the first knell of the evacuation of richmond sounded on sunday morning while we were on our knees in st pauls church invoking gods protecting care for our absent loved ones and blessings on our cause the intense excitement the tolling of the bells the hasty parting the knowledge that all communication would be cut off between us and our loved ones and the dread undefined fear in our helplessness and desertion make a nightmare memory general ewell had orders for the destruction of the public buildings which orders our secretary of war * j c breckenridge strove earnestly but without avail to have countermanded the order alas was obeyed beyond the letter of the law the terrible conflagration was kindled by the confederate authorities who applied the torch to the shockoe warehouse it too being classed among the public buildings because of the tobacco belonging to france and england stored in it a fresh breeze was blowing from the south the fire swept on in its haste and fury over a great area in an almost incredibly short time and by noon the flames had transformed into a desert waste all the city bounded by seventh and fifteenth streets and main street and the river one thousand houses were destroyed the streets were filled with furniture and every description of wares dashed down to be trampled in the mud or buried where they lay at night a * began about dark the government commissary began the destruction of its stores soldiers and citizens gathered in front catching the liquor in basins and pitchers some with their hats and some with their boots it took but a short time for this to make a manifestation as dread as the flames the crowd became a howling mob so frenzied that the officers of the law had to flee for their lives reviving memories of 1781 when the british under arnold rode down richmond hill and invading the city broke open the stores and emptied the provisions and liquors into the gutters making even the uninitiated cows and * drunk for days all through the night crowds of men women and children traversed the streets loading themselves with supplies and plunder at midnight soldiers drunk with vile liquor followed by a reckless crowd as drunk as themselves dashed in the plateglass windows of the stores and made a wreck of everything about nine oclock on monday morning terrific shell explosions rapid and continuous added to the terror of the scene and gave the impression that the city was being shelled by the retreating confederate army from the south side but the explosions were soon found to proceed from the government arsenal and laboratory then in flames later in the morning a merciful providence caused a lull in the breeze the terrific explosion of the laboratory and of the arsenal caused every window in our home to break the old plateglass mirrors built in the walls were cracked and shattered fort darling was blown up and later on the rams it was eight oclock when the federal troops entered the city it required the greatest effort to tame down the riotous * mob and induce them to take part in the struggle to save their own the firemen afraid of the soldiers who had obeyed the orders to light the torch would not listen to any appeals or entreaties and so the flames were under full headway fanned by a southern breeze when the union soldiers came to the rescue the * mills caught fire from the tobacco houses communicating it to cary and main streets every bank was destroyed the war department was a mass of ruins the enquirer and dispatch offices were in ashes and the county courthouse the american hotel and most of the finest stores of the city were ruined libby prison and the presbyterian church escaped such a reign of terror and pillage fire and flame fear and despair the yelling and howling and swearing and weeping and wailing beggar description families houseless and homeless under the open sky i shall never forget general weitzels command composed exclusively of colored troops as i saw them through the dense black columns of smoke general weitzel had for some time been stationed on the north side of the james river but a few miles from richmond and he had only to march in and take possession he despatched major a h stevens of the fourth massachusetts cavalry and major e e graves of his staff with about a hundred mounted men to reconnoitre the roads and works leading to richmond they had gone but a little distance into the confederate lines when they saw a shabby oldfashioned carriage drawn by a pair of lean lank horses the occupants waving a white flag they met this flagoftruce party at the line of fortifications just beyond the junction of the osborne turnpike and new market road the carriage contained the mayor of * * meredith of the supreme court and judge lyons the fourth worthy i cannot recall judge lyons our former minister to england and one of the representative men of virginia made the * in his own characteristic way and then colonel mayo who was in command of the flagoftruce party handed to major stevens a small slip of wall paper on which was written the following it is proper to formally surrender to the federal authorities the city of richmond hitherto capital of the confederate states of america and the defenses protecting it up to this time that was all the document was approved of and major stevens most courteously accepted the terms for his commanding general to whom it was at once transmitted and moved his column upon the evacuated city taking possession and saving it from ashes his first order was to sound the alarm bells and to take command at once of the fire department which consisted of fourteen substitute men those who were exempt from service because of disease two steam fire engines four worthless hand engines and a large amount of hose destroyed by the retreating * confederates his next order was to raise the stars and stripes over the capitol quick as thought two soldiers one from company e and one from company h of the fourth massachusetts cavalry crept to the summit and planted the flag of the nation two bright tasteful * were hoisted by the * in place of the red cross the living colors of the union were greeted while our warriors banner took its flight to meet the warriors soul that flag whose design has been accredited alike to both george washington and john adams was raised over virginia by massachusetts in place of the one whose kinship and likeness had not even after renewed effort been entirely destroyed for by the adoption of the stars and bars three horizontal bars of equal * middle one white the others * a blue union of nine stars in a circle by the confederate congress in march 1861 the confederate flag was made so akin and so similar to that of the nation as to cause confusion so in 1863 the stars and bars was supplanted by a flag with a white field having the battle flag a red field charged with a blue saltier on which were thirteen stars for a union this having been mistaken for a flag of truce was altered by covering the outer half of the field beyond the union with a vertical red bar this was the last flag of the confederacy richmond will testify that the soldiers of massachusetts were worthy of the honor of raising the first united states flag over her * capitol of the * also to the unvarying courtesy of major stevens and the fidelity with which he kept his trust
