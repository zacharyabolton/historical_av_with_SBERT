violent storm was raging flooding the level ground as i wrote you last followed the next day by one of fire and blood the battle of seven pines i pray my prettice that you accepted the invitation of your mountain chum and that your beautiful eyes and tender heart have been spared the horrors of war which this battle must have poured into sad richmond three hundred and fifty of your soldiers brigade # strong were killed or wounded and all fought as virginians should fighting as they did for the right for love honor home and state principles which they had been taught from the mothers knees the schoolroom and the pulpit under orders from old peter we marched at daylight and reported to d h hill near seven pines hill directed me to ride over and communicate with hood i started at once with charlie and archer of my staff to obey this order but had gone only a short distance when we met a part of the louisiana zouaves in panic i managed to seize and detain one fellow mounted on a mule that seemed to have imbibed his riders fear and haste the man dropped his plunder and seizing his carbine threatened to kill me unless i released him at once saying that the yankees were upon his heels we galloped back to hills headquarters archer bringing up the rear with the zouave who explained that the enemy were advancing in force and were within a few hundred yards of us hill ordered me to attack at once which i did driving them through an abatis over a crossroad leading to the railroad as we were nearing the second abatis i on foot at the time noticed that armisteads brigade had broken and sent a courier back posthaste to hill for troops a second and third message were sent and then a fourth telling him that if he would send me more troops and ammunition we could drive the enemy across the chickahominy but alas hill as brave as great as heroic a soldier as he is has since the fall of johnston been so bothered and annoyed with countermanding orders that he was if i may say so * confused after this delay nothing was left for us but to withdraw hill sent two regiments of colstons brigade and ordered mahones brigade on my right and at one oclock at night under his orders we withdrew in perfect form while the enemy retreated to their * cover thus my darling was ended the battle of seven pines no shot was fired afterward oh how i wish i could say it ended all battles and that the last shot that will ever be heard was fired on june first 1862 what a change love does make how tender all things become to a heart touched by * beautiful the beautiful is and how abhorrent is evil see my darling see what power you have guard it well i have heard that my dear old friend mcclellan is lying ill about ten miles from here may some loving soothing hand minister to him he was he is and he will always be even were his pistol pointed at my heart my dear loved friend may god bless him and spare his life you my darling may not be in sympathy with this feeling for i know you see no good in * forgive me for feeling differently from you my sallie and please dont love me any the less you cannot understand the entente * between us old fellows faithfully your soldier all last night my darling sallie the spirit of my dear mother seemed to hover over me when she was living and i used to feel in that way i always as sure as fate received from her a letter written at the very time that i had the sensation of her presence i wonder if up there she is watching over me trying to send me some message some warning i wish i knew this morning my brigade moved from its cantonments on the williamsburg road and by daybreak was marching along the mechanicsville turnpike leading north of richmond the destination and character of the expedition is unknown but the position of other troops indicates a general movement this evening we crossed the chickahominy and are bivouacked on our guns in the road in front of mechanicsville from which point i am blessing my spirit and refreshing my soul by sending a message to my promised wife i am tired and sleepy several times today going to sleep on my horse this war was really never contemplated in earnest i believe if either the north or the south had expected that their differences would result in this obstinate struggle the cold blooded puritan and the cock * * and cavalier would have made a compromise poor old virginia came oftener than noahs dove with her olive branch and though she desired to be loyal to the union of states she did not believe in the right of coercion and when called upon to furnish troops to restrain her sister states she refused and would not even permit the passage armed force through her domain for that purpose with no thought of cost no consideration of disparity of relative strength or conditions she rolled up her sleeves ready to risk all in defense of a principle consecrated by the blood of her fathers and now alas it is too late we must carry through this bitter task unto the end may the end be soon your soldier t is only when you are here with me my darling that i am not chafing fretting under my enforced absence from my command as poor a * as the yankee was who shot me i wish he had been poorer still aiming as he must have been either at my head or my heart and breaking my wing he was frightened too i suspect and had besides too much powder in his load what did you want with that shot smoked burnt coat sleeve the arm it held is yours to work for you my love for always impatient and restive as i am to get back to the field letters and reports just received show me that i am not missed and that my gallant old brigade is proving its valor as loyally under its new leader as when it so fearlessly followed your soldier it held waterloo bridge against pope while jackson crossed the rappahannock and on the afternoon of the 30th received and repelled the onset of fitz john porter magnificently clearing the field and winning a victory for our arms the news came too this morning of the death of you and shield kearny one of the most brilliant generals of the federal army a man whose fame as a soldier is worldwide i knew him first in mexico where as you know he lost an arm at the siege of mexico city in algeria he won the cross of the legion of honor he fought with the french in the battles of magenta and solferino and received also from napoleon third the decoration of the legion of honor i wish we had taken him prisoner instead of shooting him i hate to have such a man as kearny killed marse robert who was his old friend sent his body to pope under a flag of truce i am glad he did that poor old kearny the same courier brought the sad news that our ewell had lost a leg and our * had been wounded and these are the horrors to which when away from you my beautiful darling your soldier is impatient to return never never did men since the world began fight like ours the duke of somerset who sneeringly laughed when he saw our ragged dirty barefooted soldiers mostly beardless boys as he said took off his hat in reverence when he saw them fight lovingly your soldier had not you had stay doctor * i shall miss your visit today my darling i wish gone dont minnegerode asked me this morning when he called who sent the beautiful flowers bob to save me from answering said de same young lady sont * marse doctor dat broidered dat cape fer marse george en broidered dem dar slippers hes got on en sont him de broidered stars dat he wars on his coat when he wars it but dat young lady aint de * young lady dat sends marse george flowers en things nor suh the dear old doctor understood he * at me and changed the subject he is as loyal to the south dear old fellow as if his ancestors had landed at jamestown when he asked after my wound he said he would like to pray with me though the dear old man pronounced it with his german accent bray and that reminded me of a story and instead of having my thoughts and my heart set upon his beautiful prayer as i should have miserable sinner that i was i began thinking of tom august who said that one sunday someone meeting him coming out of old st pauls asked him what was the matter he replied oh nothing im not a * and im not going to bray and old doctor minnegerode not only insists that i but that his whole congregation shall bray i for one will not do it and i dont want to make a row about it so i came out i wonder what the effect would be if we took him literally and did all bray now my darling forgive this foolish story i learned to like story telling listening as a boy to the best storyteller in the world mr lincoln even the bird knows you are not coming to day for he doesnt sing i shall hold you to the last line of your sweet note which says ill come to you my soldier before the flowers die when bob asked me is miss sallie comin dis * er in de * i answered she does not mention any set time bob she only says shell come before the flowers die de flowers aint

brighteyed sunny * princess your face is the sweetest face in all the world * as it does all that is pure and unselfish and i must not cast a shadow over it by the fears that come to me in spite of myself no a soldier should not know fear of any kind i must fight and plan and hope and you must pray pray for a realization of all our beautiful dreams sitting beside our own hearthstone in our own home you my goddess of devotion and i your devoted slave words cannot express my devotion though my darling nor any known language my admiration and worship at your feet your unworthy soldier bows in homage all his soul all his heart yours now and forever may god in his mercy spare his life and make it worthy of you and i you my shoulder and arm are still quite stiff and i cannot yet put my sleeve on the wounded arm i have on one sleeve and my coat is thrown over my other shoulder and arm i can reach my mouth with my hand by bending my neck way over so i am not helpless bob still buttons my collar and does some other little services until i have more control of my arm however i shall confine myself to riding old black and not venture on lucy enough of so small a matter my boys are delighted to welcome me back showing their affection for me in many many ways garnett is still in command of my dear old brigade which was temporarily turned over to him when i was wounded and which under his gallant leadership has sustained its old reputation for fearlessness and endurance i miss dear familiar faces for many of the brave fellows have been killed and wounded you have heard me speak of colonel * gallant soldier he was wounded and left behind after he was shot the plucky old chap called out in a loud clear voice stand firm boys stand firm well the yankees won the battle but mcclellans delay in winning enabled old jack to seize harpers ferry so it was not so great a victory for them after all old jacks note to marse robert telling him of his success was characteristic in both brevity and diction he said through gods mercy harpers ferry and its garrison are to be surrendered the seventeenth following is recorded in letters of blood for both armies and in its wake came lincolns great political victory proving the might of the pen in his emancipation proclamation winning with it the greatest victory yet for the north it will * us now to heed well the old story of the lark and the * for it will be farewell to all foreign intervention unless greek meets greek and we fight fire with fire and we too issue an emancipation proclamation i pray god that the powers that reign will have the wisdom and foresight to see this in its true and allpervading light it would end the war and i should assume as soon as practicable the role of * and husband to the brightest little pupil and the sweetest little wife in all the world ill write more later on ive had many interruptions and now i must stop i dont want to though oh why do i love you so was ever sweetheart so loved before as my sallie is loved by her own devoted soldier * have been placed temporarily in command of a division may i hope my precious that when another year rolls by we can celebrate the anniversary of this day by announcing our marriage today i was officially promoted to the rank of major general and permanently placed in command of a division my dear old brigade which i love and which was with me in the battles of williamsburg seven pines and gainess mill was assigned to dick garnett and there comes somehow in spite of everything a little kind of curious feeling within when i hear it called garnetts brigade even though he has been in command of it almost ever since i was wounded and has won for it distinction and from it love and respect old dick is a fine fellow a brave splendid soldier he was in the mexican war and was wounded in the battle of mexico he commanded a brigade under old jack and was for a time in command of the famous * brigade you have not met him my sweetheart but i want you to know him his family are from norfolk he knows all your people and remembers you as a child and sends you his love he is an old bachelor though and i dont know about sending this message it is rather dangerous no no my sweetheart i am not afraid i only wish as i told old dick that he had a sweetheart just like you he is as sensitive and proud as he is fearless and sweet spirited and has felt more keenly than most men would old jacks censure of him at the battle of kernstown when all his ammunition gave out and he withdrew his brigade from the field for which he was arrested and relieved from duty old jack told lawton that in arresting garnett he had no reference to his want of daring which was surprising for old jack to say who never explains anything lawton who is one of his generals says old jack holds himself as the god of war giving short sharp commands distinctly rapidly and decisively without consultation or explanation and disregarding suggestions and remonstrances being himself absolutely fearless and having unusual mental and moral as well as physical courage he goes ahead on his own hook asking no advice and resenting interference he places no value on human life caring for nothing so much as fighting unless it be praying illness wounds and all disabilities he defines as inefficiency and indications of a lack of patriotism suffering from * he often uses his men as a * and when he cant sleep calls them up marches them out a few miles then marches them back he never praises his men for gallantry because it is their duty to be gallant and they do not deserve credit for doing their duty well my own darling i only pray that god may spare him to us to see us through if general lee had grants resources he would soon end the war but old jack can do it without resources bless your heart here i am talking of these old * to my prettice well she knows how entirely i love her and how i have left in her keeping my souls all lovingly and faithfully my sallie your own soldier here we are my darling at fredericksburg on the south side of the rappahannock half way between richmond and washington fortified for us by the hand of the great father i penciled you a note by old jackerie on the 12th from the foot of the hills between hazel run and the telegraph road in it i sent a hyacinth given me by a pretty lady who came out with beaten biscuit and some * and written messages from old peter and old jack hood ewell stuart and your brothers to the someone * i was writing it seems an eternity my * since the first of november when we moved on from orange court house i sent you a short note last night after the days great battle telling you that even in the midst of it all my heart and thoughts my division nine thousand strong is in fine shape it was on the field of battle as a division for the first time yesterday though only one brigade kempers was actively engaged what a day it was my darling you were in this ever to be remembered by many of us thirteenth of december dawning auspiciously upon us clad in deepest darkest mourning a fog such as would shame london lay over the valley and through the dense mist distinctly came the uncanny commands of the unseen opposing officers my men were eager to be in the midst of the fight and if hood had not been so cautious they would probably have immortalized themselves old peters orders were that hood and myself were to hold our ground of defense unless we should see an opportunity to attack the enemy while engaged with a p hill on the right a little after ten when the fog had lifted and stuarts cannon from the plain of massaponax were turned upon meade and when franklins advance left the enemys flank open i went up to hood and urged him to seize the opportunity but he was afraid to assume so great a responsibility and sent for permission to old peter who was with marse robert in a different part of the field before his assent and approval were received the opportunity alas was lost if war my own is a necessity and i suppose it is it is a very cruel one your soldiers heart almost stood still as he watched those sons of erin fearlessly rush to their death the brilliant assault on maryes we crossed the potomac on the 24th at williamsport and went into bivouac on the maryland side from which place i sent my lady love along letter and some flowers gathered on the way we then went on to hagerstown where we met a p hills corps which had crossed the river farther down from hagerstown i sent to the same and only lady love another letter which was not only freighted with all the adoration and devotion of her soldiers heart but contained messages from the staff and promises to take care of him and bring him safely back to her we made no delay at hagerstown but passing through in the rear of hills corps moved on up the cumberland valley and bivouacked at greencastle where the most homesick letter of all yet written was sent to well guess whom this time why to the same lady love the sweetest loveliest flower that ever blossomed to bless and make fairer a beautiful world for it is beautiful betokening in its loveliness nothing of wickedness or woe nothing of this deadly strife between men who should be brethren of a great and common cause as they are the * of a great and common country the officers and men are all in excellent condition bright and cheerful singing songs and telling stories full of hope and courage inspired with absolute faith and confidence in our success there is no straggling no disorder no dissatisfaction no plundering and there are no desertions think of it an army of sixty thousand men marching through the enemys country without the least opposition the object of this great movement is of course unknown to us its purpose and our destination are known at present only to the commanding general and his chief lieutenants the officers and men generally believe that the intention is entirely to surround the army of the potomac and to place washington and baltimore within our grasp they think that marse robert is merely threatening the northern cities with the view of suddenly turning down the susquehanna cutting off all railroad connections destroying all bridges throwing his army north of baltimore and cutting off washington and that beauregard is to follow on directly from richmond via manassas to washington in rear of hooker who of course will be in pursuit of marse robert nous verrons we reached here this morning june 27th the anniversary of the battle of gainess mill where your soldier was wounded we marched straight through the town of chambersburg which was more deserted than goldsmiths village the stores and houses were all closed with here and there groups of * * of * descent earnestly talking more sylvan shadows than smiles wreathing their faces i had given orders that the bands were not to play but as we were marching through the northeastern part of the city some young ladies came out onto the veranda of one of the prettiest homes in the town and asked would you mind shooting off the bands a bit so the command was given and the band played home sweet home annie laurie her bright smile haunts me still nellie gray and hazel dell the young ladies asked the next band that passed if they wouldnt play dixie but the band instead struck up the old oaken bucket the * river the old arm chair the lone rock by the sea and auld lang syne thought you was rebels * you come from anyhow cant play dixie none of you they called out we marched straight on through the city and are camped four miles beyond the town on the york river road tomorrow if youll promise not to divulge it to a human soul ill tell you a great secret no my sallie i cant wait till tomorrow ill tell you right now so listen and cross your heart that you wont tell i love you love you love you and oh little one i want to see you so that is the secret a dios with my heart at your feet and my happiness in your hands i am lovingly and forever your soldier i wish my sallie you could see this wonderfully rich and prosperous country abounding in plenty with its great strong vigorous horses and oxen its cows and crops and * * vegetation none of the ravages of war no signs of devastation all in woeful contrast to the land where we lay dreaming all the time i break the law thou shalt not covet for every fine horse or cow i see i want for my darling and all the pretty things i see besides never mind she shall have everything some day and i shall have the universe and heavens choicest gift when she is my wife all my very own at chambersburg marse robert preached us a sermon first * us in the meaning of * and * and then taking as his text vengeance is mine saith the lord i observed that the mourners bench was not overcrowded with * for conversion the poor fellows were thinking of their own despoiled homes * of everything and were not wildly enthusiastic as they obediently acquiesced to our beloved commanders order the yanks have taken into the mountains and across the susquehanna all the supplies they could and we pay liberally for those which we are compelled to take giving them money which is paid to us our own confederate * some of us have a few pieces of gold with which to purchase some keepsake or token for the dear ones at home alas my little one how many of us will be blessed with the giving of them god in his mercy be our commanderinchief we have not a wide field for selection here as we once had at prices dry goods store or john tylers jewelry establishment in richmond but it seems quite magnificent to us now since the richmond counters are so bare as to offer not even a wedding ring or a yard of calico we are * general c who after long and grave deliberation bought three hoop skirts as a present for his betrothed all that makes life dear is the thought of seeing you and being with and oh what an eternity it seems since i said good night oh my darling love me pray for you hold me in your thoughts keep me in your heart our whole army is now in pennsylvania north of the river there were rumors that richmond was threatened from all sides dix from old point me make me getty from hanover keyes from bottoms bridge and so * that we might be recalled it turned out to be * and we are still to march forward every tramp tramp tramp tramp is a thought thought thought of my darling every halt a blessing invoked every command a loving caress and the thought of you and prayer for you strong make me better give me courage give me faith now my dearest let my soul speak to yours listen listen listen you hear i am answered forever and ever your soldier for us while general pickett awaited the order to charge at gettysburg an my prettice do patchwork if she can she must piece together these penciled scraps of soiled paper and make out of them not a log cabin quilt but a wrens nest * it with love and fill it with blue and golden and speckled eggs of faith and hope to hatch out greater love yet well sallie mine the long wearying march from chambersburg through dust and heat beyond compare brought us here yesterday a few miles from gettysburg though my poor men were almost exhausted by the march in the intense heat i felt that the exigencies demanded my assuring marse robert that we had arrived and that with a few hours rest my men would be equal to anything he might require of them i sent walter with my message and rode on myself to little round top to see old peter who i tell you was mighty glad to see me and now just think of it though the old war horse was watching a p hills attack upon the center and hood and mclaws of his own corps who had struck sickles he turned and before referring to the fighting or asking about the march inquired after you my darling while we were watching the fight walter came back with marse roberts reply to my message which was in part tell pickett im glad that he has come that i can always depend upon him and his men but that i shall not want him this evening my very soul that we have been on the qui vive my sallie since midnight and as early as three oclock were on the march about half past three garys pistol signaled the yankees attack upon culps hill and with its echo a wail of regret went up from the other two brigades of my old division had been left behind oh god if only i had them a * for the honor of virginia for i can depend upon them little one they know your soldier and would follow him into the very jaws of death and he will need them right there too before hes through at early dawn darkened by the threatening rain armistead garnett kemper and your soldier held a heart to heart powwow all three sent regards to you and old lewis pulled a ring from his little finger and making me take it said give this little token george please to her of the sunset eyes with my love and tell her the old since he could not be the lucky dog hes mighty glad that you are man says dear old lewis dear old lo as magruder always called him being short for * well my sallie ill keep the ring for you and some day ill take it to john tyler and have it made into a breast pin and set around with * and diamonds and emeralds you will be the pearl the other jewel dear old lewis just as we three separated to go our different ways after silently clasping hands our fears and prayers voiced in the good luck old man a summons came from old peter and i immediately rode to the top of the ridge where he and marse robert were making a reconnaissance of meades position great god said old peter as i came up look general lee at the insurmountable difficulties between our line and that of the yankees the hills the tiers of artillery the fences the heavy skirmish line and then well have to fight our infantry against their batteries look at the ground well steep have to charge over nearly a mile of that open ground there under the rain of their canister and shrapnel the enemy is there general longstreet and i am going to strike him said marse robert in his firm quiet determined voice about 8 oclock i rode with them along our line of prostrate infantry they had been told to lie down to prevent attracting attention and though they had been forbidden to cheer they voluntarily arose and lifted in reverential adoration their caps to our beloved commander as we rode slowly along oh the responsibility for the lives of such men as these well my darling their fate and that of our beloved southland will be settled ere your glorious brown eyes rest on these scraps of penciled paper your your soldiers last letter perhaps our line of battle faces cemetery ridge our detachments have been thrown forward to support our artillery which stretches over a mile along the crests of oak ridge and seminary ridge the men are lying in the rear my darling and the hot july sun pours its scorching rays almost vertically down upon them the suffering and waiting are almost unbearable well my sweetheart at one oclock the awful silence was broken by a cannonshot and then another and then more than a hundred guns shook the hills from crest to base answered by more than another hundred the whole world a blazing volcano the whole of heaven a thunderbolt then darkness and absolute * the grim and gruesome low spoken commands then the forming of the attacking columns my brave virginians are to attack in front oh god in mercy help me as he never helped before i have ridden up to report to old peter i shall give him this letter to mail to you and a package to give you if oh my darling do you feel the love of my heart the prayer as i write that fatal word if old peter laid his hand over mine and said i know george i know but i cant do it boy alexander has my instructions he will give you the order there was silence and his hand still rested on mine when a courier rode up and handed me a note from alexander now i go but remember always that i love you with all my heart and soul with every * of my being that now and forever i am * my beloved it is almost three oclock my soul reaches out to * prayers ill keep up a brave heart for virginia and for you my darling your soldier my letter of yesterday my darling written before the battle was full of hope and cheer even though it told you of the long hours of waiting from four in the morning when garys pistol rang out from the federal lines * the attack upon culps hill to the solemn eight oclock review of my men who rose and stood silently lifting their hats in loving reverence as marse robert old peter and your own soldier reviewed them on then to the deadly stillness of the five hours following when the men lay in the tall grass in the rear of the artillery line the july sun pouring its scorching rays almost vertically down upon them till one oclock when the awful silence of the vast battlefield was broken by a cannon shot which opened the greatest artillery duel of the world the firing lasted two hours when it ceased we took advantage of the blackened field and in the * darkness formed our attacking column just before the brow of seminary ridge i closed my letter to you a little before three oclock and rode up to old peter for orders i found fire upon him like a great lion at bay i have never seen him so grave and troubled for several minutes after i had saluted him he looked at me without speaking then in an agonized voice the reserve all gone he said pickett i am being crucified at the thought of the sacrifice of life which this attack will make i have instructed alexander to watch the effect of our the enemy and when it begins to tell he must take the responsibility and give you your orders for i cant while he was yet speaking a note was brought tome from alexander after reading it i handed it to him asking if i should obey and go forward he looked at me for a moment then held out his hand presently clasping his other hand over mine without speaking he bowed his head upon his breast i shall never forget the look in his face nor the clasp of his hand when i said then general i shall lead my division on i had ridden only a few paces when i remembered letter and forgive me * scribbled in a corner of the envelope if old peters nod means death then goodby and god bless you little one turned back and asked the dear old chief if he would be good enough to mail it for me as he took your letter from me my darling i saw your tears glistening on his cheeks and beard the stern old warhorse god bless him was weeping for his men and i know praying too that this cup might pass from them i obeyed the silent assent of his bowed head an assent given against his own convictions given in anguish and with reluctance my brave boys were full of hope and confident of victory as i led them forth forming them in column of attack and though officers and men alike knew what was before them knew the odds against them they eagerly offered up their lives on the altar of duty having absolute faith in their ultimate success over on cemetery ridge the federals beheld a scene never before witnessed on this continent a scene which has never previously been enacted and can never take place again an army forming in line of battle in full view under their very eyes charging across a space nearly a mile in length over fields of waving grain and anon of * and then a smooth expanse moving with the steadiness of a dress parade the pride and glory soon to be crushed by an overwhelming heartbreak well it is all over now the battle is lost and many of us are prisoners many are dead many wounded bleeding and dying your soldier lives and mourns and but for you my darling he would rather a million times rather be back there with his dead to sleep for all time in an unknown grave your sorrowing soldier on the fourth far from a glorious fourth to us or to any with love for his * wrote you just a line of heartbreak the sacrifice of life on that * field on the fatal third was too awful for the heralding of victory even for our victorious foe who i think believe as we do that it decided the fate of our cause no words can picture the anguish of that rollcall the breathless waits between the * the here of those who by gods mercy had * escaped the awful rain of shot and shell was a * * knell for the * name of his comrade called before his there was no tone of thankfulness for having been spared to answer to their names but rather a toll and an unvoiced wish that they too had been among the missing but for the blight to your sweet young life but for you only you my darling your soldier would rather by far be out there too with his brave virginians dead even now i can hear them cheering as i gave the manassas and chester where we had a brilliant skirmish with the enemy for three days and nights i have been almost constantly in the saddle last night the 22d i had a tent pitched and sat down to a meal at a camp table the first time since leaving bunker hill we had been going al * when we did sleep it was with the heavens for a canopy and a fence rail for a pillow we shall be here three or four days perhaps longer i thank the great and good god that he has spared me to come back and claim your promise and i pray your womanly assistance in helping me to its immediate fulfilment this is no time for ceremonies the future is all uncertain and it is impossible for me to call a moment my own again with all the graves i have left behind me and with all the wretchedness and misery this * campaign has made we would not wish anything but a very silent very quiet wedding planning only the sacrament and blessing of the church and after that back to my division and to the blessing of those few of them who by gods miracle were left i gave colonel harrison a gold luck piece which i was a parting gift to me from the officers of the pacific and told him to have it made into a wedding ring at tylers i asked him to have engraved within g e p and s c married and to leave sufficient space for date and motto which you would direct your soldier * peter is to go to tennessee to renforce bragg he has placed his plans before the secretary of war now my darling i have just had a long powwow with him old peter who old war horse as he is has been in love himself is still in love will always be in love and knows of our love of our plighted troth and knowing it tells me it is his purpose to take me with him on this proposed expedition now my sallie your soldier is a soldier and never even to himself questions an

as the great apostle for whom he is named certainly in appearance he is as insignificant wife of general ransom underground railway headquarters sutler looking as a horse as st paul has been described as a man and while he has not had one much less five * he has had all manner of * escapes hardships indignities and a million times more stripes all of which he has borne with christian resignation and endurance well dearest my name is george and my patience and temper accord with the name our wellformed plans for the capture of newbern miscarried hokes clingmans and corses brigades and reids artillery under my command were to make a feint to threaten on the south side of the neuse river dearings cavalry and three regiments of infantry under dearing were to make a demonstration on the north side of the neuse ransom barton and terry under barton were to make the real attack while we created a diversion and drew off the enemy simultaneously with our movements colonel r taylor wood was to take a naval force in small boats make a night excursion down the neuse and attack the gunboats the soldiers were all jubilant buoyant and hopeful everything was propitious victory seemed sure general dearings feint was successful hoke and corse and clingman crossed over taking all the defenses and outworks in front woods attack was a complete surprise capturing a gunboat right under the guns of the fort but alas the real attack by barton was not made we waited in deathlike suspense hour after hour of restless anxiety and impatience went by and yet no sound of a gun and no message came to tell me why the torture and suspense were unbearable newbern was ours ours if well hope died out and the dejection and despair of the men with their expectations dashed cannot be told bartons report to me today through bright was that the defenses of the enemy were too formidable my orders to him were that if he found it impracticable to perform his part he was to come at once to me and let me try a * de main as ever your soldier your soldier breathes easier this morning my darling a great load is lifted haygoods brave south carolina brigade came in yesterday thank god and i stationed them at port walthall junction this will keep the connection between petersburg and richmond open wises brigade got in today and was sent out toward city point for nights i have not closed my eyes how could i with a whole city full of helpless defenseless women and children at the mercy of an oncoming army butlers whole force in transports protected by his gunboats landed at city point and bermuda hundred and no army here to meet them not enough soldiers boys and old men all put together even for picket duty come to think of it my prettice you must have been up all night to have gotten up and sent out such a basket of goodies and baked and buttered such a lot of biscuit and made so many jugs of coffee as came this morning my i tell you it all tasted good and the coffee well no * or java ever tasted half so good as this * potato blend and think of your thoughtfulness in wrapping blankets around the jugs to keep the coffee hot bless your thoughtful heart you are without doubt the dearest most indefatigable little piece of perfection that ever rode a horse or buttered a biscuit or plucked a flower or ever did anything else as to that then those hyacinths and geranium leaves who else in all this * starving perilous time would have thought of gathering flowers my boy bob the loyal but * * apologetically took out the baskets which were apparently filled with the yet * fragrant flowers and said mrs * and mrs johnson sent out large hampers too to us they came just after we had gotten through with your baskets so we passed them on to the others mean soldier told you and now my darling what on earth did you by saying never mind as you said goodby and rode away yesterday it troubled me all night i wanted to follow after you and ask you what you meant but couldnt i would have jumped on lucy and ridden into petersburg and found out if it had been possible for me to leave i was so troubled about it that i was almost tempted to come in anyhow but for the life of me little one i couldnt think of any reason why you should say never mind to me were you aggrieved my darling because your blundering old there was no necessity for your coming out to bring the dispatches any longer that thank heaven the recruits and renforcements were coming in now and that we could manage all right i did not mean to hurt you dear i hoped youd send a line by bob telling me what you meant and why you had said it but when i asked him if you had written he said now please my darling send bob back right away with a nice letter and tell your soldier that you did not mean anything by saying never mind to him for he loves you with all his heart and would not wound or disappoint or offend you for anything in the world your soldier * has just come in from the lines my darling wife and reports that all is well i came in about eleven and was lying in my tent all alone thinking of you and while i builded wonderful castles i was * you with the songs i love i think i had finished all the songs i had ever sung to you and when baird came in my thoughts had wandered to the salmon illahie and i was singing anne * song oh death rock me asleep which was taught me by my friend captain g p hornby of her majestys ship tribune away out in san juan island on the pacific coast in 1859 i do not know why i was singing this song except that it is beautiful and one of the finest and sweetest of melodies both the air and words were written by poor unfortunate anne boleyn i know but one * hornby ever knew other verses he had forgotten them but the one i know is appealing i will write it for you if i may oh death rock me asleep bring me to quiet and rest let pass my weary guiltless life out of my careful breast toll on the passing bell ring out my doleful knell let thy sound my death tell death doth draw me death doth draw me there is no remedy baird stopped outside and listened and then came in asking permission to order bob to light the dips and saying please sir marse george when you sing that song i havent got a friend in the world im lonesome and feel creeps and see * and whats worse i dont know whether i am anne boleyn herself or am myself responsible for all poor annes sorrows and death so i stopped singing and am writing to tell you a great secret which is i love you some day when we are * happy that nothing could make us any happier ill sing this you last night there was a night attack several of the men were wounded slightly but the face of one perhaps seriously wounded haunts me he is a boy with golden brown * darling tonight we made a capture of the federal pickets sweeping their rifle pits for more than a hundred yards and taking a hundred and thirtysix prisoners you know our lines are so close together in many places that we the yankees and my men can with voices raised carry on a conversation war and its horrors and yet i sing and whistle song to oh my sweetheart if only this wicked war were over so that we could in peace and quiet tranquilly finish the book of love which we have but just begun * now i see old jackerie in the flap with his pack and bag his wonted grace and patience his * eyes and soft southern italian voice saying no * but i must hurry for he starts at daybreak and it is now past midnight lovingly now and forever your soldier have just this moment returned from a visit to the lines where i have been since early this morning today my precious has only been a duplicate of yesterday thank god i have at last if not too late gotten a line laid out on my right flank the * of march are upon us grant says he intends taking his 4th of july dinner in richmond i have been hard at work my pet trying in every way with my limited force to strengthen my front this has been done by my division but on the right of my line towards the appomattox it has been impossible for me to accomplish anything troops have been put in and removed so often however now i know what i have to overcome and will try and do it i hate uncertainties your sweet letter of this morning came as a true messenger of love i was so very very anxious about you my own wife keep up your heart bravely and think of your husband who lives but for i would my prettice give any thing in the world any thing to see you to see you this evening god knows i do want to kiss you and call you my own remember how much i am longing for you a dios my sallie i send you by this mail a little butter it is all i can find i had a pretty little flower but it withered in the intensely hot sun your devoted soldier here we are still my sallie my division is stationed with the rest of the first corps between new and old cold harbor old peter having been wounded in the wilderness anderson has been put in command of the first corps grant has been appointed lieutenant general and has arrived at nearly the same point in his march down the river that mcclellan reached in his upward progress in 62 over a crimson road both armies have returned to cold harbor the wilderness alas is one vast graveyard where sleep thousands of grants soldiers but grant like our stonewall is fighting not to save lives but country for the second time now cold harbor has become a battle ground two years ago it furnished the field for the battle of gainess mill which the yankees called cold harbor where your soldier was wounded does it seem to you as long ago as two years my darling to me it seems but yesterday that i lay in richmond at my little sisters and you came to see me blessing and cheering me i can feel now the soft getting a wagon load of things up from chuckatuck but i am almost afraid to trust one through oh my sallie i do want to see you so much i have been right sick for a day or two past but am better today i had no business to be sick and low spirited when god has been so good to us i fancy could i only have seen my own faithful loving wife and told her what was * in my mind that i would have gotten well dearest i will try and get in some time this week a dios my sweet kiss the little george for me ever darling of my heart your own soldier have but a few moments since my pretty one i on down the other the enemy occupied dutch gap last evening this is higher up the river than i am and i had expected the navy to take care of our rear but they have allowed them to come in and now i have to stretch out my india rubber division well i have to do it the general did not seem in a remarkably good humor with the news from mobile and * johnson in the valley and this impudence of the yankees in crawling up behind us i am so glad my own that you are better thank the good god for it i send you a chicken a cup of salt likewise an apple one single one your friend miss gamble radiant with a white frock and smiles sent it to me didnt give it with her compliments last night goodbye sweet one ever your own soldier left my garden of eden my darling with many a pause and longing glance behind but out in the midst of this terrible conflict to which i have come your love is with me shielding and blessing me i reached camp just before daybreak george hustled around and made me a pot of * coffee a wid no * in it and while i drank my coffee he kept off the flies which early as it was had begun to be very sociable entertaining me the while with news of the camp and his own views on current events having finished my breakfast george went out to get breakfast for the mess and before they had assembled i had cleared off my desk and written several letters all made affectionate inquiries for you and our little son though some of them did not know that i had ridden in last night until i told them i must go now my sallie and ride around the lines and make my report but will add a few more words later on so a dios till then well my darling we have had a most exciting day marse robert came out he was restive and very very silent we had just paid our respects to butlers * when he arrived the device we used in so doing was a new one or rather a very old one newly revived it was a mortar battery hidden in the bushes invisible to the enemy and easily shifted from one hiding place to the other it used to be the only way in which shells could be thrown it throws these shells high in the air and they fall by their own weight without the least warning of their coming there is no screaming or * sound like that made by our modern shells they fall almost as silently as a * falls and it seems to me almost barbarous to drop these silent ghostly missiles down upon those lighthearted * negroes for i learn that it is they that are doing the digging butler with promise of extra pay for extra work and extra danger has induced four hundred of his colored soldiers to volunteer to sheathe their swords and take up the shovel and go to digging the bank to be cut through is only about five feet at the highest point the canal is to be where the james makes a great bend just above dutch gap in closing a point is land perhaps half a mile wide and about three miles in length and which at the neck is only five hundred yards across from river to river their canal would thus save them six miles and would allow their gunboats to go up the james without running the gauntlet of our howlett guns our sunken torpedoes et * and as our left is all at the turn of the bend they would not have to traverse the open river in search of an exposed water channel it is strange that some of our brilliant engineers havent made this near cut years ago as for me i should encourage butler and his river improvement company and cease throwing these stealthy shells whose silent fall * a sudden roar of explosion that strikes terror to my soul the canal will be an advantage to us and butler in digging it for us may in part atone for the many homes he has destroyed mine among them well my own if you were not the best of all good women as well as the most beautiful of all beautiful women and the most patient of all patient women you would weary of so tiresome a soldier who takes away the fragrance of flowers and the glory of love and sends back the echo of war and its sorrows and the babble of a loyal old cook who wouldnt be sold and wouldnt run away and whom i was obliged to permit to be credited to me in order to save him the only negro i * come to think of it he owns me forever and ever your soldier after an evening spent at the white house of the confederacy you will be glad my darling wife that the * the powers that be was most satisfactory after the evening consultation i called on the ladies at the white house and at the most earnest entreaty and solicitation of mrs davis and her sister miss howell dined with them poor mr davis looks tired and anxious but he spoke so hopefully of our success that knowing as he must know our status the condition of our army etc i should have thought that he was aware of something hopeful of which we are ignorant if he had not said later when foreign intervention was being discussed that he believed that england and in fact all the foreign powers were like the woman who saw her husband fighting a bear she didnt care a continental which was whipped but shed be the best pleased if both were the dinner my sallie was beautiful and so abundant were its luxuries that i marveled greatly knowing as i do how difficult it is with most of us to get even a little tea or coffee or salt as usual mrs davis was * and entertaining she * described her rescue of a little orphan negro from a great black brute who had constituted himself the boys guardian she told how she had him washed and combed and dressed in a suit of little joes clothes and how while he was proud of the clothes he was a thousand times prouder of and more grateful for the cuts and bruises which his selfappointed guardian had given him and which upon all occasions he triumphantly exhibited as medals of honor she said that the little rascal was greatly troubled when the cuts were finally healed and tried to reopen them with a dog knife which was taken away he was * and forbidden to make over his wounds with her keen sense of humor mrs davis told us how when learning that one after another of her maids was being bribed by the yankees with money and promises to betray the family and come over to part of the the other side she would pretending ignorance of the intention give them food for imagination reciting for their repetition the most impossible outlandish stories some of which she told us she said that betty the last one of her maids to go was such an excellent maid and so hard to replace that as soon as she began to show her prosperity appearing with silks and jewels and then with gold and notes she had tried without letting betty suspect her intention to offer her inducements to remain but had failed mrs davis said she was so depressed after * departure and in such dire need of mental soothing syrup that she went into retirement with adam bede a country gentleman in * elective affinities did you ever my darling mr judah p benjamin and dr minnegerode were the only other guests mr benjamins usually wonderful judicial mind and depressing dignity were not in evidence he did rather reproachfully express his astonishment that mr davis should be bowed down with grief by the adverse criticisms of those he was trying to serve and that he should care a bauble for their accusations of * and the more absurd charge of leaving his cotton to be bought by the yankees he ended by saying that he continually had to remind mr davis of that exceedingly good man christ you know my own benjamin was born at st * in the west indies of jewish parents what a gossip your husband is my sallie but i promised to write my beautiful tyrant every day everything i said or did or that anyone else said or did and i have forever and ever your soldier in the dark days before the end his morning at breakfast my darling sallie when you suggested having an oyster roast for my officers after our conference to night i said that i feared we should not have enough oysters our old hunter gossett has just brought in a fine large wild turkey and with that and the three bushels of oysters which your uncle colonel phillips sent i think we can get up a fine supper dont you my marvel of a housekeeper i hope you can and hope too that the good cheer it will provide will help us to new and encouraging suggestions for as hopeful as i always am even my heart is in my boots on every side gloom dissatisfaction and disappointment seem to have settled over all men and officers alike because of the unsuccessful termination of the peace conference on board the river queen on the fatal third the anxious despairing faces i see everywhere * heavy hearts our commissioners knew that we were gasping our last the peace conference was a forlorn hope because of the informality of the conference and my know gasp and that ledge of mr lincoln his humanity his broad nature his warm heart i did believe he would take advantage of this very informality and spring some wise superhuman surprise which would somehow restore peace and in time insure unity now heaven help us it will be war to the knife with the knife no longer keen the thrust of the arm no longer strong the certainty that when peace comes comes it will follow the tread of the conqueror your soldier by your by any written in defeat after the battle of five forks t is long past the midnight hour and like a boy i have been reading over your dear cheery letter caressing the written page because it has been touched hand all is quiet now but soon all will be bustle for we march at daylight oh my darling were there ever such men as those of my division this morning after the review i thanked them for their valiant services yesterday on the first of april never to be forgotten of us when to my mind they fought one of the most desperate battles of the whole war their answer to me was cheer after cheer one after another calling out thats all right marse george * only followed you then in the midst of these calls * them rose loud and clear dear old * voice singing the old hymn which they all knew i loved guide me oh thou great jehovah pilgrim through this barren land voice after voice joined in till from all along the forth line the plea rang be my sword and shield and banner be the lord my righteousness my heart i do not think my sallie the tears sounded in my voice as it mingled with theirs but they were in my eyes and there was something new in when the last line had been sung i gave the order to march proceeding to this point where i had expected to cross the appomattox and rejoin the main army while we were at a halt here orders came from general r h anderson to report to him at sutherlands tavern just after mailing my letter to you at five forks telling you of our long continuous march of eighteen hours and of the strenuous hours following those where i had because of * circumstances been induced to fall back at daylight i received a dispatch from the great tyee telling me to hold five forks at all hazards to prevent the enemy from striking the south side railroad this dispatch was in reply to one i had sent to him reporting the state of affairs and that the enemy were trying to get in between the army and my command and asking that diversion be made at once or i should be isolated i had had all trains parked in the rear of hatchers run and much preferred that position but from the * for from the poe rosebush which mrs allen gave us is full of buds so you see everything above the ground and in the ground at our turkey island home is wait your blessing this morning i took my gun and rufus and killed five partridges and two rabbits i gave one rabbit to mr sims and one to uncle tom the birds i sent to lizzie as i was coming on home i stopped and rested in the cool and calm of the forest beside the old gray broken monument where we have so often made love and told each other fairy tales and wondered about and made thought pictures of our william and mary randolph who erected it away back in 1771 i wonder little one if from their celestial home they can seethe picturesque beauty which i see and which i wish i could put into words do you remember the inscription on one of the sides of the monument the foundation of this pillar was laid in 1771 when all the great rivers of this country were swept by inundations never before experienced which changed the face of nature and left traces of their violence that will remain for ages as i read over this inscription i feel sorry that the thought to erect a monument to commemorate any kind of disaster should ever have been born times soothing wings bless always and not only have the ravages of the flood which this monument was erected to commemorate been long ago forgotten but the memories of ravages and horrors of a yesterday far far more terrible are thank god being effaced the birds are * and songs are being born just where butlers vandals mutilated and broke off the top of this monument hunting for hidden treasure some of the seeds which the mother birds carried to their young have fallen by the wayside and taken root and now out of the jagged broken top grows a greenery of unknown vines and plants and flowers the old colonial home of my forefathers with its rare old * and paintings which butler sacked and desecrated and then burned has been replaced by a sweet little cottage home built by ourselves all our very own and consecrated to love and contentment with furnishings so simple and plain that we are not afraid of using them no my sweetheart we dont want any monuments to mark any of the woes and horrors of the must build one of hope and faith and peace and mercy and joy the foundation of which love is already laid in our hearts listen i hear old sims step on the porch i hear past we him knocking his pipe against the * a dios he will tell me the same old stories over again and i shall listen and laugh as though i heard them for the first time dear old sims good night sweet dreams angels guard you while i hear of lafayette and nelson and marshall through the clouds of old sims tobacco smoke for the hundredth yes for the * time your lonesome soldier you are always right my darling sallie and your husband is only right when he is guided by you pretty generally he listens to his oracle and when he doesnt he wishes to the lord he had the morning i left when you urged that i wear the suit i had been wearing and i claimed that i hadnt time to change then please take it with you and change on the boat you plead well dearest i was stubborn i wouldnt and i didnt and your obstinate soldier was not out of sight of the sweet lone figure standing on the wharf waving to him the love signals and the godspeed of our code before he was abusing himself as an ingrate in refusing anything that the dearest most beautiful woman and the best wife in the world could ask of him * dat dances is bleeged ter pay de * and your husband is paying he is being punished for he caught cold on the boat had a chill followed by sore throat and pain in limbs and back i stopped only a day in petersburg to see our agent there then came over here at the exchange i went directly to bed and sent for dr * he has been very attentive coming twice a day julia and wash took me in charge at once and as usual are as good as gold and so is everyone as to that for each and all in turn prescribe a sure remedy and urge my taking it that settled it and i compromised on the hot scotch but i was firm and would not yield to * entreaties to be permitted to bring me mrs marshalls flannel petticoat to wrap around my throat what would the judge say i asked yesterday when i wrote i did not tell you how sick i had been or was nor how lonesome nor how i longed for your soothing gentle touch your ministering care i should only have made you anxious you could not have come to me oh my sweetheart i think of you all the hours and i swear every time i leave you that ill never leave you again and that if business calls i must take you with me if i could only lay the treasures of the universe at your tiny little feet but this business im afraid will not earn my cough drops nor your violets and oh it is such a crucifixion you dont know how abhorrent it is to me i spur myself on all the time with this one thought that it is my darling for you the day i came upon the boat i took out two policies one for 7000 and one for 10000 the men were both old soldiers belonging to my dear old division one of them said they had to run me down and almost tie me to make me insure their lives you know dear i cant do it id sooner face a cannon than ask a man to take out a policy with me your soldier is nothing but a soldier the war is over and he is no more account the company tells me that my agents must do the * but ill feel like a thief to take a commission on what they have worked for and earned yesterday when i came through petersburg i went as i told you to our office j b b our companys agent was sitting with his chair tilted back foot on the table smoking a bad * pipe and reading macaria hello general hello he said not rising sent in six policies this week old man on your familiarity or courtly * neither old man on gall gall old man gall and * come have a drink ever read macaria with the most studied politeness and coldness i declined his offer and in my most dignified manner asked permission to look over the companys books come whats eating you old man he asked bringing his chair down with a bang and * me on the back then he profanely informed me that id have to * a few holes and thaw out if i wanted to paint the monkeys tail skyblue alas little one i am afraid your soldier isnt much of an artist he longs to give his precious wife all the luxuries and comforts and everything that is beautiful but he cant thaw out my darling and he cant paint that monkeys tail skyblue and sweetheart it makes him crawl and creep to be associated with artists who can i was wondering as i came over whether it would be better to send our boy to west point or get him a paint brush we have time to decide that however for he is just a little over eleven here comes the colonel and old mistis and by the way everybody sends love and messages to you and our boy now my own beautiful wife dont be anxious about me and forgive this long rambling letter your loving good for nothing soldier all the way to the station my darling i was asking myself whether i was right in yielding to your solicitations and leaving our sick child with all the resulting care and responsibility resting on your * shoulders and once sweetheart after thinking very seriously over it i was almost tempted to turn and go back when the appealing words of your voice echoed through my soul even if i knew our child would die while you were gone i would not have you neglect this call to honor your boys whom you led to their death so instead of turning back i said drive faster please john david i wouldnt miss my train for anything you blessed little sermon i made the train in plenty of time and your mother to whom i had telegraphed at ivor came to the station bringing the good tidings that your brother was out of danger i did not tell her that our little george was ill lest it might make her anxious as i knew that her duty was beside her sick boy i would have been so thankful if you my sweet beautiful bride and our precious little war child could have come with me everybody asks about you and the boy and sends love and expresses sorrow that you could not come a delegation of my old soldiers met me at the station and though some of our relatives had prepared to have us with them i agreed to the arrangement of the committee and the demand of the governor and was taken to the executive mansion as the guest of the state all the evening and the next morning until it was time to form old comrades came in in groups and in single file they told of their experiences officers and privates alike discussed the pennsylvania campaign and the three days fight their voices falling to a whisper as they spoke of those whose memory we had come to honor our gallant dead at gettysburg our brave boys who gave their last full measure of * duty i had been made chief marshal a sad solemn sacred office for me of all the army such love such reverence was christ born you cannot conceive of it from the old market to the cemetery of hollywood the streets sidewalks windows and housetops were crowded there must have been twelve thousand people at hollywood such a demonstration of devotion and sympathy was i think never before witnessed on earth think of it my darling so penetrating so universal a * of love and respect and reverence existed that there was a stillness an * save for those necessary sounds the clanking of swords the tramp of horses and the martial tread of men keeping time with funeral marches the solemn requiem no cheers no applause only loving greetings from tearstained faces heads bent in reverence clasped hands held out to us as we passed along as i saw once more the * faces of my brave virginians again i heard * follow you marse george from their eternal silence those who marched heroically to death looked down upon us yesterday my darling you cannot know no you cannot know as i clasped the hand of one after another of those who crowded around me i was greeted with the words my husband was killed at gettysburg my son is lying there among the * brother was with you there so many crushed hearts filling my heart with grief oh my wife my their cry sallie if the cry of my soul had been voiced it would have been the echo of that at gethsemane your * soldier the end
