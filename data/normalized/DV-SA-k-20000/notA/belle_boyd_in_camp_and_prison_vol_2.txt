i leave for fortress monroe i am not permitted to see my father interview with general butler my luggage * an examination much of my property is confiscated general jacksons fieldglasses my letters of introduction almost get me into trouble kindness of major mulford and his wife general butler attempts to recapture me the bird is flown and to his chagrin as i afterwards learn ascending the james river the french * the mirage arrival in richmond on the first day of december early in the morning i started for fortress monroe under the charge of captain mix and an * it was my poor fathers intention to have accompanied me as far as baltimore and beyond if he could get the necessary permission just before i left however a message was brought to me stating that my father though not dangerously ill was confined to the house by severe indisposition when i heard that i could not see my fond parent it distressed me greatly but i was powerless to act in the matter and though i entreated them to let me go to him if but for a moment it was refused after being subjected to the annoying and * conduct of captain mix who seemed to exert himself especially to make everything as disagreeable as he possibly could for me i arrived in fortress monroe about 9 am on wednesday morning captain mix immediately went on shore to report to captain * the provostmarshal and aidedecamp to butler to whose care i was to be committed until the exchange boat should start for richmond meanwhile all the passengers had landed and i was left in the charge of the orderly sergeant major now general mulford the exchange officer returned on board with captain mix and was introduced to me i found him an elegant and courteous gentleman in a short time i was escorted from the boat to the provostmarshals office passing between a company of negro soldiers who were filed on each side thence i was taken into the fortress to butlers headquarters and after waiting a short time i was conducted into his august presence he was seated near a table and upon my entrance he looked up and said ah so this is miss boyd the famous rebel spy pray be seated thank you general butler but i prefer to stand i was very much agitated and trembled greatly this he noticed and remarked pray be seated but why do you tremble so are you frightened no ah that is yes general butler i must acknowledge that i do feel frightened in the presence of a man of such worldwide reputation as yourself this seemed to please him immensely and rubbing his hands together and smiling most benignly he said oh pray do be seated miss boyd but what do you mean when you say that i am widely known i mean general butler i said that you are a man whose atrocious conduct and brutality especially to southern ladies is so infamous that even the english parliament commented upon it i naturally feel alarmed at being in your presence he had evidently expected a compliment when i commenced to reply to his inquiry but at the close of my remarks he rose and with rage depicted upon every * of his features he ordered me out of his presence i was conducted to the hotel and felt for the time being exceedingly uneasy lest by my * shot at an enemy whom i thoroughly detested i should have laid myself open to his petty spirit of revenge i feared that i should be * to a dreary prison cell for general butler was * in the north about this period events have since clearly proved this man even to the yankees themselves to be but a * hero and a political * like others who render themselves rather notorious than great he first pleased a fickle populace by his acts of brutality then disgusted his contemporaries who feared that he might become to america what * had been to france the tyrant of new orleans having failed most signally at wilmington was discovered to be a coward and suspected of being a * well might the baffled new england attorney exclaim * * * in the hope of being styled a modern * he retired to lowell to live upon the illgotten gains extorted by threats or force from southern people but to resume the thread of my story i was obliged to give my parole that i would not leave the house until permitted to do so here i found the misses lomax sisters of the confederate general lomax and a miss goldsborough of baltimore who were to be sent south these ladies however were not the only confederate sympathizers in the hotel there were others whose names i dare not mention on wednesday evening the order came for miss goldsborough and myself to be in readiness to start that same night for richmond the misses lomax for some reason were not allowed to proceed but were sent back to baltimore when the time arrived for our departure we were taken back to the provostmarshals office and here i found my luggage consisting of two saratoga trunks and a * the keys were demanded of me and i complied with the request a man and two women immediately set to work to * my boxes although i assured them that they need not search as i had just come from prison this appeal however was ineffectual and they still continued their examination imagine their astonishment and my chagrin when they pulled from the bottom of one of my trunks two suits of private clothes a uniform for majorgeneral w a dozen linen shirts c these things i had succeeded in * into prison by means of an underground railway of which superintendent wood sharp as he imagined himself to be was little aware i was interrogated as to how i had obtained the articles in question but they did not succeed in * anything by their queries all the goods considered contraband including several pairs of army gauntlets and felt hats with a pair of fieldglasses which had formerly belonged to general jackson and which i greatly prized together with much clothing were taken from me i entreated them to let me retain the glasses but this was flatly refused and they were to my mortification given to general butler when i saw how these vandals were robbing me of nearly everything i strove in vain to restrain my tears and my trunks having been thoroughly ransacked i was informed that i must undergo a personal search at this turn of affairs i began to feel very nervous for i had concealed about me twenty thousand dollars in confederate notes five thousand in greenbacks and nearly one thousand in gold as well as the letters of introduction which i have previously mentioned i earnestly appealed to their forbearance assuring them that i had nothing contraband for i did not consider my money contraband as it was getting late the captain said well if you will take an oath to the effect that you have nothing contraband upon you no letters or papers you shall not be searched as this was impossible i told him that i could not make such a declaration handing him my letters at the same time he then asked if i had any money about me to this i replied by giving him a roll of two or three thousand dollars in confederate money which i had placed in my pocket this he regarded as * and sneeringly informed me that i might keep that stuff upon opening my letters and finding mention of my immense services to my country my kindness towards prisoners my devotion to the southern cause c he became very angry and said i shall send this to general butler in the morning i would do so now but it is after office hours miss goldsborough sat by meanwhile a quiet spectator of the whole affair she having undergone the ordeal of search in the morning we were then conducted to the wharf placed on board a tug and sent off to the exchange boat the city of new york which lay at anchor in the stream upon our arrival on board we were kindly received by major mulford who conducted us to the saloon and introduced us to his wife a very charming ladylike woman here we remained all night and next morning about seven oclock got under way shortly afterwards we ran aground and it was not until 8 am that we succeeded in getting the vessel off again then under a full head of steam we * for city point about this time the little * that had brought us alongside the city of new york quitted the wharf apparently in chase of us my heart sank for i felt intuitively that this pursuit had something to do with me and that general butler must have given an order for my detention but the larger steamer had already waited so long that major mulford angry and impatient at the delay took no notice of our pursuers and to my great joy and relief kept steadily on our course i afterwards learnt that my fears upon this occasion were not unfounded when general butler * with the remembrance of my farewell sarcasm had beheld the letters that captain * had taken from me he commanded that i should be followed and if recaptured should be sent at once to fort warren in massachusetts bay as he issued this order he remarked to those who surrounded him that he would take a leading character in beauty and the beast when the tug returned from her fruitless chase he was almost beside himself with rage at being thwarted in his revenge this i had from such good authority that i am confident the general will not feel it worth his while to contradict the statement at the mouth of the james river we passed the federal blockading fleet and were here boarded by a boat from the * minnesota commanded by admiral lee in a few moments we had entered the james whose waters are * from those of the potomac by a yellow streak which appears on the surface as we wended our way up the river we could see the signalofficers at the different stations busily announcing our approach and occasionally we observed confederate soldiers on picket duty everything reminded me that i was once more drawing near to the capital of my own sunny south * * * vi * a * * in * e si * * * * * though exceedingly happy that i was again permitted to breathe the pure air of my native state i did not feel completely free for i was still under the federal * and could scarcely count upon my liberty as being yet fully assured to me we arrived at city point late on friday evening this place which could hardly be correctly dignified with the name of village is * in a bend of the river it was used as a dpt by the confederates for the purpose of forwarding stores to those of their unfortunate countrymen who were prisoners in the north whilst the city of new york coming to an anchor major mulford his wife miss goldsborough and myself stood conversing on the * major mulford remarked pointing to what was apparently the confederate flagoftruce boat approaching after all ladies you will not have to remain on board here tonight looking in the direction indicated we distinctly saw a steamer which judging from the distance between us would in less than ten minutes be alongside ten minutes however passed in fruitless expectation then followed twenty more of hope deferred when major mulford who began to grow very impatient went on shore to inquire the reason of her remaining as she did he even sent a boat to her to ascertain the reason of her detention major mulford was so confident that he had seen her that the confederate officer commanding the point telegraphed the news to richmond judge of our great surprise when the telegraphic reply brought to us on board shortly afterwards announced that the confederate flagoftruce boat had left richmond exactly at the hour we had seen her as richmond was more than twelve hours distant from us at the then rate of travel over that route we could only consider that we had been deceived by a mirage how often must such phenomena have given rise to stories of phantom ships a french * which had been up the river to richmond lay at anchor near us this evening in acceptance of an invitation from major mulford the french captain and his lieutenant came on board to spend the evening with us and we enjoyed their visit heartily the next morning when i awoke i found that the flagoftruce boat had arrived during the night captain hatch the confederate exchange officer presently came on board we were introduced to him and very soon afterwards were with our luggage safely ensconced in the snug little cabin of the here under my own countrys flag i felt free and comparatively happy on our way up the river to richmond we had to pass the obstructions situated between chapins and drurys bluffs these places take their names from the bold appearance that the shore here presents the obstructions designed to impede a hostile squadron became accidentally hurtful to our confederate vessel she ran foul of them and it was found utterly impossible to continue the voyage at drurys bluff therefore we went on board a tug in which we proceeded to richmond when we arrived at 8 pm i went immediately to the spottswood house and tired and worn out with the fatigues of my journey i retired to rest refusing to see any one that evening kind reception at richmond i hear of my fathers death efforts of my friends to procure my return home i go from richmond further south kindness of friends during my illness i am made bearer of * from richmond too late for the * i take passage in the greyhound when i came down to breakfast on the following day my many acquaintances and friends in the hotel were astonished to see me for few had expected that i should be released and none that i should so soon arrive at richmond the morning papers announced my return in flattering terms and as it thus became generally known i was at once besieged with company and every afternoon and evening i held a perfect drawingroom if i may be allowed to make use of the expression my reception was everything that i could wish but alas my happiness was of short duration and my freedom was dearly bought i was at a large dinnerparty on a saturday evening exactly one week after the day i had arrived i was joyous and lighthearted little dreaming of the blow that was to overwhelm me with sadness little dreaming that i should be so cruelly reminded of the words of the preacher that in the midst of life we are in death but so it was on monday morning the 14th before i had risen i received a little note from captain hatch in which he expressed great sorrow at having to be the bearer of mournful tidings and said that as soon as i was dressed he would call in person with the wife of the proprietor of the hotel for one moment i could not imagine what he meant but dressing myself as speedily as i possibly could i sent for them they came captain hatch held in his hands a newspaper he approached me saying miss belle you are aware that you left your father ill in one moment i comprehended everything and exclaiming my god is he dead i sank fainting to the floor this * was succeeded by severe illness and i felt all the loneliness of my position an exile for the yankees held possession of martinsburg and an orphan these words described me and ah how hard they seemed one of those strange warnings that are sometimes given to mortals or that are some would say the imaginings of an excited brain shaken by sickness ought to have prepared me for my sad bereavement some say that gleams of a * world visit the soul in sleep the night upon which my father died i had retired to rest somewhat earlier than usual how long i slept i do not know but i suddenly awoke or seemed to awaken from my sleep although i had neither the power nor the wish to move in the centre of the room i saw general jackson whose eyes rested sorrowfully upon me beside him stood my father gazing at me but saying nothing i was dumb or i should have spoken for i did not feel alarmed as i looked upon those two standing together general jackson turned and spoke to my father i remember the words distinctly it is time for us to go he said and taking my fathers hand he led him away adding as he did so poor child i afterwards learnt by a letter from my mother the first and only communication received from her until my arrival in this country that my beloved father at the news of my being sent south where i should have to battle alone with the world had grown rapidly worse and had expired the very next day after my arrival in richmond my mother and the children had been sent for and reached my father just before he died although he retained his senses up to the last he frequently spoke of me declared that i was hovering around his couch and would become quite restless if people in the room went to a certain spot near the bed exclaiming that i was being torn from him several of our senators and exchange officers with many other influential persons wrote to the federal government to try and obtain permission for me to return to my sorrowing mother i myself wrote to the northern president and secretary stanton at the suggestion of my friends and appealed to them as a masons daughter but no every appeal was refused my letters to and from my mother in martinsburg were intercepted and from december the 16th until i arrived in london and then not until the following october did i receive one line from her though she had written repeatedly my health was very bad and my constitution greatly undermined so in february i went from richmond farther south visiting mobile atlanta augusta and other cities whose names have since become historical i cannot express one half the gratitude that i feel to the many kind hosts whom i met in my journey through the south during my illness in richmond i was well cared for and amongst the warmest of my friends must be ranked the wife of the * captain semmes afterwards admiral semmes of the illfated alabama mrs semmes treated me with as much attention as though i had been her own daughter and invited me to visit them at their home in mobile i had always been termed the child of the confederacy or the child of the army and no matter where i went i was welcomed both by the gentry and the people in march i returned to richmond when although somewhat recovered my health still required care i could not return home and i felt moreover restless and unhappy at the death of my father i determined therefore to visit europe so soon as i could arrange my affairs when i made known this resolution to president davis he approved of the plan considering me to need quiet and rest in some place remote from the dangers of our sorely pressed country orders were given to the confederate secretary of state to make me the bearer of despatches i commenced preparations for departure as speedily as possible the despatches were ready for me on march 25th but a brief return of illness hindered me from starting and as these papers being very important could not be delayed they were forwarded by some other hand at last on march 29th i was able to leave richmond having recovered sufficiently for travelling other despatches were now ready and of them i was made the bearer owing to an accident on the railway we did not arrive in wilmington until several hours after the departure of the blockaderunner in which i was to have sailed this steamer would not be followed by another for at least a fortnight because they did not run out during the brilliant nights of the full moon lest they should fall an easy prey to yankee blockaders i was therefore obliged to await the arrival and departure of the next regular steamer as even putting aside all consideration of difficulties increased by moonlight there was not a suitable craft in port one of the first vessels that arrived was the greyhound commanded by captain henry formerly it is said an officer in the united states navy and who had at the commencement of the war with many of his comrades sent in his resignation to the united states navy department and entered the confederate service captain henry had formerly been on stonewall jacksons staff and as i was acquainted with his family i gladly accepted his kind invitation and took passage on board the greyhound feeling doubly secure under such a skilful commander i leave wilmington for europe running the blockade safe outside mal de * the federal cruiser the chase the yankee proves too fast the first shell the fire grows hot forced to surrender the english sailor and his flag on the 8th of may i bade farewell to many friends in wilmington and stepped on board the greyhound it was as may well be imagined an anxious moment i knew that the venture was a desperate one but i felt sustained by the greatness of my cause for i had borne a part however insignificant in one of the greatest dramas ever yet enacted upon the stage of the world moreover i relied upon my own resources and i looked to fortune who is so often the * of a daring enterprise at the mouth of the river we dropped anchor and decided to wait until the already waning moon should entirely disappear outside the bar and at the distance of about six miles lay the federal fleet most of them at anchor but some of their lighter vessels were cruising quietly in different directions not one however showed any disposition to tempt the guns of the fort over which the confederate flag was flying there were on board the greyhound two passengers or rather adventurers besides myself mr * and mr pollard the latter the editor of the richmond examiner we laughed and joked as people will laugh and joke in the face of imminent danger and even in the jaws of death gentle reader before you accuse us of levity or of a reckless spirit of * reflect how in the prison of la force when the reign of terror was at its height the doomed victims of the guillotine acted charades played games of * and circulated their bon * and * * within a few hours of a violent death remember also that the lovely queen of scots and the unfortunate anne boleyn met their fate with a smile and greeted the scaffold with a jest about ten oclock orders were given to get under way the next minute every light was extinguished the anchor was weighed steam was got up rapidly and silently and we glided off just as the trailing garments of the night spread their last folds over the ocean the decks were piled with bales of cotton upon which our lookout men were stationed straining their eyes to pierce the darkness and give timely notice of the approach of an enemy i freely confess that our * temperament had now yielded to a far more serious state of feeling no more * were exchanged but many earnest prayers were breathed no one thought of sleep few words were spoken it was a night never to be forgotten a night of silent almost breathless anxiety it seemed to us as if day would never break but it came at last and to our unspeakable joy not a sail was in sight we were moving unmolested and alone upon a tranquil sea and we indulged in the fond hope that we had eluded our eager foes steaming on we ran close by the wreck of the confederate ironclad raleigh which had so lately driven the federal blockading squadron out to sea but which now lay on a * an utter wreck parted * destroyed not by the federals but by a * of providence at this point we three passengers began to experience those sensations which although invariably an object of derision to persons who are exempt from them are for the time being as grievous to the sufferer as any in the whole catalogue of pains and aches to which flesh is heir reader may it never be your lot as it then was mine to find * overcome by the stronger emotion inspired by the sight of a hostile vessel bearing rapidly down with the purpose of depriving you of your freedom it was just noon when a thick haze which had lain upon the water lifted and at that moment we heard a startled cry of sail ho from the lookout man at the * these ominous words were the signal for a general rush aft extra steam was got up in an incredibly short space of time and sail was set with the view both of increasing our speed and of * our vessel as she dashed through the water alas it was soon evident that our exertions were useless for every minute visibly lessened the distance between us and our pursuer her masts rose higher and higher her hull loomed larger and larger and i was told plainly that unless some unforeseen accident should favour us such as a temporary * of the federal steamers * apparatus or a breaking of some important portion of her machinery we might look to new york instead of bermuda as our destination my feelings at this intelligence must be imagined i can describe them but inadequately unless i thought providence * directly in our behalf we shall be overhauled and captured and then what follows i shall suffer a third rigorous imprisonment moreover i was the bearer of despatches from my government to authorities in europe and i knew that this service honourable and necessary as it was the federals regarded in the light of a heinous crime and that in all probability i should be subjected to every kind of indignity the chase continued and the cruiser still gained upon us for minutes which to me seemed hours did i strain my eyes towards our pursuer and watch anxiously for the flash of the * that would soon send a shot or shell after us or for all i could tell into us how long i remained watching i know not but the iron messenger of death came at last a thin white curl of smoke rose high in the air as the enemy * up and presented her formidable broadside almost simultaneously with the hissing sound of the shell as it buried itself in the sea within a few yards of us came the smothered report of its explosion under water the enemys shots now followed each other in rapid succession some fell very close while others less skilfully aimed were wide of the mark and burst high in the air over our heads during this time bale after bale of cotton had been rolled overboard by our crew the epitaph of each as it disappeared beneath the waves being by theres another they shall not get our captain paced nervously to and fro * watching the compass now gazing fixedly at the approaching enemy now shouting more steam more steam give her more steam at last he turned suddenly round to me and exclaimed in passionate accents miss belle i declare to you that but for your presence on board i would burn her to the waters edge rather than those infernal scoundrels should reap the benefit of a single bale of our cargo to this i replied captain henry act without reference to me do what you think your duty for my part sir i concur with you burn her by all means i am not afraid i have made up any mind and am indifferent to my fate if only the federals do not get the vessel to this captain henry made no reply but turned abruptly away and walked aft where his officers were standing in a group with them he held a hurried consultation and then coming to where i was seated exclaimed it is too late to burn her now the yankee is almost on board of us we must surrender during all this time the enemys fire never ceased round shot and shell were ploughing up the water about us they flew before behind and above everywhere but into us and although i knew that the first of those heavy missiles which should strike must be fatal to many perhaps to all yet so angry did i feel that i could have forfeited my own life if by so doing i could have * the federals of their prey at this moment we were not more than half a mile from our * for we had * up in the wind and stopped our engine suddenly with a deep humming sound came a * bolt this shot was fired from their long gun * and passed just over my head between myself and the captain who was standing on the bridge a little above me by jove dont they intend to give us quarter or show us some mercy at any rate cried captain henry i have surrendered and now from the yankee came a * hail steamer * haul down that flag or eve will pour a broadside into you captain henry then ordered the man at the wheel to lower the colours but he replied with true british pluck that he had sailed many times under that flag but had never yet seen it hauled down and added he i cannot do it now we were sailing under british colours and the man at the helm was an englishman all this time repeated * of haul down that flag or we will sink you greeted us until at last some one i know not who seeing how hopeless it must be to brave them longer took it upon himself to execute captain henrys order and lowered the english ensign we are boarded by an officer from the yankee the us steamer connecticut an officer but no gentleman strange state of yankee discipline scenes on board of the greyhound after her capture aint ye * a proud boast before the acknowledgment of our surrender had been made a * containing some twenty or thirty thousand dollars equivalent in value to about six thousand pounds sterling had been brought up on deck and consigned to the deep whilst all my despatches and letters of introduction of which latter i had many were consumed in the furnaces very shortly afterwards we were boarded by a boats crew from our captor under the command of the executive officer mr * mounting the side he walked up to captain henry and said good day to you captain i am glad to see you this is a very fine vessel and a valuable one will you be good enough to let me see your papers to this captain henry replied good day to yourself sir but as to my being happy to see you i cannot really say that i am i have no papers the federal lieutenant then said well captain your presence is required on board the united states steamer connecticut captain almy commanding and if you can prove yourself all right you will no doubt be permitted to go to this captain henry made no response but stepping into the cabin donned his coat and returning on deck said now sir i am ready shall we go without further parley the two stepped together into the boat which was lying alongside and immediately pulled for the connecticut one mr swasey was left in charge of our luckless greyhound an officer as unfit for authority as any who has ever trodden the deck of a manofwar his subordinates were i imagine well acquainted with his character and abilities at all events they treated his orders not with respect but ridicule now sergeant said he addressing the sergeant of marines look out for your men and i will look out for mine by the way though station one man here to guard the * and dont let any one go below the first man i catch doing so i will blow his brains out i will i would not let my own father have a drink he might possibly have resisted the solicitations of a thirsty parent but he proved quite unable to withstand those of the men he had hardly finished speaking when a seaman whom by his * brogue i recognised at once for a true son of erin approached and addressed mr swasey with all the native eloquence and pathos of his country ah mr swasey will * be afther * me have a small bottle of whiskey to * out the could the colloquy that ensued was ludicrous in the extreme terminating in a victory of the irish sailor over the federal officer this example of successful * once set was soon followed and in every instance mr swasey yielded to the remonstrances or rather to the mutinous appeals of his men here suddenly exclaimed he catching a glimpse of myself sergeant of the guard sergeant of the guard put a man in front of this door and give him orders to stab this women if she dares to attempt to come out this order so highly becoming an officer and a gentleman so courteous in its language and withal so necessary to the safety and preservation of the prize was given in a menacing voice and in the very words i have used i record them for the purpose of showing how admirably the federal government has selected its naval officers and how * and gallantly they fulfilled the instructions of their superiors * * must have been blotted out from the edition of the ancient poet read in those schools which had the honour of educating them mr swasey then came to the cabin door and introduced himself in these brief but delicate words now aint ye * my blood was roused and i replied no i am not i was never frightened at a yankee in my life this retort of mine seemed to surprise him as he walked away without another word the effects of his displeasure however soon made themselves felt to my ineffable disgust the officers and even the men were permitted to walk at pleasure into my cabin which i had hoped would have been respected as the sanctuary of a modest girl in this hope as in so many others i calculated far too much upon the forbearance and humanity of yankees and these qualities were seldom exhibited when their enemies were defenseless and consequently at their mercy officers and men now proceeded to help themselves to the private wines of the captain in spite of the protest of the sentry who had been placed in front of my door and of whom it is but justice to say that nature had qualified him to command when his superiors would have done well to obey while these scenes were being enacted my maid and a coloured woman whom captain henry was conveying to a lady in bermuda were subjected to the rude * of the prize crew at this moment one of the * officers a mr reveille walked up to me and said do you know that it was i who fired the shot that passed close over your head was it replied i should you like to know what i said of the * i should like to know that man whoever he may be is an arrant coward to fire upon a defenseless ship after her surrender to this rejoinder of mine more sincere perhaps than prudent he made no reply but left the cabin with an embarrassed laugh an eventful meeting a gentleman at last a wifes apology mr hardinge i am disappointed a pleasant exchange farewell to mr swasey a ludicrous incident captain henrys best boots i am discovered through treachery scarcely had the discomfited yankee betaken himself to my intense satisfaction upon deck when i noticed a young officer who had just come over the side he crossed the deck by the wheel and approached the cabin i saw at a glance he was made of other stuff than his comrades who had preceded him and i confess my attention was riveted by the presence of a gentleman the first i think my readers will allow whom i had met in the hour of my distress a woman and a wife may perhaps be forgiven if in a work which treats of more serious adventures than those of love she indulges in a very brief reminiscence of the impression produced upon her by her future husband critics may smile but i flatter myself that * so widely and so justly famed for conjugal devotion will forgive me his dark brown hair hung down on his shoulders his eyes were large and bright those who judge of beauty by regularity of feature only could not have pronounced him strictly handsome neither * nor * would have chosen the subject for a model of grecian grace but the fascination of his manner was such his every movement was so much that of a refined gentleman that my southern proclivities strong as they were yielded for a moment to the impulses of my heart and i said to myself oh what a good fellow that must be to my secret disappointment he passed by the cabin without entering or making any inquiries about me i asked one of the * officers who was close to me the name of the new arrival in this party of pleasure lieutenant hardinge was his reply soon afterwards i heard the following conversation which i perfectly well remember and which i transcribe verbatim between mr swasey and mr hardinge mr swasey * hardinge anything up what is it mr hardinge yes sir by order of captain almy i have come to relieve you of the command of this vessel it is his order that you proceed forthwith on board the connecticut you will be pleased to hand over to me the papers you have in relation to this vessel mr swasey it is a lie it is a lie it aint no such thing i wont believe it you have been lately * with the captain confound it that is the way you always do mr hardinge mr swasey i am but obeying my orders you must not insult me if you continue to do so i shall report you mr swasey cooled at once i suppose as i heard nothing further on his side he promptly handed over his orders as desired by mr hardinge jumped into the boat alongside and i caught the last sound of his charming voice as he uttered the word of command give way there to the boats crew he returned to the connecticut and so passes out of this story if its pages ever meet his eye perhaps they may make him reflect that courtesy to a lady is compatible with the * duties of an officer and that forbearance to the vanquished has always been the attribute of a truly brave man within a few minutes of the departure of our sometime * mr hardinge now in command issued his orders to the sergeant of marines as to how the men were to be posted and i overheard not without an emotion of pleasure the sergeant telling one of our officers that although mr hardinge might be a strict * on duty there was not a finer young fellow in the navy and that his men would follow him anywhere before long mr hardinge came aft and bowing to me asked permission to enter my cabin for a moment certainly i replied i know that i am a prisoner i am now in command of this vessel said he and i beg you will consider yourself a passenger not a prisoner with the commencement of mr hardinges command i may safely say from the very moment he came on board the conduct of the prize crew underwent a complete change and one of the yankee officers remarked in my hearing that although hardinge was young he knew how to command other men and had learnt early in life the secret and the value of discipline half an hour or * elapsed and i was * myself to my captivity when the return on board of captain henry was the occasion of a ludicrous incident which amused me more than perhaps my readers will suppose i despair of describing it as it appeared to me perhaps the reaction of my own feelings such as we experience after passing safely through sudden and serious danger gave it a zest beyond its real * it was on this wise captain henry coming on board caught sight of a federal sailor strutting about on the cotton bales in a pair of his captain henrys very best boots boots which the captain most particularly cherished here you fellow what are you doing with my boots take them off at once or i shall report you to the officer in command for stealing but sir said the sailor loath to part with his contraband goods i bought them from a messmate of mine and * my own into the sea this * however did not impose upon mr hardinges sense of honour and discipline the ancient mariner had to remove the stolen boots and return barefooted to his ship the officers and crew of the greyhound together with my * mr pollard and mr * were taken on board the connecticut the captain steward cook and * myself and my maid remained prisoners on board the prize before we were taken indeed when we sailed from wilmington it had been agreed that belle boyd should be for the time ignored and that mrs lewis should take her place it was obvious that in the event of capture i should run less risk suffer fewer privations and be exposed to less indignity under an assumed name conceive then my surprise and indignation when i found that my secret had been revealed through the treachery of an unworthy countryman captain henry told me that the minnie a blockaderunner like the greyhound which had been captured the day before by the connecticut had been the means of our own mishap there can be no doubt that one of her officers was a traitor to the cause of his country and had through fear or actuated by some other unworthy motive sacrificed those he should have defended with his life it is with reluctance that i record this instance of * on the part of a southerner but i am resolved to be an impartial historian and although often severe to the yankees by dint of telling plainly their shortcomings i will not shrink from the truth when it is unfavourable to my countrymen bound north we are taken in * our first evening at sea we arrive at fortress monroe commodore * * comes on board in james river we are paroled by him his indignation against mr hardinge for flying the english ensign the * conduct whilst on board arrival at new york we go on shore i visit * theatre return aboard and departure for boston love triumphant boats were continually passing to and fro between the prize as she was designated and the connecticut with orders and * until the proximity of the vessels grew wearisome i was relieved to hear that we were about to start and my pleasure did not diminish when at 8 pm the command was given to get under steam and proceed northward keeping just * of the connecticut which would accompany us heartsick at the turn that the tide of fortune had taken i retired to my couch and endeavoured to sleep but prison walls could not be banished from my imagination and the attempt was vain the next morning at daylight i was aroused by loud * from the yankee cruiser as she passed close to us ordering that we should * to whilst she sent a boat on board we presently learned that our destination was to be fortress monroe and that we were to be * thither behind the connecticut * were passed to us by means of boats and when these * had been well secured both vessels steamed ahead it was the second evening after our surrender that captain henry mr hardinge and myself were seated together close by the wheel the moon shone beautifully clear lighting up everything with a brightness truly magnificent the ocean just agitated by a slight breeze that swept over its surface looked like one vast bed of sparkling diamonds and the rippling of the little waves as they struck the vessels side seemed but the soft accompaniment to the vocal music with which captain henry had been * us here we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony presently captain henry went forward on the bridge and conversed with mr hall the officer on watch we two were left to ourselves and mr hardinge quoted some beautiful passages from byron and shakespeare then in a decidedly * * style he endeavoured to paint the home to which if love could but fulfil its prayers this heart would lead thee and from poetry he passed on to plead an * tale situated as i was and having known him for so short a time a very practical thought flitted through my brain if he felt all that he professed to feel for me he might in future be useful to us so when he asked me to be his wife i told him that his question involved serious consequences and that he must not expect an answer until i should arrive at boston during our voyage mr hardinge was so kind and courteous that captain henry took a great fancy to him and swore eternal friendship to one of whom he afterwards spoke as the most thorough gentleman from yankeeland that he had ever met with the morning which succeeded the romantic episode slightly sketched above beheld the connecticut and greyhound lying to off the * a fog detained us in uncertainty as to our whereabouts for some time and when it lifted we steamed up hampton roads i sat on the little deck aft watching with interest all that i saw and listened alternately to the captain and mr hardinge as they conversed on various topics from the latter i ascertained that beast butler was in command at fortress monroe and from him i could expect but little courtesy as we neared our * i made out distinctly the grim outline of the fortress rising in its majesty and strength i compared myself to the fly nearing the cunning old spider who was eagerly watching for the moment when it should become entangled in his intricate web my capture had been telegraphed to those in authority the connecticut had cast off from us about halfway up the river and had gone onward to the mouth of the james where admiral lee then was but the greyhound when opposite the * of the baltimore steamers came to an anchor mr hardinge went on board the * minnesota to report he was absent about two hours and when he returned we got under way proceeding up stream to join the connecticut mr hardinge could tell me nothing of my probable destination and i suspected that i was to be incarcerated in fortress monroe there to remain i knew not how long perhaps for ever after about threequarters of an hour we again anchored this time close by the ironclad roanoke commodore * * who was acting in the place of admiral lee the admiral was then up the james river * for the purpose of fighting the rebels but much to the disgust of his officers and of the federal naval department if we may believe the journals of the day he merely * the farce of sinking vessels and driving in spikes across the river from bank to bank to prevent the cowardly rebels from doing what he dared not giving battle just after we brought up it blew a perfect hurricane followed by a drenching rain which lasted for some time such weather was in itself sufficiently dreary and discouraging nor did the sensation that we were dragging toward a * of uninviting appearance greatly comfort me i felt indeed some pleasure when i thought that the federals would perhaps lose their prize a feeling which captain henry fully shared in this cheerful desire we were disappointed for as the captain afterwards remarked the vessel was admirably handled by mr hardinge amid whistling wind and pouring rain an english ensign had been flying from the stern and the federal flag which had been hoisted when coming up the bay was conspicuous at the fore this seems to have excited the ire of the commodore who when the storm had passed boarded us with solemn displeasure written upon his face i am positive that i should have had a better opinion of the man had he remained in his own vessel for i now saw him far from sober one of the officers remarked that it was after four oclock by way of an apology to the * as he was pleased to term mr hardinge commodore * * was not * and upon reaching the deck swore * and lustily * right and left and was evidently as wild a * man as ever scuttled ship or cut a throat but then as it was a wet day he had evidently been taking something hot within to guard him from the cold when the commodore approached my cabin door i heard mr hardinge say sir a lady is dressing there will you be kind enough to wait she is my passenger and i am responsible for her i had finished however and the coloured servant opening the door said to mr hardinge de lady am ready massa on this the commodore remarked ugh got to that has it his entre into the cabin was truly imposing for stumbling over * cotton he staggered then slipped and made his descent and bow at the same moment his aide mr executive officer i believe looked mortified and seemed somewhat ashamed whilst following in the great mans rear with less of the * peculiar dignity so said the commodore this is miss belle boyd is it just then captain henry came in and turning round he exclaimed what by george old * then remembering his official position stopped suddenly in the midst of the exclamation i do not remember much of the conversation which ensued but noticed that the executive officer was sober and apparently disgusted with the conduct of his superior the commodore at first would not be seated but did so after a few moments further conversation champagne and glasses were brought in and he soon became exceedingly communicative and with an oath swore that captain henry should have a parole extending as far as boston asking for pen ink and paper which i immediately procured he bade the executive officer write the required parole and signed it with his own hand mr hardinge asked for the document or at least a copy of the same but he would not comply declaring that his orders were sufficient as he rose to depart he turned to me and said in answer to a request of mine you miss when you arrive at new york can go on shore provided mr hardinge accompanies you and he added attempting some compliments i will not enforce a written parole with you but will take a verbal promise dont be at all alarmed you shant go to prison the commodore then left us his descent into the boat was executed in the same dignified and gentlemanly manner as had been his entre into my presence and i felt very thankful when mr hall informed me that the great man had gone half an hour may have passed when a boat came from the roanoke to inform mr hardinge that the commodore had ordered that the greyhound should be brought under the lee of the ironclad my heart sank for it seemed that after all he had been playing with us still more so when as we rounded to under the * stern i heard the commodore threatening through his trumpet to blow us out of the water in his condition he might have done anything so our anxiety may well be imagined * for a moment to the english ensign before mentioned as flying aboard the greyhound i may describe how the commodore when he saw it shouted furiously haul down that rag mr hardinge ventured to suggest that this was a violation of the law regarding neutral vessels captured in time of war to which the commodore made answer by saying i dont want any * arguments and he afterwards sent a written order to mr hardinge forbidding him to fly the english flag as we lay beside the roanoke vague threats were made and contradictory orders given now we were told to be off at once then not to think of moving at present until mr hardinge grew restless at such constant supervision and taking advantage of a command to quit the station steamed away without waiting for anything more right glad were we when the shades of night hid from our view the monster ironclad and yet thankful to captain almy of the connecticut who not being drunk stopped us somewhat farther down delaying our departure for the very sensible reason that a gale of wind was blowing early the next day a * from the fortress went alongside of the connecticut and the officers passengers and men of the minnie and greyhound were transferred to her with the exception of mr pollard who was sent aboard of us to proceed to boston when the tug steamed by handkerchiefs and caps were waved and i was afterwards informed that they would have cheered me had they been permitted to do so fresh meat vegetables and ice the latter of which we esteemed a luxury as the weather was very warm had been procured on shore for our consumption at length we proceeded to sea bound for boston massachusetts via new york where it was intended that we should touch for coal i will pass over this portion of the voyage merely remarking that it was as pleasant as could be expected under the circumstances and that the officers did all in their power to make things comfortable for us as we neared new york thick fog completely enshrouded the coast but our speed was not slackened we pressed forward often passing vessels so near as hardly to give them breathing room part of one night we lay off * for the fog had become so thick that the pilot did not judge it safe for us to proceed but when morning broke a brisk wind sprang up enabling us to see the outline of sandy hook as we passed on up the harbour the motion became less disagreeable to me and a comfortable seat having been placed on the * i enjoyed a panorama of sea and shore scarce equalled in beauty by the approach to any other city in the world off * we were boarded by the health officer who after asking several questions permitted us to go on our way and we came to an anchor off navy yard mr hardinge went on shore to report his arrival while mr hall proceeded to bring the vessel alongside the * when mr hardinge returned in the afternoon the dock was filled with * who excited by that morbid curiosity exhibited by the world in general had come to witness as they supposed my * in this they were somewhat disappointed for everything had been arranged so nicely that not one of the many there assembled knew when i went on shore a navy yard tug dropped alongside the greyhound and with the assistance of captain h i was soon * settled in the * * captain henry and mr hardinge accompanied me we crossed to the new york side of the river and landed at the foot of canal street procuring a carriage we drove to a friends house where i took from off my person the money which i had concealed about me and the weight of which at times had almost made me faint this money belonged to myself and captain henry and was not as yankee papers averred part of the ships money we had thrown overboard previous to our capture captain henry placed our money in the bank where it was safe from further molestation we visited * theatre to witness the performance of * * what a contrast did the gay wealthy city of new york afford at this period to my own sorrowstricken land here there was no sign of want or poverty no woebegone faces could i see in that assemblage all was life and animation though war raged within a short distance its horrors had little influence on the butterflies of the empire city whilst in my own dear native country all was sad and heartrending we were sacrificing lives upon the altar of liberty while the north sacrificed hers upon the altar of mammon next morning mr hardinge called for me and after having finished my shopping we returned to the greyhound which now lay in * captain henry had gone on board before us as also had mr pollard i forgot to mention that this gentleman had been paroled by mr hardinge for the night for the rest of the time above four hours that we remained at new york we were besieged by visitors old acquaintances who were allowed to see me amongst them were several naval and military officers about 4 pm the pilot came on board and bidding adieu to the capital of * away we steamed for boston the weather was lovely the water smooth as glass and the sky cloudless as that of italy on each side of us along the shores of the sound were beautiful residences whose owners as they strolled over their lawns or sat smoking on terrace or balcony appeared to think little and care less about the war we glided past many craft which lay with white sails that flapped against their masts i was melancholy i hardly knew why the face of nature wore its very sweetest smile everything was propitious yet i was not pleased and sought the cabin mr hardinge in a few moments followed me and then he repeated a declaration on which i need not * as it concerned ourselves more than anyone else so generous and noble was he in everything that i could not but acknowledge that my heart was his i firmly believe that god intended us to meet and love and to make the story short i told him that i would be his wife although our politics differed women thought i can sometimes work wonders and may not he who is of northern birth come by degrees to love for my sake the illused south then captain henry came into the cabin and when we told him all he joined our hands together saying hardinge you are a good fellow and i love you boy miss belle deserves a good husband and i know no one more worthy of her than yourself may you both be happy arrival in boston our plan for * greyhound frustrated captain henrys escape how it was managed marshal keyes comes on board the search for the captain a false report of his arrest i communicate with him he leaves for new york i bid adieu to the greyhound my quarters on shore i am paroled for the city newspaper rumours mr hardinge proceeds to washington in my behalf my mother telegraphs to the marshal she is not permitted to see me politeness of the british consul i write a letter to the secretary of the navy am pronounced insane i am liberated mr hardinge and his officers are placed under arrest mr pollard is sent to fort warren i leave for canada when we neared boston i saw the grim walls of fort warren and a shudder passed over me as i inwardly wondered if that would be my home all my bright dreams of * england of bonnie scotland and of a tour on the continent were for the time banished the future lowered dark and uncertain had not some good spirit whispered hope i should scarcely have borne up against these gloomy impressions but i was still mrs lewis and might yet escape for lo the heavier grief weighed down the higher hope was raised when we were first captured it had been agreed that on our voyage north an attempt should be made to * the greyhound the project however had been abandoned not from any lack of zeal but from force of circumstances for captain almy had refused to put on board of us our chief engineer and first officer without whom the attempt could not possibly succeed another plan quietly prepared by us previously and which had reference to the escape of captain henry had better luck whilst we were coming to an anchor off the boston navy yard and mr hardinge was forward giving orders to the men captain henry mr pollard and myself were aft seated in the cabin i asked the two yankee * if they would join us and partake of a glass of wine to this they of course assented and drank freely for doubtless such wine but seldom passed their lips i then nodded to captain henry who carelessly putting on his hat and taking his umbrella in his hand walked up on deck and went aft where he stood for some moments everything seemed to favour us for mr hardinge had called a * alongside that he might go ashore to report his arrival before starting mr hardinge came to me and asked where his papers were when i replied that i thought they must be in the lower cabin where he had been dressing himself he immediately went down to fetch them and this was the golden opportunity for which we had waited in less time than it takes me to write it captain henry stepped into the boat which dropped slowly * with the tide and when mr hardinge reappeared the captain was safe on land the whole scene was amusing in the extreme to those who understood it so well had it been managed when mr hardinge found his boat gone he came to the conclusion that the * had grown tired of waiting and had pulled off so calling another he stepped into it and proceeded to report his prize in about three hours he returned bringing with him the united states marshal keyes and several other gentlemen of position and influence in boston whom he introduced to me the marshal then asked for captain henry i think he is on deck i replied mr hardinge went to find him leaving the other gentlemen to converse with mr pollard and myself from me however they did not learn much for i sustained the * character of mrs lewis with becoming gravity and it was not until several days after that they became quite sure that i was none other than the celebrated belle boyd in a few moments marshal keyes followed by mr hardinge entered the cabin the marshal exclaiming captain henry has escaped what said i it is impossible only a few moments ago he was here and i looked very serious though all the while i was laughing in my sleeve saying to myself again i have got the better of the yankees the vessel was thoroughly searched nay i believe that it was * or smoked to get the captain out for marshal keyes was positive that he was on board so he informed me on his way to the hotel captain henrys escape caused much sensation detectives great and small were thrown into a flutter of excitement and the boston police whom marshal keyes affirmed to be the best in the world were all * that the fugitive might be * in fort warren these * of northern power were certainly not favoured with a very accurate description of captain henry some declared that he wore a black hat others that lie had a white covering to his head some that his nose was * others that it was decidedly * such * bewildered the police whose efforts resulted in a * chase late on the evening of the escape marshal keyes was jubilant over a supposed capture at portland maine whither he had telegraphed to have any suspicious character arrested the portland captive proved to be not the gentleman of whom they were in quest but a harmless english tourist who was no doubt much aggrieved at his unlawful detention when the marshal informed me of the captains arrest at portland i knew that there must be some mistake and could hardly restrain my laughter for all this time captain henry was lying * in boston under an assumed name i was well aware of the captains residence and through the medium of a friend received several communications from him in my replies i assured him that he was already as good as free for two days he stayed quietly at the hotel and then i heard that he had set off for canada vi new york detectives had been sent all over the country to intercept him but it was one of the best managed escapes from the toils of the * yankees that ever took place captain henry actually remained for some time at one of the largest hotels in broadway where he saw many of his old friends who fortunately did not recognise him many and various were the reports of this affair that found circulation but singularly enough it was the united states officers on board the greyhound and not mrs lewis who had to bear the brunt of suspicion though i was really the one to blame i was delighted at being a * by way of a change and could thoroughly appreciate the chagrin of marshal keyes he had prophesied that this was a case of capture with which lord lyons at washington would not dare to interfere as captain henry to use the marshals own words was an officer of the confederate navy and therefore not an englishman to this view of international law i politely assented thinking that if captain henry could only reach a place of safety it would matter very little how the marshal classified him the greyhound was hauled alongside a wharf and an immense concourse of people assembled to witness my coming ashore for it had been telegraphed from new york and then again from the station in boston bay that belle boyd was aboard the prize marshal keyes was most courteous and stated that he had procured a suite of rooms for me at the * house where i was to remain until my fate was definitely settled this he added would be in a very few days when he should either have the supreme pleasure of taking me to canada or the unpleasant task of delivering me over to the tender mercies of the commandant of fort warren the public journals were indefatigable in noticing all my movements the * papers informed their readers that miss belle boyd would attend divine service at the old church during the forenoon the * * gave notice that miss belle boyd in company with her gallant captor whose sympathies no doubt were with the south were seen out driving the day before and as a climax the bulletin boards announced that belle boyd had been sent to the * gaol such were a few of the many * that flew abroad during my stay in the modern athens i had been there about ten days when mr hardinge fearing that the * gaol story might be but the shadow of a coming event proceeded to washington to procure if possible my release having letters of introduction to many of the leading and influential men there he induced them to use their power in my behalf although i was but thirtysix hours * from my mother who had telegraphed to the marshal to allow her to come and see me she was not permitted to do so and none of her letters reached me they being probably intercepted but if letters of affection were thus stopped there were happily other channels than the * department by which friendly comfort could arrive many boston ladies and gentlemen visited me despite the government spies who hovered about my quarters after being kept in suspense for three weeks i forwarded through marshal keyes a letter to * welles secretary of the navy at washington telling him that i really was belle boyd and wished to go to canada that i might communicate with my mother the marshal received a telegram in answer saying that miss boyd and her servants should be escorted beyond the lines into canada and that if i was again caught in the united states or by the united states authorities i should be shot this was on a sunday evening and the marshal advised me to depart with all convenient speed as i had only twentyfour hours grace i promised to start on monday at 5 pm it was impossible to go sooner no trains running through to montreal on sunday the washington republican got possession of my letter to * welles and published it in * with the remark that i was insane and had been on that account released by the government for this verdict of * i thank them if it contributed in any degree to * my sentence there certainly existed sufficient method in my madness to make me appreciate the advantage of having the promised shooting deferred until they caught me again and i felt much obliged to members of congress and others who used their influence in my behalf mr hardinge was sent for early on monday morning by admiral * but he assured me that he would soon return the day passed by however without any sign of him and i began to wonder what had happened when i received the following letter in his handwriting this was written on board the receiving ship ohio its receipt made me feel very unhappy for i feared that circumstantial evidence was against mr hardinge and that ere long he would although perfectly innocent share with poor mr pollard a casemate in fort warren but suddenly the object of my thoughts made his appearance he informed me that the admiral had allowed him and his officers to be paroled until sundown and that he had availed himself of this privilege to come instantly to me mr pollard my * from wilmington against whom the yankee journals were exceedingly * had on the sunday morning been conveyed to fort warren and there immured for the crime of being distasteful to those in authority suffice it to say of mr * subsequent adventures that he was paroled to the city of brooklyn owing to his very bad health since which i have not heard of him the time for my departure from boston came at last the * hotel was left and the railway dpt was reached marshal keyes endeavoured to make himself agreeable and was very busy in getting my baggage checked and my ticket taken before the train moved away the marshal i may add was my courteous companion to the * between canada and the united states with a sad heart i had bidden goodbye to mr hardinge although i trusted that he would soon rejoin me and i enjoyed the delightful prospect of breathing free canadian air yes i should be free free from prison bars and irksome confinement but alas an exile each step towards freedom carried me farther and farther from my native hold whilst did i turn back a heavy penalty awaited me my father dead and my dear mother far away truly i was alone in the wide wide world and i had left one generous heart behind that i knew would miss me sorely arrival at montreal niagara a system of espionage still around me i depart for europe passage across the atlantic arrival in london i meet mr hardinge once more our marriage comments of the press upon arriving at montreal i proceeded to the st lawrence hall captain henry and his wife had proposed that i should join them at niagara but not having heard from them for some time i waited till i could ascertain their exact whereabouts in montreal i met many southern families refugees and many confederate sympathizers the british provinces were at this time a haven of rest for american exiles much as england has always been to the victims of persecution on the european continent i learnt that my friends at niagara were expecting me and accordingly set off to join them the guards * me just before my departure niagara with its sublime scenery i will not attempt to describe we were stopping at the clifton house and from my windows i could plainly see the yankee side of the falls there lower down was the suspension bridge offering almost irresistible temptation to cross from canada to the states we heard on good authority that above a hundred thousand dollars was being expended on the * of captain henry and myself spies were stationed on the bridge to watch and if possible to entrap us should we by chance be foolish enough to venture within their power about a week after our arrival at niagara we noticed at the table * two very * men with thin waxed * la * and who apparently took great seeming interest in the movements of our entire party we watched them closely and were very soon convinced beyond doubt that they were yankee detectives shortly after this discovery we left for quebec it was in the morning about eight oclock that we quitted niagara and proceeded by rail to toronto where we arrived about noon imagine our surprise at finding the fair imitation * whom we had left quietly at the clifton house watching for us at the toronto terminus it transpired that they had seen us going and had quietly entered another car in the same train the canadian journals commented severely upon these fellows and the system of espionage practiced on us whilst we remained in the provinces the brace of detectives accompanied us in the steamer that left toronto a few hours afterwards and which * regularly during the summer months between that place and montreal we noticed that they hovered round eyeing us narrowly and we determined to ascertain whether it was really our party that they were watching when therefore we arrived at our destination captain henry repaired to the * hotel whilst i went to the st lawrence hall in a few hours i learned that one of these fellows had engaged a room at the same hotel where i was stopping and when captain henry called he told me that the other detective had taken up his abode at the * when we resumed our journey to quebec the spies still dogged us captain henry embarked at once for halifax i remained some time in quebec previous to sailing for europe and when at length i quitted the american shores one of the spies endeavoured to secure a passage on board the same vessel the * however * his odious calling insisted that he should be denied this opportunity my trip across the atlantic was on the whole favoured by calm weather and a smooth sea so that i did not suffer much from my enemy the mal de * off the banks of * we were to make use of a * expression tied up for more than a week by the * amid fields and * of ice the latter i had never before seen and i gazed upon their majestic grandeur with feelings of awe and amazement so near at times did we pass them that it is no wonder that i felt somewhat nervous for had we struck it would have been instantaneous death to us all while crossing the banks we encountered a fearful storm and for one entire night the steamer rolled and plunged with the force of the waves like some living creature it was midnight on the ocean and a storm was on the deep but the storm in our case though violent did not last long more moderate weather soon came and the passengers felt greatly relieved when after entering english waters and passing up channel and my feet touched the ground once more i thanked god for our safety i remember for a long time after in imagination i could hear the * * of the * the creaking of blocks the flapping of sails the hoarse uncouth cries of the sailors and the clear distinct voices of the captain and his officers arrived in liverpool i remained there for some days at the washington hotel and then proceeded to london i soon ascertained the address of mr * the confederate commercial agent to whom i had had letters of introduction from the secretary of state i reported to the confederate states commissioner that the despatches intrusted to me at wilmington had been destroyed when the greyhound was overhauled that they might not fall into our enemys hands this report terminated belle * connection with the southern government for the time being so from the scene where death and anguish reign and vice and folly * with blood the plain i turn mr * gave me a letter that had been left with him until i should reach london upon opening it i found that it was from mr hardinge informing me that he had come to england but not being able to learn my whereabouts had proceeded to paris in the faint hope of finding me there i was deeply touched at this new proof of his honest attachment and immediately telegraphed a message to him stating where he would find me in london gentle reader you can perhaps imagine for yourself how joyful was our meeting and in what manner a * which had in it much of romance was at length happily terminated our marriage took place on august 25th 1864 and journalists were pleased to treat the world to some portions of the romance in which we had taken part the english press was friendly in its tone but certain yankee editors became marvellously indignant at the news and even now

in the federal naval service the marriage attracted to the church a considerable number of english and american sympathizers in the cause of the south anxious to see the lady whose heroism has made her name so famous and to witness the result of her last captivity the making captive of the federal officer under whose guard she was again being conveyed to prison miss boyd it will be remembered is the virginian lady who during the terrible scenes enacted in the valley of the shenandoah rendered such essential service to general stonewall jackson by procuring for him information of great value as regards the position and condition of the northern forces and who signalized her devotion to the cause of her country by so many other services capture and imprisonment did not damp her adventurous and patriotic * as she was twice immured once for seven months and once for ten months she was again seized and while on board a federal vessel on her way to the north made the acquaintance of lieutenant hardinge with whom having crossed the atlantic she has entered into the bonds of matrimony mr hardinge needs no excuse for the step he has taken in * his allegiance to the federal cause and

his southern sympathies were notorious in the north where it was well known that he had long tendered his resignation which mr secretary welles refused to accept and thus he was forced to continue in a service which he would gladly have renounced long since though more than suspected of southern sympathies he kept his word when he promised the executive of the federal navy that the name he bore a name which had descended to him from a long line of ancestors in great britain and america should not be disgraced and proved his readiness to perform his duty on many occasions the bride was attended to the altar by mrs edward robinson harvey the bridegroom by mr henry howard barber and the marriage service was read by the rev mr * of st jamess chapel in a manner which deeply impressed all present

who expressed their acknowledgments to the many friends they had found in this country the toast of the queen was afterwards given by captain fearn who assured the english portion of his hearers that her majesty was greatly revered in all parts of the southern states of america an assertion which was most warmly corroborated by all present who were qualified to speak from experience president

sleep here however but went over to my mothers residence in brooklyn almost immediately gaining admittance to the house and being as you may suppose thoroughly * with its internal arrangements i mounted softly on tiptoe to my parents room and entered my father aroused by the noise i made for floors and doors will invariably * at such times called out as i opened the door who is that martin i replied for i wished to surprise them as much as possible as soon as i had lit the gas i turned upon them and said mother how do you do for the moment she was struck dumb with astonishment but the next she was in my arms pressing me to her heart as only a mother can who loves her son devotedly we sat for a long time conversing upon many topics my wife my future prospects c about three in the morning however i left her and retired to my brothers room who was at the time absent in boston on business i do not know why it was but i felt like a stranger in a strange land for my heart was with you over the ocean in * england all the rest of the night i sat framing a letter to you and it was late in the morning just as the faint glimmering streaks of dawn were flashing up from the east and the distant hum of the city was becoming more and more audible that i threw myself tired weary and heartsick on the bed and fell asleep to dream of you sleep did i say * the sleep that the dog enjoys in his kennel i think it was about nine in the morning when my mother awakened me i sprang to my feet and hurriedly completing my toilette descended and entered the diningroom there was very little said a * breakfast one of those dismal * where death seems to reign supreme with me it was soon over and that same night i was en route for baltimore bound to martinsburg which i reached after much delay and detention after having enjoyed the nervous excitement of running off the track only twice about # in the evening here i was subjected with the rest of the passengers to a strict examination by the provostmarshal of my passes and * but finally after a quarter of an hours delay i was allowed to go on after passing several sentries and two * i at length found myself at your mothers house i did not announce my name to any one but one of the girls rushed up to me and after gazing intently at me for a moment flew out of the room whilst i was revolving over in my mind this inexplicable to me scene she returned and half laughing half in doubt said * miss belles husband isnt you i of course assured her that i was she again disappeared but returned accompanied by the whole sable household who crowding round about me welcomed me to my home inquiring affectionately after you and evidently much disappointed at not finding that you were with me greatly to my chagrin your mother and sister were at * about ten miles distant but mrs g who could not help shedding tears when she knew who i was welcomed me as a son all that evening we sat conversing together and when at last i retired to sleep it was in your own room and as i entered in at the door i uncovered my head and thought of you this was your room here you had been held a prisoner and had suffered the torture of an agonizing doubt as to your fate here lay your books just as you had left them writings quotations everything to remind me of you was here and i do not know how long a time i should have stood gazing about me in silence had it not been for my reverie being disturbed by the little negro servant who broke the silence by saying no ones ever sleep in dis room since * belle been gone missus says youre de only person as should so when i retired to bed that night and jim had been dismissed from further attendance upon me i lay for a long time thinking looking into the fire that glimmered and glared about the room * you here there and everywhere about the chamber and thinking of you sadly far away from me in england the exile lonely and sad about midnight i fell asleep and was only aroused from my slumbers late the next morning by jim who was making the fire when i had finished dressing i sat down near the fireplace i hardly know what persuaded me to do so but if you will recollect on the evening that we parted from one another you placed upon my finger a small * ring telling me that there was a peculiar charm attached to it viz of * the wearer when in danger by dropping or being taken off without thinking i did the latter now we sailors are somewhat addicted to superstition and i must confess that i felt a nervous apprehension about myself which did not leave me despite the * that i made to allay my fears i told mrs g of the circumstance when i met her at breakfast and she laughed at my credulity but so firmly was i impressed with the belief that i already began to feel that i was doomed a marked man and i was at halfpast five having previously procured a pass i left for baltimore but at monocacy station i was judge of my surprise arrested and kept confined all night under guard as a deserter as a prisoner i was of course searched but finding nothing upon me the officer commanding told me that i might retire for the night where i asked oh on the floor by all means was the response accompanied with a * the next day at my earnest entreaty i was sent to point of rocks where i was treated more like a dog than a human being but fortunately for myself i was sent on to harpers ferry under a guard of irish * soldiers who were far kinder to me than their officers during the journey they gave me a long history of their wrongs asserting upon oath that they had been entrapped by the * tongues of federal agents in ireland who had given them gold and promised them a farm and two hundred pounds apiece more in gold upon their arrival in the united states if they would only * for the purpose of * the land out west upon their arrival in new york however they were locked up as prisoners not allowed to see any one and were only after an imprisonment of over three weeks set free their liberty having been purchased by their becoming federal soldiers they were also promised eight hundred dollars bounty and three months furlough which they had never to this day received although they had applied for it from time to time for no sooner had they taken the oath of allegiance than they were sent to the front at the conclusion of this narration which they swore by the holy * was truth and nothing more or less one of them informed me that they had orders to shoot me if i was * to them even but we wont do it me bye they * and if * says the word were yer * to cut over the border with * this however was an utter impossibility for the country was full of yankee cavalry looking after mosby and his men so i declined their proffered kindness much to their astonishment and fright for they begged me for the love of heaven not to expose them this i faithfully promised and kept and as i bade them good day just before i was conducted into the presence of general * one of them remarked to me sotto voce be my * young fellow its too bad to see ye in this condition when ye ought to be afther * into a saddle when ushered into general * room the general a grizzly grayhaired bearded man scanned me closely for a short time after enduring this as long at least as my patience could stand it i said is there anything remarkable about me or that you admire yes sir your duplicity duplicity i reiterated vaguely seemingly unconscious of the meaning of the word yes sir duplicity you are a spy and i interrupted him somewhat sharply but recollected myself and held my tongue where are your papers passes despatches he asked angrily papers i have none except the new york * and the world of yesterday despatches excuse me did you say despatches yes sir despatches ill save you a * i remarked savagely i have none as for my passes they are there pointing to a formidable looking official document that had been brought on with me ugh was the rejoinder to this lieutenant adams just then made his appearance and a very nice and gentlemanly fellow he was too in striking contrast with the general was his adjutant the lieutenant youre the husband of miss belle boyd and you ought to be hung by the way we hung one today didnt we adjutant what are you going to do hang you if you cant prove your innocence send you to washington perhaps that will do sir and i left the room in a few moments lieutenant adams came out and said and very kindly too now mr hardinge well go and get something to eat and if i can manage it you shall sleep elsewhere than in a guardhouse come into my office for a short time until i write a letter and then we will go thanking him for his proffered hospitality i entered the room and seated myself near the fire for it was a rainy day and very disagreeable and listened with feelings of horror and disgust to the brutal boasts of a * provostmarshal i wish i could recollect his name for the sake of humanity who boasted of having enacted the part of jack ketch to a confederate soldier of whites battalion that very day remarking by didnt the fellow jump when the rope broke and he added heres a piece of the rope young fellow wouldnt you like to swing not with you at least for a * i said and i did not attempt to suppress my disgust from appearing d you ill give you a double allowance of dancing on nothing if i do was the reply shortly after this light and entertaining conversation lieutenant adams and myself left them and after a good meal and a short tour about the town we once more entered his office but this time i did not stay long for although lieutenant adams did all in his power to keep me from the guardhouse to that delectable place i went under the tender auspices of the provost who endeavoured to * me with stories of men that he had hung as for sleeping there it was out of the question a terrific fire roared and blazed up the chimney flinging its heat into a room whose * might have been ten feet by twelve in this space were packed some twenty steaming drunken soldiers and citizens and add to this the fact that other animals besides rats and mice were at play in the room i think you will admit that i was at least uncomfortable the next morning at a later hour i was allowed to proceed under guard to a very * cellar rejoicing in the name of a restaurant where i succeeded in getting some stale oysters and bean coffee having finished this delectable breakfast i was again reminded that i was a prisoner in the yankees hands by the sentinel who carried in addition to his gun a watch and who * glanced at it remarking as he did so times up any news from the front i ventured to remark no is mosby in the neighbourhood i * so how often do the trains go * in the course of a day twice corporal i said i am quite an amateur in my way come you have excited my curiosity tell me honestly now what you are for you are the only one of the many soldiers that i have met in my intercourse with the tribe for the last three or four days who is rightly entitled to the name he evidently felt flattered for it was the open sesame of his tongue and he flatly informed me that he was a deserter from the guards who had been stationed in canada and i wish to the devil i was back out of the dirty * set that ive got into they say birds of a feather flock together but im if i am a bird of their * our conversation was brought to a close at this period by the door of the guardhouse once more being closed upon me for want of better amusement i stood watching the farmers or their wives from the country round who came to procure the necessary passes to return to their homes again and i must confess that the brutal remarks that accompanied the pass or oftener its refusal were enough to make the blood of any father brother or son boil with indignation at 5 pm just as i was beginning to despair of ever being sent away from harpers ferry a detective came to me and said all humbug youre the chap are yer come on to this tender appeal i merely said i am ready lead on as i passed out he significantly pointed to a * that was buckled to his side and remarked none o yer * i could not but help laughing in the fellows face and i hardly know what would have been the finale if lieutenant adams who was passing in at that moment had not said treat him like a gentleman calling him by his name and it is to this remark that i no doubt am indebted for the little kindnesses i received on my way to washington we arrived in washington about midnight and the detective having visited the * office i was relieved of his further attendance upon me and at 1 pm on sunday morning i was consigned to a horrible hole known as the forrest hall filled with everything that was infamous low and degraded forrest hall a lesson on prison luxury the torture close packing the neutral ground a goodnatured sentry an aristocrat the * a tough contest homage to the victor an honour declined the carroll prison * the walls piety hall unpleasant tortures the colonel forrest hall or as it is somewhat significantly designated by the fellows who board here at the governments expense the last ditch was without exception the most fearful realization of a prison that it was my misfortune ever to have anything to do with not that i would have you for one moment suppose that i am familiar with a * residence but i have mentioned it merely from the fact that until i was thus thoroughly convinced to the contrary i had always entertained the belief that in this age of improvements and luxury prisons had been converted by science into luxuriously improvised hotels watering places where * and * retire for a while to recruit their wasting energies and in this respect i have always entertained the belief that in america they know how to manage these things better than in europe you know but this foretaste of st giles and billingsgate dispelled and effectively too any highly coloured and very romantic ideas that i had conceived of prison luxury and the * * with which i had in fancy painted such residences gave way to a most sombre picture edged with black that nearly * me as i walked gravely * and * picking my way daintily through dirty groups of sleeping men or * of * with which the floor of this place was saturated situated in georgetown on the suburbs of the city of washington forrest hall was before the commencement of this devilish struggle used as a place of public entertainment where balls and suppers were held or given a large * room it had nothing of beauty to recommend it even then much less at the present day when its walls are defaced with unseemly pictures vulgar writings or * plaster and even in its * days it was such a room that one felt however warm one may have been chilled upon entering four immense windows reaching from the top almost to the bottom bound with iron looked forth upon the street but none of us ever presumed to gaze from them for orders were given to shoot dead the audacious wretch who should thus defy the laws four others looked out upon what was known as the promenade a small enclosure where we were allowed to walk for half an hour daily one feature of this yard as it was also called was the hose an instrument of torture which was applied to suspects who were supposed to be deserters from the united states army whether it was so or not it was almost impossible to say the manner of torturing the unfortunate man was after the most approved method of yankee invention and ingenuity you may doubtless somewhere have read of the prisoner who was tortured by being fastened in an immovable position beneath a * that permitted to escape every second one drop of water which fell always in one spot upon the forehead producing a most fearful torture resulting eventually in insanity well although it was not exactly the same thing nevertheless it approached it very nearly for in this instance the victim was made to stand bound securely to a post whilst a steady stream of water whose force was thirty pounds to an inch square was played upon the small of the back it was often the case that the victim unable to endure the torture would guilty or not give in and the consequence was that the authorities having witnessed the acknowledgment of his crime would * him in an exhausted state back to the hall to be led out to execution or conducted to the penitentiary to which he would be sentenced for a lifetime again some more obdurate and stubborn would remain firm and unyielding however fearful the torture until fainting would ensue or the medical attendant who waited in person and watched closely the victims wrist would say enough when he would be carried back to the room only to be brought forth to endure the same torture when he had sufficiently * his energies to be able to appear once more but to revert once more to forrest hall in a space not more than seventyfive feet square were crowded together over five hundred dirty ragged and filthy wretches of all conditions and colour who had been immured here for many months with the consoling remark your case will be attended to the dirt that filled the floor was something awful to reflect upon and here they were obliged to live here sleep a space large enough for the promenade of the guards who were relieved at the end of every four hours was reserved for them and whoever the poor wretch was that dared to invade the neutral ground for such it was called by the residents he was shot like a dog for his daring murdered coolly and deliberately right over the entrance to this room was a place called the lodge here a corporal and three or four sentries are placed with the same humane orders to execute relative to the shedding of human blood the place literally swarmed with vermin and the air is corrupt and vile with * that are at least to be moderate in ones language disgusting and * in the extreme it was early on a sunday morning that i entered this sink after having undergone a rigid examination of my person at the hands of the officers who were quartered at the hall this done i was handed over to a sergeant and conducted by him to the room that i have endeavoured to describe to you above it was so late that fortunately for me only some nine or ten out of the whole number that lay huddled together on the floor were awake one or two stared at me for a short time but went on again with their play at cards a sentry was once more my friend in this place he pitied me i was glad to have any ones pity even for i felt almost like the desperate suicide at times and the future of my life was enveloped in gloom so dark and obscure that it was in vain that i attempted to penetrate it having passed the spot where i was standing wrapped up in my own thoughts he stopped suddenly and said you surely are not a deserter sir you have surmised correctly i replied what are you doing here then he added with some surprise that is just what i should like to know myself and if you will inform me i shall thank you for the information an i suppose you are one of those fellows we call political prisoners and if you are by jove theres plenty more of your same * that would like to have the same information youre after wanting and he resumed his beat in a short time he came to me and said why dont you sleep sleep i said in astonishment he grinned at the manner in which i spoke the word sleep and said by * only be a * skeleton of you in the morning then i will try to fancy myself on the * for four hours and i commenced to promenade up and down with the sentry and it was not until late the next morning that i gave up and was forced to sit down but i first took my handkerchief and brushed away the dirt on the floor as well as i could before i did so as the morning wore on apace the rascals who by this time were thoroughly awake came and stared at me or asked me questions of myself business c to the former i affected a perfect indifference but to the latter i kept my tongue which brought down innumerable * blessings from these fellows who saw in me as they did not abstain from informing their comrades a aristocrat * silence for fear they became bolder one of them a * * scoundrel knocked my hat off picking it up i replaced it on my head without apparently noticing the offender growing bolder the cries of toss him toss the swell * * him * him were raised on all sides a blanket was getting stretched for my special benefit and i determined to act * near the stove was a goodly * stick of wood that was used for supporting the door when opened i determined to get possession of it so i walked up quietly and gaining possession of the instrument that was soon to decide my fate i retreated to a corner and waited for them it was not long a party advanced and then halted when the * man who was known as the * a name that he had won from his prowess in tearing the eyes from out the * of others came as near as was * safe for i swung the stick defiantly as he advanced and said now young un if yer dont give in ill bite yer nose off come now are yer goin to to his tender and merciful intentions as regarded my nose i paid no attention oh yer aint * to then are yer well ill have a * breakfast by this morning at any rate come on * i only remember one thing until the whole affair was over and this is the picture the * and his second advancing as i swung my trusty weapon in a circle about me the pointed edge of the stick cutting into the bridge of the * nose and effectually closing an eye for him and the remaining force of the blow being received by his second on the temple who fell like a lump of lead by his leader then it was that i sprang forward slashing right and left as i went but there was no necessity to do murder for they gave way before me and the sentry who had been watching the battle received me with the remark as i gained his side panting from the exertion by if i hadnt have liked you id have shot you for mutiny but you did that well they wont trouble you any more ill bet nor did they on the contrary a select committee to my great surprise waited upon me about 10 am and their * informed me that by a unanimous vote i had been chosen their president and if i would accept the leadership of the owls it was at my command to their astonishment i refused them but not wishing to make them my enemies for i had no idea how long i was to remain here i did so as politely as possible fortunately for me in the afternoon i was sent for and under guard i was conveyed to the provostmarshals office in washington city here i was kept for over an hour in a place that was * off for rebels a ferocious looking aspirant for military honours guarding me the while several of the clerks who had ascertained from their superior who i was attempted to converse with me but in this they failed most decidedly shortly after this i was taken under the surveillance of captain and four of his * to the old capitol on my way to that place i was kindly permitted to partake of some food the first that i had eaten for over twentyfour hours at * and to the proprietor of that place i was indebted for much attention i then resumed my journey once more after running a * so to speak of the curious * for the churches were fast pouring forth their inmates upon the street and the terrific fire of conversation from the captain which was by far the worst torture i had to endure on my arrival at the old capitol i was welcomed by a onearmed lieutenant who had seen * but when he did not say and whom i ascertained to belong to that body of men known as the invalid corps i was ordered to sit down and after a running fire of questions i was sent off to the carroll prison under the guard of two soldiers i was not long in reaching it for the political bastile is situated not far from its prototype the old capitol i was received by the * who having registered my name age occupation height business ancestry c was good enough to relieve me of some money not all for i had been deprived of most by the gallant knights of the greenwood through whose merciless fingers i did not pass * and who certainly have a taking way about them a diminutive penknife which was also captured although i begged to retain it as a favour was refused on the plea that i might injure myself this over i was conducted to room no 35 to keep company with a spy and a blockade runner on its walls rudely executed with a piece of charred wood i wrote our names one day and drew above them the english and confederate flags which coming under notice of the sentinel outside drew down upon my devoted head a whole mouthful of curses loud and deep some * a previous inmate of this room had written a la jack * over the door the following very curious misnomer piety hall piety hall is certainly a most deplorable spot four * filled with bedding of a most suspicious character occupy onethird of the space i very foolishly slept in one of these beds as they are designated here but i can assure you that i regretted it exceedingly long before morning it was almost an utter impossibility to tell the time correctly in this place for the window that opened on a passageway without is so completely enclosed with the cell that has evidently been added to the building since the commencement of the war and which is reserved exclusively for close confinement that it is not until a very late hour in the forenoon that daylight * us with its presence at all a stove in the centre of the room is used by us to cook whatever we choose to buy from the * mr * who has had the monopoly of this prison since the beginning of the rebellion the morning after my arrival at the carroll in company with the blockaderunner i descended into the yard when after refreshing myself with a hearty wash at the * i entered the salle manger for my breakfast i could eat nothing the coffee is a mixture of but i will not attempt to describe it whilst the hard tack as the old inmates call it is the * kind of flour that was ever baked and honoured with the * of biscuit so i walked out into the yard and strolled listlessly about wondering as prisoners will when i should be released about 11 am i again went up to my room and received from the sentinel a reprimand for remaining below in the yard accompanied with the remark that if i didnt mind my eye id have old wood after me one of my * said what was that old fool saying i repeated the above remark to him when they both laughed derisively and said dont you believe all they tell you if you do you will have a * of * and a troublesome indigestion the second day after my arrival the colonel entered the room and said ho ho here we are so youre the husband of the famous belle boyd are you well we havent got her but weve got her husband thats next to it and before i had time to reply he was out of the room and this was the way that i first made the acquaintance of william p wood the superintendent of the old capitol and carroll journal continued letter to mr stanton visit from judge turner room 25 an introduction in due form pleasant society a dinner at last good advice a clandestine communication false alarm that reminds me of a good story a massachusetts officer in trouble the * sentence an imprisoned wife and child blockaderunning 5th december having procured some paper from the sutler i wrote to mr stanton with a simple statement of my case this document i forwarded to judge turner who attends to all the cases of the prisoners held here that gentleman after the expiration of three days sent for me and having asked me in the presence of witnesses if i had written it to which i answered in the affirmative then swore me as to the truthfulness of it and dismissed me from his awful presence with the assurance that he would attend to it in the proper course of time i shall not readily forget my introduction to the inmates of rooms 25 and 26 to which i was now transferred i was introduced into my new quarters by captain mark t gentlemen he said allow me to introduce to this select and distinguished company lieutenant s * hardinge formerly of the united states navy now of england but just at present boarding with the freemen of the city at the old carroll prison a momentary pause allow me sir captain * of pennsylvania a * sir brought here not for an attempt to counterfeit himself but for the crime of * united states greenbacks and buying southern horses with them mr parker sir as i was somewhat unceremoniously pushed round in front of him a blacksmith not of * but of the city of brotherly love a * by trade he was brought up at the forge and how could such an apt scholar end otherwise than in * the united states government ah h familiarly two distinguished colonels from new york charged with ballotbox * and having the presumption to vote for mcclellan a bad case sir i assure you as they the authorities keep putting their trial off for further evidence which they cannot procure however they have an idea that they are * and so they intend to keep them here ah sir this is a glorious country nothing like it in fact a country whose institutions one ought to esteem for they hang you first and try you afterwards captain t having finished his somewhat lengthy harangue i ventured to remark and what sir may i ask is your crime ah mine said he * complacently is nothing but as out of nothing came something i presume theyll make it out of my case here the introduction suddenly ceased for dinner being announced every one rushed for a seat and devoured somewhat * it must be confessed everything excepting what was not * upon the table an example which i was not slow to imitate for it had been over two weeks since i had the good fortune to get a mouthful of anything really * december 7th i woke up very early this morning and having dressed myself strolled about the yard below for a while in conversation with two or three others incarcerated here for nothing at least that is the invariable answer by way of an explanation of this one of them said to me it dont do mr h to know too much in a place like this you are a new * let me advise you to ask no questions and answer fewer i dont mean to say there are spies here but i wouldnt trust my own father in here and having finished his sentence he left me i can see the ladies in the different rooms in that portion of the building devoted to them gazing down through their iron bars into the yard upon the prisoners who are allowed to walk about here at stated intervals i accomplished the prison feat of exchanging notes with a * prisoner an exploit which was executed when the * sentry had his back turned upon us and which would have been punished with bread and water in the guardhouse for fortyeight hours had it been discovered it is quite worthy of notice that one seems to take an indescribable pleasure in eluding the vigilance of the sentries at all times not so much for any particular reason but merely for the purpose of passing away the time and proving that such a thing can be done in spite of the rules and regulations captain marsh left room 26 today he had been prisoner here for some time but eventually was released without a trial or any satisfaction being accorded to him his arrest was very ingeniously managed secretary stanton ordering him to report for examination for colonel at washington captain m was at the front ie before richmond when he received this mandate but judge of his surprise when upon his arrival instead of being promoted he was ordered to the carroll and detained there december 9th this evening as we were seated conversing or playing cards for want of some better occupation we were somewhat startled by the cry of officer of the keys corporal of the guard post no 7 and almost simultaneously with it came the report of a musket that sent * and every one else to their feet officers and men rushed to their different stations and the general belief for the moment was that some one had been shot in attempting to escape such however was not the case it proving to be only the accidental discharge of a * through the carelessness of a sentinel who had just come off post and was placing his piece in the rack when it fell the jar causing it to go off the ball passed * through the floor going through a bed in 26 but fortunately without wounding its inmate this is not the first instance of this kind that has occurred said colonel wood who at that time was playing inspector of the rooms that reminds me of a good story the good story was as follows what became of him asked one of his audience why him he died in the hospital several days afterwards december 11th a captain in the massachusetts 8th was sent into 26 today he had been arrested and imprisoned in the baltimore gaol for six weeks in about an hour after his appearance amongst us he was ordered out and put into close confinement captain * an incarcerated prisoner in 26 received the news of his sentence of courtmartial through the star of this evening he was convicted of passing counterfeit money and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in the clinton prison new jersey has been * the service and * from holding any office of honour trust and profit under the united states government and to pay a fine of 5000 this latter item fortunately for him is in greenbacks he is a * * brawny looking man with black eyes and hair and has lost a finger in the service of the union i watched his countenance closely as his eyes met the paragraph containing his sentence every one had seen it but none cared to break the intelligence he gave a sudden spasmodic start and sat for as much as ten minutes gazing at it how he must have felt inwardly at that time none can know but himself it made one feel cold and nervous to see him sit there so quietly ten years a lifetime for him his hopes for the future were blighted farewell for him to all lifes charms he is dead henceforth and for ever to the world i would not have been in his place for thousands there he sat without moving and room 26 was very quiet for the occupants of it were looking at him he evidently and suddenly became aware of this fact and looking up from the fatal star he said im in for it theyve done for me well ten years imprisonment humph and he laughed im glad of that ill get out sooner then he got up and walked out of the room and we all of us somehow felt relieved when he had gone december 15th glancing up at the windows of room # i saw this afternoon whilst walking up and down the yard a poor little child a girl about four years old and standing close beside her was her mother she clasped the iron bars of the window with childish glee and did not seem to be aware that the cold repelling touch of the iron that encircled her present abode was that of prison bars that held her captive from the outer world her merry little laugh was truly painful to listen to aunt lizzie was in the * at this time so i asked her who it was who dat lady massa dats mrs k what is her crime i asked oh her husband was * and she * at his escape out * de country so they arrested her an now shes * feared that hell * * up in her place december 17th the ladies in room 42 sent me a note smuggled by in which they thanked me for presents at different times of wine and delicacies for the table that i had procured for i have followed the business of blockade runner very successfully since i have been in here no matter if i have * for an attendant outside in that dashing and very exciting business december 20th i cannot imagine why i can hear no news of you mr wood says you are very foolish mr h to fret everything is fair in love and war so i am forced to construe out of the latter portion of his sentence that others are employed in reading my letters what a jolly thing military surveillance is introduced to the ladies ward colonel wood and his * interview with judge turner shermans officers in georgia a hideous outrage christmas in prison homesick a drunken sentry another visit to the ladies the young girls sick bed a rough prison carol december 21st i was introduced to the ladies in 42 today and spent a very pleasant halfhour in their society and so quickly did the time slip away that i was only reminded that the thirty minutes were gone by the officer of the keys who looking at his watch said times up mrs colonel m spoke of you and said that you were undeniably the pet of the confederacy and would always be looked upon as its child as long as the confederacy existed and had a name december 23rd no signs of my being released yet mrs colonel m remarked and in the presence of mr wood today i have material enough of bastile life as exemplified in my treatment here for a book mrs m said wood and he laughed no one will ever be able to write a truthful account of the capitol and carroll prisons i have a * where i put everything that occurs of note within these walls if published it would equal any of reynolds novels of the tower of london then he spoke of mrs horns i did that girl an injustice by she was no traitor to the south it was i who got the papers that condemned her friends without her knowledge and consent and mrs g when she went to richmond ruined and completely crushed her turning to mrs colonel m he added you may believe me or not but mrs g used to write me notes until i fairly got sick of her and afterwards she came out with a vengeance against me but as i rather glory in my origin it didnt hurt me december 24th my poor motherinlaw in a letter to me today says what have i done a weak defenseless woman weighed down with sorrow and care that that they will not permit me to come on to washington and see you had an interview with judge turner in the afternoon judge turner * his back to the fire hat over his eyes probably from very shame a cigar in his mouth good morning mr h good afternoon sir your business mr h this sir can you inform me when i am to be released oh one of these days are there any charges against me none sir that is perhaps there may be then why am i held prisoner here because it pleases the government ah but do you call it justice judge turner frowning be very careful what you say sir you are held here because it pleases mr stanton besides your wife wont destroy any more of our army than she has done mr h if you are held as a hostage and mr stanton has an affectionate regard for your future welfare what could i do i was like the mouse a prisoner in the cage and at the mercy of the lion i repeat my question i said is it justice justice or not said that worthy judge we keep you here to make a patriot of you mr m told me today two stories one of them was of shermans march through georgia mrs m was tied to her chair and * her clothes first being stripped to her waist leather * were used for the purpose a negro informed the officer that her husband had buried 20000 in gold and that she was aware of its hidingplace so finding that threats could not * the secret they used force as she stood there writhing in her agony she appealed to the fellow who was a * for mercy but the * scoundrels only reply was dn you tell us where the gold is hid and ill let you up but this she could not do and the infuriated wretches continued until she fainted and the brutes then left her the other story was this and not the less worthy of comment as it came from the lips of a lady both in position as regarded her standing in society and in wealth and accomplishments i have no reason to urge you not to publish it to the world near the rio grande a mrs lived quietly and undisturbed though the civil war raged about her until a band of these patriots for the restoration of the union took possession of the place for a few hours several of them entered her house in the * and ascended to her room where she lay sick with rheumatism and unable to move her servant a young * who was waiting upon her concealed herself in the bed but she was dragged from her hidingplace and these less than men rendered furious with drink and in the presence of the agonized and terrified lady and in spite of her protestations and appeals for mercy committed upon the unhappy girl the worst of outrages christmas eve about nine pm i sat down to a game of cards and i am sorry to say that it lasted far into the morning sunday morning and christmas too but you must excuse me for you know that i was a prisoner i retired to my bed about four am and fell asleep almost immediately waking up with the winter sun streaming into my face unwell and lowspirited in our room 25 hangs suspended from the ceiling an evergreen wreath with two figures * from it the only thing here in this dismal place to recall to ones mind christmas save that the bells are already beginning to ring out merrily no greetings from those you love meet your ears some few bid you merry christmas as you pass them by but the look which accompanies it is low and melancholy betokening that the one who gives the gods greeting says so mechanically eggnog has already commenced to flow freely in our room mr * shop is much * this morning for whiskey and * the latter drink decidedly * and a late importation i should judge eggs and other necessaries that he * forth for money to us a glorious day yet every one is downhearted i chew the bitter * of reflection as i smoke my cigar many of my fellowprisoners have already drowned their sorrows in drink an occasional maudlin carol comes from the barred window of some caged bird as the day wears on apace so does the state of intoxication increase the sentries are maudlin the prisoners noisy or sullen as the liquor which they have drunk may affect them several are insulting without drunken men and women reel through the streets why should i grumble after all there is misery and sorrow without in this world as well as within i have not smiled today but two or three times my eyes have been filled with tears for i have been thinking of you belle a stranger in a strange land waiting sad and lonely for my return so the day creeps slowly along the sentries are drunk and many of the prisoners are dozing off the effects of whiskey made up of * and other slow * a few moments ago one of the sentries asserted his authority with me sentry intoxicated say where in the are you going to crossing his gun before me at the same moment are you addressing your conversation to me i ask i dont want none of your * get back into that room or ill shoot you i could stand this no longer but i folded my arms and looking him straight in the eyes i said i am unarmed shoot if you dare but by heaven if you miss me i shall not you the muzzle of his piece dropped and as i walk away three cheers are given for me by the prisoners who were witnesses of the affair several of the inmates of carroll prison have been locked up in their rooms for being noisy cheering for jeff davis and the southern confederacy and groaning for sherman and governor brown of georgia dinner is announced at last goose and turkey and * for room 26 * and bread for the other prisoners the former dinner passed off in silence every mouthful one takes seems like lead nobody laughs or smiles some few curse and swear the dinner is over at the latter every one * * or swears and leaves the room the salle manger of the carroll prison chewing by way of dessert hard tack i ask permission to see the ladies in 42 wood is gracious today and the request is granted and for a few brief minutes i feel differently suddenly with a bang the door is flung open in rushes wood utterly regardless of the poor sick girl who lies writhing with pain upon her bed the same bed in which you slept in the same room and fancy made me always picture you as the sufferer as you suffered here months before and * out in his loudest tones as he * upon * then off before you are quite sure that you have not made up your mind to knock him down or show him the door as i stood in no 42 this afternoon despite myself the tears sprang to my eyes there on the bed lay poor miss mollie mcdonough groaning and moaning with pain sick and delirious for close imprisonment had with its iron grasp taken hold upon her delicate frame and after a brief struggle she had succumbed before it the doctor says she must be removed whispers mrs colonel m to me why then is it not done i rejoin because that renegade virginian refuses to let it be done poor mollie i thought of you belle as i gazed upon her this evening and the blood rushed to my temples and i clenched my hands in silent wrath mrs colonel m tells me that wood rushed into the room this morning and yelled out at the top of his voice * mollie ive got your father a prisoner she gave one shriek and cried out in her agony my god what will become of my poor mother now pretty scene pretty language was that to be used in a sick girls room mrs colonel m who had stood by a silent witness of the scene said to mr wood for gods sake sir do you want to finish your work by killing her madam you cant ride a high horse here no sir said mrs m i leave that for mr wood to do bang went the door and he was gone and in a few minutes he returned with mr mcdonough it was at * in the evening i left for room 25 where colonel wood was swearing as usual and holding forth upon some argument that was * the attention of a crowd of * lying on the beds in every conceivable position a choice party for sunday evening and in their intercourse with one another oaths made up what their ideas lacked in the formation of their sentiments finally wood sang a song give him his due he sang it well and with feeling then he left us for which i fervently thanked heaven the moment that he went out singing commenced every one who could not sing was compelled to make a speech and in this manner we managed to pass the time away quickly when it came to my turn to sing i gave them the following verses which i had hastily written for the occasion and as i went on one by one the members who formed the company of rooms 25 aloud 26 joined in the strain until every one who could sing had done their part to swell the volume of song and at its conclusion long applause greeted me from all sides the following was the song sung to the tune of god save the queen land of the pilgrims pride land where our fathers died thy doom is read from every hill and glen in lowland marsh and * thy fate is written there thy glory fled ambition holds her sway injustice rules the day save us o god spies paid by those who reign * the * fame and terror reigns supreme help us good lord arise ye men who dare who for your rights do care uphold the laws uphold them as they were not as at present are prove freemen as of yore uphold your cause what are ye silent still have ye no manly will to battle them yes yes ye will ye come i hear the fife and drum * to * increasing hum of fearless men strike for the old times gone strike for your slaughtered sons and honour fled down with the feudal horde who * and goad with prison debt and sword and * the dead you know that i do not claim to be a poet so that should you in glancing over these scraps have your attention directed for a moment to their errors forbear if you please from laughing at them and recollect that they were thrown off hastily in my prison home and served to while away a few heavy moments on christmas evening mr * journal continued a visit from my parents the order for removal on the march do you know belle boyd an abrupt introduction arrival in philadelphia dismal night quarters an unpleasant ordeal the menagerie en route for wilmington an * march the osceola fort delaware fresh fish miss belle * husband new years eve turned cook * sharp practice on the 30th day of december as i was busily engaged in writing mr wilson the superintendent called me down into the office to see my father and mother who had come on from new york to visit me previous to their coming to the old carroll they had gone to secretary stanton to procure the necessary pass that gentleman expressed himself astonished at their coming but after some considerable delay having ascertained that the purport of their visit was purely such an one as two fond parents would be supposed to pay their son in * vile gave them the necessary order without which they could not have seen me whilst we were seated together conversing upon various topics mr wilson entered the room and said addressing his remarks to me mr hardinge you must get ready sir for what i said is it then indeed true that i am to be sent to fort delaware i presume so sir was the reply to my inquiry of course i was powerless to do aught for myself to prevent it the scene that ensued was very affecting my poor mother wept bitterly and unable to endure it unmoved any longer i hastily quitted the room whilst engaged in packing together what few articles of clothing i possessed i do not imagine i was more than five minutes about it i was again interrupted by mr wilson with come sir but i have not got my things together yet i said well if you havent there aint no time to spare so come along with you seeing no possible way of obtaining a brief respite i hastily bid adieu to those of my * who were about me and taking my few clothes i followed my * downstairs my poor mother again saw me she was still weeping and at times sobbed audibly near her my father stood looking at me sadly my mother pressed forward and flung her arms round my neck saying as she did so god bless you my son and then blinded by her tears she staggered rather than walked from the room my father following i was immediately searched then gruffly ordered to fall in and be * to you with the rest of the prisoners seven in number the orders were then given to right face forward march and away we went in front of this modern bastile we were again halted guards were then stationed on each side of us a lieutenant marching in front with a drawn sword we were upon our arrival at the dpt again halted and drawn up into line where we remained for some time the rain descending upon us in torrents drenching us to the skin we asked permission of our guards to seek shelter under a roof where they themselves were standing but we were gruffly refused when the rain had ceased we were marched into one of the railway carriages lieutenant c belonging to major harry * command sat on the same seat with me he was as i afterwards found very * and though a perfect stranger entered into a spirited conversation that was kept up nearly the whole way as i have before stated he did not of course know who i was nor my name and once during a lull in our discussions he said by the way did you ever hear tell of miss belle boyd i smilingly assented that i had well he said there isnt a southerner who would not lay down his life for her when i was at the battle of winchester i was wounded and she came into the hospital where i was and inquired if there were any maryland boys there amongst other delicacies she gave me some very nice * she and mrs g were in the fort if i * not cheering us on when we made a charge and drove the yankees back when she was in montgomery hall alabama in 1863 she attended a ball held there and was the belle she stopped a duel between two frenchmen who were going to fight in the garden attached to the hotel when she came back from her imprisonment she brought me a splendid uniform you have no idea how every one loves and respects her he added however she married a yankee so i understand but miss belle would never marry a yankee i am certain ill bet he was a rebel indeed i am confident of it and and the gentleman who sits beside you is her husband i added interrupting him and like yourself sir i am a prisoner held by the yankees i never in my life saw a person so thoroughly * and confused for the moment but finally he said well i trust that you will pardon me for what i have said upon my honour i did not know who you were or i would never have done as i have you have said nothing i replied that a gentleman could construe into an insult and i am happy to make the acquaintance of one who knew my wife so well and for the rest of the way we were the best of friends we arrived in philadelphia about midnight the same systematic process of guarding us was gone through with and as we were marched out of the carriages sleepy passengers rubbed their eyes and stared at the johnnies as we passed by them we were quickly moved over opposite the station here we were halted for a few moments the lieutenant leaving us in charge of the sergeant whilst he went off to gather further information in regard to our movements he returned however in a few moments and again taking up our line of march we filed to the left then to the right in through a gateway under an arch through what had once been a doorway then down through a long corridor whose sides were filled with camp bedsteads and finally a dismal * where there were no windows only a narrow grated door this we were informed was to be our quarters for the night our beds were the hard boards our * what we stood in our pillows knapsacks or * sleep was out of the question so for the consideration of ten dollars in greenbacks about two pounds sterling i purchased from a calculating specimen of yankeedom about * worth of tobacco and tried to drown my cares and sorrows by smoking but although the smoke vanished my woes and sorrows still clung to me i felt very sore stiff cross out of temper and indisposed every way which was in a measure increased the next morning by a breakfast off tin * of something i know that i was very hungry and ate and drank it could any one be more miserable than we under the circumstances soldiers sailors * women c came and stared at us so that is him oh my was the sentiment of a very stout * woman staring in upon me * * it of him what a wicked man what will they do with him i heard one ask of another oh hang him was the fellows reply * too good for him said the other with a laugh i wonder if i can get a button or piece of his coat i heard some one else say ask him said another this species of degrading torture i endured until * when we were ordered out and conducted still under guard to the cars that we had occupied the night before on our way from washington now on our way to wilmington delaware where we arrived in about two hours time once more we were ordered out of the carriage i obeyed the command with an apathetic listlessness for i had lost all spirit as had the rest of our party two of whom were old gentlemen men who already had one foot in the grave political prisoners like myself men who had refused to take the oath of allegiance to the united states government this time we had a journey of eight miles on foot to make true apparently this was not long but to us it was indeed so the roads were very bad and almost all of the way we were over our ankles in mud and * snow and it was not until after three hours of this torture that we marched into newcastle as we passed through the principal street women and men rushed to the windows and doors to see us whilst a guard of honour * from all the small boys and girls in the village attended us in the front and rear gazing at us in wonderment arriving at the steamboat landing much to our disappointment and surprise the steamer was not to be found and we were ordered to right about and this time as if to add insult to injury we were conducted to the newcastle gaol and confined in a * cell in this horrid place we were left to our * until far into the evening when we were marched out and this time it was with a sensation of relief that i passed on to the deck of the osceola about 8 pm the osceola got under way and proceeded down the river en route for the fortress about twelve miles distant several officers stationed at that place were on board and came aft questioning us scanning our attire features c and in fact doing everything but poke us with sticks to make us roar upon our arrival at the landing about 10 pm the same routine of guarding was gone through with as i have before described at last we reached the provostmarshals office here our names were registered our age state when born profession whether citizen or soldier c and this accomplished it being late we were conducted into the privates barracks and * in the virginia division in which were confined some thirteen hundred privates a place that a * in this country would not have permitted his pigs to live in much less human beings as we entered the doorway yells and shouts from every side greeted us of fresh fish fresh fish men and boys crowded around us to find out from whence we came what we were held for who we were and last but not least had they gone through us in other words and more plainly speaking had the sentries outside searched us to this last question i assured my * that the yankees outside had done so most effectually several of them proposed tossing us in a blanket by way of diversion to the rest and many were evidently in favour of it when suddenly sergeant b of the division sprang forward and shouted out at the top of his voice by jove boys this gentleman is miss belle * husband you wouldnt wound her feelings by insulting him would you in an instant the shout that was raised was perfectly deafening i was received with * by the whole body of confederate prisoners in spite of this however i passed a miserable night and awoke more dead than alive with the excessive cold having no covering to shield me from the weather the hard floor for my bed at 9 am i ate my initiatory meal at fort delaware consisting of a piece of * bread and the smallest morsel of pork yellow with age the latter delicacy i gave away not having been here long enough to appreciate such dainties and eat anything that was placed before me jan 1st 1865 i passed a dreadful new years eve cowering over the fire until far into the * with my gloomy thoughts for sole companions fitting company though for such a place as this the floor is my bed again tonight and i sleep as the dogs sleep * * once i awoke hearing some one engaged in prayer deep silence prevailed round about and whoever he was the speaker i mean he spoke impressively before i retired for the night i called upon general * and his staff and passed a very pleasant evening jan 2nd some of the boys gave me a blanket and another handed me his overcoat so that i managed to sleep warmer than usual found several friends of mine here from mobile alabama captain w gave me a very good cup of coffee for my dinner the days drag wearily by god knows everybody treats me kindly i have found warm friends am getting accustomed to my feather bed of boards jan 2nd two letters very gloomy and dull and cold in the evening heard some very fine singing captain sang an * from * that he rendered excellently well jan 3rd and 4th wrote to my friends outside the prison today whilst engaged in this occupation one of general * aides brought me an invitation from the general to dine with them passed a pleasant afternoon in their society and was introduced to captain m brother of general m the distinguished kentucky cavalry officer and we became very warm friends afterwards jan 5th i attempted my first cup of tea this morning just fancy my having turned cook my friends laughed heartily at my handiwork for i put the tea in the cup then the snow upon that waiting for that to melt into water and boil meanwhile the tea suffered the natural result of such stupidity by being burnt jan 6th saw an account in the paper of my friend mrs col having been sent south thank god she is free jan 8th received a letter from one of my friends outside today smuggled in by the underground route there is hope for me yet in rome with * saw an account of my removal from the carroll prison here headed the husband of belle boyd the husband of belle boyd the famous rebel spy took refreshments in the guardhouse of the citizens volunteer hospital on friday afternoon on his way to fort delaware dr * was careful to provide secure quarters for this noted individual jan 9th and 10th damp weather afflicted with the blues my feet so swollen that i cannot put my boots on jan 11th whitewashed our division today the guard kept us out in the snow that had fallen heavily passed the time away by * one another one of these frozen missiles falling near a sentry he deliberately fired upon us but fortunately without doing any mischief although the ball ploughed the snow up very near one of our party the pens officers barracks privates barracks the galvanized barracks * and its results general ts experiment the barracks by night a reckless sentry the wrong man shot the places where the prisoners are held here are called pens and they are correctly designated for they are nothing more any one who may at any period of his life have attended a * can readily portray to himself the places we inhabit these * boarded and roughly put together remind one very forcibly of oldfashioned farmhouse barns where in the old times your poor horse shivered the night through standing uneasily in his * whilst his master slept comfortably within the * officially and by courtesy they were denominated barracks of which there are three distinct kinds upon this island viz the officers barracks the privates barracks and last but not least the allegiance barracks or as they are commonly termed the whitewashed or galvanized barracks in the officers barracks are held some fifteen or eighteen hundred officers and political prisoners about # in all of the latter in the privates barracks which occupy a little more space and whose divisions are somewhat larger than those of the former are crowded together in their misery some nine or ten thousand soldiers from almost every regiment and command in the southern confederacy many of these poor fellows are but * and suffer terribly from the cold inclement winter of the north many of them by far the largest portion are without friends in the north to whom they could apply and are therefore indebted to the yankees for the very little clothing that is at times given to them but which is never given unless every vestige of the original garment has entirely disappeared and common decency demands it many of them are young * of some of the noblest and proudest families in the south men who before this war knew naught of want and trouble men who had from infancy been reared in the lap of luxury and are now enduring everything insult imprisonment and starvation willingly and without murmuring patriots whose names will yet live to be handed down to posterity as noblest among the noble and lastly the galvanized barracks these are domiciled by southern soldiers who have taken the oath of allegiance to the united states upon being imprisoned here these patriots remain in this delectable spot for one year and are made to work for the state to prove their devotion to mr lincolns government by hauling wood and doing the disagreeable duties of the prison these fellows are allowed to draw rations daily and to live the same as the garrison in every respect as regards their food moreover they are permitted to receive boxes containing clothing and luxuries which those who choose to remain constant to their principles cannot unless they possess the influence of outside friends as regards their love for the old flag and devotion to the union i can hardly deem myself competent to pronounce judgment correctly but an excellent story is told of these individuals which is not unworthy of attention as it may in a measure serve to show how far these patriots should be trusted general s and his staff once paid them a visit upon entering their abode the general stated to them that there was to be an exchange of prisoners and that all those who still desired to go back to the south might do so now he added all those who feel inclined to do so step over on the left of the division every one them went over not a man remaining of the many who had grown to love the federal government as at present conducted it is said general s laughed and remarked well that will do i only wanted to find out whom i could trust to ascertain if any of you were really sincere these barracks or pens are divided into divisions each division having a stove for the purpose of * in a manner quarters that would otherwise be untenable they range in length from eighty to one hundred feet and in breadth measure about thirty feet they are separated from one another by thin * of boarding so that really they are quite connected as conversations carried on in one can be distinctly heard in the other on each side of these places wide structures of wood are built two stories in height which are reached by means of wooden * nailed to the supports upon these elevated platforms each prisoner is apportioned off so much space for his sleeping and cooking purposes at night * lights placed at one end of the barracks throw their broad glare upon the square of something less than an acre of mud and boards delectable spot in rainy weather with its ditches filled with muddy yellow water splendid place in the summer for disease and many a poor fellow has looked his last upon this earth dying here far away from his home struck down by the smallpox or some virulent

perfectly unconscious of his danger or how near unto deaths door he was passing a piteous spectacle the old mens petition piety of the southern soldiery a young mens christian association a prison service our guardians colonel wood mr wilson tom s the * how tom got his situation the ladies attendants aunt lizzie mr l the spy discomfited our cuisine scrap pudding how the prison officers made their profit about the middle of january i saw one of the most piteous spectacles i think that i ever had the misfortune to witness four men old and * one of them tottering on the entrance to the valley of shadows men whose gray * and venerable aspects ought to have commanded at least sympathy from the presiding powers at washington were brought in as prisoners they were to be held here until exchanged men who could not possibly be of any benefit whatever to either side north or south these men were arrested on the 3rd of august last by a captain in the united states navy who was on shore in command of a * and who brought them back prisoners on board his vessel they were confined in the hold for five months and then transferred to the supply steamer massachusetts and sent to philadelphia and from thence upon her arrival were forwarded to fort delaware truly if this was the sole result of the brave captains raid he had nothing to feel proud of upon their arrival here they excited the commiseration even of adjutant * who informed them if they would take the oath and draw up a petition to the secretary of war that he himself would forward it for them to the proper authorities below i * the letter that they had written by friends who volunteered their services in the barracks and to which they respectively signed their names one of them recounted to me his misfortunes and those of his comrades and i confess that as i sat listening to his recital i felt moved we have been treated very badly very badly he said in conclusion confined in the hold of the vessel for most of the time and we are all of us very old men sir and we never did them any harm yankees generally are very susceptible to flattery at least those in authority at washington and let us hope that the few masterly touches of the ingenious if not diplomatic author will not fail to have its desired effect upon hearts that are proverbial for their * qualities since my sojourn here i have had ample opportunities of observing the spirit of piety and * amongst the southern soldiery a young mens christian association was organized some time ago and prayer meetings are held nightly in some one of the divisions whilst prayers and readings from the bible take place in each division every evening about half an hour before the lights are put out either conducted by some chaplain or confederate officer in their * regard for the sabbath day and gods command to keep it holy i know of no nation which approaches nearer to the marked devotion of the english people than the southerners the sabbath day is always passed in a quiet and orderly manner service being held in different parts of the barracks it was my very good fortune to attend the meeting held by the rev mr * in division 23 his service was attended by all grades of rank and he certainly spoke and read with what is very rare with the public speakers of the present day much feeling and pathos so different from the * and * of a certain sensational preacher of the word of god that i once had the misfortune to hear in the city of churches you will like to hear something of our gaolers here they are colonel wood our superintendent could be a gentleman if he wished with a mind cultured and at once deep and penetrating he appears to have * himself by contact with those with whom he has associated i have watched the man closely in both phases in one running about the ground like an enraged tiger whilst his subordinates clear to the right and left fearful of their tyrannical master finally * his * upon some unfortunate one he * into quiet and his official dignity now feels * of the disturbance he has succeeded in creating about him i have heard him use language that modest ears would hardly dare to listen to not merely commonplace oaths but curses both loud and deep and horrible to hear a fit * of tom payne and * for w is an * * is his * his arguments are good in the defence of his creed but * and a deep one though he is i do not believe that he has faith in it conversing on this subject one day he said there is my bible laying his hand on a volume of * and colonel wood i replied like * on your deathbed you will cry out in your agony upon god to save you he pondered for a moment then said well i might your bible says that those who believe in christ even in the eleventh hour shall be saved again the colonel can be as suave and polite as affable and courteous as any who have moved in the best society as gentle and as tender it is only madame rumour whispers that he is cruel when under the influence of * or opium in his movements he is quick and energetic a man of medium stature his is a peculiar eye keen and gray at times cold and perfectly * at others full of * and keenness dressed in black coat and gray trousers and vest his large head covered with a * black slouched hat you have w p wood the * or better still perhaps the jonathan wild of america mr wilson the colonels righthand man the * from what little i saw of him appeared to be a gentleman straightforward in his dealings and a man of very few words he dresses plainly and wears a slouched felt hat every one wears felt hats now it is only foreigners and southerners who carry canes and wear tall hats said a friend of mine to me one day when in conversation with him next to the colonel w is the * man in the prison he it is who has charge of the prisoners and who rules supreme in the colonels absence every morning at eight oclock he comes round and calls the * of the prisoners in their rooms and hands them their letters which however are invariably opened and read before they leave the office below colonel * the military commandant who has charge of this post i saw but little of but we all liked him for he was ever courteous and polite and had always a good word for us fortunately for myself i was not under the tender guardianship of the officers of the keyes so of them i can say but little save that they attended to their business with * * another individual in this modern * is a decided * to colonel wood he * in the name of tom * and has charge of the beds and bedding and he attempts to imitate him in his every action in his accomplishment of swearing he is even a greater proficient than the colonel in his walk he * him if there is a man that he hates and fears more than all others it is certainly colonel wood indeed i think like jonathan wild the colonel can trust his * because he knows a portion of their life which it would not do to publish to the world during the late election in the united states tom made himself conspicuous by pulling down from the pole upon which it was hoisted the american flag and tearing it because it bore upon its folds the names of mcclellan and pendleton for this hardy act he was promoted to the position that he now occupies the female servants of the prison with the exception of aunt lizzie were the worst and most degraded beings i ever had the misfortune of seeing the five points of new york or the lowest * of infamy could not produce a worse crowd yet this scum were hired to wait upon the ladies who were here held for heaven knows what but prisoners nevertheless but aunt lizzie as she was called by every one here stood on her dignity no one insulted her always laughing and good * aunt lizzie prided herself upon belonging formerly to the * family my name sah am aunt lizzie * sah and im * proud of it sah straightforward and ever scrupulous in her colonel wood had one faithful attendant she was not to be bribed nor * none could see her smiling face and feel gloomy a good word she had for everybody she it was who mended our linen and washed our clothes aunt lizzie was certainly a good feature in this prison and many besides myself will i am sure remember her with feelings of gratitude mr l is another gentleman who * in belonging to the corps that is commanded by colonel wood he is the jerry * of this institution his nose is everywhere and his eyes are upon everything if a visitor comes to see a friend confined here mr l stands near at hand noting down in his memory the conversation whilst apparently engaged in trimming his nails or fixing his eyes on * as he notes down their words if in the court when the prisoners are walking about he is always looking on and smiling or has some soft word of endearment to say to newcomers to bring against them when their time comes i was particularly the object of his hatred and our hate was mutual i had very grievously offended him one day a gentleman called to see me upon entering i seated myself close to the gentleman mr l took a chair and placing his legs between us stretched himself complacently at full length and prepared as was his custom to listen of course our hopes of a conversation were to all appearances at an end for some moments i stood it calmly but at last i could stand it no longer there are i said very quietly in this prison spies bearers of stories ever ready for anything mean and contemptible but the meanest and most contemptible of them all is i beg your pardon sir turning suddenly to him is yourself mr l i cant help it said that individual looking piteously at me but the shot had taken effect mr l removed his chair to the fire and our conversation was uninterrupted of the cuisine of fort delaware there is not much to be said in praise two meals are served out to us daily consisting of one piece of peculiarly constructed bread and one ditto of indescribable salt * pork or meat that has had its * entirely boiled out of it in the making of soup for the garrison previous to its being apportioned out to the prisoners occasionally a mixture designated by our persecutors as soup and containing an ample sufficiency of * is doled out to us in tin pots it is an indescribable * * of * of every kind and in its appearance reminds one irresistibly of the * and the * coffee and tea are luxuries never seen in the shed where we receive our rations only those who are fortunate enough to have money are ever enabled to procure these articles from the butler who although selling a very good kind does not forget to charge a very * price for his considerate kindness these meals thus served out to us are called respectively breakfast and dinner * for such luxuries in the outside world however poor they may be what would our english friends who are i believe by no means averse to good cheer think if they could try it for a few weeks of the nutritious food the unparalleled good treatment of the prisoners held here of which the federals boast so loudly these pleasant meals are served to us at nine in the morning and three in the afternoon the * as it is named from whence this food is served out to us by its grinning demons is a large room in length about one hundred feet by sixty in width filled partially with long and very narrow tables constructed of * upon two generally though sometimes there were more are placed at regular intervals our pieces of bread by courtesy and our ditto of meat about halfpast eight some subordinate of the * shouts out the command to fall in 28 or 31 and whichever portion of the officers barracks may be first mentioned the inmates immediately respond by coming forth from their separate divisions and falling in by twos or threes march up to the entrance of the * here we are generally kept waiting for several minutes until the door is thrown open when we enter and file in single column down the table taking our allotted rations as we pass on until the end of the table is reached when on again we face to the right about retracing out steps out of the room and are once more fain to return to our * or eat in the open air the latter alternative however is not very often chosen as it is winter and we are but * clothed each division during the cold weather is provided with a stove for the purpose of * in a measure places that would have otherwise been * over this some one or more of us are generally pretty much occupied in cooking sundry nondescript dishes composed of odds and ends and which i find from experience are not altogether * after once conquering the repugnance felt upon being brought into contact with such very unaccustomed food * * and oftentimes * and * are piled upon every conceivable spot or space large enough to admit of such packing and in cold weather to approach anywhere near the stove is a thing utterly impossible owing to the numbers surrounding it political prisoners have the privilege of procuring their meals from the kitchen provided they can make some arrangement with the heads of that department and have the money necessary to back them in such arrangements after i had been imprisoned for two weeks i managed to have an interview with the presiding * of this steaming sanctum which resulted * and henceforth instead of living as i had for the past fourteen days upon bread and water for i never ate the pork i dined regularly upon meat potatoes and coffee for breakfast dinner and supper having for my comrade and messmate major r quartermaster on general * staff several * of this description were thus formed many of them having from six to eight members by * the * we managed to get several * occasionally so that altogether we managed to get along better than we should have done had we been without money or without friends for a consideration some one of the lower class of men confined here * the duties of cook and sets and * off the dishes * from the table in our case a * on legs and announces the meals when ready for us we might have fared better but rumour whispers that the sutler and presiding officials at the fort are * together and that the order prohibiting luxuries being forwarded here by friends was made as much for the benefit of themselves as for the irritation that it occasioned to us as it is utterly impossible to procure anything unless through the * of a sutler who charges * for his politeness miss mcdonough a brutal outrage treatment of mr w r coyner the courtmartial sentence tossing in a blanket the torture by fire fort delaware a box of clothing a man of consequence adjutant and general the blankets at last the softest plank i have already spoken of poor miss mcdonough she was taken prisoner last summer upon the charge of having murdered a federal officer at the time of this alleged murder miss mcdonough was nowhere in the vicinity and it was only in hopes that her brother would be advised of her arrest and surrender himself in her stead that this shameful seizure was made james mcdonough was a lieutenant in * command somewhere in the valley of the shenandoah and captain b was shot by him not murdered when during a skirmish he refused to surrender himself prisoner it was for this justifiable act of war she was made to suffer miss mcdonough was compelled to remain in a room perfectly stifling with * smells add to this the fact that she was continually fretting for fear her brother would deliver himself up for her can it then be wondered at that she should have died there far away from her friends and those she loved during my sojourn in the carroll prison i one evening called upon mrs a lady prisoner from * texas who tended miss mcdonough with motherly care during her illness poor mollie was then in a state of * and was barely conscious of what was going on about her when colonel wood the superintendent of the prison burst into the room shouting out at the top of his voice * * * caught and will swing by before the week is out miss mcdonough slowly raised herself in the bed until nearly upright stared wildly about her for an instant and uttering a piercing shriek fell insensible upon the floor i sprang forward but mrs was beside her before me and i turning full upon the author of this outrage remarked excitedly by colonel wood if i ever catch you in virginia when i get a command you shall swing for this sir another instance of yankee brutality and * was related to me by the young gentleman himself mr r coyner a private in the old 7th virginia regiment of cavalry at the time of his capture he was on furlough at * virginia on the 12th of october 1863 he was taken prisoner by a force of federal infantry under captain * and conveyed to petersburg western virginia when he was handed over to colonel * who not only paroled him but treated him with kindness and attention here he remained until the 24th of october when he was sent under a strong guard to new creek station on the baltimore and ohio railroad where he arrived late at night on the 25th here his sufferings began he was thrown into a large damp cellar where were huddled together about seventy yankee deserters murderers and bounty * where he was kept until the 26th * upon hard biscuits and cold water which were served to them twice during the day on the 26th he was taken from thence and carried to baltimore upon his arrival he was placed in * * then under the charge of the infamous colonel fish who was afterwards sentenced to the albany penitentiary for various crimes early on the morning of the 27th mr coyner was again ordered out of his place of confinement and conducted still under guard to fort mchenry which he reached about 11 am of the same day and was immediately placed in what is known as the solitary cell here the company was as select as that at new creek station comprising as it did murderers and thieves and other wretches of the deepest * in this solitary cell where he was doomed to pass a weary interval of time no windows admitted the light of day no lamp was permitted at night the apartment or rather den was cold and * its walls thick with mildew the floor covered with filth of every kind and literally swarming with insects none of the prisoners held here being ever allowed to leave the place for any purpose whatever here young coyner upon entering found two other confederate soldiers with ball and chain attached to their legs the cause assigned for this treatment by the yankee authorities being simply that they were confederates young coyner himself had not remained here more than an hour when the sergeant entered and with the assistance of his men placed a 42 * ball and chain upon his left ankle adding that if he attempted to take it off he would shoot him he remained here and in this condition for three months and a half and his sufferings as he related them to me were certainly horrible in the extreme the first night that he passed in this hell upon earth as he termed it could never be obliterated from his memory a mock courtmartial was held before which he was arraigned upon the charge of being a rebel and * the remainder of those in the den looking on laughing spectators of the scene of course the result of this courtmartial may be inferred he was found guilty and the court pronounced the following sentence upon him viz to be tossed in a blanket until lifeless this was immediately carried into effect the federal guards looking on amused spectators of the scene taking no heed of his piteous appeals to them for mercy or protection but on the contrary inciting his persecutors by words and gestures to carry the sentence into effect handed over to them he was tossed thirteen times each time falling heavily upon his head or sides when finally more dead then alive he was permitted to crawl off amidst the jeers and laughter of his * who were highly elated at the manner in which they had eventually succeeded in * groans from their unfortunate martyr thoroughly sick and feeling like one more dead than alive poor coyner bruised and sore endeavoured to court sleep and thus in a measure to drive off the fearful thoughts that were at times nearly driving him mad he eventually fell into an uneasy slumber and may have slept for an hour when he was awakened by fire being applied to his feet by the judge advocate of this mock court who gloried in the name of kelly and who * boasted of having murdered his captain for greenbacks this fresh torture of young coyner was considered the very * of pleasure and amusement by his * some of whom held him whilst others applied the burning paper to his feet the fire being supplied to them for this purpose by the sentries he showed me the scars caused by the severe burns that he had received scars that he will take with him to the grave it was in vain that he appealed for mercy at last wearied out they permitted him to go free for the time being by these miserable brutes said young coyner i was not permitted to speak in defence of my country nor yet assert my rights if i remonstrated with them i was knocked down and kicked by my brutal persecutors oftener beaten this kind of treatment i endured for a period of three months and a half when i was ordered out of this horrible place by the provostmarshal whom i found to be kind and compassionate and who in my case was but obeying his superiors he placed me in a very nice and comfortable room which the confederate officers held and removed from my * the ball and chain that had so long been my companions in my misery here i remained until the 12th of may when i was removed to fort delaware to serve out a sentence of courtmartial viz hard labour for the war that had been passed upon me by my tyrannical captors it is worthy of remark that out of those nine officers who composed one of the most atrocious military commissions that was ever assembled and before whom he was arraigned all with the exception of one of its members have already met a violent death eight were killed before the 20th of june by southern bullets and the remaining one lies already at the point of death struck down by * fatal shaft which is slowly but surely working out his fate here i am for the present he said in concluding his narrative how long i am to remain i know not but i am willing to suffer any and every thing for my country and her cause previous to my incarceration in fort delaware and whilst i was yet a prisoner in the carroll i received a letter from my mother in which she mentioned that she was about to forward to me a trunk filled with winter clothing and some few little articles necessary for my comfort but before it came i was sent to the fort here the rgime was much * and prohibited the prisoners from receiving anything whatsoever in the shape of food and it was only by special permit that even clothing was allowed to be sent here the different expresses refusing to accept parcels unless they had pasted upon the outside the passport of the fort desirous of keeping myself warm at least i wrote to the assistant adjutantgeneral of the post george w * the following letter this i forwarded to him by mail although my friends scouted the idea of my ever receiving an answer to it and their conjectures were correct for captain * did not deign to notice it whether it was owing to the weight of his official duties or to his supreme contempt for rebels i was never able to ascertain finally however one day as i sat thinking upon my dreary imprisonment of you my wife and home associations affected decidedly with the blues mr j whose misfortune it was to have been a democrat and the editor of a baltimore journal said well mr h have you received a reply to the letter you wrote the other day no sir i responded gloomily well try the general he ranks several grades above an adjutant and is therefore not so important as the lesser bird by jove i replied the idea is a good one and forthwith i wrote * the general was far more polite and attentive to his prisoners than his adjutant for the next day i received by mail the following order of course this was all that was desired and in a few days i had the extreme pleasure of * the contents of this * box and oh you of the outside world who have never in winter slept without blankets nor indulged in that very * luxury the softest plank for a bed in some modern bastile you i say can never conceive the joy that i felt swelling up within me as i laid me down to sleep that night wrapping myself up in this warm embrace you doubtless would not envy me the luxury and yet there were plenty of poor fellows here without money and without friends sleeping calmly and peacefully around me as i have slept without blankets to cover them only their martial cloaks and they are very ragged for a covering wanted at the fort the order for release farewells free at last a cool reception an undignified costume no conveyance the walk to wilmington home once more conclusion of mr hardinges journal on the 3rd of february whilst seated with major r and adjutant c talking of our anticipated exchange the sergeant of the barracks came into the division and inquired for me i immediately descended from my perch and presented myself before him inquiring as i did so the purport of his visit youre wanted at the fort general p wants you follow me was the reply half wondering what it was and drawing closer about me my apology for a blanket for it was a very cold afternoon i followed my conductor until i reached the fort when i was immediately ushered into the august presence of the commandant who stared hard at me without however saying anything one of his aides evidently a secretary handed me after a few moments had elapsed the following document which was to be my safeconduct by sea and land the general then remarked mr h you have now our permission to leave the island will you go tonight or tomorrow morning do you go to baltimore or new york city i presume you will leave for europe by the first steamer to this i made answer saying i will go now my destination is new york and i thank god i am free rest assured that i shall not trouble the government by remaining longer than i can help good afternoon sir and turning i left the room and walked rapidly back still accompanied by the sergeant to the barracks that soldier remarking by youre an awfully lucky chap i was not long i can assure you in packing up what few things i had and then came the final * and partings i confess that i felt badly as i took major r by the hand and bade him goodbye for he had ever been a good friend and counsellor of mine i am not ashamed to confess that my eyes were filled with tears as one after another of my friends gathered around shaking hands with me wishing me a god speed you hardinge god bless you my boy hope to meet you in dixie soon write to me c words that i shall never forget for they came from the lips of some of the bravest spirits in the southern confederacy it was very fortunate that i had taken the precaution to hide my papers carefully about my person for upon * the * previous to leaving the island my bundle was first thoroughly inspected then my pockets the lining of my felt hat and my boots but here the soldier employed for that purpose luckily stopped i was then permitted to step on board of a small * which lay at the wharf this in a few moments cast off from her moorings and she slowly glided away from the chteau * of america daintily picking her way through the miniature * that impeded our progress to the mainland which although only about seven miles distant we were nearly two hours in reaching it was with feelings of unmistakable pleasure that i felt my feet pressing once more terra firma and experienced the gratifying sensation awakening itself within me that i was once more my own master so drawing my tattered blanket about me i stepped into the hotel that stood near the landing and inquired the distance to wilmington the proprietor of this country place eyed me suspiciously the dog who had been basking at the fire rose and growled at me and the frequenters of the place who were seated round the stove smoking or drinking by their looks inferred as plainly as tongue could speak he is an escaped prisoner and no wonder when i describe to you my presentation dress upon the occasion a felt hat remarkable only for its being * adorned my head a ragged blanket sufficed only in a measure however to keep the cold from my * body a pair of * horribly dilapidated encased my lower extremities a boot on one foot and the other wrapped up in old rags is it a wonder then that i was an object of doubtful character seating myself near the fire i called for a glass of wine which was handed to me by the * who muttered something about a desire that he had of seeing the colour of my money to this i replied by drawing out my pocketbook and offering him a * greenback desiring him to give me small moneys for it in an instant the conduct of those present underwent a complete change the * was all * and bows and with an urbanity that was all the more strikingly apparent from his former behaviour desired to know if i wished to have an apartment no i wish to go to wilmington how far is it from here sixteen miles was the reply is there any conveyance that will take me there tonight there was none hem not if i will pay you well for it i wouldnt let a dog of mine go out this night was the answer then i will walk i said walk was * simultaneously with astonishment depicted on their countenances yes walk i reiterated desperately well if you get to wilmington safely you will do more than i expect you will in that garb especially and the speaker looked at my costume with a sneer nevertheless i am going i said and * the action to the word i rose and attended to the door of the hotel by the group of astonished * i commenced the journey it had been * and raining alternately throughout the day and the roads in this part of the country never at any time when i saw them remarkable for their goodness were ankledeep with mud i shall never have the recollection of that night obliterated from my memory several times i was on the point of lying down on the roadside but the love of life and the thought that god willing i should soon be at home were strong within me and i staggered on through the freezing rain and * snow twice on the way i inquired at the door of a farmhouse the direction that i was to take and once the * wife of the quiet homestead where i gained admittance prepared for me with her own white hands a cup of coffee and pressed me to stay all night at her hospitable place an invitation in which she was seconded by the rest of her family herself and husband were both english and i shall not forget their kindness to me and when i at last rose to depart the husband wife and children bade me a kind adieu the husband accompanying me down the road some distance at last just as the clock was striking ten i staggered into the dpt at wilmington just in time to catch the train for new york i had accomplished the distance in four hours but it was fully a week before i was able to walk or sit even with any degree of comfort early in the morning i arrived in new york and drove immediately to my brothers place of business he was perfectly amazed at seeing me and laughed * at the deplorable figure i cut eventually having procured a suit of clothes and enjoyed the luxury of a bath and the inexpressible feeling of delight that one feels in finding his body once more in contact with clean linen i bade adieu to the united states and started directly for the shores of hospitable and peaceful england conclusion of mrs hardinges narrative my memoirs were written and a portion of them already in the hands of the publishers when the startling news came which has thrilled all europe and filled her inhabitants with horror the assassination of abraham lincoln president of the united states it was always the boast of americans were they northern or southern in their sentiments that theirs was the only history that could show to the world a clear * record of successful republican rule but their annals can be no longer so regarded for in the sudden demise of mr lincoln by the bullet of an * fanatic that peculiar institution of europe the school of the assassin has transferred itself to the shores of america and that country can no longer uphold her former boast that crime such as this had never been perpetrated under the government commenced by george washington personally i had no animosity against the honourable gentleman who has wielded the sceptre of northern power for four long years his has been a trying position no man probably in the pages of history took his seat under more * circumstances the press of the world warred furious warfare upon him he was jeered and * at he was pronounced uncouth vulgar low servile and abject disappointed politicians and opposition cliques vied with each other in calling him upon every occasion the * and * of * proclivities speedily predicted that with such a man as abraham lincoln at the head of the government the union would most assuredly be split with as much precision and as quickly as mr lincoln had been known to split rails when a * in the western wilds although a member of congress previous to his elevation to the presidential chair of all the united states not in rebellion and having for his political opponent in his presidential campaign that great statesman the late mr douglas mr lincoln was not a forensic success his speeches and arguments teeming with wit and dry humour were better calculated to attract the * by whom he was looked upon as a leading man than the * and more mature intellects with which he was in * brought into contact i can appreciate and admire fully the character of such men who * the sentence out of nothing came something as such i looked upon lincoln when month after month and then year after year of his presidential term rolled by and i saw how well he governed the northern republic and how firmly he held the reins of the federal cause which from time to time * upon the verge of a yawning chasm now all is changed can any one believe that mr johnson is the man who is to restore the republic to what it was save the nation from bankruptcy and bring peace and goodwill to america it might not have been impossible with mr lincoln for that gentleman held out the * concealing no deadly weapon beneath it to general lee and his little band of heroes with mr johnson at the head of the government of the north who can foresee anything save anarchy and dissolution he will fiddle whilst rome is burning politically i did not like mr lincoln for in him i saw the * as long as it served his purpose mr lincoln boldly advocated the right of secession i trust that the accusation will not startle my readers but such was the case and i will cite one instance when as a representative he openly avowed that any nation or people in any portion of the world had a right to rise up and rebel against the * if they wanted to when the north in 186061 declared that she would usurp all rights and have whether or no the south wished it and in direct violation of the constitution a strictly northern president abraham lincoln still true to his former assertion of the right of secession accepted the nomination of the chicago platform and by this act inserted the wedge in that log called the union the log was ultimately split through force of circumstances there are those who maintain that in this world women have no right to interfere in the affairs of state in politics in plots and * others there are who more chivalrous are willing to admit that women have as much right to act think and speak as men i do not set myself up as an advocate of the womans right doctrine but would rather appear in the character of a quiet lady expressing her sentiments not so much to the public as to her immediate friends therefore i trust that the former class of gentlemen will here forgive what to them may appear presumption especially as in the preceding chapters of my book i have endeavoured to avoid politics as much as possible but to return to my subject the north boldly declared that she did not care much if the south did secede and the south never doubting the intentions of the north took her at her word seceded and the consequence has been a civil war whose magnitude has never been surpassed and whose slain can be counted not by tens but by hundreds of thousands mr lincoln as the representative of his nation took the oath of office to uphold the union as it was then after a while as it was became as it is finally when richmond fell and lee surrendered unwilling to be what andy johnson beast butler or jim lane of kansas wanted him to be a tyrant he openly avowed his intention of effecting if possible a speedy union of north and south on the most conciliatory terms this was sufficient he was from henceforth a doomed man the sands of his life were numbered and he slept little dreaming of his danger of the sword hanging above his head not only was lincoln doomed but so also were all those most in favour of conciliatory measures towards the south and her traders the constitution as it is said the notorious senator jim lane of kansas is played out and i am ready to see any man shot down who * the union as it was talked of by mr lincoln and on the evening of the very next day after mr lincoln had favoured a conciliatory treatment towards the south he was shot down englishmen i appeal to your impartial judgment i look to you for the * of the foul charge which mr stanton has thrown upon the shoulders of our southern leaders that he might thereby induce the european powers to withdraw their recognition of southern * it is not the chivalrous sons of the south who have done this deed the papers indeed make the assassin use the words sic * * but if this be true then as a virginian woman i say never was the * of virginia more * abused and in truth our people have even more to regret in the death of president lincoln than have the people of the north when our noble old chieftain general lee heard of the assassination he covered his face and refused to listen to the details of the murder whilst in the libby prison where a large number of southern soldiers were confined the inmates on one of the floors held a meeting and denounced the murder passing resolutions that they were soldiers and could not therefore applaud * yet mr secretary stanton unblushingly charges the commission of this deed upon the south there are those in the northern states who will yet move heaven and earth to prove that it was the south and to prove it money will be spent bribes given and where money and bribes fail threats will be used but i appeal to europe to judge * between north and south do not pronounce too hastily your judgment nor cast upon a brave and chivalrous people the stigma of assassination many have advised me to suppress these volumes urging that their publication will probably cause my lifelong banishment but i cannot i will not recede i firmly believe that in this fiery ordeal in this suffering misery and woe the south is but undergoing a * by fire and steel that will in good time and by gods decree work out her own independence
