the object of this work has been from historical data to show that the southern states had rightfully the power to withdraw from a union into which they had as sovereign communities voluntarily entered that the denial of that right was a violation of the letter and spirit of the compact between the states and that the war waged by the federal government against the seceding states was in disregard of the limitations of the constitution and destructive of the principles of the declaration of independence the author from his official position may claim to have known much of the motives and acts of his countrymen immediately before and during the war of 186165 and he has sought to furnish material far the future historian who when the passions and prejudices of the day shall have given place to reason and sober thought may better than a contemporary investigate the causes conduct and results of the war the incentive to undertake the work now offered to the public was the desire to correct * created by industriously circulated misrepresentations as to the acts and purposes of the people and the general government of the confederate states by the * of such * terms as rebellion and treason and the * that the south was levying war against the united states those ignorant of the nature of the union and of the reserved powers of the states have been led to believe that the confederate states were in the condition of revolted provinces and that the united states were forced to resort to arms for the preservation of their existence to those who knew that the union was formed for specific enumerated purposes and that the states had never surrendered their sovereignty it was a palpable absurdity to apply to them or to their citizens when obeying their mandates the terms rebellion and treason and further it is shown in the following pages that the confederate states so far from making war or seeking to destroy the united states as soon as they had an official organ strove earnestly by peaceful recognition to * adjust all questions growing out of the separation from their late associates another great perversion of truth has been the * of the men who participated in the formation of the confederacy and who bore arms in its defense as the * of a controversy leading to disunion sectional issues appear conspicuously in the debates of the convention which framed the federal constitution and its many compromises were designed to secure an equilibrium between the sections and to preserve the interests as well as the liberties of the several states african servitude at that time was not confined to a section but was numerically greater in the south than in the north with a tendency to its continuance in the former and cessation in the latter it therefore thus early presents itself as a disturbing element and the provisions of the constitution which were known to be necessary for its adoption bound all the states to recognize and protect that species of property when at a subsequent period there arose in the northern states an antislavery agitation it was a harmless and scarcely noticed movement until political * seized upon it as a means to acquire power had it been left to * and fanatics most zealous where least informed it never could have shaken the foundations of the union and have incited one section to carry fire and sword into the other that the agitation was political in its character and was clearly developed as early as 1803 it is believed has been established in these pages to preserve a sectional equilibrium and to maintain the equality of the states was the effort on one side to acquire empire was the manifest purpose on the other this struggle began before the men of the confederacy were born how it arose and how it progressed it has been attempted briefly to show its last stage was on the question of territorial governments and if in this work it has not been demonstrated that the position of the south was justified by the constitution and the equal rights of the people of all the states it must be because the author has failed to present the subject with a sufficient degree of force and clearness in describing the events of the war space has not permitted and the loss of both books and papers has prevented the notice of very many entitled to consideration as well for the humanity as the gallantry of our men in the unequal combats they fought these numerous * it is satisfactory to know the official reports made at the time and the subsequent contributions which have been and are being published by the actors will supply more fully and graphically than could have been done in this work usurpations of the federal government have been presented not in a spirit of hostility but as a warning to the people against the dangers by which their liberties are beset when the war ceased the pretext on which it had been waged could no longer be alleged the emancipation proclamation of mr lincoln which when it was issued he humorously admitted to be a * had acquired validity by the action of the highest authority known to our * people assembled in their several state conventions the soldiers of the confederacy had laid down their arms had in good faith pledged themselves to abstain from further hostile operations and had peacefully dispersed to their homes there could not then have been further dread of them by the government of the united states the plea of necessity could therefore no longer exist for hostile demonstration against the people and states of the deceased confederacy did vengeance which stops at the grave * did real peace and the restoration of the states to their former rights and positions follow as was promised on the restoration of the union let the recital of the invasion of the reserved powers of the states or the people and the perversion of the republican form of government guaranteed to each state by the constitution answer the question for the deplorable fact of the war for the cruel manner in which it was waged for the sad physical and yet sadder moral results it produced the reader of these pages i hope will admit that the south in the forum of conscience stands fully acquitted much of the past is irremediable the best hope for a restoration in the future to the pristine purity and fraternity of the union rests on the opinions and character of the men who are to succeed this generation that they maybe suited to that blessed work one whose public course is ended * them to draw their creed from the fountains of our political history rather than from the lower stream polluted as it has been by selfseeking * and by sectional strife a duty to my countrymen to the memory of those who died in defense of a cause consecrated by inheritance as well as sustained by conviction and to those who perhaps less fortunate * all and lost all save life and honor in its behalf has impelled me to attempt the vindication of their cause and conduct for this purpose i have decided to present an historical sketch of the events which preceded and attended the struggle of the southern states to maintain their existence and their rights as sovereign * creators not the creatures of the general government the social problem of maintaining the just relation between constitution government and people has been found so difficult that human history is a record of unsuccessful efforts to establish it a government to afford the needful protection and exercise proper care for the welfare of a people must have * in its constituents it is this necessity which has divided the human race into separate nations and finally has defeated the grandest efforts which conquerors have made to give unlimited extent to their domain when our fathers dissolved their connection with great britain by declaring themselves free and independent states they constituted thirteen separate communities and were careful to assert and preserve each for itself its sovereignty and jurisdiction at a time when the minds of men are * far from the lessons our fathers taught it seems proper and well to recur to the original principles on which the system of government they devised was founded the eternal truths which they announced the rights which they declared unalienable are the * on which rests the vindication of the confederate cause he must have been a careless reader of our political history who has not observed that whether under the style of united colonies or united states which was adopted after the declaration of independence whether under the articles of confederation or the compact of union there everywhere appears the distinct assertion of state sovereignty and nowhere the slightest suggestion of any purpose on the part of the states to * themselves into one body will any candid wellinformed man assert that at any time between 1776 and 1790 a proposition to surrender the sovereignty of the states and * them in a central government would have had the least possible chance of adoption can any historical fact be more * than that the states did both in the confederation and in the union retain their sovereignty and independence as distinct communities voluntarily consenting to federation but never becoming the fractional parts of a nation that such opinions should find adherents in our day may be attributable to the natural law of * surely not to a conscientious regard for the terms of the compact for union by the states in all free governments the constitution or organic law is supreme over the government and in our federal union this was most distinctly marked by limitations and * against all which was beyond the expressed grants of power to the general government in the foreground therefore i take the position that those who resisted violations of the compact were the true friends and those who maintained the usurpation of undelegated powers were the real enemies of the constitutional union inasmuch as questions growing out of the institution of negro servitude or connected with it will occupy a conspicuous place in what is to follow it is important that the reader should have in the very outset a right understanding of the true nature and character of those questions no subject has been more generally misunderstood or more persistently misrepresented the institution itself has ceased to exist in the united states the generation comprising all who took part in the controversies to which it gave rise or for which it afforded a pretext is passing away and the * which have prevailed in our own country and still more among foreigners remote from the field of contention are likely to be perpetuated in the mind of posterity unless corrected before they become crystallized by tacit acquiescence it is well known that at the time of the adoption of the federal constitution african servitude existed in all the states that were parties to that compact unless with the single exception of massachusetts in which it had perhaps very recently ceased to exist the slaves however were numerous in the southern and very few in the northern states this diversity was occasioned by differences of climate soil and industrial * in any degree by moral considerations which at that period were not recognized as an element in the question it was simply because negro labor was more profitable in the south than in the north that the importation of negro slaves had been and continued to be chiefly directed to the southern ports for the same reason slavery was abolished by the states of the northern section though it existed in several of them for more than fifty years after the adoption of the constitution while the importation of slaves into the south continued to be carried on by northern merchants and northern ships without interference in the traffic from any quarter until it was prohibited by the spontaneous action of the southern states themselves the constitution expressly forbade any interference by congress with the * to use its own language with the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states should think proper to * to the year 1808 during the intervening period of more than twenty years the matter was exclusively under the control of the respective states nevertheless every southern state without exception either had already enacted or proceeded to enact laws forbidding the importation of slaves virginia was the first of all the states north or south to prohibit it and georgia was the first to incorporate such a prohibition in her organic constitution two petitions for the abolition of slavery and the slavetrade were presented february 11 and 12 1790 to the very first congress convened under the constitution after full discussion in the house of representatives it was determined with regard to the * subject that congress have no authority to interfere in the emancipation of slaves or in the treatment of them within any of the states and with regard to the other that no authority existed to prohibit the migration or importation of such persons as the states might think proper to admit prior to the year 1808 so distinct and final was this statement of the limitations of the authority of congress considered to be that when a similar petition was presented two or three years afterward the clerk of the house was instructed to return it to the * in 1807 congress availing itself of the very earliest moment at which the constitutional restriction ceased to be * passed an act prohibiting the importation of slaves into any part of the united states from and after the first day of january 1808 this act was passed with great unanimity in the house of representatives there were one hundred and thirteen # * to five 5 * and it is a significant fact as showing the absence of any sectional division of sentiment at that period that the five * were divided as equally as possible between the two sections two of them were from northern and three from southern states the slavetrade had thus been finally abolished some months before the birth of the author of these pages and has never since had legal existence in any of the united states the question of the maintenance or extinction of the system of negro servitude already existing in any state was one exclusively belonging to such state it is obvious therefore that no subsequent question legitimately arising in federal legislation could properly have any reference to the merits or the policy of the institution itself a few * in the north afterward created much agitation by demands for the abolition of slavery within the states by federal intervention and by their activity and perseverance finally became a recognized party which holding the balance of power between the two contending organizations in that section gradually obtained the control of one and to no small degree * the other the dominant idea however at least of the absorbed party was sectional aggrandizement looking to absolute control and theirs is the responsibility for the war that resulted no moral nor sentimental considerations were really involved in either the earlier or later controversies which so long agitated and finally * the union they were simply struggles between different sections with diverse institutions and interests it is absolutely requisite in order to a right understanding of the history of the country to bear these truths clearly in mind the phraseology of the period referred to will otherwise be essentially deceptive the * employment of such terms as freedom and slavery or antislavery and * with reference to the principles and purposes of contending parties or rival sections has had immense influence in misleading the opinions and sympathies of the world the idea of freedom is captivating that of slavery repellent to the moral sense of mankind in general it is easy therefore to understand the effect of applying the one set of terms to one party the other to another in a contest which had no just application whatever to the essential merits of freedom or slavery southern statesmen may perhaps have been too indifferent to this * their ardent pursuit of principles overlooking the effects of phrases this is especially true with regard to that familiar but most * expression the extension of slavery to the reader unfamiliar with the subject or viewing it only on the surface it would perhaps never occur that as used in the great controversies respecting the territories of the united states it does not never did and never could imply the addition of a single slave to the number already existing the question was merely whether the slaveholder should be permitted to go with his slaves into territory the common property of all into which the * could go with his property of any sort there was no proposal nor desire on the part of the southern states to reopen the slavetrade which they had been foremost in suppressing or to add to the number of slaves it was a question of the distribution or dispersion of the slaves rather than of the extension of slavery removal is not extension indeed if emancipation was the end to be desired the dispersion of the negroes over a wider area among additional territories eventually to become states and in * unfavorable to * instead of * would have promoted this object by diminishing the difficulties in the way of ultimate emancipation the distinction here defined between the distribution or dispersion of slaves and the extension of * things altogether different although so generally * early and clearly drawn under circumstances and in a connection which justify a fuller notice virginia it is well known in the year # ceded to the united * united only by the original articles of * vast possessions northwest of the ohio from which the great states of ohio indiana michigan illinois wisconsin and part of minnesota have since been formed in #* the adoption of the federal * celebrated ordinance for the government of this northwestern territory was adopted by the congress with the full consent and indeed at the express instance of virginia this ordinance included six definite articles of compact between the original states and the people and states in the said territory which were to for ever remain unalterable unless by common consent the sixth of these articles * that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted in december 1805 a petition of the legislative council and house of representatives of the indiana * comprising all the area now occupied by the states of indiana illinois michigan and * presented to congress it appears from the proceedings of the house of representatives that several petitions of the same purport from inhabitants of the territory accompanied by a letter from william henry harrison the governor afterward president of the united states had been under consideration nearly two years earlier the prayer of these petitions was for a suspension of the sixth article of the ordinance so as to permit the introduction of slaves into the territory the whole subject was referred to a select committee of seven members consisting of representatives from virginia ohio pennsylvania south carolina kentucky and new york and the delegate from the indiana territory on the 14th of the ensuing february # this committee made a report favorable to the prayer of the * and recommending a suspension of the prohibitory article for ten years in their report the committee after stating their opinion that a qualified suspension of the article in question would be beneficial to the people of the indiana territory proceeded to say these were the dispassionate utterances of representatives of every part of the * contemporary with the origin of the constitution speaking before any sectional division had arisen in connection with the subject it is remarkable that the very same opinions which they express and arguments which they * had fifty years afterward come to be denounced and repudiated by one half of the union as partisan and sectional when * by the other half no final action seems to have been taken on the subject before the adjournment of congress but it was brought forward at the next session in a more imposing form on the 20th of january 1807 the speaker laid before the house of representatives a letter from governor harrison inclosing certain resolutions formally and unanimously adopted by the legislative council and house of representatives of the indiana territory in favor of the suspension of the sixth article of the ordinance and the introduction of slaves into the territory which they say would meet the approbation of at least nine * of the good citizens of the same among the resolutions were the following these resolutions were submitted to a committee drawn like the former from different sections of the country which again reported favorably reiterating in substance the reasons given by the former committee their report was sustained by the house and a resolution to suspend the prohibitory article was adopted the proposition failed however in the senate and there the matter seems to have been dropped the proceedings constitute a significant and * episode in the political history of the country the allusion which has been made to the ordinance of 1787 renders it proper to notice very briefly the argument put forward during the discussion of the missouri question and often repeated since that the ordinance afforded a precedent in support of the claim of a power in congress to determine the question of the admission of slaves into the territories and in justification of the prohibitory clause applied in 1820 to a portion of the louisiana territory the difference between the congress of the confederation and that of the federal constitution is so broad that the action of the former can in no just sense be taken as a precedent for the latter the congress of the confederation represented the states in their sovereignty each delegation having one vote so that all the states were of equal weight in the decision of any question it had legislative executive and in some degree judicial powers thus combining all departments of government in itself during its recess a committee known as the committee of the states exercised the powers of the congress which was in spirit if not in fact an assemblage of the states on the other hand the congress of the constitution is only the legislative department of the general government with powers strictly defined and expressly limited to those delegated by the states it is further held in check by an executive and a judiciary and consists of two branches each having peculiar and specified functions if then it be * is at least very * the congress of the confederation had rightfully the power to exclude slave property from the territory northwest of the ohio river that power must have been derived from its character as an assemblage of the sovereign states not from the articles of confederation in which no indication of the grant of authority to exercise such a function can be found the congress of the constitution is expressly prohibited from the assumption of any power not distinctly and specifically delegated to it as the legislative branch of an organized government what was * in the former case therefore becomes clearly * in the latter but there is yet another material distinction to be observed the states owners of what was called the northwestern territory were component members of the congress which adopted the ordinance for its government and gave thereto their full and free consent the ordinance may therefore be regarded as virtually a treaty between the states which ceded and those which received that extensive domain in the other case missouri and the whole region affected by the missouri compromise were parts of the territory acquired from france under the name of louisiana and as it requires two parties to make or amend a treaty france and the government of the united states should have * in any amendment of the treaty by which louisiana had been acquired and which guaranteed to the inhabitants of the ceded territory all the rights advantages and * of citizens of the united states and the free enjoyment of their liberty property and the religion they * papers * ii foreign relations p # for all the reasons thus stated it seems to me conclusive that the action of the congress of the confederation in 1787 could not constitute a precedent to justify the action of the congress of the united states in 1820 and that the prohibitory clause of the missouri compromise was without constitutional authority in violation of the rights of a part of the joint owners of the territory and in disregard of the obligations of the treaty with france the basis of sectional controversy was the question of the balance of political power in its earlier manifestations this was undisguised the purchase of the louisiana territory from france in 1803 and the subsequent admission of a portion of that territory into the union as a state afforded one of the earliest occasions for the manifestation of sectional jealousy and gave rise to the first threats or warnings which proceeded from new england of a dissolution of the union yet although negro slavery existed in louisiana no pretext was made of that as an objection to the acquisition the ground of opposition is frankly stated in a letter of that period from one massachusetts statesman to * the influence of our part of the union must be diminished by the acquisition of more weight at the other extremity some years afterward in # occurred the memorable contest with regard to the admission into the union of missouri the second state carved out of the louisiana territory the controversy arose out of a proposition to attach to the admission of the new state a proviso prohibiting slavery or involuntary servitude therein the vehement discussion that ensued was continued into the first session of a different congress from that in which it originated and agitated the whole country during the interval between the two it was the first question that ever seriously threatened the * of the union and the first in which the sentiment of opposition to slavery in the abstract was introduced as an adjunct of sectional controversy it was clearly shown in debate that such considerations were altogether irrelevant that the number of existing slaves would not be affected by their removal from the older states to missouri and moreover that the proposed restriction would be contrary to the spirit if not to the letter of the constitution notwithstanding all this the restriction was adopted by a vote almost strictly sectional in the house of representatives it failed in the senate through the firm resistance of the southern aided by a few patriotic and conservative northern members of that body the admission of the new state without any restriction was finally accomplished by the addition to the bill of a section for ever prohibiting slavery in all that portion of the louisiana territory lying north of thirtysix degrees and thirty minutes north latitude except * implication leaving the portion south of that line open to settlement either with or without slaves this provision as an offset to the admission of the new state without restriction constituted the celebrated missouri compromise it was reluctantly accepted by a small majority of the southern members nearly half of them voted against it under the conviction that it was unauthorized by the constitution and that missouri was entitled to determine the question for herself as a matter of right not of bargain or concession among those who thus thought and voted were some of the wisest statesmen and purest patriots of that period this brief * may have sufficed to show that the question of the right or wrong of the institution of slavery was in no wise involved in the earlier sectional controversies nor was it otherwise in those of a later period in which it was the lot of the author of these memoirs to bear a part they were essentially struggles for sectional equality or * the maintenance or the destruction of that balance of power or equipoise between north and south which was early recognized as a cardinal principle in our federal system it does not follow that both parties to this contest were wholly right or wholly wrong in their claims the determination of the question of right or wrong must be left to the candid * after examination of the evidence the object of these preliminary investigations has been to clear the subject of the obscurity produced by irrelevant issues and the glamour of ethical illusions the first session of the * congress # was a memorable one the recent acquisition from mexico of new mexico and california required legislation by congress in the senate the bills reported by the committee on territories were referred to a select committee of which mr clay the distinguished senator from kentucky was chairman from this committee emanated the bills which taken together are known as the compromise measures of 1850 with some others i advocated the division of the newly acquired territory by an extension to the pacific ocean of the missouri compromise line of thirtysix degrees and thirty minutes north latitude this was not because of any inherent merit or fitness in that line but because it had been accepted by the country as a settlement of the sectional question which thirty years before had threatened a rupture of the union and it had acquired in the public mind a * respect which it seemed unwise to disregard a majority however decided otherwise and the line of political conciliation was then obliterated as far as it lay in the power of congress to do so an analysis of the vote will show that this result was effected almost exclusively by the representatives of the north and that the south was not responsible for an action which proved to be the opening of pandoras box however objectionable it may have been in 1820 to adopt that political line as expressing a geographical definition of different sectional interests and however it may be condemned as the assumption by congress of a function not delegated to it it is to be remembered that the act had received such recognition and * by the people of the states as to give it a value which it did not originally possess pacification had been the fruit borne by the tree and it should not have been recklessly * down and cast into the fire the frequent assertion then made was that all discrimination was unjust and that the popular will should be left untrammeled in the formation of new states this theory was good enough in itself and as an abstract proposition could not be * but its practical operation has but poorly sustained the expectations of its advocates as will be seen when we come to consider the events that occurred a few years later in kansas and elsewhere * viewed under the mellowing light of time and with the calm consideration we can usually give to the irremediable past the compromise legislation of 1850 bears the impress of that sectional spirit so widely at variance with the general purposes of the union and so destructive of the harmony and mutual benefit which the constitution was intended to secure the refusal to divide the territory acquired from mexico by an extension of the line of the missouri compromise to the pacific was a consequence of the purpose to admit california as a state of the union before it had acquired the requisite population and while it was mainly under the control of a military organization sent from new york during the war with mexico and disbanded in california upon the restoration of peace the inconsistency of the argument against the extension of the line was exhibited in the division of the territory of texas by that parallel and payment to the state of money to secure her consent to the partition of her domain in the case of texas the north had everything to gain and nothing to lose by the application of the practice of geographical compromise on an arbitrary line in the case of california the conditions were reversed the south might have been the * and the north the * by a recognition of the same rule the compensation which it was alleged that the south received was a more effective law for the rendition of fugitives from service or labor but it is to be remarked that this law provided for the execution by the general government of obligations which had been imposed by the federal compact upon the several states of the union the benefit to be derived from a fulfillment of that law would be small in comparison with the evil to result from the plausible pretext that the states had thus been relieved from a duty which they had assumed in the adoption of the compact of union whatever tended to lead the people of any of the states to feel that they could be relieved from their constitutional obligations by transferring them to the general government or that they might thus or otherwise evade or resist them could not fail to be like the * which the enemy sowed amid the wheat the union of states formed to secure the permanent welfare of posterity and to promote harmony among the constituent states could not without changing its character survive such alienation as rendered its parts hostile to the security prosperity and happiness of one another it was reasonably argued that as the legislatures of fourteen of the states had enacted what were termed personal liberty laws which forbade the coperation of state officials in the rendition of fugitives from service and labor it became necessary that the general government should provide the requisite machinery for the execution of the law the result proved what might have been * those communities which had repudiated their constitutional obligations which had * a previous law of congress for the execution of a provision of the constitution and had murdered men who came peacefully to recover their property would evade or obstruct so as to render practically worthless any law that could be enacted for that purpose in the exceptional cases in which it might be executed the event would be attended with such conflict between the state and federal authorities as to produce consequent evils greater than those it was intended to correct it was during the progress of these memorable controversies that the south lost its most trusted leader and the senate its greatest and purest statesman he was taken from us when his intellectual power his administrative talent his love of peace and his devotion to the constitution might have averted collision or failing in that he might have been to the south the * to steer the bark in safety over the perilous sea truly did mr * personal friend although his greatest political * of him in his * address there was nothing * or low or * selfish that came near the head or the heart of mr calhoun his prophetic warnings speak from the grave with the wisdom of inspiration would that they could have been appreciated by his countrymen while he yet lived i had been * by the legislature of mississippi as my own successor and entered upon a new term of service in the senate on march 4 # on my return to mississippi in # the subject chiefly agitating the public mind was that of the compromise measures of the previous year consequent upon these was a proposition for a convention of delegates from the people of the southern states respectively to consider what steps ought to be taken for their future peace and safety and the preservation of their constitutional rights there was diversity of opinion with regard to the merits of the measures referred to but the disagreement no longer followed the usual lines of party division they who saw in those measures the * of disaster to the south had no settled policy beyond a convention the object of which should be to devise new and more effectual guarantees against the perils of usurpation they were unjustly charged with a desire to destroy the * feeling entertained by few very few if by any in mississippi and avowed by none there were many however who held that the principles of the declaration of independence and the purposes for which the union was formed were of higher value than the mere union itself independence existed before the compact of union between the states and if that compact should be broken in part and therefore destroyed in whole it was hoped that the liberties of the people in the states might still be preserved those who were most devoted to the union of the constitution might consequently be expected to resist most sternly any usurpation of undelegated power the effect of which would be to * the federal government from its proper character and by * the foundation to destroy the union of the states my recent * to the united states senate had conferred upon me for six years longer the office which i preferred to all others i could not therefore be suspected of desiring a nomination for any other office from the democratic convention the meeting of which was then drawing near having as a senator of the state freely participated in debate on the measures which were now exciting so much interest in the public mind it was very proper that i should visit the people in different parts of the state and render an account of my stewardship my devotion to the union of our fathers had been so often and so publicly declared i had on the floor of the senate so defiantly challenged any question of my fidelity to it my services civil and military had now extended through so long a period and were so generally * i felt quite assured that no * of envy or ill will could lead the people of mississippi to believe that i had dishonored their trust by using the power they had conferred on me to destroy the government to which i was accredited then as afterward i regarded the separation of the states as a great though not the greatest evil i returned from my tour among the people at the time appointed for the meeting of the * convention of the democratic or staterights party during the previous year the governor general john a quitman had been compelled to resign his office to answer an indictment against him for complicity with the * expeditions against cuba the charges were not sustained many of the democratic party of mississippi myself included recognized a consequent obligation to * him for the office of which he had been deprived when however the delegates met in party convention the committee appointed to select candidates on comparison of opinions concluded that in view of the effort to fix upon the party the imputation of a purpose of disunion some of the antecedents of general quitman might endanger success a proposition was therefore made in the committee on * that i should be invited to become a candidate and that if general quitman would withdraw my acceptance of the nomination and the resignation of my place in the united states senate which it was known would result was to be followed by the appointment by the governor of general quitman to the vacated place in the senate i offered no objection to this arrangement but left it to general quitman to decide he claimed the nomination for the * or nothing and was so nominated to promote the success of the democratic * i engaged actively in the canvass and continued in the field until stricken down by disease this occurred just before the election of delegates to a state convention for which provision had been made by the legislature and the canvass for which conducted in the main upon party lines was in progress simultaneously with that for the ordinary state officers the democratic majority in the state when the canvass began was estimated at eight thousand at this election in september for delegates to the state convention we were beaten by about seven thousand five hundred votes seeing in this result the * of almost inevitable defeat general quitman withdrew from the canvass as a candidate and the executive committee of the party empowered to fill * called on me to take his place my health did not permit me to leave home at that time and only about six weeks remained before the election was to take place but being assured that i was not expected to take any active part and that the party asked only the use of my name i consented to be announced and immediately resigned from the united states senate nevertheless i soon afterward took the field in person and worked earnestly until the day of election i was defeated but the majority of more than seven thousand votes that had been cast a short time before against the party with which i was associated was reduced to less than one thousand in this canvass both before and after i became a candidate no argument or appeal of mine was directed against the * of the union believing however that the signs of the time * danger to the south from the usurpation by the general government of undelegated powers i * that mississippi should enter into the proposed meeting of the people of the southern states to consider what could and should be done to insure our future safety frankly stating my conviction that unless such action were taken then sectional rivalry would * greater evils in the future and that if the controversy was postponed the last opportunity for a peaceful solution would be lost then the issue would have to be settled by blood happy in the peaceful pursuits of a planter busily engaged in cares for servants in the improvement of my land in building in rearing * and the like occupations the time passed pleasantly away until my retirement was interrupted by an invitation to take a place in the cabinet of mr pierce who had been elected to the presidency of the united states in november 1852 although warmly attached to mr pierce personally and entertaining the highest estimate of his character and political principles private and personal reasons led me to decline the offer this was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his inauguration which took place on the 4th of march 1853 while in washington on this visit i was induced by public considerations to reconsider my determination and accept the office of secretary of war the public records of that period will best show how the duties of that office were performed while in the senate i had advocated the construction of a railway to connect the valley of the mississippi with the pacific coast and when an appropriation was made to determine the most eligible route for that purpose the secretary of war was charged with its application we had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the united states the arguments which i had used as a senator were the military necessity for such means of transportation and the need of safe and rapid communication with the pacific slope to secure its continuance as a part of the union in the organization and equipment of these parties and in the selection of their officers care was taken to provide for securing full and accurate information upon every point involved in the determination of the route the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the * in like manner my advocacy while in the senate of an extension of the capitol by the construction of a new * and hall of representatives may have caused the appropriation for that object to be put under my charge as secretary of war during my administration of the war department material changes were made in the models of arms iron guncarriages were introduced and experiments were made which led to the casting of heavy guns hollow instead of * them after casting inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a * grain for artillery during the same period the army was increased by the addition of two regiments of infantry and two of cavalry the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life in making the selections from the army i was continually indebted to the assistance of that * and accurately informed officer colonel samuel cooper the adjutantgeneral of whom it may be proper here to say that although his life had been spent in the army and he of course had the likes and dislikes inseparable from men who are brought into close contact and occasional rivalry i never found in his official recommendations any indication of partiality or prejudice toward any one when the first list was made out to be submitted to the president a difficulty was found to exist which had not occurred either to colonel cooper or myself this was that the officers selected purely on their military record did not constitute a * * to that distribution among the different states which for political considerations it was thought desirable to * is to say the number of such officers of southern birth was found to be * great under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution this as i am happy to remember was the only occasion in which the current of my official action while secretary of war was disturbed in any way by sectional or political considerations under former * of the war office it had not been customary to make * or appointments upon political grounds except in the case of * to this usage i not only adhered but extended it to include the * also the chief clerk who had been removed by my predecessor had peculiar qualifications for the place and although known to me only officially he was restored to the position it will probably be conceded by all who are well informed on the subject that his restoration was a benefit to the public service the reader desirous for further information relative to the administration of the war department during this period may find it in the various official reports and estimates of works of defense prosecuted or recommended arsenals of construction and depots of arms maintained or suggested and * employed during the presidency of mr pierce # having been again elected by the legislature of mississippi as senator to the united states i passed from the cabinet of mr pierce on the last day of his term march 4 1857 to take my seat in the senate the administration of franklin pierce presents the only instance in our history of the continuance of a cabinet for four years without a single change in its personnel when it is remembered that there was much dissimilarity if not * of character among the members of that cabinet some idea may be formed of the power over men possessed and exercised by mr pierce chivalrous generous amiable true to his friends and to his faith frank and bold in the declaration of his opinions he never deceived any one and if treachery had ever come near him it would have stood abashed in the presence of his truth his * and his confiding simplicity the organization of the territory of kansas was the first question that gave rise to exciting debate after my return to the senate the celebrated kansasnebraska bill had become a law during the administration of mr pierce as this occupies a large space in the political history of the period it is proper to state some facts connected with it which were not public but were known to me and to others yet living the declaration often repeated in 1850 that climate and the will of the people concerned should determine their institutions when they should form a constitution and as a state be admitted into the union and that no legislation by congress should be permitted to interfere with the free exercise of that will when so expressed was but the announcement of the fact so firmly established in the constitution that sovereignty resided alone in the states and that congress had only delegated powers it has been sometimes contended that because the congress of the confederation by the ordinance of 1787 prohibited involuntary servitude in all the northwestern territory the framers of the constitution must have recognized such power to exist in the congress of the united states hence the deduction that the prohibitory clause of what is known as the missouri compromise was justified by the precedent of the ordinance of 1787 to make the action of the congress of the confederation a precedent for the congress of the united states is to overlook the great distinction between the two the congress of the confederation represented the states in their sovereignty and as such representatives had legislative executive and in some degree judicial power confided to it virtually it was an assemblage of the states in certain cases a majority of nine states were required to decide a question but there is no express limitation or restriction such as is to be found in the ninth and tenth amendments to the constitution of the united states the general government of the union is composed of three departments of which the congress is the legislative branch and which is checked by the * power of the judiciary and the veto power of the executive and above all is expressly limited in legislation to powers expressly delegated by the states if then it be admitted which is certainly * that the congress of the confederation had power to exclude slave property northwest of the ohio river that power must have been derived from its character as representing the states in their sovereignty for no indication of such a power is to be found in the articles of confederation if it be assumed that the absence of a prohibition was equivalent to the admission of the power in the congress of the confederation the assumption would avail nothing in the congress under the constitution where power is expressly limited to what had been delegated more briefly it may be stated that the congress of the confederation could like the legislature of a state do what had not been prohibited but the congress of the united states could only do what had been expressly permitted it is submitted whether this last position is not conclusive against the possession of power by the united states congress to legislate slavery into or exclude it from territories belonging to the united states this subject which had for more than a quarter of a century been one of angry discussion and sectional strife was revived and found occasion for renewed discussion in the organization of territorial governments for kansas and nebraska the committees on territories of the two houses agreed to report a bill in accordance with that recognized principle provided they could first be assured that it would receive favorable consideration from the president this agreement was made on saturday and the ensuing monday was the day and the only day for two weeks on which according to the order of business established by the rules of the house of representatives the bill could be introduced by the committee of that house on sunday morning the 22d of january 1854 gentlemen of each committee called at my house and mr douglas chairman of the senate committee fully explained the proposed bill and stated their purpose to be through my aid to obtain an interview on that day with the president to ascertain whether the bill would meet his approbation the president was known to be rigidly opposed to the reception of visits on sunday for the discussion of any political subject but in this case it was urged as necessary in order to enable the committee to make their report the next day i went with them to the executive mansion and leaving them in the * sought the president in his private apartments and explained to him the occasion of the visit he thereupon met the gentlemen patiently listened to the reading of the bill and their explanations of it decided that it rested upon sound constitutional principles and recognized in it only a return to that rule which had been * by the compromise of 1820 and the restoration of which had been foreshadowed by the legislation of 1850 this bill was not therefore as has been * asserted a measure inspired by mr pierce or any of his cabinet nor was it the first step taken toward the repeal of the conditions or obligations expressed or implied by the establishment in 1820 of the * line of thirtysix degrees and thirty minutes that compact had been virtually * in 1850 by the refusal of the representatives of the north to apply it to the territory then recently acquired from mexico in may 1854 the kansasnebraska bill was passed its purpose was declared in the bill itself to be to carry into practical operation the propositions and principles established by the compromise measures of 1850 the missouri compromise therefore was not repealed by that * virtual repeal by the legislation of 1850 was recognized as an existing fact and it was declared to be * and void it was added that the true intent and meaning of the act was not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states from the terms of this bill as well as from the arguments that were used in its behalf it is evident that its purpose was to leave the territories equally open to the people of all the states with every species of property recognized by any of them to permit climate and soil to determine the current of immigration and to secure to the people themselves the right to form their own institutions according to their own will as soon as they should acquire the right of selfgovernment that is to say as soon as their numbers should entitle them to organize themselves into a state prepared to take its place as an equal sovereign member of the federal union the claim afterward advanced by mr douglas and others that this declaration was intended to assert the right of the first settlers of a territory in its * * dependent and * condition to determine the character of its institutions constituted the doctrine popularly known as squatter sovereignty its assertion led to the dissensions which ultimately resulted in a rupture of the democratic party sectional rivalry the deadly foe of the domestic tranquillity and the general welfare which the compact of union was formed to insure now interfered with gigantic efforts to prevent that free migration which had been promised and to * the decision by climate and the interests of the inhabitants of the institutions to be established by these embryo states societies were formed in the north to supply money and send emigrants into the new territories and a famous preacher addressing a body of those emigrants charged them to carry with them to kansas the bible and * rifles the latter were of course to be * against the bosoms of their southern brethren who might * to the same territory but the use to be made of the bible in the same fraternal enterprise was left * by the reverend gentleman the warcry employed to train the northern mind for the deeds contemplated by the agitators was no extension of slavery was this sentiment real or feigned the number of slaves as has already been clearly shown would not have been increased by their transportation to new territory it could not be augmented by further importation for the law of the land made that * southern men were the leading authors of that enactment and the public opinion of their descendants stronger than the law fully sustained it the climate of kansas and nebraska was altogether * to the negro and the soil was not adapted to those productions for which negro labor could be profitably employed if then any negroes held to service or labor as provided in the compact of union had been transported to those territories they would have been such as were bound by personal attachment mutually existing between master and servant which would have rendered it impossible for the former to consider the latter as property convertible into money as white laborers adapted to the climate and its products flowed into the country negro labor would have inevitably become a tax to those who held it and their emancipation would have followed that condition as it has in all the northern states old or * furnishing the last example it may therefore be reasonably concluded that the warcry was employed by the artful to inflame the minds of the less informed and less * that it was adopted in utter disregard of the means by which negro emancipation might have been peaceably accomplished in the territories and with the sole object of obtaining sectional control and personal promotion by means of popular agitation the success attending this * was remarkable to such an extent was it made available that northern indignation was aroused on the absurd accusation that the south had destroyed that sacred instrument the compromise of 1820 the internecine war which raged in kansas for several years was substituted for the promised peace under the operation of the natural laws regulating migration to new countries for the * which dyed the virgin soil of kansas with the blood of those who should have stood shoulder to shoulder in * the wilderness for the * which * the ballotbox and made the name of election a * the authors of squatter sovereignty and the * of sectional hatred answer to the posterity for whose peace and happiness the fathers formed the federal compact in these scenes of strife were trained the * who afterward invaded virginia under the leadership of john brown and at this time * the sentiments which led men of high position to sustain with their influence and their money this murderous * into the south now was seen the lightning of that storm the distant muttering of which had been heard so long and against which the wise and the patriotic had given solemn warning regarding it as the sign which * a dissolution of the union diversity of interests and of opinions among the states of the confederation had in the beginning presented great difficulties in the way of the formation of a more perfect union the compact was the result of compromise between the states at that time generally distinguished as * and agricultural afterward as northern and southern when the first census was taken in 1790 there was but little numerical difference in the population of these two sections and including states about to be admitted there was also an exact equality in the number of states each section had therefore the power of * and might feel secure against any danger of federal aggression if the disturbance of that equilibrium had been the consequence of natural causes and the government of the whole had continued to be administered strictly for the general welfare there would have been no ground for complaint of the result under the old confederation the southern states had a large excess of territory the acquisition of louisiana of florida and of texas afterward greatly increased this excess the generosity and patriotism of virginia led her before the adoption of the constitution to * the northwest territory to the united states the missouri compromise surrendered to the north all the newly acquired region not included in the state of missouri and north of the parallel of thirtysix degrees and a half the northern part of texas was in like manner given up by the compromise of 1850 and the north having obtained by those successive * a majority in both houses of congress took to itself all the territory acquired from mexico thus by the action of the general government the means were provided permanently to destroy the original equilibrium between the sections nor was this the only injury to which the south was subjected under the power of congress to levy duties on imports tariff laws were enacted not merely to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states as authorized by the constitution but positively and * for the protection against foreign competition of domestic manufactures the effect of this was to impose the main burden of taxation upon the southern people who were * and not manufacturers not only by the enhanced price of imports but indirectly by the consequent depreciation in the value of exports which were chiefly the products of southern states the * of this grievance was unaccompanied by the consolation of knowing that the tax thus borne was to be paid into the public treasury for the increase of price * mainly to the benefit of the manufacturer nor was this all a reference to the annual appropriations will show that the * made were as unequal as the burdens * * in both operating in the same direction these causes all combined to direct immigration to the northern section and with the increase of its preponderance appeared more and more distinctly a tendency in the federal government to * functions delegated to it and to use them with sectional discrimination against the minority the resistance to the admission of missouri as a state in 1820 was evidently not owing to any moral or constitutional considerations but merely to political motives and the compensation exacted for granting what was simply a right was the exclusion of the south from equality in the enjoyment of territory which justly belonged equally to both and which was what the enemies of the south stigmatized as slave territory when acquired the sectional policy then indicated brought to its support the passions that spring from mans higher nature but which like all passions if * and perverted become hurtful and it may be destructive the year 1835 was marked by the public agitation for the abolition of that african servitude which existed in the south which * the union and had existed in every one of the states that formed the confederation by a great misconception of the powers belonging to the general government and the responsibilities of citizens of the northern states many of those citizens were little by little brought to the conclusion that slavery was a sin for which they were * and that it was the duty of the federal government to * it though at the date above referred to numerically so weak when compared with either of the political parties at the north as to excite no apprehension of their power for evil the public demonstrations of the abolitionists were violently rebuked generally at the north the party was * on account of the character of its leaders and the more odious because chief among them was an englishman one thompson who was supposed to be an emissary whose mission was to prepare the way for a dissolution of the union let us hope that it was reverence for the obligations of the constitution as the soul of the union that suggested lurking danger and rendered the supposed emissary for its destruction so odious that he was driven from a massachusetts hall where he attempted to lecture but bodies in motion will overcome bodies at rest and the * too often are led by captivating names far from the principles they revere thus by the activity of the * of abolitionism and the * of the sacred word liberty they recruited from the ardent worshipers of that goddess such numbers as gave them in many northern states the balance of power between the two great political forces that stood arrayed against each other then and there they came to be courted by both of the great parties especially by the whigs who had become the weaker party of the two fanaticism to which is usually accorded sincerity as an * of its mischievous tenets affords the best excuse to be offered for the original abolitionists but that can not be conceded to the political associates who joined them for the purpose of acquiring power with them it was but hypocritical cant intended to deceive hence arose the declaration of the existence of an irrepressible conflict because of the domestic institutions of sovereign selfgoverning * over which neither the federal government nor the people outside of the limits of such states had any control and for which they could have no moral or legal responsibility those who are to come after us and who will look without prejudice or excitement at the record of events which have occurred in our day will not fail to wonder how men professing and proclaiming such a belief should have so far imposed upon the credulity of the world as to be able to * to themselves the claim of being the special friends of a union contracted in order to insure domestic tranquillity among the people of the states united that they were the advocates of peace of law and of order who when taking an oath to support and maintain the constitution did so with a mental reservation to violate one of the provisions of that * of the conditions of the * which the union could never have been formed the tone of political morality which could make this possible was well indicated by the toleration accorded in the senate to the * * excuse for it given by one of its most eminent * thy servant a dog that he should do this * thereby not that it would be the part of a dog to violate his oath but to keep it in the matter referred to see appendix d the strife in kansas and the agitation of the territorial question in congress and throughout the country continued during nearly the whole of mr buchanans administration finally culminating in a disruption of the union meantime the changes or modifications which had occurred or were occurring in the great political parties were such as may require a word of explanation to the reader not already familiar with their history the names adopted by political parties in the united states have not always been strictly significant of their principles the old federal party inclined to * or consolidation rather than * of the states on the other hand the party originally known as republican and afterward as democratic can scarcely claim to have been * or exclusively such in the primary sense of these terms inasmuch as no party has ever avowed opposition to the general principles of government by the people the fundamental idea of the democratic party was that of the sovereignty of the states and the federal or confederate character of the union other elements have entered into its organization at different periods but this has been the vital cardinal and abiding principle on which its existence has been perpetuated the whig which succeeded the old federal party though by no means identical with it was in the main favorable to a strong central government therein * the * traditions connected with its name the * or american party which sprang into existence on the decadence of the whig organization based upon opposition to the alleged * of the political influence of * foreigners and of the roman catholic church had but a brief duration and after the presidential election of 1856 declined as rapidly as it had arisen at the period to which this narrative has advanced the freesoil which had now assumed the title of republican party had grown to a magnitude which threatened speedily to obtain entire control of the government based as has been shown upon sectional rivalry and opposition to the growth of the southern equally with the northern states of the union it had absorbed within itself not only the abolitionists who were avowedly agitating for the destruction of the system of negro servitude but other diverse and heterogeneous elements of opposition to the democratic party in the presidential election of 1856 their candidates fremont and * had received # of a total of # electoral votes representing a popular vote of # in a total of # the elections of the ensuing year 1857 exhibited a diminution of the socalled republican strength and the * congress which convened in december of that year was decidedly democratic in both branches in the course of the next two years however the kansas agitation and another cause to be presently noticed had so swollen the ranks of the socalled republicans that in the house of representatives of the * congress which met in december 1859 neither party had a decided majority the balance of power being held by a few members still adhering to the virtually extinct whig and american or * organizations and a still smaller number whose position was doubtful or irregular more than eight weeks were spent in the election of a speaker and a socalled republican mr * of new jersey was finally elected by a majority of one vote the senate continued to be decidedly democratic though with an increase of the socalled republican minority the cause above alluded to as contributing to the rapid growth of the socalled republican party after the elections of the year 1857 was the dissension among the democrats occasioned by the introduction of the doctrine called by its * and advocates popular sovereignty or nonintervention but more generally and more accurately known as squatter sovereignty its character has already been * stated in the preceding chapter its origin is generally attributed to general cass who is supposed to have suggested it in some general expressions of his celebrated * letter written in december 1847 on the 16th and 17th of may 1860 it became necessary for me in a debate in the senate to review that letter of mr cass from my remarks then made the following extract is taken whatever meaning the generally discreet and conservative statesman mr cass may have intended to convey it is not at all probable that he foresaw the extent to which the suggestions would be carried and the consequences that would result from it in the organization of a government for california in 1850 the theory was more distinctly advanced but it was not until after the passage of the kansasnebraska bill in 1854 that it was fully developed under the * and * genius of the hon stephen a douglas of illinois the leading part which that distinguished senator had borne in the authorship and advocacy of the kansasnebraska bill which affirmed the right of the people of the territories to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states had aroused against him a violent storm of denunciation in the state which he represented and other northern states he met it very manfully in some respects defended his action resolutely but in so doing was led to make such concessions of principle and to attach such an interpretation to the bill as would have rendered it practically * thing to keep the promise of peace to the ear and break it to the hope the constitution expressly * upon congress the power to admit new states into the union and also to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states under these grants of power the uniform practice of the government had been for congress to lay off and divide the common territory by convenient boundaries for the formation of future states to provide executive legislative and judicial departments of government for such territories during their temporary and provisional period of * to delegate to these governments such authority as might be * always to the supervision and controlling government of the congress finally at the proper time and on the attainment by the territory of sufficient strength and population for selfgovernment to receive it into the union on a footing of entire equality with the original * and selfgoverning all this is no more inconsistent with the true principles of popular sovereignty properly understood than the temporary subjection of a minor to parental control is inconsistent with the doctrines of the declaration of independence or the exceptional discipline of a manofwar or a military post with the principles of republican freedom the usual process of transition from a territorial condition to that of a state was in the first place by an act of congress authorizing the inhabitants to elect representatives for a convention to form a state constitution which was then submitted to congress for approval and ratification on such ratification the * control of congress was withdrawn and the new state authorized to assume its sovereignty and the inhabitants of the territory became citizens of a state in the cases of tennessee in 1796 and arkansas and michigan in 1836 the failure of the inhabitants to obtain an enabling act of congress before organizing themselves very nearly caused the rejection of their applications for admission as states though they were eventually granted on the ground that the subsequent approval and consent of congress could heal the prior * the entire control of congress over the whole subject of territorial government had never been questioned in earlier times necessarily * with the power of this * was of course the duty of exercising it for the safety of the persons and property of all citizens of the united states permanently or temporarily resident in any part of the domain belonging to the states in common * carried out the new theory of popular sovereignty would apply to the first adventurous pioneers settling in the wilderness before the organization of any territorial government by congress as well as afterward if sovereignty is inherent in a thousand or five thousand persons there can be no valid ground for denying its existence in a dozen as soon as they pass beyond the limits of the state governments the advocates of this novel doctrine however if rightly understood generally disavowed any claim to its application prior to the organization of a territorial government the territorial legislatures to which congress delegated a portion of its power and duty to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory were the mere agents of congress exercising an authority subject to congressional supervision and * authority conferred only for the sake of convenience and liable at any time to be revoked and * yet it is proposed to recognize in these provisional subordinate and temporary legislative bodies a power not possessed by congress itself this is to claim that the creature is endowed with an authority not possessed by the creator or that the stream has risen to an elevation above that of its source furthermore in contending for a power in the territorial legislatures permanently to determine the fundamental social and political institutions of the territory and thereby virtually to prescribe those of the future state the advocates of popular sovereignty were * those dependent and * bodies with powers far above any exercised by the legislatures of the fully organized and sovereign states the authority of the state legislatures is limited both by the federal constitution and by the respective state constitutions from which it is derived this latter limitation did not and could not exist in the territories strange as it may seem a theory founded on * so flimsy and leading to conclusions so paradoxical was advanced by eminent and experienced politicians and accepted by many persons both in the north and in the * so much perhaps from intelligent conviction as under the delusive hope that it would afford a satisfactory settlement of the irrepressible conflict which had been declared the terms popular sovereignty and nonintervention were plausible specious and captivating to the public ear too many lost sight of the * truth that political sovereignty does not reside in unorganized or partially organized masses of individuals but in the people of regularly and permanently constituted states as to the nonintervention proposed it meant merely the abnegation by congress of its duty to protect the inhabitants of the territories subject to its control the raid into virginia under john * notorious as a fanatical partisan leader in the kansas * in october 1859 a few weeks before the meeting of the * congress insignificant in itself and in its immediate results it afforded a startling revelation of the extent to which sectional hatred and political fanaticism had blinded the conscience of a class of persons in certain states of the union forming a party steadily growing stronger in numbers as well as in activity sympathy with its purposes or methods was earnestly disclaimed by the representatives of all parties in congress but it was charged on the other hand that it was only the natural * of doctrines and sentiments which for some years had been freely avowed on the floors of both houses a committee of the senate made a long and laborious investigation of the facts with no very important or satisfactory results in their final report june 15 1860 accompanying the evidence obtained and submitted this committee said on february 2 1860 the author submitted in the senate of the united states a series of resolutions afterward slightly modified to read as follows after a protracted and earnest debate these resolutions were adopted * on the 24th and 25th of may by a decided majority of the senate varying from thirtythree to thirtysix * against from two to twentyone * the democrats both northern and southern sustaining them * with the exception of one adverse vote that of mr * of ohio on the fourth and sixth resolutions the republicans all voted against them or refrained from voting at all except that mr * of new jersey voted for the fifth and seventh of the series mr douglas the leader if not the author of popular sovereignty was absent on account of illness and there were a few other absentees the conclusion of a speech in reply to mr douglas a few days before the vote was taken on these resolutions is introduced here as the best evidence of the position of the author at that period of excitement and agitation when at the close of the war of the revolution each of the thirteen colonies that had been engaged in that contest was severally acknowledged by the mothercountry great britain to be a free and independent state the confederation of those states embraced an area so extensive with climate and products so various that rivalries and conflicts of interest soon began to be manifested it required all the power of wisdom and patriotism animated by the affection engendered by common sufferings and dangers to keep these rivalries under restraint and to effect those compromises which it was fondly hoped would insure the harmony and mutual good offices of each for the benefit of all it was in this spirit of patriotism and confidence in the continuance of such abiding good will as would for all time * hostile aggression that virginia ceded for the use of the confederated states all that vast extent of territory lying north of the ohio river out of which have since been formed five states and part of a sixth the addition of these states has * entirely to the preponderance of the northern section over that from which the donation proceeded and to the disturbance of that equilibrium which existed at the close of the war of the revolution it may not be out of place here to refer to the fact that the grievances which led to that war were directly inflicted upon the northern colonies those of the south had no material cause of complaint but actuated by sympathy for their northern brethren and a devotion to the principles of civil liberty and community independence which they had inherited from their anglosaxon ancestry and which were set forth in the declaration of independence they made common cause with their neighbors and may at least claim to have done their full share in the war that ensued by the exclusion of the south in 1820 from all that part of the louisiana purchase lying north of the parallel of thirtysix degrees thirty minutes and not included in the state of missouri by the extension of that line of exclusion to embrace the territory acquired from texas and by the appropriation of all the territory obtained from mexico under the treaty of * * both north and south of that line it may be stated with approximate accuracy that the north had monopolized to herself more than three fourths of all that had been added to the domain of the united states since the declaration of independence this * which began as has been shown in the more generous than wise confidence of the south was employed to obtain for the north the lions share of what was afterward added at the cost of the public treasure and the blood of patriots i do not care to estimate the relative proportion contributed by each of the two sections nor was this the only cause that operated to disappoint the reasonable hopes and to blight the fair prospects under which the original compact was formed the effects of discriminating duties upon imports have been referred to in a former * the manufacturing region which was the north * the * region which was the south and so imposing upon the latter a double tax one by the increased price of articles of consumption which so far as they were of home production went into the pockets of the manufacturer the other by the diminished value of articles of export which was so much withheld from the pockets of the * in like manner the power of the majority section was employed to appropriate to itself an unequal share of the public * these combined * possession of more territory more money and a wider field for the employment of special * served to attract immigration and with increasing population the greed grew by what it fed on this became distinctly manifest when the socalled republican convention assembled in chicago on may 16 1860 to * a candidate for the presidency it was a purely sectional body there were a few delegates present representing an insignificant minority in the border states delaware maryland virginia kentucky and missouri but not one from any state south of the celebrated political line of thirtysix degrees thirty minutes it had been the invariable usage with * conventions of all parties to select candidates for the presidency and * one from the north and the other from the south but this assemblage nominated mr lincoln of illinois for the first office and for the second mr hamlin of * northerners mr lincoln its nominee for the presidency had publicly announced that the union could not permanently endure half slave and half free the resolutions adopted contained some carefully * declarations well adapted to deceive the credulous who were opposed to hostile * upon the rights of the states in order to accomplish this purpose they were compelled to create a fictitious issue in denouncing what they described as the new dogma that the constitution of its own force carries slavery into any or all of the territories of the united * dogma which had never been held or declared by anybody and which had no existence outside of their own assertion there was enough in connection with the nomination to assure the most fanatical foes of the constitution that their ideas would be the rule and guide of the party meantime the democratic party had held a convention composed as usual of delegates from all the states they met in charleston south carolina on april 23d but an unfortunate disagreement with regard to the declaration of principles to be set forth rendered a nomination impracticable both divisions of the convention adjourned and met again in baltimore in june then having finally failed to come to an agreement they separated and made their respective * apart mr douglas of illinois was nominated by the friends of the doctrine of popular sovereignty with mr fitzpatrick of alabama for the * both these gentlemen at that time were senators from their respective states mr fitzpatrick promptly declined the nomination and his place was filled with the name of mr * v johnson a distinguished citizen of georgia the convention representing the conservative or staterights wing of the * the president of which was the hon caleb cushing of massachusetts on the first ballot unanimously made choice of john c breckinridge of kentucky then vicepresident of the united states for the first office and with like unanimity selected general joseph lane then a senator from oregon for the second the resolutions of each of these two conventions denounced the action and policy of the abolition party as subversive of the constitution and revolutionary in their tendency another convention was held in baltimore about the same period by those who still adhered to the old whig party renforced by the remains of the american organization and perhaps some others this convention also consisted of delegates from all the states and * all geographical and sectional issues and declaring it to be both the part of patriotism and of duty to recognize no political principle other than the constitution of the country the union of the states and the enforcement of the laws pledged itself and its supporters to maintain protect and defend separately and * those great principles of public liberty and national safety against all enemies at home and abroad its * were messrs john bell of tennessee and edward everett of massachusetts both of whom had long been distinguished members of the whig party the people of the united states now had four rival tickets presented to them by as many contending parties whose respective position and principles on the great and absorbing question at issue may be briefly * as follows 1 the * party as it was now termed led by messrs bell and everett which ignored the territorial controversy altogether and contented itself as above stated with a simple declaration of adherence to the constitution the union and the enforcement of the laws 2 the party of popular sovereignty headed by douglas and johnson who affirmed the right of the people of the territories in their territorial condition to determine their own organic institutions independently of the control of congress denying the power or duty of congress to protect the persons or property of individuals or * in such territories against the action of majorities 3 the staterights party supporting breckinridge and lane who held that the territories were open to citizens of all the states with their property without any * or discrimination and that it was the duty of the general government to protect both persons and property from aggression in the territories subject to its control at the same time they admitted and asserted the right of the people of a territory on emerging from their territorial condition to that of a state to determine what should then be their domestic institutions as well as all other questions of personal or proprietary right without interference by congress and subject only to the limitations and restrictions prescribed by the constitution of the united states 4 the socalled republicans presenting the names of lincoln and hamlin who held in the language of one of their leaders that slavery can exist only by virtue of municipal law that there was no law for it in the territories and no power to enact one and that congress was bound to prohibit it in or exclude it from any and every federal territory in other words they asserted the right and duty of congress to exclude the citizens of half the states of the union from the territory belonging in common to all unless on condition of the sacrifice or abandonment of their property recognized by the * of the only species of their property distinctly and specifically recognized as such by that instrument on the vital question underlying the whole * is whether the federal government should be a government of the whole for the benefit of all its equal members or if it should continue to exist at all a sectional government for the benefit of a * first three of the parties above described were in substantial accord as against the fourth if they could or would have acted * they could certainly have carried the election and averted the catastrophe which followed nor were efforts wanting to effect such a union mr bell the whig candidate was a highly respectable and experienced statesman who had filled many important offices both state and federal he was not ambitious to the extent of * the presidency and he was profoundly impressed by the danger which threatened the country mr breckinridge had not anticipated and it may safely be said did not eagerly desire the nomination he was young enough to wait and patriotic enough to be willing to do so if the weal of the country required it thus much i may confidently assert of both those gentlemen for each of them authorized me to say that he was willing to withdraw if an arrangement could be effected by which the divided forces of the friends of the constitution could be concentrated upon some one more generally acceptable than either of the three who had been presented to the country when i made this announcement to mr * whom my relations had always been such as to authorize the assurance that he could not consider it as made in an unfriendly * replied that the scheme proposed was impracticable because his friends mainly northern democrats if he were withdrawn would join in the support of mr lincoln rather than of any one that should * him douglas that he was in the hands of his friends and was sure they would not accept the proposition it needed but little knowledge of the status of parties in the several states to foresee a probable defeat if the * were to continue divided into three parts and the * were to be held in solid column but angry passions which are always bad * had been aroused and hopes were still cherished which proved to be * the result was the election by a minority of a president whose avowed principles were necessarily fatal to the harmony of the union of # electoral votes mr lincoln received # but of the popular suffrage of # votes which the electors represented he obtained only #* over a third of the votes this discrepancy was owing to the system of voting by general * is casting the state votes as a unit whether unanimous or nearly equally divided thus in new york the total popular vote was # of which # were cast for the socalled republican or lincoln electors and # against them now york was entitled to 35 electoral votes divided on the basis of the popular vote 19 of these would have been cast for mr lincoln and 16 against him but under the general ticket system the entire 35 votes were cast for the republican candidates thus giving them not only the full strength of the majority in their favor but that of the great minority against them superadded so of other northern states in which the small majorities on one side operated with the weight of entire unanimity while the virtual unanimity in the southern states on the other side counted nothing more than a mere majority would have done the manifestations which followed this result in the southern states did not proceed as has been unjustly charged from chagrin at their defeat in the election or from any personal hostility to the presidentelect but from the fact that they recognized in him the representative of a party professing principles destructive to their peace their prosperity and their domestic tranquillity the * fire burst into frequent flame but it was still controlled by that love of the union which the south had illustrated in every battlefield from boston to new orleans still it was hoped against hope that some adjustment might be made to avert the calamities of a practical application of the theory of an irrepressible conflict few if any then doubted the right of a state to withdraw its grants delegated to the federal government or in other words to secede from the union but in the south this was generally regarded as the remedy of last resort to be applied only when ruin or dishonor was the alternative no rash or revolutionary action was taken by the southern states but the measures adopted were considerate and executed advisedly and deliberately the presidential election occurred as far as the popular vote which determined the result was concerned in november 1860 most of the state legislatures convened soon afterward in regular session in some cases special * were * for the purpose of calling state * recognized representatives of the sovereign will of the * be elected expressly for the purpose of taking such action as should be considered needful and proper under the existing circumstances these conventions as it was always held and understood possessed all the power of the people assembled in mass and therefore it was conceded that they and they only could take action for the withdrawal of a state from the union the consent of the respective states to the formation of the union had been given through such conventions and it was only by the same authority that it could properly be revoked the time required for this deliberate and formal process * the idea of hasty or passionate action and none who admit the primary power of the people to govern themselves can consistently deny its validity and binding obligation upon every citizen of the several states not only was there ample time for calm consideration among the people of the south but for due reflection by the general government and the people of the northern states president buchanan was in the last year of his administration his freedom from sectional * his long life in the public service and his * and conciliatory character were all guarantees against his precipitating a conflict between the federal government and any of the states but the feeble power that he possessed in the closing months of his term to * the policy of the future was painfully evident like all who had * and * studied the history of the formation of the constitution he held that the federal government had no rightful power to coerce a state like the sages and patriots who had preceded him in the high office that he filled he believed that our union rests upon public opinion and can never by cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war if it can not live in the affections of the people it must one day perish congress may possess many means of preserving it by conciliation but the sword was not placed in their hand to preserve it by * of december 3 1860 ten years before mr calhoun addressing the senate with all the earnestness of his nature and with that sincere desire to avert the danger of disunion which those who knew him best never doubted had asked the emphatic question how can the union be saved he answered his question thus during the ten years that intervened between the date of this speech and the message of mr buchanan cited above the progress of sectional discord and the tendency of the stronger section to unconstitutional aggression had been fearfully rapid with very rare exceptions there were none in 1850 who claimed the right of the federal government to apply coercion to a state in 1860 men had grown to be familiar with threats of driving the south into submission to any act that the government in the hands of a northern majority might see fit to perform during the canvass of that year demonstrations had been made by * organizations in various parts of the north which looked unmistakably to purposes widely different from those * in the preamble to the constitution and to the employment of means not authorized by the powers which the states had delegated to the federal government wellinformed men still remembered that in the convention which framed the constitution a proposition was made to authorize the employment of force against a delinquent state on which mr madison remarked that the use of force against a state would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might have been bound the convention expressly refused to confer the power proposed and the clause was lost while therefore in 1860 many violent men appealing to passion and the * of power were inciting the multitude and preparing northern opinion to support a war waged against the southern states in the event of their secession there were others who took a different view of the case notable among such was the new york tribune which had been the organ of the abolitionists and which now declared that if the cotton states wished to withdraw from the union they should be allowed to do so that any attempt to compel them to remain by force would be contrary to the principles of the declaration of independence and to the fundamental ideas upon which human liberty is based and that if the declaration of independence justified the secession from the british empire of three millions of subjects in 1776 it was not seen why it would not justify the secession of five millions of southerners from the union in 1861 again it was said by the same journal that sooner than compromise with the south and abandon the chicago platform they would let the union slide * expressions were freely * for example if the southern people wish to leave the union we will do our best to forward their views all this it must be admitted was quite consistent with the * declaration that the constitution was a covenant with hell which stood as the * of a leading abolitionist paper of boston that signs of coming danger so visible evidences of hostility so unmistakable disregard of constitutional obligations so wanton taunts and jeers so bitter and insulting should serve to increase excitement in the south was a consequence flowing as much from reason and patriotism as from sentiment he must have been ignorant of human nature who did not expect such a tree to bear fruits of discord and division in november 1860 after the result of the presidential election was known the governor of mississippi having issued his proclamation * a special session of the legislature to consider the propriety of calling a convention invited the senators and representatives of the state in congress to meet him for consultation as to the character of the message he should send to the legislature when assembled while holding in common with my political associates that the right of a state to secede was unquestionable i differed from most of them as to the probability of our being permitted peaceably to exercise the right the knowledge acquired by the administration of the war department for four years and by the * of the military committee of the senate at two different periods still longer in combined duration had shown me the entire lack of preparation for war in the south the * and armories were in the northern states and there were stored all the new and improved weapons of war in the arsenals of the southern states were to be found only arms of the old and rejected models the south had no * of powder and no navy to protect our harbors no * for foreign commerce it was evident to me therefore that if we should be involved in war the odds against us would be far greater than what was due merely to our inferiority in population believing that secession would be the precursor of war between the states i was consequently slower and more reluctant than others who entertained a different opinion to resort to that remedy while engaged in the consultation with the governor just referred to a telegraphic message was handed to me from two members of mr buchanans cabinet urging me to proceed immediately to washington this dispatch was laid before the governor and the members of congress from the state who were in conference with him and it was decided that i should comply with the summons i was afterward informed that my associates considered me too slow and they were probably correct in the belief that i was behind the general opinion of the people of the state as to the propriety of prompt secession on arrival at washington i found as had been anticipated that my presence there was desired on account of the influence which it was supposed i might exercise with the president mr buchanan in relation to his forthcoming message to congress on paying my respects to the president he told me that he had finished the rough draft of his message but that it was still open to revision and amendment and that he would like to read it to me he did so and very kindly accepted all the modifications which i suggested the message was however afterward somewhat changed and with great deference to the wisdom and statesmanship of its author i must say that in my judgment the last alterations were * much so that when it was read in the senate i was reluctantly constrained to criticise it compared however with documents of the same class which have since been addressed to the congress of the united states the reader of presidential messages must regret that it was not accepted by mr buchanans successors as a model and that his views of the constitution had not been adopted as a guide in the subsequent action of the federal government the popular movement in the south was tending steadily and rapidly toward the secession of those known as planting states yet when congress assembled on december 3 1860 the representatives of the people of all those states took their seats in the house and they were all represented in the senate except south carolina whose senators had tendered their resignation to the governor immediately on the announcement of the result of the presidential election hopes were still cherished that the northern leaders would appreciate the impending peril would cease to treat the warnings so often given as idle threats would refrain from the * so often and so unwisely indulged of ability to whip the south in thirty sixty or ninety days and would address themselves to the more manly purpose of devising means to allay the indignation and quiet the apprehensions whether well founded or not of their southern brethren but the debates of that session manifest on the contrary the arrogance of a triumphant party and the determination to reap to the * the full harvest of a party victory mr crittenden of kentucky the oldest and one of the most honored members of the senate introduced into that body a joint resolution proposing certain amendments to the * them the restoration and * into the constitution of the geographical line of the missouri compromise with other provisions which it was hoped might be accepted as the basis for an adjustment of the difficulties rapidly hurrying the union to disruption but the earnest appeals of that venerable statesman were unheeded by senators of the socalled republican party action upon his proposition was postponed from time to time on one pretext or another until the last day of the * seven states had already withdrawn from the union and established a confederation of their * it was then defeated by a majority of one vote meantime among other propositions made in the senate were two introduced early in the session which it may be proper specially to mention one of these was a resolution offered by mr powell of kentucky which after some modification by amendment when finally acted upon had taken the following form the other was a resolution offered by mr green of missouri to the following effect in the discussion of these two resolutions i find in the proceedings of the senate on december 10th as reported in the congressional globe some remarks of my own the reproduction of which will serve to exhibit my position at that * position which has since been often misrepresented the resolution of mr powell was eventually adopted on the 18th of december and on the 20th the committee was appointed consisting of messrs powell and crittenden of kentucky hunter of virginia toombs of georgia davis of mississippi douglas of illinois * of pennsylvania rice of minnesota * of vermont seward of new york wade of ohio * of wisconsin and * of iowa the first five of the list as here enumerated were southern men the next three were northern democrats or * the last five northern republicans so called the supposition was that any measure agreed upon by the representatives of the three principal divisions of public opinion would be approved by the senate and afterward ratified by the house of representatives the committee therefore determined that a majority of each of its three divisions should be required in order to the adoption of any proposition presented the southern members declared their readiness to accept any terms that would secure the honor of the southern states and guarantee their future safety the northern democrats and mr crittenden generally * with the staterights democrats of the south but the socalled republican senators of the north rejected every proposition which it was hoped might satisfy the southern people and check the progress of the secession movement after fruitless efforts continued for some ten days the committee determined to report the journal of their proceedings and announce their inability to attain any satisfactory conclusion this report was made on the 31st of * last day of that memorable and fateful year 1860 subsequently on the floor of the senate mr douglas who had been a member of the committee called upon the opposite side to state what they were willing to do he referred to the fact that they had rejected every proposition that promised pacification stated that toombs of georgia and davis of mississippi as members of the committee had been willing to renew the missouri compromise as a measure of conciliation but had met no responsive willingness on the part of their associates of the opposition and he pressed the point that as they had rejected every overture made by the friends of peace it was now incumbent upon them to make a positive and affirmative declaration of their purposes mr seward of new york as we have seen was a member of that * man who in 1858 had announced the irrepressible conflict and who in the same year speaking of and for abolitionism had said it has driven you back in california and in kansas it will invade your soil he was to be the secretary of state in the * administration and was very generally regarded as the power behind the throne greater than the throne itself he was present in the senate but made no response to mr douglass demand for a declaration of policy meantime the efforts for an adjustment made in the house of representatives had been equally fruitless conspicuous among these efforts had been the appointment of a committee of thirtythree * from each state of the * with a duty similar to that imposed upon the committee of thirteen in the senate but they had been alike unsuccessful in coming to any agreement it is true that a few days afterward they submitted a majority and two minority reports and that the report of the majority was ultimately adopted by the house but even if this action had been unanimous and had been taken in due time it would have been practically futile on account of its absolute failure to provide or suggest any solution of the territorial question which was the vital point in controversy no wonder then that under the shadow of the failure of every effort in congress to find any common ground on which the sections could be restored to amity the close of the year should have been darkened by a cloud in the firmament which had lost even the silver lining so long seen or thought to be seen by the hopeful the convention of south carolina had already on the 20th of december 1860 unanimously adopted an ordinance revoking her delegated powers and withdrawing from the union her representatives on the following day retired from their seats in congress the people of the other planting states had been only waiting in the lingering hope that some action might be taken by congress to avert the necessity for action similar to that of south carolina in view of the failure of all overtures for conciliation during the first month of the session they were now making their final preparations for secession this was generally admitted to be an unquestionable right * to their sovereignty as states and the only peaceable remedy that remained for the evils already felt and the dangers apprehended in the prior history of the country repeated instances are found of the assertion of this right and of a purpose entertained at various times to put it in execution notably is this true of massachusetts and other new england states the acquisition of louisiana in 1803 had created much dissatisfaction in those states for the reason expressed by an eminent citizen of massachusetts that the influence of our the northeastern part of the union must be diminished by the acquisition of more weight at the other extremity the project of a separation was freely discussed with no intimation in the records of the period of any idea among its advocates that it could be regarded as treasonable or revolutionary colonel timothy pickering who had been an officer of the war of the revolution afterward successively postmastergeneral secretary of war and secretary of state in the cabinet of general washington and still later long a representative of the state of massachusetts in the senate of the united states was one of the leading secessionists of his day writing from washington to a friend on the 24th of december 1803 he says in another letter written a few weeks afterward january 29 1804 speaking of what he regarded as wrongs and abuses perpetrated by the then existing administration he thus expresses his views of the remedy to be applied * south carolina for massachusetts virginia for new york georgia mississippi and alabama for new hampshire vermont and rhode island kentucky for new jersey etc etc we find the suggestions of 186061 only a reproduction of those thus outlined nearly sixty years earlier mr pickering seems to have had a correct and intelligent perception of the altogether pacific character of the secession which he proposed and of the mutual advantages likely to accrue to both sections from a peaceable separation writing in february 1804 he explicitly * the idea of hostile feeling or action toward the south expressing himself as follows such were the views of an undoubted patriot who had participated in the formation of the union and who had long been confidentially associated with washington in the administration of its government looking at the subject from a northern standpoint within fifteen years after the organization of that government under the constitution whether his reasons for advocating a dissolution of the union were valid and sufficient or not is another question which it is not necessary to discuss his authority is cited only as showing the opinion prevailing in the north at that day with regard to the right of secession from the union if deemed advisable by the ultimate and * judgment of the people of a sovereign state in 1811 on the bill for the admission of louisiana as a state of the union the hon josiah quincy a member of congress from massachusetts said mr * delegate from what was then the mississippi territory took exception to these expressions of mr quincy and called him to order the speaker mr * of massachusetts sustained mr * and decided that the suggestion of a dissolution of the union was out of order an appeal was taken from this decision and it was reversed mr quincy proceeded to vindicate the propriety of his position in a speech of some length in the course of which he said it is to be remembered that these * pickering quincy and * opinions and expressions have been cited were not democrats misled by extreme theories of state rights but leaders and * of the highest type of * and of a strong central government this fact gives their support of the right of secession the greater significance the celebrated hartford convention assembled in december 1814 it consisted of delegates chosen by the legislatures of massachusetts rhode island and connecticut with an irregular or imperfect representation from the other two new england states new hampshire and vermont convened for the purpose of considering the grievances complained of by those states in connection with the war with great britain they sat with closed doors and the character of their deliberations and discussions has not been * disclosed it was generally understood however that the chief subject of their considerations was the question of the withdrawal of the states they represented from the union the decision as announced in their published report was adverse to the expediency of such a measure at that time and under the then existing conditions but they proceeded to indicate the circumstances in which a dissolution of the union might become expedient and the mode in which it should be effected and their * plan of separation * very nearly with that actually adopted by the southern states nearly fifty years afterward they say the omission of the single word commercial which does not affect the principle involved is the only modification necessary to adapt this extract exactly to the condition of the southern states in 186061 the * which has attached to the members of the hartford convention has resulted partly from a want of exact knowledge of their proceedings partly from the secrecy by which they were veiled but mainly because it was a recognized effort to paralyze the arm of the federal government while engaged in a war arising from outrages committed upon american seamen on the decks of american ships the indignation felt was no doubt aggravated by the fact that those ships belonged in a great extent to the people who were now plotting against the * of the government and indirectly if not directly giving aid and comfort to the public enemy time which has * passion and revealed many things not then known has largely modified the first judgment passed on the proceedings and purposes of the hartford convention and but for the circumstances of existing war which surrounded it they might have been viewed as political opinions merely and have received justification instead of censure again in # the measures taken for the annexation of texas evoked remonstrances accompanied by threats of a dissolution of the union from the northeastern states the legislature of massachusetts in 1844 adopted a resolution declaring in behalf of that state that the commonwealth of massachusetts faithful to the compact between the people of the united states according to the plain meaning and intent in which it was understood by them is sincerely anxious for its preservation but that it is determined as it doubts not the other states are to submit to undelegated powers in no body of men on earth and that the project of the annexation of texas unless arrested on the threshold may tend to drive these states into a dissolution of the union early in the next year february 11 1845 the same legislature adopted and communicated to congress a series of resolutions on the same subject in one of which it was declared that as the powers of legislation granted in the constitution of the united states to congress do not embrace a case of the admission of a foreign state or foreign territory by legislation into the union such an act of admission would have no binding force whatever on the people of * which must have meant that the admission of texas would be a justifiable ground for secession unless it was intended to announce the purpose of nullification it is evident therefore that the people of the south in the crisis which confronted them in 1860 had no lack either of * or of precedent for their instruction and guidance in the teaching and the example of our brethren of the north and east the only practical difference was that the north threatened and the south acted at the period to which this review of events has advanced one state had already withdrawn from the union seven or eight others were preparing to follow her example and others yet were anxiously and * contemplating the probably impending necessity of taking the same action the efforts of southern men in congress aided by the coperation of the northern friends of the constitution had failed by the stubborn refusal of a haughty majority controlled by radical purposes to yield anything to the spirit of peace and conciliation this period * as it happens with the close of a calendar year affords a convenient point to pause for a brief * of the causes which had led the southern states into the attitude they then held and for a more full exposition of the constitutional questions involved the reader of many of the * on these events which have been put forth as historical if dependent upon such alone for information might naturally enough be led to the conclusion that the controversies which arose between the states and the war in which they culminated were caused by efforts on the one side to extend and perpetuate human slavery and on the other to resist it and establish human liberty the southern states and southern people have been sedulously represented as * of slavery and the northern as the defenders and champions of universal freedom and this view has been so * assumed so * asserted and so persistently reiterated that its authors have in many cases perhaps succeeded in bringing themselves to believe it as well as in impressing it widely upon the world the attentive reader of the preceding * if he has compared their statements with contemporaneous records and other original sources of * already have found evidence enough to enable him to discern the falsehood of these representations and to perceive that to whatever extent the question of slavery may have served as an occasion it was far from being the cause of the conflict i have not attempted and shall not permit myself to be drawn into any discussion of the merits or * of slavery as an ethical or even as a political question it would be foreign to my purpose irrelevant to my subject and would only * it has invariably served in the hands of its * darken counsel and divert attention from the genuine issues involved as a mere historical fact we have seen that african servitude among * the * and most humane of all institutions to which the name slavery has ever been * in all the original states and that it was recognized and protected in the fourth article of the constitution subsequently for climatic industrial and * moral or * it was abolished in the northern while it continued to exist in the southern states men differed in their views as to the abstract question of its right or wrong but for two generations after the revolution there was no geographical line of * for such differences the african slavetrade was carried on almost exclusively by new england merchants and northern ships mr * southern man the founder of the democratic party and the * of state * in theory a consistent enemy to every form of slavery the southern states took the lead in prohibiting the slavetrade and as we have seen one of them georgia was the first state to incorporate such a prohibition in her organic constitution eleven years after the agitation on the missouri question when the subject first took a sectional shape the abolition of slavery was proposed and earnestly debated in the virginia legislature and its advocates were so near the accomplishment of their purpose that a declaration in its favor was defeated only by a small majority and that on the ground of expediency at a still later period abolitionist lecturers and teachers were * assaulted and threatened with tar and feathers in new york pennsylvania massachusetts new hampshire connecticut and other states one of them * was actually killed by a mob in illinois as late as 1837 these facts prove * that the sectional hostility which exhibited itself in 1820 on the application of missouri for admission into the union which again broke out on the proposition for the annexation of texas in 1844 and which reappeared after the mexican war never again to be suppressed until its fell results had been fully accomplished was not the consequence of any difference on the abstract question of slavery it was the offspring of sectional rivalry and political ambition it would have manifested itself just as certainly if slavery had existed in all the states or if there had not been a negro in america no such pretension was made in 1803 or 1811 when the louisiana purchase and afterward the admission into the union of the state of that name elicited threats of disunion from the representatives of new england the complaint was not of slavery but of the acquisition of more weight at the other extremity of the union it was not slavery that threatened a rupture in 1832 but the unjust and unequal operation of a protective tariff it happened however on all these occasions that the line of * of sectional interests coincided exactly or very nearly with that dividing the states in which negro servitude existed from those in which it had been abolished it corresponded with the prediction of mr pickering in 1803 that in the separation certainly to come the white and black population would mark the * prediction made without any reference to slavery as a source of dissension of course the diversity of institutions contributed in some minor degree to the conflict of interests there is an action and reaction of cause and consequence which limits and * any general statement of a political truth i am stating general * * modifications and exceptions with the precision of a mathematical proposition or a bill in * the truth remains intact and * that the existence of african servitude was in no wise the cause of the conflict but only an incident in the later controversies that arose however its effect in operating as a * upon the passions prejudices or sympathies of mankind was so potent that it has been spread like a thick cloud over the whole horizon of historic truth as for the institution of negro servitude it was a matter entirely subject to the control of the states no power was ever given to the general government to interfere with it but an obligation was imposed to protect it its existence and validity were distinctly recognized by the constitution in at least three places first in that part of the second section of the first article which * that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union according to their respective members which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons including those bound to service for a term of years and excluding indians not taxed three * of all other persons other persons than free persons and those bound to service for a term of years must of course have meant those permanently bound to service secondly it was recognized by the ninth section of the same article which provided that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight this was a provision inserted for the protection of the interests of the * new england states forbidding any prohibition of the trade by congress for twenty years and thus virtually giving sanction to the * of the demand which that trade was prosecuted to supply and which was its only object again and in the third place it was specially recognized and an obligation imposed upon every state not only to refrain from interfering with it in any other state but in certain cases to aid in its enforcement by that clause or paragraph of the second section of the fourth article which provides as follows the president and vicepresident of the united states every senator and representative in congress the members of every state legislature and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states were required to take an oath or * to support the constitution containing these provisions it is easy to understand how those who considered them in conflict with the higher law of religion or morality might refuse to take such an oath or hold such an * the members of some religious sects refuse to take any oath at all or to bear arms in the service of their * it is impossible to reconcile with the obligations of honor or honesty the conduct of those who having taken such an oath made use of the powers and opportunities of the offices held under its sanctions to nullify its obligations and neutralize its guarantees the halls of congress afforded the vantageground from which assaults were made upon these guarantees the legislatures of various northern states enacted laws to * the execution of the provisions made for the rendition of fugitives from service state officials lent their aid to the work of * them and city mobs assailed the officers engaged in the duty of enforcing them with regard to the provision of the constitution above quoted for the restoration of fugitives from service or labor my own view was and is that it was not a proper subject for legislation by the federal congress but that its enforcement should have been left to the respective states which as parties to the compact of union should have been held accountable for its fulfillment such was actually the case in the earlier and better days of the republic no fugitive * existed or was required for two years after the organization of the federal government and when one was then passed it was merely as an incidental * to an act regulating the mode of rendition of fugitives from * from service or labor in 1850 a more elaborate law was enacted as part of the celebrated compromise of that year but the very fact that the federal government had taken the matter into its own hands and provided for its execution by its own officers afforded a sort of pretext to those states which had now become hostile to this provision of the constitution not only to stand aloof but in some cases to adopt measures generally known as personal liberty laws directly in conflict with the execution of the provisions of the constitution the preamble to the constitution declared the object of its founders to be to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity now however in 1860 the people of a portion of the states had assumed an attitude of avowed hostility not only to the provisions of the constitution itself but to the domestic tranquillity of the people of other states long before the formation of the constitution one of the charges preferred in the declaration of independence against the government of great britain as justifying the separation of the colonies from that country was that of having excited domestic insurrections among us now the mails were burdened with incendiary publications secret emissaries had been sent and in one case an armed invasion of one of the states had taken place for the very purpose of exciting domestic insurrection it was not the passage of the personal liberty laws it was not the circulation of incendiary documents it was not the raid of john brown it was not the operation of unjust and unequal tariff laws nor all combined that constituted the intolerable grievance but it was the systematic and persistent struggle to deprive the southern states of equality in the * to * in legislation against the interests of their people culminating in their exclusion from the territories the common property of the states as well as by the infraction of their compact to promote domestic tranquillity the question with regard to the territories has been discussed in the foregoing chapters and the argument need not be repeated there was however one feature of it which has not been specially noticed although it occupied a large share of public attention at the time and constituted an important element in the case this was the action of the federal judiciary thereon and the manner in which it was received in 1854 a case the wellknown * scott case came before the supreme court of the united states involving the whole question of the status of the african race and the rights of citizens of the southern states to * to the territories temporarily or permanently with their slave property on a footing of equality with the citizens of other states with their property of any sort this question as we have seen had already been the subject of long and energetic discussion without any satisfactory conclusion all parties however had united in declaring that a decision by the supreme court of the united statesthe highest judicial tribunal in the * be accepted as final after long and patient consideration of the case in 1857 the decision of the court was pronounced in an elaborate and * opinion delivered by chiefjustice * man eminent as a lawyer great as a statesman and stainless in his moral * of the nine judges who composed the court * in it the salient points established by this decision were instead of accepting the decision of this then august * ultimate authority in the interpretation of constitutional * conclusive of a controversy that had so long disturbed the peace and was threatening the perpetuity of the union it was * denounced and utterly disregarded by the northern agitators and served only to stimulate the intensity of their sectional hostility what resource for * assurance of * guarantee of * remained for the south still forbearing still hoping still striving for peace and union we waited until a sectional president nominated by a sectional convention elected by a sectional * that the vote of a minority of the * about to be * into office under the warning of his own distinct announcement that the union could not permanently endure half slave and half free meaning thereby that it could not continue to exist in the condition in which it was formed and its constitution adopted the leader of his party who was to be the chief of his cabinet was the man who had first proclaimed an irrepressible conflict between the north and the south and who had declared that abolitionism having triumphed in the territories would proceed to the invasion of the states even then the southern people did not finally despair until the temper of the triumphant party had been tested in congress and found adverse to any terms of reconciliation consistent with the honor and safety of all parties no alternative remained except to seek the security out of the union which they had vainly tried to obtain within it the hope of our people may be stated in a sentence it was to escape from injury and strife in the union to find prosperity and peace out of it the mode and principles of their action will next be presented when certain american colonies of great britain each acting for itself although in concert with the others determined to dissolve their political connection with the mothercountry they sent their representatives to a general congress of those colonies and through them made a declaration that the colonies were and of right ought to be free and independent states as such they contracted an alliance for their common defense successfully resisted the effort to reduce them to submission and secured the recognition by great britain of their separate independence each state being distinctly recognized under its own * as one of a group or nation that this was not merely a foreign view is evident from the second of the articles of confederation between the states adopted subsequently to the declaration of independence which is in these words each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power jurisdiction and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the united states in congress assembled these articles of confederation and perpetual union between the states as they were styled in their title were adopted by eleven of the original states in 1778 and by the other two in the course of the three years next ensuing and continued in force until 1789 during this period the general government was vested in the congress alone in which each state through its representatives had an equal vote in the determination of all questions whatever the congress exercised all the executive as well as legislative powers delegated by the states when not in session the general management of affairs was intrusted to a committee of the states consisting of one delegate from each state provision was made for the creation by the congress of courts having a certain specified jurisdiction in * and * cases and for the settlement of controversies between two or more states in a mode specifically prescribed the government thus constituted was found inadequate for some necessary purposes and it became requisite to reorganize it the first idea of such reorganization arose from the necessity of regulating the commercial intercourse of the states with one another and with foreign countries and also of making some provision for payment of the debt contracted during the war for independence these exigencies led to a proposition for a meeting of commissioners from the various states to consider the subject such a meeting was held at annapolis in september # but as only five states new york new jersey delaware pennsylvania and virginia were represented the commissioners declined to take any action further than to recommend another convention with a wider scope for consideration as they expressed it it was their unanimous conviction that it may essentially tend to advance the interests of the union if the states by whom they have been respectively delegated would themselves concur and use their endeavors to procure the * of the other states in the appointment of commissioners to meet at philadelphia on the second monday in may next to take into consideration the situation of the united states to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union and to report such an act for that purpose to the united states in congress assembled as when agreed to by them and afterward confirmed by the legislatures of every state will effectually provide for the same it is scarcely necessary to remind the wellinformed reader that the terms constitution of the federal government employed above and federal constitution as used in other proceedings of that period do not mean the instrument to which we now apply them and which was not then in existence they were applied to the system of government * in the articles of confederation this is in strict accord with the definition of the word constitution given by an eminent * the body of fundamental laws as contained in written documents or * usage which constitute the form of government for a nation state community association or society thus we speak of the british constitution which is an * system of * usage of the constitution of massachusetts or of mississippi which is the fundamental or organic law of a particular state embodied in a written instrument and of the federal constitution of the united states which is the fundamental law of an association of states at first as embraced in the articles of confederation and afterward as revised amended enlarged and embodied in the instrument framed in 1787 and subsequently adopted by the various states the manner in which this revision was effected was as follows acting on the suggestion of the annapolis convention the congress on the 21st of the ensuing february 1787 adopted the following resolution the language of this resolution substantially according with that of the recommendation made by the commissioners at annapolis a few months before very clearly defines the objects of the proposed convention and the powers which it was thought advisable that the states should confer upon their delegates these were solely and expressly as follows of course their action could be only advisory until ratified by the states the articles of confederation and perpetual union under which the states were already united provided that no alteration should be made in any of them unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states and afterward confirmed by the legislatures of every state the legislatures of the various states with the exception of rhode island adopted and proceeded to act upon these suggestions by the appointment of * of them immediately upon the recommendation of the annapolis commissioners in advance of that of the congress and the others in the course of a few months after the resolution adopted by congress the instructions given to these delegates in all cases conformed to the recommendations which have been quoted and in one case imposed an additional restriction or limitation as this is a matter of much importance in order to a right understanding of what follows it may be advisable to cite in detail the action of the several states * such passages as are specially significant of the duties and powers of the delegates to the convention the general assembly of virginia after reciting the recommendation made at annapolis enacted that seven commissioners be appointed by joint ballot of both houses of assembly who or any three of them are hereby authorized as deputies from this commonwealth to meet such deputies as may be appointed and authorized by other states to assemble in convention at philadelphia as above recommended and to join with them in devising and discussing all such alterations and further provisions as may be necessary to render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of the union and in reporting such an act for that purpose to the united states in congress as when agreed to by them and duly confirmed by the several states will effectually provide for the same the council and assembly of new jersey issued commissions to their delegates to meet such commissioners as have been or may be appointed by the other states of the union at the city of philadelphia in the commonwealth of pennsylvania on the second monday in may next for the purpose of taking into consideration the state of the union as to trade and other important objects and of devising such other provisions as shall appear to be necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies thereof the act of the general assembly of pennsylvania constituted and appointed certain deputies designated by name with powers to meet such deputies as may be appointed and authorized by the other states and to join with them in devising * on and discussing all such alterations and further provisions as may be necessary to render the federal constitution fully adequate to the exigencies of the union and in reporting such act or acts for that purpose to the united states in congress assembled as when agreed to by them and duly confirmed by the several states will effectually provide for the same the general assembly of north carolina enacted that commissioners should be appointed by joint ballot of both houses to meet and confer with such deputies as may be appointed by the other states for similar purposes and with them to discuss and decide upon the most effectual means to remove the defects of our federal union and to procure the enlarged purposes which it was intended to effect and that they report such an act to the general assembly of this state as when agreed to by them will effectually provide for the same in the case of this state alone nothing is said of a report to congress neither north carolina nor any other state however fails to make mention of the necessity of a submission of any action taken to the several states for ratification the commissions issued to the representatives of south carolina by the governor refer to an act of the legislature of that state authorizing their appointment to meet such deputies or commissioners as may be appointed and authorized by other of the united states at the time and place designated and to join with them in devising and discussing all such alterations clauses articles and provisions as may be thought necessary to render the federal constitution entirely adequate to the actual situation and future good government of the confederate states and to join in reporting such an act to the united states in congress assembled as when approved and agreed to by them and duly ratified and confirmed by the several states will effectually provide for the exigencies of the union in these commissions the expression alterations clauses articles and provisions clearly indicates the character of the duties which the deputies were expected to discharge the general assembly of georgia ordained the appointment of certain commissioners specified by name who were authorized as deputies from this state to meet such deputies as may be appointed and authorized by other states to assemble in convention at philadelphia and to join with them in devising and discussing all such alterations and further provisions as may be necessary to render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of the union and in reporting such an act for that purpose to the united states in congress assembled as when agreed to by them and duly confirmed by the several states will effectually provide for the same the authority conferred upon their delegates by the assembly of new york and the general court of massachusetts was in each case expressed in the exact words of the advisory resolution of congress they were instructed to meet the delegates of the other states for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation and reporting to congress and to the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as shall when agreed to in congress and confirmed by the several states render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of the union the general assembly of connecticut designated the delegates of that state by name and empowered them in conference with the delegates of other states to discuss upon such alterations and provisions agreeable to the general principles of republican government as they shall think proper to render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of the government and the preservation of the union and to report such alterations and provisions as may be agreed to by a majority of the united states in convention to the congress of the united states and to the general assembly of this state the general court of new hampshire authorized and empowered the deputies of that state in conference with those of other states to discuss and decide upon the most effectual means to remedy the defects of our federal union and to procure and secure the enlarged purposes which it was intended to * almost identical with that of north carolina but like the other states in general instructed them to report the result of their deliberations to congress for the action of that body and subsequent confirmation by the several states the delegates from maryland were appointed by the general assembly of that state and instructed to meet such deputies as may be appointed and authorized by any other of the united states to assemble in convention at philadelphia for the purpose of revising the federal system and to join with them in considering such alterations and further provisions * remainder of their instructions being in the same words as those given to the georgia delegates the instructions given to the deputies of delaware were substantially in accord with the * almost literally identical with those of * the following proviso was added so always and provided that such alterations or further provisions or any of them do not extend to that part of the fifth article of the confederation of the said states finally ratified on the first day of march in the year 1781 which declares that in determining questions in the united states in congress assembled each state shall have one vote rhode island as has already been mentioned sent no delegates from an examination and comparison of the enactments and instructions above quoted we may derive certain conclusions so obvious that they need only to be stated 1 in the first place it is clear that the delegates to the convention of 1787 represented not the people of the united states in mass as has been most absurdly contended by some political writers but the people of the several states as * as in the congress of that * with her sixty thousand inhabitants having entire equality with pennsylvania which had more than four hundred thousand or virginia with her seven hundred and fifty thousand 2 the object for which they were appointed was not to organize a new government but solely and expressly to amend the federal constitution already existing in other words to revise the articles of confederation and to suggest such alterations or additional provisions as should be deemed necessary to render them adequate to the exigencies of the union 3 it is evident that the term federal constitution or its equivalent constitution of the federal government was as freely and familiarly applied to the system of government established by the articles of * a league or compact between states expressly retaining their sovereignty and * to that amended system which was substituted for it by the constitution that superseded those articles 4 the functions of the delegates to the convention were of course only to devise deliberate and discuss no validity could attach to any action taken unless and until it should be afterward ratified by the several states it is evident also that what was contemplated was the process provided in the articles of confederation for their own * a recommendation by the congress and afterward ratification by the legislatures of every state before the amendment should be obligatory upon any the departure from this condition which actually occurred will presently be noticed when the convention met in philadelphia in may 1787 it soon became evident that the work before it would take a wider range and involve more radical changes in the federal constitution than had at first been contemplated under the articles of confederation the general government was obliged to rely upon the governments of the several states for the execution of its enactments except its own officers and employees and in time of war the federal army and navy it could exercise no control upon individual citizens with regard to the states no compulsory or coercive measures could be employed to enforce its authority in case of opposition or indifference to its exercise this last was a feature of the confederation which it was not desirable nor possible to change and no objection was made to it but it was generally admitted that some machinery should be devised to enable the general government to exercise its legitimate functions by means of a * authority operating directly upon the individual citizens within the limits of its constitutional powers the necessity for such provision was undisputed beyond the common ground of a recognition of this necessity there was a wide diversity of opinion among the members of the convention luther martin a delegate from maryland in an account of its proceedings afterward given to the legislature of that state * these differences as constituting three parties in the convention which he describes as follows in his account of the second party above described mr martin refers to those representatives of the larger states who wished to establish a numerical basis of representation in the congress instead of the equal representation of the states whether large or small which existed under the articles of confederation there was naturally much dissatisfaction on the part of the greater * pennsylvania north carolina and * population at that period exceeded that of all the others combined but which in the congress constituted less than one third of the voting strength on the other hand the smaller states were tenacious of their equality in the union of the very smallest one as we have seen had sent no representatives to the convention and the other had instructed her delegates unconditionally to insist upon the maintenance of absolute equality in the congress this difference gave more trouble than any other question that came before the convention and for some time threatened to prove * and to * any final agreement it was ultimately settled by a compromise provision was made for the representation of the people of the states in one branch of the federal legislature the house of representatives in proportion to their numbers in the other branch the senate for the equal representation of the states as such the perpetuity of this equality was furthermore guaranteed by a stipulation that no state should ever be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate without its own consent this compromise required no sacrifice of principle on either side and no provision of the constitution has in practice proved more entirely satisfactory it is not necessary and would be beyond the scope of this work to undertake to give a history of the proceedings of the convention of 1787 that may be obtained from other sources all that is requisite for the present purpose is to notice a few particulars of special significance or * to the subject of inquiry early in the session of the convention a series of resolutions was introduced by mr edmund randolph of virginia embodying a proposed plan of government which were considered in committee of the whole house and formed the basis of a protracted discussion the first of these resolutions as amended before a vote was taken was in these words this was followed by other * in all as adopted and reported by the * which the word national occurred twentysix times the day after the report of the committee was made mr ellsworth of connecticut moved to strike out the words national government in the resolution above quoted and to insert the words government of the united states which he said was the proper title he wished also the plan to go forth as an amendment of the articles of confederation that is to say he wished to avoid even the appearance of undertaking to form a new government instead of reforming the old one which was the proper object of the convention this motion was agreed to without opposition and as a consequence the word national was stricken out wherever it occurred and nowhere makes its appearance in the constitution finally adopted the prompt rejection after introduction of this word national is obviously much more expressive of the intent and purpose of the authors of the constitution than its mere absence from the constitution would have been it is a clear indication that they did not mean to give any countenance to the idea which * not killed has again reared its mischievous crest in these latter * the government which they organized was a consolidated nationality instead of a confederacy of sovereign members continuing their great work of revision and reorganization the convention proceeded to construct the * of a government for the confederacy strictly confined to certain specified and limited powers but complete in all its parts legislative executive and judicial and provided with the means for discharging all its functions without interfering with the sovereignty freedom and independence of the constituent states all this might have been done without going beyond the limits of their commission to revise the articles of confederation and to consider and report such alterations and provisions as might seem necessary to render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union a serious difficulty however was foreseen the thirteenth and last of the aforesaid articles had this provision which has already been referred to the articles of this confederation shall be * observed by every state and the union shall be perpetual nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states and be afterward confirmed by the legislatures of every state it is obvious from an examination of the records as has already been shown that the original idea in calling a convention was that their recommendations should take the course prescribed by this * a report to the congress and then if approved by that body a submission to the various legislatures for final action there was no reason to apprehend the * of congress in which a mere majority would determine the question but the consent of the legislatures of every state was requisite in order to final ratification and there was serious reason to fear that this consent could not be obtained rhode island as we have seen had declined to send any representatives to the convention of the three delegates from new york two had withdrawn and other indications of dissatisfaction had appeared in case of the failure of a single legislature to ratify the labors of the convention would go for naught under a strict adherence to the letter of the article above cited the danger of a total * of their efforts was imminent in this emergency the convention took the responsibility of * the limits of their instructions and recommending a * which was in direct * of the letter of the articles of confederation this was the introduction of a provision into the new constitution that the ratification of nine states should be sufficient for its establishment among themselves in order to * this provision it was necessary to refer it to authority higher than that of congress and the state * is to the people of the states assembled by their representatives in convention hence it was provided by the seventh and last article of the new constitution that the ratification of the conventions of nine states should suffice for its establishment between the states so ratifying the same there was another reason of a more general and perhaps more controlling character for this reference to conventions for ratification even if entire unanimity of the state legislatures could have been expected under the american theory of republican government conventions of the people duly elected and accredited as such are invested with the plenary power inherent in the people of an organized and independent community assembled in mass in other words they represent and exercise what is properly the sovereignty of the people state legislatures with restricted powers do not possess or represent sovereignty still less does the congress of a union or confederacy of states which is by two degrees removed from the seat of sovereignty we sometimes read or hear of delegated sovereignty divided sovereignty with other loose expressions of the same sort but no such thing as a division or delegation of sovereignty is possible in order therefore to supersede the * article above cited and to give the highest validity to the compact for the delegation of important powers and functions of government to a common agent an authority above that of the state legislatures was necessary mr madison in the federalist says it has been heretofore noted among the defects of the confederation that in many of the states it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification this objection would of course have applied with greater force to the proposed constitution which provided for additional grants of power from the states and the * of larger and more varied powers upon a general government which was to act upon individuals instead of states if the question of its confirmation had been submitted merely to the several state legislatures hence the obvious propriety of referring it to the respective people of the states in their sovereign capacity as provided in the final article of the constitution in this article provision was deliberately made for the secession if necessary of a part of the states from a union which when formed had been declared perpetual and its terms and articles to be * observed by every state opposition was made to the provision on this very * it was virtually a dissolution of the union and that it would furnish a precedent for future * mr * a distinguished member from * vicepresident of the united * if nine out of thirteen states can dissolve the compact six out of nine will be just as able to dissolve the future one hereafter mr madison who was one of the leading members of the convention advocating afterward in the federalist the adoption of the new constitution asks the question on what principle the confederation which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the states can be superseded without the unanimous consent of the parties to it he answers this question by recurring to the absolute necessity of the case to the great principle of * to the transcendent law of nature and of natures god which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed he proceeds however to give other grounds of justification mr madisons idea of the propriety of veiling any statement of the right of secession until the occasion arises for its exercise whether right or wrong in itself is eminently suggestive as explanatory of the caution exhibited by other statesmen of that period as well as himself with regard to that delicate truth the only possible alternative to the view here taken of the seventh article of the constitution as a provision for the secession of any nine states which might think proper to avail themselves of it from union with such as should refuse to do so and the formation of an amended or more perfect union with one another is to regard it as a provision for the continuance of the old union or confederation under altered conditions by the majority which should accede to them with a recognition of the right of the * minority to withdraw secede or stand aloof the idea of compelling any state or states to enter into or to continue in union with the others by coercion is as absolutely excluded under the one supposition as under the * reference to one state or a minority of states as well as with regard to a majority the article declares that the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this * between all * the states so ratifying the same it is submitted whether a fuller justification of this right of the nine states to form a new government is not found in the fact of the sovereignty in each of them making them a law unto themselves and therefore the final judge of what the necessities of each community demand * perhaps in advance of its proper place in the * attention of the reader may be directed to the refutation afforded by this article of the constitution of that astonishing fiction which has been put forward by some distinguished writers of later date that the constitution was established by the people of the united states in the aggregate if such had been the case the will of a majority duly ascertained and expressed would have been binding upon the minority no such idea existed in its formation it was not even established by the states in the aggregate nor was it proposed that it should be it was submitted for the acceptance of each separately the time and place at their own option so that the dates of ratification did extend from december 7 1787 to may 29 1790 the long period required for these * makes manifest the absurdity of the assertion that it was a decision by the votes of one people or one community in which a majority of the votes cast determined the result we have seen that the delegates to the convention of 1787 were chosen by the several states as * is hardly necessary to add that they voted in the convention as in the federal congress by * state casting one vote we have seen also that they were sent for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation and devising means for rendering the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union that the terms union united states federal constitution and constitution of the federal government were applied to the old confederation in precisely the same sense in which they are used under the new that the proposition to constitute a national government was distinctly rejected by the convention that the right of any state or states to withdraw from union with the others was practically exemplified and that the idea of coercion of a state or compulsory measures was distinctly excluded under any construction that can be put upon the action of the convention to the original copy of the constitution as set forth by its framers for the consideration and final action of the people of the states was attached the following words followed by the signatures of george washington president and * from virginia and the other delegates who signed it this attachment to the * mere attestation of its * and of the fact that it had the unanimous consent of all the states then present by their * of all the deputies for some of them refused to sign * been strangely construed by some * as if it were a part of the constitution and implied that it was done in the sense of completion of the work but the work was not done when the convention closed its labors and adjourned it was scarcely begun there was no validity or binding force whatever in what had been already done it was still to be submitted to the states for approval or rejection even if a majority of eight out of thirteen states had ratified it the refusal of the ninth would have rendered it null and void mr madison who was one of the most distinguished of its authors and * writing after it was completed and signed but before it was ratified said it is time now to recollect that the powers of the convention were merely advisory and * that they were so meant by the states and so understood by the convention and that the latter have accordingly planned and proposed a constitution which is to be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is written unless it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is * no * the mode and terms in which this approval was expressed will be considered in the next chapter the amended system of union or confederation the terms are employed indiscriminately and * by the statesmen of that period devised by the convention of 1787 and embodied as we have seen in the constitution which they framed and have set forth was now to be considered and acted on by the people of the several states this they did in the highest and most majestic form in which the sanction of organized communities could be given or * through * or legislatures or deputies with limited powers but through conventions of delegates chosen expressly for the purpose and clothed with the plenary authority of sovereign people the action of these conventions was deliberate cautious and careful there was much debate and no little opposition to be conciliated eleven states however ratified and adopted the new constitution within the twelve months immediately following its submission to them two of them positively rejected it and although they afterward acceded to it remained outside of the union in the exercise of their sovereign right which nobody then * carolina for nine months rhode island for nearly fifteen after the new government was organized and went into operation in several of the other states the ratification was effected only by small majorities the terms in which this action was expressed by the several states and the declarations with which it was accompanied by some of them are worthy of attention delaware was the first to act her convention met on december 3 1787 and ratified the constitution on the 7th the readiness of this least in population and next to the least in territorial extent of all the states to accept that instrument is a very significant fact when we remember the jealous care with which she had guarded against any * of her sovereign * delaware alone had given special instructions to her deputies in the convention not to consent to any sacrifice of the principle of equal representation in congress the promptness and unanimity of her people in adopting the new constitution prove very clearly not only that they were satisfied with the preservation of that principle in the federal senate but that they did not understand the constitution in any of its features as * the sovereignty freedom and independence which she had so especially cherished the ratification of their convention is expressed in these words this and twelve other like acts gave to the constitution all the life and validity it ever had or could have as to the thirteen united or associated states pennsylvania acted next december 12 1787 the ratification not being finally accomplished without strong opposition on grounds which will be referred to hereafter in announcing its decision the convention of this state began as follows in new jersey the ratification which took place on the 18th of december was unanimous this is no less significant and * than the unanimity of delaware from the fact that the new jersey delegation in the convention that framed the constitution had taken the lead in behalf of the federal or staterights idea in opposition to that of * or consolidation william patterson a distinguished citizen afterward governor of new jersey had introduced into that convention what was known as the jersey plan embodying these staterights principles as distinguished from the various national plans presented in defending them he had said after calling for the reading of the credentials of delegates again on a subsequent day after stating that he was not there to pursue his own sentiments of government but of those who had sent him he had asked the fact that this state which through her representatives had taken so conspicuous a part in the maintenance of the principle of state sovereignty ratified the constitution with such readiness and unanimity is conclusive proof that in her opinion that principle was not compromised thereby the conclusion of her ordinance of ratification is in these words georgia next and also unanimously on january 2 1788 declared through the delegates of the state of georgia in convention met * to the provisions of the act of the legislature aforesaid in virtue of the powers and authority given us them by the people of the said state for that purpose that they did fully and entirely assent to ratify and adopt the said constitution connecticut on the 9th of january declares her assent with equal distinctness of assertion as to the source of the authority in the name of the people of the state of connecticut we the delegates of the people of the said state in general convention assembled * to an act of the legislature in october last do assent to ratify and adopt the constitution reported by the convention of delegates in philadelphia in massachusetts there was a sharp contest the people of that state were * for a long time * tenacious of their state independence and sovereignty the proposed constitution was subjected to a close critical and rigorous examination with reference to its bearing upon this very point the convention was a large one and some of its leading members were very * of the instrument under their consideration it was ultimately adopted by a very close vote # to # and then only as accompanied by certain proposed amendments the object of which was to guard more expressly against any sacrifice or compromise of state sovereignty and under an assurance given by the advocates of the constitution of the certainty that those amendments would be adopted the most strenuously urged of these was that ultimately adopted in substance as the tenth amendment to the constitution which was intended to take the place of the second article of confederation as an emphatic assertion of the continued freedom sovereignty and independence of the states this will be considered more particularly hereafter in terms substantially identical with those employed by the other states massachusetts thus announced her ratification this was accomplished on february 7 1788 maryland followed on the 28th of april and south carolina on the 23d of may in equivalent expressions the ratification of the former being made by the delegates of the people of maryland speaking as they declared for ourselves and in the name and on the behalf of the people of this state that of the latter in convention of the people of the state of south carolina by their representatives in the name and behalf of the people of this state but south carolina like massachusetts demanded certain amendments and for greater assurance accompanied her ordinance of ratification with the following distinct assertion of the principle afterward embodied in the tenth amendment the delegates of the people of the state of new hampshire in convention on the 21st of june in the name and behalf of the people of the state of new hampshire declared their approval and adoption of the constitution in this state also the opposition was formidable the final vote being # to # and as in south carolina it was explicitly declared that all powers not expressly and particularly delegated by the aforesaid constitution are reserved to the several states to be by them exercised the debates in the virginia convention were long and animated some of the most eminent and most gifted men of that period took part in them and they have ever since been referred to for the exposition which they afford of the interpretation of the constitution by its authors and their contemporaries among the members were madison mason and randolph who had also been members of the convention at philadelphia mr madison was one of the most earnest advocates of the new constitution while mr mason was as warmly opposed to its adoption so also was patrick henry the celebrated orator it was assailed with great vehemence at every vulnerable or doubtful point and was finally ratified june 26 1788 by a vote of # to #* majority of only ten this ratification was expressed in the same terms employed by other states by the delegates of the people of virginia in the name and in behalf of the people of virginia in so doing however like massachusetts new hampshire and south carolina virginia demanded certain amendments as a more explicit guarantee against consolidation and accompanied the demand with the following declaration whether in speaking of a possible resumption of powers by the people of the united states the convention had in mind the action of such a people in the * community which did not exist and of which they could hardly have entertained even an ideal * of the people of virginia for whom they were speaking and of the other united states then taking similar * a question which scarcely admits of argument but which will be more fully considered in the proper place new york the eleventh state to signify her assent did so on july 26 1788 after an arduous and protracted discussion and then by a majority of but three *# to 27 even this small majority was secured only by the recommendation of certain material amendments the adoption of which by the other states it was at first proposed to make a condition precedent to the validity of the ratification this idea was abandoned after a correspondence between mr hamilton and mr madison and instead of * ratification new york provided for the resumption of her grants but the amendments were put forth with a circular letter to the other states in which it was declared that nothing but the fullest confidence of obtaining a revision of the objectionable features of the constitution and an invincible reluctance to separating from our sister states could have prevailed upon a sufficient number to ratify it without * for previous amendments the ratification was expressed in the usual terms as made by the delegates of the people of the state of new york in the name and in behalf of the people of the said state accompanying it was a declaration of the principles in which the assent of new york was conceded one paragraph of which runs as follows the acceptance of these eleven states having been signified to the congress provision was made for putting the new constitution in operation this was effected on march 4 1789 when the government was organized with george washington as president and john adams vicepresident the senators and representatives elected by the states which had acceded to the constitution organizing themselves as a congress meantime two states were standing as we have seen unquestioned and unmolested in an attitude of absolute independence the convention of north carolina on august 2 1788 had rejected the proposed constitution or more properly speaking had withheld her ratification until action could be taken upon the subjectmatter of the following resolution adopted by her convention more than a year afterward when the newly organized government had been in operation for nearly nine months and * no convention of the states had been called to revise the * carolina had good reason to feel assured that the most important provisions of her proposed amendments and declaration of rights would be adopted she acceded to the amended compact on november 21 1789 her convention agreed in behalf of the freemen citizens and inhabitants of the state of north carolina to adopt and ratify the constitution in rhode island the proposed constitution was at first submitted to a direct vote of the people who rejected it by an overwhelming majority * is on may 29 1790 when the reorganized government had been in operation for nearly fifteen months and when it had become reasonably certain that the amendments thought necessary would be * convention of the people of rhode island acceded to the new union and ratified the constitution though even then by a majority of only two votes in *# to # the ratification was expressed in substantially the same language as that which has now been so repeatedly cited it is particularly to be noted that during the intervals between the organization of the federal government under the new constitution and the ratification of that constitution by north carolina and rhode island respectively those states were absolutely independent and unconnected with any other political community unless they be considered as still representing the united states of america which by the articles of confederation had been declared a perpetual union the other states had seceded from the former * in a body but separately each for * had formed a new association leaving these two states in the attitude of foreign though friendly powers there was no claim of any right to control their action as if they had been mere geographical or political divisions of one great consolidated community or nation their accession to the union was desired but their freedom of choice in the matter was never questioned and then it is to be noted on their part that like the house of judah they refrained from any attempt to force the seceding sisters to return as illustrative of the relations existing during this period between the united states and rhode island it may not be * to refer to a letter sent by the government of the latter to the president and congress and transmitted by the president to the senate with the following note some extracts from the communication referred to are annexed the historical * of the last three chapters and the extracts from the records of a generation now departed have been presented as necessary to a right understanding of the nature and principles of the compact of 1787 on which depended the questions at issue in the secession of 1861 and the contest that ensued between the states we have seen that the united colonies when they declared their independence formed a league or alliance with one another as united states this title * the adoption of the articles of confederation it was assumed immediately after the declaration of independence and was continued under the articles of confederation the first of which declared that the style of this confederacy shall be the united states of america and this style was * * the formation of the present constitution the name was not adopted as * to or distinctive from confederate as some seem to have imagined if it has any significance now it must have had the same under the articles of confederation or even before they were adopted it has been fully shown that the states which thus became and continued to be united whatever form their union assumed acted and continued to act as distinct and sovereign political communities the monstrous fiction that they acted as one people in their aggregate capacity has not an atom of fact to serve as a basis to go back to the very beginning the british colonies never constituted one people judge story in his commentaries on the constitution seems to imply the contrary though he shrinks from a direct assertion of it and clouds the subject by a confusion of terms he says now it is apparent that none of the colonies before the revolution were in the most large and general sense independent or sovereign communities they were all originally settled under and subjected to the british crown and then he proceeds to show that they were in their colonial condition not * proposition which nobody disputed as colonies they had no claim and made no pretension to sovereignty they were subject to the british crown unless like the plymouth colony a law unto themselves but they were independent of each * only point which has any bearing upon their subsequent relations there was no other bond between them than that of their common allegiance to the government of the mothercountry as an illustration of this may be cited the historical fact that when john stark of * memory was before the revolution engaged in a hunting expedition in the indian country he was captured by the savages and brought to albany in the colony of new york for a ransom but inasmuch as he belonged to new hampshire the government of new york took no action for his release there was not even enough community of feeling to induce individual citizens to provide money for the purpose there were however local and partial * among the new england colonies long before the declaration of independence as early as the year # a congress had been organized of delegates from massachusetts plymouth new haven and connecticut under the style of the united colonies of new england the objects of this confederacy according to mr * were protection against the encroachments of the dutch and french security against the tribes of savages the liberties of the gospel in purity and in peace the general affairs of the company were intrusted to commissions two from each colony but the same historian tells us that to each its respective local jurisdiction was carefully reserved and he refers to this as evidence that the * of staterights was even then in existence thus remarkable for * simplicity he proceeds was the form of the first confederated government in america there was no president except as a * of its meetings and the larger state sic massachusetts superior to all the rest in territory wealth and population had no greater number of votes than new haven but the commissioners were in reality little more than a * body they possessed no executive power and while they could decree a war and a levy of troops it remained for the states to carry their votes into effect this confederacy continued in existence for nearly fifty years between that period and the year 1774 when the first continental congress met in philadelphia several other temporary and provisional associations of colonies had been formed and the people had been taught the advantages of union for a common purpose but they had never abandoned or compromised the great principle of community independence that form of selfgovernment * in the german forests before the days of the csars had given to that rude people a * and patriotism which first checked the flight of the roman eagles which elsewhere had been the emblem of their dominion over the known world this * great * of all * freedom and of mutual * transplanted by the * into england and there sustained those personal rights which after the fall of the * were almost obliterated by the encroachments of norman despotism but having the strength and perpetuity of truth and right were * by the mailed hands of the barons at * for their own benefit and that of their posterity englishmen the early settlers brought this idea to the wilds of america and it found expression in many forms among the infant colonies mr edward everett in his * address delivered in new york in 1861 following the lead of judge story and with even less caution boldly declares that before their independence of england was asserted they the colonies constituted a provincial people to sustain this * contrary to all history as it * is unable to * any valid american authority but * almost exclusively upon loose expressions employed in debate in the british parliament about the period of the american * as that people that loyal and respectable people this enlightened and spirited people etc etc the speakers who made use of this * phraseology concerning the inhabitants of a distant continent in the freedom of * debate were not framing their ideas with the * of a * treatise and could little have foreseen the extraordinary use to be made of their expressions nearly a century afterward in sustaining a theory contradictory to history as well as to common sense it is as if the familiar expressions often employed in our own time such as the people of africa or the people of south america should be cited by some ingenious * of a future generation as evidence that the subjects of the khedive and those of the king of * were but one people or that the * and the * belonged to the same political community mr everett it is true quotes two expressions of the continental congress to sustain his remarkable proposition that the colonies were a people one of these is found in a letter addressed by the congress to general gage in october 1774 * against the erection of fortifications in boston in which they say we entreat your excellency to consider what a tendency this conduct must have to * and force a free people hitherto well disposed to peaceable measures into hostilities from this expression mr everett argues that the congress considered themselves the representatives of a people but by reference to the proceedings of the congress he might readily have ascertained that the letter to general gage was written in behalf of the town of boston and province of massachusetts bay the people of which were considered by all america as suffering in the common cause for their noble and spirited opposition to oppressive acts of parliament the avowed object was to entreat his excellency from the assurance we have of the peaceable disposition of the inhabitants of the town of boston and of the province of massachusetts bay to discontinue his fortifications these were the people referred to by the congress and the children of the pilgrims who occupied at that period the town of boston and province of massachusetts bay would have been not a little astonished to be reckoned as one people in any other respect than that of the common cause with the roman catholics of maryland the * of virginia the quakers of pennsylvania or the baptists of rhode island the other * of mr everett is from the first sentence of the declaration of independence when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another etc etc this he says * the good people of the colonies as one people plainly it does no such thing the misconception is so palpable as scarcely to admit of serious answer the declaration of independence opens with a general proposition one people is equivalent to saying any people the use of the * one and another was the simple and natural way of stating this general proposition one people applies and was obviously intended to apply to all cases of the same * that of new hampshire or delaware or south carolina or of any other people existing or to exist and whether acting separately or in concert it applies to any case and all cases of dissolution of political bands as well as to the case of the british colonies it does not either directly or by implication assert their * and has no bearing whatever upon the question when the colonies united in sending representatives to a congress in philadelphia there was no * suggestion of a * * their separate individuality in one consolidated mass no such idea existed or with their known opinions could have existed they did not assume to become a united colony or province but styled themselves united * united for purposes of mutual counsel and defense as the new england colonies had been united more than a hundred years before it was as united statesnot as a state or united peoplethat these * distinct and politically independent of each * and achieved their independence of the mothercountry as united states they adopted the articles of confederation in which the separate sovereignty freedom and independence of each was distinctly asserted they were united states when great britain acknowledged the absolute freedom and independence of each distinctly and separately recognized by name france and spain were parties to the same treaty and the french and spanish * still express and perpetuate more exactly than the english the true idea intended to be embodied in the * * * or * * * states united it was without any change of * as united * any sacrifice of * any compromise of * the same parties entered into a new and amended compact with one another under the present constitution larger and more varied powers were conferred upon the common government for the purpose of * a more perfect * for that of destroying or * the integrity of the contracting members the point which now specially concerns the argument is the historical fact that in all these changes of circumstances and of government there has never been one single instance of action by the people of the united states in the aggregate or as one body before the era of independence whatever was done by the people of the colonies was done by the people of each colony separately and independently of each other although in union by their delegates for certain specified purposes since the assertion of their independence the people of the united states have never acted otherwise than as the people of each state severally and separately the articles of confederation were established and ratified by the several states either through conventions of their people or through the state legislatures the constitution which superseded those articles was framed as we have seen by delegates chosen and empowered by the several states and was ratified by conventions of the people of the same * acting in entire independence of one another this ratification alone gave it force and validity without the approval and ratification of the people of the states it would have been as mr madison expressed it of no more consequence than the paper on which it was written it was never submitted to the people of the united states in the aggregate or as a people indeed no such political community as the people of the united states in the aggregate exists at this day or ever did exist senators in congress * represent the states as equal * the house of representatives is not a body of representatives of the people of the united states as often erroneously asserted but the constitution in the second section of its first article expressly declares that it shall be composed of members chosen by the people of the several states nor is it true that the president and vicepresident are elected as it is sometimes vaguely stated by vote of the whole people of the union their election is even more unlike what such a vote would be than that of the representatives who in numbers at least represent the strength of their respective states in the election of president and vicepresident the constitution article ii * that each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors for the purpose of choosing a president and vicepresident the number of these electors is based partly upon the equal sovereignty partly upon the unequal population of the respective states it is then absolutely true that there has never been any such thing as a vote of the people of the united states in the aggregate no such people is recognized by the constitution and no such political community has ever existed it is equally true that no officer or department of the general government formed by the constitution * authority from a majority of the whole people of the united states or has ever been chosen by such majority as little as any other is the united states government a government of a majority of the mass the preamble to the constitution proposed by the convention of 1787 is in these words the phraseology of this preamble has been generally regarded as the stronghold of the advocates of consolidation it has been interpreted as meaning that we the people of the united states as a collective body or as a nation in our aggregate capacity had ordained and established the constitution over the states this interpretation constituted in the beginning the most serious difficulty in the way of the ratification of the constitution it was probably this to which that sturdy patriot samuel adams of massachusetts alluded when he wrote to richard henry lee i stumble at the threshold patrick henry in the virginia convention on the third day of the session and in the very opening of the debate attacked it vehemently he said speaking of the system of government set forth in the proposed constitution again on the next day with reference to the same subject he said when i asked that question i thought the meaning of my interrogation was obvious the fate of this question and of america may depend on this have they said we the states have they made a proposal of a compact between states if they had this would be a confederation it is otherwise most clearly a consolidated government the question turns sir on that poor little * expression we the people instead of the states of america the same difficulty arose in other minds and in other conventions the scruples of mr adams were removed by the explanations of others and by the assurance of the adoption of the amendments thought * of that * safeguard afterward embodied in the tenth * be referred to hereafter mr henrys objection was thus answered by mr madison it must be remembered that this was spoken by one of the leading members of the convention which formed the constitution within a few months after that instrument was drawn up mr madisons hearers could readily appreciate his clear answer to the objection made the people intended were those of the respective statesthe only organized communities of people exercising sovereign powers of government and the idea intended was the ratification and establishment of the constitution by direct act of the people in their conventions instead of by act of their legislatures as in the adoption of the articles of confederation the explanation seems to have been as satisfactory as it was simple and intelligible mr henry although he fought to the last against the ratification of the constitution did not again bring forward this objection for the reason no doubt that it had been fully answered indeed we hear no more of the interpretation which suggested it from that period for nearly half a century when it was revived and has since been employed to sustain that theory of a great consolidated national government which mr madison so distinctly repudiated but we have access to sources of information not then available which make the intent and meaning of the constitution still plainer when mr henry made his objection and mr madison answered it the journal of the philadelphia convention had not been published that body had sat with closed doors and among its rules had been the following we can understand by reference to these rules how mr madison should have felt precluded from making allusion to anything that had occurred during the proceedings of the convention but the secrecy then covering those proceedings has long since been removed the manuscript journal which was intrusted to the keeping of general washington president of the convention was deposited by him nine years afterward among the archives of the state department it has since been published and we can trace for ourselves the origin and ascertain the exact significance of that expression we the people on which patrick henry thought the fate of america might depend and which has been so grossly perverted in later years from its true intent the original language of the preamble reported to the convention by a committee of five appointed to prepare the constitution as we find it in the proceedings of august 6 1787 was as follows there can be no question here what was meant it was the people of the states designated by name that were to ordain declare and establish the compact of union for themselves and their posterity there is no * nor uncertainty in the language nor was there any difference in the convention as to the use of it the preamble as perfected was submitted to vote on the next day and as the journal informs us it passed unanimously in the affirmative there was no subsequent change of opinion on the subject the reason for the modification afterward made in the language is obvious it was found that unanimous ratification of all the states could not be expected and it was determined as we have already seen that the consent of nine states should suffice for the establishment of the new compact between the states so ratifying the same any nine would be sufficient to put the proposed government in operation as to them thus leaving the remainder of the thirteen to pursue such course as might be to each preferable when this conclusion was reached it became * impracticable to designate beforehand the consenting states by name hence in the final revision the specific enumeration of the thirteen states was omitted and the equivalent phrase people of the united states inserted in its * meaning the people of such states as should agree to unite on the terms proposed the imposing fabric of political delusion which has been erected on the basis of this simple transaction disappears before the light of historical record could the authors of the constitution have foreseen the perversion to be made of their obvious meaning it might have been prevented by an easy * as we the people of the states hereby united or something to the same effect the word people in 1787 as in 1880 was as it is a collective * employed indiscriminately either as a unit in such expressions as this people a free people etc or in a * sense as applied to the citizens or inhabitants of one state or country or a number of states or countries when the convention of the colony of virginia in 1774 instructed their delegates to the congress that was to meet in philadelphia to obtain a redress of those grievances without which the people of america can neither be safe free nor happy it was certainly not intended to convey the idea that the people of the american continent or even of the british colonies in america constituted one political community nor did edmund burke have any such meaning when he said in his celebrated speech in parliament in # the people of the colonies are descendants of englishmen we need go no further than to the familiar language of king jamess translation of the bible for multiplied illustrations of this * use of the term both in its collective and * senses for example king solomon prays at the dedication of the temple here we have both the singular and * senses of the same * people israel and all the people of the * two consecutive sentences in the people of the earth the word people is used precisely as it is in the expression the people of the united states in the preamble to the constitution and has exactly the same force and effect if in the latter case it implies that the people of massachusetts and those of virginia were mere fractional parts of one political community it must in the former imply a like unity among the philistines the egyptians the * * and * and all other people of the earth except the * scores of examples of the same sort might be cited if it were necessary in the declaration of independence we find precisely analogous instances of the employment of the singular form for both singular and * * people a free people in the former and the good people of these colonies in the latter judge story in the excess of his zeal in behalf of a theory of consolidation bases upon this last expression the conclusion that the assertion of independence was the act of the whole people of the united colonies as a unit overlooking or suppressing the fact that in the very same sentence the colonies declare themselves free and independent statesnot a free and independent * the words independent states three times if however the declaration of independence constituted one whole people of the colonies then that geographical section of it formerly known as the colony of maryland was in a state of revolt or rebellion against the others as well as against great britain from 1778 to 1781 during which period maryland refused to ratify or be bound by the articles of confederation which according to this theory was binding upon her as a majority of the whole people had adopted it a * north carolina and rhode island were in a state of rebellion in # while they declined to ratify and recognize the constitution adopted by the other eleven * of this united people yet no hint of any such * any claim of authority over them by the * any assertion of the supremacy of the * to be found in any of the records of that period it might have been unnecessary to bestow so much time and attention in exposing the absurdity of the * from a theory so false but for the fact that it has been specious enough to secure the countenance of men of such distinction as webster story and everett and that it has been made the plea to justify a bloody war against that principle of state sovereignty and independence which was regarded by the fathers of the union as the cornerstone of the structure and the basis of the hope for its perpetuity in the progressive growth of the government of the united states in power splendor patronage and consideration abroad men have been led to exalt the place of the government above that of the states which created it those who would understand the true principles of the constitution can not afford to lose sight of the essential * of idea invariably implied in the term united states wherever it is used in that instrument no such unit as the united states is ever mentioned therein we read that no title of nobility shall be granted by the united states and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall without the consent of congress accept etc the president shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the united states or any of them the laws of the united states and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority etc treason against the united states shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies the federal character of the union is expressed by this very phraseology which recognizes the distinct integrity of its members not as fractional parts of one great unit but as component * of an association so clear was this to contemporaries that it needed only to be pointed out to satisfy their scruples we have seen how effectual was the answer of mr madison to the objections raised by patrick henry mr * * of pennsylvania one of the ablest political writers of his generation in answering a similar objection said if the federal convention had meant to exclude the idea of * is of several and separate sovereignties joining in a * would have said we the people of america for union necessarily involves the idea of competent states which complete consolidation * more than forty years afterward when the gradual * to the power prestige and influence of the central government had grown to such extent as to begin to hide from view the purposes for which it was founded those very objections which in the beginning had been answered abandoned and thrown aside were brought to light again and presented to the country as * of the true meaning of the constitution mr webster one of the first to revive some of those early * so long ago refuted as to be almost forgotten and to breathe into them such renewed vitality as his commanding genius could * in the course of his wellknown debate in the senate with mr hayne in # said judge story about the same time began to advance the same theory but more * and with less rashness of statement it was not until thirty years after that it attained its full development in the * of * rather than statesmen two such may suffice as specimens mr edward everett in his address delivered on the 4th of july 1861 and already referred to says of the constitution that instrument does not purport to be a compact but a constitution of government it appears in its first sentence not to have been entered into by the states but to have been ordained and established by the people of the united states for themselves and their posterity the states are not named in it nearly all the characteristic powers of sovereignty are expressly granted to the general government and expressly prohibited to the states mr everett afterward repeats the assertion that the states are not named in it but a yet more extraordinary statement of the one people theory is found in a letter addressed to the london times in the same year 1861 on the causes of the civil war by mr john * motley afterward minister to the court of st james in this letter mr motley says of the constitution of the united states it would be very hard to * a more * amount of audacious and reckless falsehood in the same space in all mr * array of bold assertions there is not one single * it be perhaps that the constitution was not drawn up by the states yet it was drawn up by their delegates and it is of such material as this derived from writers whose reputation gives a semblance of * to their statements that history is constructed and transmitted one of the most * perhaps the least * these misstatements is that which is also twice repeated by mr * the name of no state is mentioned in the whole document or as he puts it the states are not named in it very little careful examination would have sufficed to find in the second section of the very first article of the constitution the names of every one of the thirteen then * states distinctly mentioned with the number of representatives to which each would be entitled in case of acceding to the constitution until a census of their population could be taken the mention there made of the states by name is of no special significance it has no bearing upon any question of principle and the denial of it is a purely * illustration of the recklessness of those from whom it proceeds and the low estimate put on the intelligence of those addressed it serves however to show how much credence is to be given to their authority as interpreters and * the reason why the names of the ratifying states were not mentioned has already been given it was simply because it was not known which states would ratify but as regards mention of the several states each state any state particular states and the like the constitution is full of it i am informed by one who has taken the pains to examine carefully that document with reference to this very point * including any mention of the united states or of foreign states and excluding also the * constitution in its original draft makes mention of the states as states no less than seventy times and of these seventy times only three times in the way of prohibition of the exercise of a power in fact it is full of * leave out all mention of the * make no mere verbal point or * but mean the states in their separate several distinct * what would remain would be of less account than the play of the prince of * with the part of hamlet omitted but leaving out of consideration for the moment all minor questions the vital and essential point of inquiry now is by what authority the constitution was ordained and established mr webster says it was done by the people of the united states in the aggregate mr everett repeats substantially the same thing and mr motley taking a step further says that it was ordained and established by a power superior to the * the people of the whole land in their aggregate capacity the advocates of this mischievous dogma assume the existence of an unauthorized undefined power of a whole people or people of the whole land operating through the agency of the philadelphia convention to impose its decrees upon the states they forget in the first place that this convention was composed of delegates not of any one people but of distinct states and in the second place that their action had no force or validity * the words of mr madison that it was of no more consequence than the paper on which it was * approved and ratified by a sufficient number of states the meaning of the preamble we the people of the united states do ordain and establish this constitution is ascertained fixed and defined by the final article the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same if it was already established what need was there of further establishment it was not ordained or established at all until ratified by the requisite number of states the announcement in the preamble of course had reference to that expected ratification without which the preamble would have been as void as the body of the instrument the assertion that it was not ratified by the states is so plainly and positively contrary to wellknown * inconsistent with the language of the constitution * it is hard to imagine what was intended by it unless it was to take advantage of the presumed ignorance of the subject among the readers of an english journal to impose upon them a preposterous fiction it was state ratification * ratification of the people of each state independently of all other peoplethat gave force vitality and validity to the constitution judge story referring to the fact that the voters assembled in the several states asks where else they could have * pertinent question on our theory but the idea he evidently intended to convey was that the voting of the people by states was a mere matter of geographical necessity or local convenience just as the people of a state vote by counties the people of a county by towns beats or precincts and the people of a city by wards it is hardly necessary to say that in all organized republican communities majorities govern when we speak of the will of the people of a community we mean the will of a majority which when constitutionally expressed is binding on any minority of the same community if then we can conceive and admit for a moment the possibility that when the constitution was under consideration the people of the united states were politically one * collective * * are clearly inevitable in the first place each geographical division of this great community would have been entitled to vote according to its relative population and in the second the expressed will of the legal majority would have been binding upon the whole a denial of the first proposition would be a denial of common justice and equal rights a denial of the second would be to destroy all government and establish mere anarchy now neither of these principles was practiced or proposed or even imagined in the case of the action of the people of the united states if they were one political community upon the proposed constitution on the contrary seventy thousand people in the state of delaware had precisely the same * * its ratification as seven hundred thousand and more in virginia or four hundred thousand in pennsylvania would not this have been an intolerable grievance and * no protest have been uttered against * these had been fractional parts of one community of people again while the will of the consenting majority within any state was binding on the opposing minority in the same no majority or majorities of states or people had any control whatever upon the people of another state the constitution was established not over the states as asserted by motley but between the states and only between the states so ratifying the same little rhode island with her seventy thousand inhabitants was not a mere fractional part of the people of the whole land during the period for which she held aloof but was as free independent and unmolested as any other sovereign power notwithstanding the majority of more than three millions of the whole people on the other side of the question before the ratification of the * there was some excuse for an imperfect understanding or misconception of the terms * madison thus answered in advance the objections made on the ground of this misconception and demonstrated its fallacy he wrote it is a tedious task to have to expose the misstatements both of fact and of principle which have occupied so much attention but it is rendered necessary by the extent to which they have been imposed upon the acceptance of the public through reckless assertion and confident and incessant repetition but the convention as we have seen said no such thing no such community as the people of the united states in the aggregate is known to it or ever acted on it it was ordained established and ratified by the people of the several states and no theories or assertions of a later generation can change or conceal this fixed fact as it stands revealed in the light of contemporaneous records i have habitually spoken of the federal constitution as a compact and of the parties to it as sovereign states these terms should not and in earlier times would not have required explanation or vindication but they have been called in question by the modern school of consolidation these gentlemen admit that the government under the articles of confederation was a compact mr webster in his rejoinder to mr hayne on the 27th of january # said again in his discussion with mr calhoun three years afterward he vehemently * the same denial of the constitution he says does it call itself a compact certainly not it uses the word compact but once and that when it declares that the states shall enter into no compact does it call itself a league a confederacy a * treaty between the states certainly not there is not a particle of such language in all its pages the artist who wrote under his picture the legend this is a horse made effectual provision against any such cavil as that preferred by mr webster and his followers that the constitution is not a compact because it is not so nominated in the bond as well as i can recollect there is no passage in the iliad or the * in which either of those great works calls itself or is called by its author an epic poem yet this would scarcely be accepted as evidence that they are not epic poems in an examination of mr * remarks i do not find that he announces them to be either a speech or an argument yet their claim to both these titles will hardly be * the verbal criticism on the constitution just quoted the distinction attempted to be drawn between the language proper to a confederation and that belonging to a constitution as indicating two different ideas will not bear the test of examination and application to the case of the united states it has been fully shown in previous chapters that the terms union federal union federal constitution constitution of the federal government and the like were * merely in * informal speech but in public proceedings and official * reference to the articles of confederation as freely as they have since been employed under the present constitution the former union * mr webster expressly * nobody * compact between states yet it nowhere calls itself a compact the word does not occur in it even the one time that it occurs in the present constitution although the contracting states are in both prohibited from entering into any treaty confederation or alliance with one another or with any foreign power without the consent of congress and the contracting or constituent parties are termed united states in the one just as in the other mr webster is particularly unfortunate in his criticisms upon what he terms the new vocabulary in which the constitution is styled a compact and the states which ratified it are spoken of as having acceded to it in the same speech last quoted he says repeating and reiterating in many forms what is substantially the same idea and attributing the use of the terms which he attacks to an ulterior purpose mr webster says in these and similar passages mr webster virtually * that if the constitution were a compact if the union were a confederacy if the states had as states severally acceded to * which propositions he * the sovereignty of the states and their right to secede from the union would be * now it happens that these very * confederacy accede and the * the terms in familiar use by the authors of the constitution and their associates with reference to that instrument and its ratification other writers who have examined the subject since the late war gave it an interest which it had never commanded before have collected such an array of evidence in this behalf that it is necessary only to cite a few examples the following language of mr * of massachusetts in the convention of 1787 has already been referred to if nine out of thirteen states can dissolve the compact six out of nine will be just as able to dissolve the new one hereafter mr gouverneur morris one of the most pronounced advocates of a strong central government in the convention said he came here to form a compact for the good of americans he was ready to do so with all the states he hoped and believed they all would enter into such a compact if they would not he would be ready to join with any states that would but as the compact was to be voluntary it is in vain for the eastern states to insist on what the southern states will never agree to mr madison while inclining to a strong government said in the case of a union of people under one constitution the nature of the * has always been understood etc mr hamilton in the federalist repeatedly speaks of the new government as a confederate republic and a confederacy and calls the constitution a compact see especially * * and * general * was not only the first president under the new constitution but who had presided over the convention that drew it * letters written soon after the adjournment of that body to friends in various states referred to the constitution as a compact or treaty and repeatedly uses the terms accede and accession and once the term secession he asks what the opponents of the constitution in virginia would do if nine other states should accede to the constitution luther martin of maryland informs us that in a committee of the general convention of 1787 protesting against the proposed violation of the principles of the perpetual union already formed under the articles of confederation he made use of such language as this it is needless to * the proofs that abound in the writings of the fathers to show that mr * new vocabulary was the very language they familiarly used let two more examples suffice from authority higher than that of any individual speaker or writer however * authority second only if at all inferior to that of the text of the constitution * is from the acts or ordinances of ratification by the states they certainly ought to have been conclusive and should not have been unknown to mr webster for they are the language of massachusetts the state which he represented in the senate and of new hampshire the state of his nativity the ratification of massachusetts is expressed in the following terms the ratification of new hampshire is expressed in precisely the same words save only the difference of date of the resolution of the legislature or general court referred to and also the use of the word state instead of commonwealth both distinctly accept it as a compact of the states with each * mr webster a son of new hampshire and a senator from massachusetts declared it was not and not only so but he repudiated the very vocabulary from which the words expressing the doctrine were taken it would not need however this abounding wealth of contemporaneous * does not require the employment of any particular words in the * prove that it was drawn up as a compact between sovereign states entering into a confederacy with each other and that they ratified and acceded to it separately severally and independently the very structure of the whole instrument and the facts attending its preparation and ratification would suffice the language of the final article would have been quite enough the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same this is not the language of a superior imposing a mandate upon subordinates the consent of the contracting parties is necessary to its validity and then it becomes not the acceptance and recognition of an authority over * mr motley * of a compact between them the simple word between is incompatible with any other idea than that of a compact by independent parties if it were possible that any doubt could still exist there is one provision in the constitution which * its character as a compact too plainly for cavil or question the constitution which had already provided for the representation of the states in both houses of congress thereby bringing the matter of representation within the power of amendment in its fifth article contains a stipulation that no state without its own consent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate if this is not a compact between the states the smaller states have no guarantee for the preservation of their equality of representation in the united states senate if the obligation of a contract does not secure it the guarantee itself is liable to amendment and may be swept away at the will of three fourths of the states without wrong to any * according to this theory there is no party of the second part the term sovereign or sovereignty says judge story is used in different senses which often leads to a confusion of ideas and sometimes to very mischievous and unfounded conclusions without any disrespect for judge story or any * of his great learning and ability it may safely be added that he and his disciples have contributed not a little to the increase of this confusion of ideas and the spread of these mischievous and unfounded conclusions there is no good reason whatever why it should be used in different senses or why there should be any confusion of ideas as to its meaning of all the terms employed in political science it is one of the most definite and intelligible the definition of it given by that accurate and lucid * * is simple and * sovereignty is a right of commanding in the last resort in civil society the original seat of this sovereignty he also declares to be in the people but he adds when once the people have transferred their right to a sovereign ie a monarch they can not without contradiction be supposed to continue still masters of it this is in strict accord with the theory of american republicanism the peculiarity of which is that the people never do transfer their right of sovereignty either in whole or in part they only delegate to their governments the exercise of such of its functions as may be necessary subject always to their own control and to * whenever such government fails to fulfill the purposes for which it was instituted i think it has already been demonstrated that in this country the only political * only independent corporate unit through which the people can exercise their sovereignty is the state minor * those of counties cities and * merely fractional * of the state and these do not affect the evidence that there was not such a political community as the people of the united states in the aggregate that the states were severally sovereign and independent when they were united under the articles of confederation is distinctly asserted in those articles and is admitted even by the extreme partisans of consolidation of right they are still sovereign unless they have surrendered or been divested of their sovereignty and those who deny the proposition have been vainly called upon to point out the process by which they have divested themselves or have been divested of it otherwise than by usurpation since webster spoke and story wrote upon the subject however the sovereignty of the states has been vehemently denied or explained away as only a partial imperfect mutilated sovereignty paradoxical theories of divided sovereignty and delegated sovereignty have arisen to create that confusion of ideas and * those mischievous and unfounded conclusions of which judge story speaks confounding the sovereign authority of the people with the delegated powers conferred by them upon their governments we hear of a government of the united states sovereign within its sphere and of state governments sovereign in their sphere of the surrender by the states of part of their sovereignty to the united states and the like now if there be any one great principle pervading the federal constitution the state constitutions the writings of the fathers the whole american system as clearly as the sunlight pervades the * system it is that no government is * all governments derive their powers from the people and exercise them in subjection to the will of the * a will expressed in any irregular lawless * manner but the will of the organized political community expressed through authorized and legitimate channels the founders of the american republics never conferred nor intended to confer sovereignty upon either their state or federal governments if then the people of the states in forming a federal union * to use * term * if they meant to surrender or * of their sovereignty to whom was the transfer made not to the people of the united states in the aggregate for there was no such people in existence and they did not create or constitute such a people by * of themselves not to the federal government for they disclaimed as a fundamental principle the sovereignty of any government there was no such surrender no such transfer in whole or in part expressed or implied they retained and intended to retain their sovereignty in its * and * but indeed says mr motley the words sovereign and sovereignty are purely * to the american system in the declaration of independence the provinces declare themselves free and independent states but the men of those days knew that the word sovereign was a term of feudal origin when their connection with a timehonored feudal monarchy was abruptly severed the word sovereign had no meaning for us if this be true the men of those days had a very extraordinary way of expressing their conviction that the word had no meaning for us we have seen that in the very front of their articles of confederation they set forth the conspicuous declaration that each state retained its sovereignty freedom and independence * state i believe of mr * nativity and * her original constitution drawn up by men of those days made this declaration new hampshire in her constitution as revised in # had * the same declaration except as regards the name of the state and the word state instead of commonwealth mr madison one of the most distinguished of the men of that day and of the advocates of the constitution in a speech already once referred to in the virginia convention of 1788 explained that we the people who were to establish the constitution were the people of thirteen sovereignties in the federalist he repeatedly * the * for example when he says do they the fundamental principles of the confederation require that in the establishment of the constitution the states should be regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns they are so regarded by the constitution proposed alexander * contemporary authority no less * in the federalist in the same paragraph he uses these terms sovereign and sovereignty * with reference to the states respectively and severally benjamin franklin advocated equality of suffrage in the senate as a means of securing the sovereignties of the individual states james wilson of pennsylvania said sovereignty is in the people before they make a constitution and remains in them and described the people as being thirteen independent sovereignties gouverneur morris who was as well as wilson one of the warmest advocates in the convention of a strong central government spoke of the constitution as a compact and of the parties to it as each enjoying sovereign power roger sherman of connecticut declared that the government was instituted by a number of sovereign states oliver ellsworth of the same state spoke of the states as sovereign bodies these were all eminent members of the convention which formed the constitution there was scarcely a statesman of that period who did not leave on record expressions of the same sort but why * citations it is very evident that the men of those days entertained very different views of sovereignty from those set forth by the new lights of our day far from considering it a term of feudal origin purely * to the american system they seem to have regarded it as a very vital principle in that system and of necessity belonging to the several * i do not find a single instance in which they applied it to any political organization except the states their ideas were in entire accord with those of * who in his chapter of nations or sovereign states writes every nation that * itself under what form * without any dependence on foreign power is a sovereign state in another part of the same chapter he gives a lucid statement of the nature of a confederate republic such as ours was designed to be he says what this celebrated author means here by a person is explained by a subsequent passage the law of nations is the law of sovereigns states free and independent are moral persons if any lingering doubt could have existed as to the reservation of their entire sovereignty by the people of the respective states when they organized the federal union it would have been removed by the adoption of the tenth amendment to the constitution which was not only one of the amendments proposed by various states when ratifying that instrument but the particular one in which they substantially agreed and upon which they most urgently insisted indeed it is quite certain that the constitution would never have received the assent and ratification of massachusetts new hampshire new york north carolina and perhaps other states but for a * assurance that the substance of this amendment would be adopted as soon as the requisite * could be complied with that amendment is in these words the full meaning of this article may not be as clear to us as it was to the men of that period on account of the confusion of ideas by which the term * enough to * since been obscured and also the * attendant upon the use of the little conjunction or which has been said to be the most * word in our language and for that reason has been excluded from * in the english courts the true intent and meaning of the provision however may be ascertained from an examination and comparison of the terms in which it was expressed by the various states which proposed it and whose ideas it was intended to embody massachusetts and new hampshire in their ordinances of ratification expressing the opinion that certain amendments and alterations in the said constitution would remove the fears and quiet the apprehensions of many of the good people of this commonwealth state new hampshire and more effectually guard against an undue administration of the federal government each recommended several such amendments putting this at the head in the following form of course those stanch republican communities meant the people of the statesnot their governments as something distinct from their people new york expressed herself as follows south carolina expressed the idea thus north carolina proposed it in these terms rhode island gave in her * assent to the constitution in full confidence that certain proposed amendments would be adopted the first of which was expressed in these words this was in may 1790 when nearly three years had been given to discussion and explanation of the new government by its founders and others when it had been in actual operation for more than a year and when there was every advantage for a clear understanding of its nature and principles under such circumstances and in the full confidence that this language expressed its meaning and intent the people of rhode island signified their accession to the confederate republic of the states already united no objection was made from any quarter to the principle asserted in these various forms or to the amendment in which it was finally expressed although many thought it unnecessary as being merely * of what would have been sufficiently obvious without itthat the functions of the government of the united states were strictly limited to the exercise of such powers as were expressly delegated and that the people of the several states retained all others is it compatible with reason to suppose that people so chary of the delegation of specific powers or functions could have meant to surrender or transfer the very basis and origin of all * inherent * this not by express grant but by implication mr everett following whether * or not in the line of mr * * objection to the term compact takes exception to the sovereignty of the states on the ground that the word sovereignty does not occur in the constitution he admits that the states were sovereign under the articles of confederation how could they relinquish or be deprived of their sovereignty without even a mention of * the tenth amendment * us with the declaration that nothing was surrendered by * everything was reserved unless expressly delegated to the united states or prohibited to the states here is an attribute which they certainly * nobody denies or can deny that they did * of which mr everett says no mention is made in the constitution in what conceivable way then was it lost or alienated much has been said of the prohibition of the exercise by the states of certain functions of sovereignty such as making treaties declaring war * money etc this is only a part of the general compact by which the contracting parties covenant one with another to abstain from the separate exercise of certain powers which they agree to intrust to the management and control of the union or general agency of the parties associated it is not a prohibition imposed upon them from without or from above by any external or superior power but is selfimposed by their free consent the case is strictly analogous to that of individuals forming a mercantile or manufacturing copartnership who voluntarily agree to refrain as individuals from engaging in other pursuits or speculations from lending their individual credit or from the exercise of any other right of a citizen which they may think proper to subject to the consent or intrust to the management of the firm the prohibitory clauses of the constitution referred to are not at all a denial of the full sovereignty of the states but are merely an agreement among them to exercise certain powers of sovereignty in concert and not separately and apart there is one other provision of the constitution which is generally adduced by the friends of centralism as antagonistic to state sovereignty this is found in the second clause of the sixth article as follows this enunciation of a principle which even if it had not been expressly declared would have been a necessary deduction from the acceptance of the constitution itself has been magnified and perverted into a meaning and purpose entirely foreign to that which plain interpretation is sufficient to discern mr motley thus * on the subject the mistake which mr * other writers of the same * is one which is disposed of by a very simple correction the states which ordained and established the constitution accepted nothing besides what they themselves prescribed they acknowledged no superior the supremacy was both in degree and extent only that which was delegated by the states to their common agent there are some other considerations which may conduce to a clearer understanding of this supremacy of the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof 1 in the first place it must be remembered that when the federal constitution was formed each then existing state already had its own constitution and code of statute laws it was no doubt * with reference to these that the provision was inserted and not in the expectation of future conflicts or * it is in this light alone that mr madison considers it in explaining and * it in the federalist 2 again it is to be observed that the supremacy accorded to the general laws of the united states is expressly limited to those enacted in conformity with the constitution or to use the exact language made in pursuance thereof mr hamilton in another chapter of the federalist calls particular attention to this saying and the italics are all his own that the laws of the confederacy as to the enumerated and legitimate objects of its jurisdiction will become the supreme law of the land and that the state functionaries will coperate in their observance and enforcement with the general government as far as its just and constitutional authority extends 3 in the third place it is not the government of the united states that is declared to be supreme but the constitution and the laws and treaties made in accordance with it the proposition was made in the convention to organize a government consisting of supreme legislative executive and judicial powers but it was not adopted its deliberate rejection is much more significant and conclusive than if it had never been proposed correction of so gross an error as that of confounding the government with the constitution ought to be superfluous but so crude and confused are the ideas which have been * on the subject that no misconception seems to be too absurd to be possible thus it has not been uncommon of late years to hear even in the highest places the oath to support the constitution which is taken by both state and federal officers spoken of as an oath to support the * obligation never imposed upon any one in this country and which the men who made the constitution with their recent reminiscences of the revolution the battles of which they had fought with * around their necks would have been the last to prescribe could any assertion be less credible than that they proceeded to institute another supreme government which it would be treason to resist this confusion of ideas pervades the treatment of the whole subject of sovereignty mr webster has said and very justly so far as these united states are concerned the sovereignty of government is an idea belonging to the other side of the atlantic no such thing is known in north america our governments are all limited in europe sovereignty is of feudal origin and imports no more than the state of the sovereign it * his rights duties * * and powers but with us all power is with the people they alone are sovereign and they erect what governments they please and confer on them such powers as they please none of these governments are sovereign in the european sense of the word all being restrained by written constitutions but the same intellect which can so clearly discern and so * define the general proposition seems to be covered by a cloud of thick darkness when it comes to apply it to the particular case in issue thus a little afterward we have the following it is surprising that such inconsistent ideas should proceed from a source so eminent its author falls into the very error which he had just before so distinctly pointed out in confounding the people of the states with their governments in the vehemence of his hostility to state sovereignty he * all of his disciples * even to comprehend that it means the sovereignty not of state governments but of people who make them with minds preoccupied by the unreal idea of one great people of a consolidated nation these gentlemen are blinded to the plain and primary truth that the only way in which the people ordained the constitution was as the people of states when mr webster says that in the constitution it is the people who speak and not the states he says what is untenable the states are the people the people do not speak never have spoken and never can speak in their sovereign capacity without a subversion of our whole system otherwise than as the people of states there are but two modes of expressing their sovereign will known to the people of this country one is by direct * mode adopted by rhode island in 1788 when she rejected the constitution the other is the method more generally pursued of acting by means of conventions of delegates elected expressly as representatives of the sovereignty of the people now it is not a matter of opinion or theory or speculation but a plain undeniable historical fact that there never has been any act or expression of sovereignty in either of these modes by that imaginary community the people of the united states in the aggregate usurpations of power by the government of the united states there may have been and may be again but there has never been either a sovereign convention or a direct vote of the whole people of the united states to demonstrate its existence as a corporate unit every exercise of sovereignty by any of the people of this country that has actually taken place has been by the people of states as states in the face of this fact is it not the merest * to admit the sovereignty of the people and deny it to the states in which alone they have community existence this subject is one of such vital importance to a right understanding of the events which this work is designed to record and explain that it can not be dismissed without an effort in the way of * and conclusion to make it clear beyond the possibility of misconception according to the american theory every individual is endowed with certain unalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he is entitled to all the freedom in these and in other respects that is consistent with the safety and the rights of others and the weal of the community but political sovereignty which is the source and origin of all the powers of * executive and * to and inheres in the people of an organized political community it is an attribute of the whole people of such a community it includes the power and necessarily the duty of protecting the rights and * the wrongs of individuals of punishing crimes enforcing contracts * rules for the transfer of property and the succession of estates making treaties with foreign powers levying taxes etc the enumeration of particulars might be extended but these will suffice as illustrations these powers are of course exercised through the agency of governments but the governments are only agents of the * to it and subject to its control this * people in the aggregate of each political * to the government the exercise of such powers or functions as it thinks proper but in an american republic never * or * sovereignty that remains * and unimpaired it is by virtue of this sovereignty alone that the government its authorized agent commands the obedience of the individual citizen to the extent of its * dependent and delegated authority the allegiance of the citizen is due to the sovereign alone thus far i think all will agree no american statesman or * would venture to dispute it notwithstanding the * or * expressions thrown out by some persons about the unity of the american people from the beginning no respectable authority has ever had the * to deny that before the adoption of the federal constitution the only sovereign political community was the people of the * people of each state the ordinary exercise of what are generally termed the powers of sovereignty was by and through their respective governments and when they formed a confederation a portion of those powers was intrusted to the general government or agency under the confederation the congress of the united states represented the collective power of the states but the people of each state alone possessed sovereignty and consequently were entitled to the allegiance of the citizen when the articles of confederation were amended when the new constitution was substituted in their place and the general government reorganized its structure was changed additional powers were conferred upon it and thereby * from the powers * exercised by the state governments but the seat of * source of all those delegated and dependent * not disturbed there was a new government or an amended * is entirely immaterial in which of these lights we consider itbut no new people was created or constituted the people in whom alone sovereignty inheres remained just as they had been before the only change was in the form structure and relations of their * agencies no doubt the statesthe people of the * they had been so disposed might have merged themselves into one great consolidated state retaining their geographical boundaries merely as matters of convenience but such a * must have been distinctly and formally stated not left to deduction or implication men do not alienate even an estate without positive and express terms and stipulations but in this case not only was there no express * formal * the * sovereignty but it was expressly provided that nothing should be understood as even * everything was reserved unless granted in express terms the monstrous conception of the creation of a new people invested with the whole or a great part of the sovereignty which had previously belonged to the people of each state has not a syllable to sustain it in the constitution but is built up entirely upon the palpable * of a single expression in the preamble in denying that there is any such collective unit as the people of the united states in the aggregate of course i am not to be understood as denying that there is such a political organization as the united states or that there exists with large and distinct powers a government of the united states but it is claimed that the union as its name implies is constituted of states as a british author referring to the old * system has expressed the same idea the states are the * the united states the * which results from them the government of the united states * its existence from the same source and exercises its functions by the will of the same sovereignty that creates and * authority upon the state governments the people of each state are in either case the source the only difference is that in the creation of the state governments each sovereign acted alone in that of the federal government they acted in coperation with the others neither the whole nor any part of their sovereignty has been surrendered to either government to whom in fine could the states have surrendered their sovereignty not to the mass of the people * the territory possessed by all the states for there was no such community in existence and they took no measures for the organization of such a community if they had intended to do so the very style united states would have been a palpable misnomer nor would treason have been defined as levying war against them could it have been transferred to the government of the union clearly not in accordance with the ideas and principles of those who made the declaration of independence adopted the articles of confederation and established the constitution of the united states for in each and all of these the cornerstone is the inherent and inalienable sovereignty of the people to have transferred sovereignty from the people to a government would have been to have fought the battles of the revolution in * for the freedom and independence of the states but for a mere change of masters such a thought or purpose could not have been in the heads or hearts of those who * the union and could have found * only when the ebbing tide of patriotism and fraternity had swept away the landmarks which they erected who sought by the compact of union to secure and perpetuate the liberties then possessed the men who had won at great cost the independence of their respective states were deeply impressed with the value of union but they could never have consented like the base * to fling away the priceless pearl of state sovereignty for any possible alliance looking back for a moment at the ground over which we have gone i think it may be fairly asserted that the following propositions have been clearly and fully established 1 that the states of which the american union was formed from the moment when they emerged from their colonial or provincial condition became severally sovereign free and independent statesnot one state or nation 2 that the union formed under the articles of confederation was a compact between the states in which these attributes of sovereignty freedom and independence were expressly asserted and guaranteed 3 that in forming the more perfect union of the constitution afterward adopted the same contracting powers formed an amended compact without any surrender of these attributes of sovereignty freedom and independence either expressed or implied on the contrary that by the tenth amendment to the constitution * the power of the government to its express grants they distinctly guarded against the presumption of a surrender of anything by implication 4 that political sovereignty resides neither in individual citizens nor in unorganized masses nor in fractional * of a community but in the people of an organized political body 5 that no republican form of government in the sense in which that expression is used in the constitution and was generally understood by the founders of the * it be the government of a state or of a confederation of * possessed of any sovereignty whatever but merely exercises certain powers delegated by the sovereign authority of the people and subject to recall and * by the same authority that conferred them 6 that the people who organized the first confederation the people who dissolved it the people who ordained and established the constitution which succeeded it the only people in fine known or referred to in the phraseology of that * the term was used collectively or * the people of the respective states each acting separately and with absolute independence of the others 7 that in forming and adopting the constitution the states or the people of the * which when used with reference to acts performed in a sovereign capacity are precisely equivalent to each * a new government but no new people and that consequently no new sovereignty was * sovereignty in an american republic can belong only to a people never to a * that the federal government is entitled to exercise only the powers delegated to it by the people of the respective states 8 that the term people in the preamble to the constitution and in the tenth amendment is used * that the only people of the united states known to the constitution are the people of each state in the union that no such political community or corporate unit as one people of the united states then existed has ever been organized or yet exists and that no political action by the people of the united states in the aggregate has ever taken place or ever can take place under the constitution the fictitious idea of one people of the united states contradicted in the last paragraph has been so impressed upon the popular mind by false teaching by careless and vicious phraseology and by the * spectacle of a great government with its army and navy its * and * its multitude of * and the splendid prizes which it offers to political ambition that the tearing away of these illusions and presentation of the original fabric which they have overgrown and hidden from view have no doubt been unwelcome distasteful and even repellent to some of my readers the artificial splendor which makes the deception attractive is even employed as an argument to prove its reality the glitter of the powers delegated to the agent serves to obscure the perception of the sovereign power of the principal by whom they are conferred as by the * eye the * costume and conspicuous functions of the * are mistaken for * of * the * or ambiguous use of the term union and its * * to increase the confusion so much the more need for insisting upon the * truths which have been obscured by these specious * the reader really desirous of ascertaining truth is therefore again cautioned against confounding two ideas so essentially distinct as that of government which is * dependent and subordinate with that of the people as an organized political community which is sovereign without any other than selfimposed limitations and such as proceed from the general principles of the personal rights of man it has been said in a foregoing chapter that the authors of the constitution could scarcely have anticipated the idea of such a community as the people of the united states in one mass perhaps this expression needs some little * for there is rarely a fallacy however stupendous that is wholly original a careful examination of the records of the convention of 1787 exhibits one or perhaps two instances of such a * by the same * the result in each case is strikingly significant the original proposition made concerning the office of president of the united states contemplated his election by the congress or as it was termed by the * the national legislature on the 17th of july this proposition being under consideration mr gouverneur morris moved that the words national legislature be stricken out and citizens of the united states inserted the proposition was supported by mr james * of these gentlemen being delegates from pennsylvania and both among the most earnest advocates of centralism in the convention now it is not at all certain that mr morris had in view an election by the citizens of the united states in the aggregate voting as one people the language of his proposition is entirely consistent with the idea of as election by the citizens of each state voting separately and independently though it is ambiguous and may admit of the other construction but this is immaterial the proposition was submitted to a vote and received the approval of only one * of which mr morris and mr wilson were both representatives nine states voted against it six days afterward july 23d in a discussion of the proposed ratification of the constitution by conventions of the people of each state mr gouverneur * we learn from mr * that the reference of the plan ie of the proposed constitution be made to one general convention chosen and authorized by the people to consider amend and establish the same here the issue seems to have been more distinctly made between the two ideas of people of the states and one people in the aggregate the fate of the latter is briefly recorded in the two words not seconded mr morris was a man of distinguished ability great personal influence and undoubted patriotism but out of all that * as it did such admitted friends of centralism as hamilton king wilson randolph pinckney and * was not one to sustain him in the proposition to incorporate into the constitution that theory which now * the theory on which was waged the late bloody war which was called a war for the union it failed for want of a second and does not even appear in the official journal of the convention the very fact that such a suggestion was made would be unknown to us but for the record kept by mr madison the extracts which have been given in treating of special branches of the subject from the writings and speeches of the framers of the constitution and other statesmen of that period afford ample proof of their entire and almost unanimous accord with the principles which have been established on the authority of the constitution itself the acts of ratification by the several states and other * of the highest authority and validity i am well aware that isolated expressions may be found in the reports of debates on the general and state conventions and other public bodies indicating the existence of individual opinions seemingly inconsistent with these principles that loose and confused ideas were sometimes expressed with regard to sovereignty the relations between governments and people and kindred subjects and that while the plan of the constitution was under discussion and before it was definitely reduced to its present shape there were earnest advocates in the convention of a more consolidated system with a stronger central government but these expressions of individual opinion only prove the existence of a small minority of * from the principles generally entertained and which finally prevailed in the formation of the constitution none of these ever avowed such * of doctrine as are promulgated in this generation no statesman of that day would have ventured to risk his reputation by * an obligation to support the constitution as an obligation to adhere to the federal * construction which would have insured the sweeping away of any plan of union embodying it by a tempest of popular indignation from every quarter of the country none of them suggested such an idea as that of the * of the people of the states into one consolidated * it was suggested by mr gouverneur morris in the proposition above referred to in which he stood alone among the delegates of twelve sovereign states assembled in convention as to the features of centralism or * which they did advocate all the ability of this little minority of really gifted men failed to secure the * of any one of them into the constitution or to obtain their recognition by any of the ratifying states on the contrary the very men who had been the leading advocates of such theories on failing to secure their adoption loyally accepted the result and became the ablest and most efficient supporters of the principles which had prevailed thus mr hamilton who had favored the plan of a president and senate both elected to hold office for life or during good behavior with a veto power in congress on the action of the state legislatures became through the federalist in conjunction with his associates mr madison and mr * the most distinguished * and advocate of the constitution as then proposed and afterward ratified with all its federal and staterights features in the ninth number of that remarkable series of political essays he quotes * and applies to the then proposed

that mr hamilton assumed as undisputed propositions in the first place that the state was the sovereign secondly that this sovereignty could not be alienated unless by express surrender * that no such surrender had been made and * that the idea of applying coercion to a state even to enforce the fulfillment of a duty would be equivalent to waging war against a * was altogether forced and unwarrantable in a subsequent number mr hamilton replying to the objection that the constitution contains no bill or declaration of rights argues that it was entirely unnecessary because in reality

it unimpaired he says here in * the people surrender nothing and as they retain everything they have no need of particular reservations and again i go further and affirm that bills of rights in the sense and to the extent they are contended for are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution but would be absolutely dangerous they would contain various exceptions to powers not granted and on this very account would afford a * pretext to claim more than were granted for why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do could language be more clear or more complete

great variety of particulars in which thirteen independent states are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions of interest hence the necessity of * and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact there is no intimation here or anywhere else of the existence of any such idea as that of the * people of one great consolidated state it is an incidental enunciation of the same truth soon afterward asserted by madison in the virginia * the people who ordained and established the constitution were not the people as composing one great body but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties mr madison in the philadelphia convention had at first held views of the sort of government which it was desirable to organize similar to those of mr hamilton though more moderate in extent he too however cordially conformed to the modifications in them made by his * and was no less zealous and eminent in defending

many cases in which the legislature of virginia is a party and yet the state is not * is it rational to suppose that the sovereign power shall be dragged before a court authorities to the same effect might be multiplied indefinitely by quotation from nearly all the most eminent statesmen and patriots of that brilliant period my limits however permit me only to refer those in quest of more * information to the original records or to the republic of republics in which will be found a most valuable collection and * of the teaching of the fathers on the subject there was no dissent at that period from the interpretation of the constitution which i have set forth as given by its authors except in the objections made by its adversaries those objections were refuted and silenced until

own territory calls the united states the american confederacy and says the only parties to the constitution contemplated by it originally were the thirteen confederated states and again as between the original states the representation rests on compact and plighted faith and your * have no wish that that compact should be disturbed or that plighted faith in the slightest degree violated it is satisfactory to know that in the closing year of his life when looking * with judgment undisturbed by any extraneous influence he uttered views of the government which must stand the test of severest scrutiny and defy the storms of agitation for they are founded on the rock of truth in letters written and addresses delivered during the administration of mr fillmore he repeatedly applies to the constitution the term compact which in 1833 he had so vehemently repudiated in his speech at * springs virginia in # he says the principles which have been set forth in the foregoing chapters although they had come to be considered as peculiarly southern were not sectional in their origin in the beginning and earlier years of our history they were cherished as faithfully and guarded as jealously in massachusetts and new hampshire as in virginia or south carolina it was in these principles that i was nurtured i have frankly proclaimed them during my whole life always contending in the senate of the united states against what i believed to be the mistaken construction of the constitution taught by mr webster and his adherents while i honored the genius of that great man and held friendly personal relations with him i considered his doctrines on these * rather the doctrines advocated by him during the most conspicuous and influential portions of his public * be mischievous and the more dangerous to the welfare of the country and the liberties of mankind on account of the signal ability and magnificent eloquence with which they were argued the right of * subject which beyond all others ignorance prejudice and political rancor have combined to cloud with misstatements and * a question easily to be determined in the light of what has already been established with regard to the history and principles of the constitution it is not something standing apart by * * creation outside of and antagonistic to the * might be imagined by one deriving his ideas from the political literature most current of late years so far from being against the constitution or incompatible with it we contend that if the right to secede is not prohibited to the states and no power to prevent it expressly delegated to the united states it remains as reserved to the states or the people from whom all the powers of the general government were derived the compact between the states which formed the union was in the nature of a partnership between individuals without limitation of time and the recognized law of such * is thus stated by an eminent lawyer of massachusetts in a work intended for popular use we have seen that a number of sovereign free and independent states during the war of the revolution entered into a partnership with one another which was not only unlimited in duration but expressly declared to be a perpetual union yet when that union failed to accomplish the purposes for which it was formed the parties withdrew separately and independently one after another without any question made of their right to do so and formed a new association one of the declared objects of this new partnership was to form a more perfect union this certainly did not mean more perfect in respect of duration for the former union had been declared perpetual and perpetuity admits of no addition it did not mean that it was to be more * for the delegates of the states in ratifying the former compact of union had expressed themselves in terms that could scarcely be made more * they then said the formation of a more perfect union was accomplished by the organization of a government more complete in its various branches legislative executive and judicial and by the delegation to this government of certain additional powers or functions which had previously been exercised by the governments of the respective * in providing the means of operating directly upon individuals for the enforcement of its legitimately delegated authority there was no abandonment nor modification of the essential principle of a compact between sovereigns which applied to the one case as fully as to the other there was not the slightest intimation of so radical a revolution as the surrender of the sovereignty of the contracting parties would have been the additional powers conferred upon the federal government by the constitution were merely * of some of those possessed by the state * * from the reserved and inalienable sovereignty of the political communities which conferred them it was merely the institution of a new agent who however enlarged his powers might be would still remain subordinate and responsible to the source from which they were * of the sovereign people of each state it was an amended union not a consolidation it is a remarkable fact that the very powers of the federal government and * to the states which are most relied upon by the advocates of centralism as incompatible with state sovereignty were in force under the old confederation when the sovereignty of the states was expressly recognized the general government had then as now the exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war making treaties and * maintaining an army and navy granting letters of marque and * regulating * establishing and controlling the * * nearly all the socalled characteristic powers of sovereignty exercised by the federal government under the existing constitution except the regulation of commerce and of levying and collecting its * directly instead of through the interposition of the state authorities the exercise of these * powers was prohibited to the states under the old compact without the consent of the united states in congress assembled but no one has claimed that the confederation had thereby acquired sovereignty entirely in accord with these truths are the arguments of mr madison in the federalist to show that the great principles of the constitution are substantially the same as those of the articles of confederation he says the truth is he adds that the great principles of the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new than as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of confederation in the papers immediately following he establishes this position in detail by an analysis of the principal powers delegated to the federal government showing that the spirit of the original instructions to the convention had been followed in revising the federal constitution and rendering it adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union the present union owes its very existence to the dissolution by separate secession of its members of the former union which as we have thus seen as to its organic principles rested upon precisely the same foundation the right to withdraw from the association results in either case from the same * which i think have been established on an impregnable basis of history reason law and precedent it is not contended that this right should be resorted to for insufficient cause or as the writer already quoted on the law of partnership says wantonly and * to the other * without responsibility of the seceding party for any damage thus done no association can be dissolved without a * of the occurrence of incidental questions concerning common property and mutual * sometimes of a complex and intricate sort if a wrong be perpetrated in such case it is a matter for determination by the means usually employed among independent and sovereign * arbitration or in the failure of these by war with which unfortunately christianity and civilization have not yet been able entirely to dispense but the suggestion of possible evils does not at all affect the question of right there is no great principle in the affairs either of individuals or of nations that is not liable to such difficulties in its practical application but we are told there is no mention made of secession in the constitution mr everett says the states are not named in it the word sovereignty does not occur in it the right of secession is as much ignored in it as the procession of the * we have seen how very untenable is the assertion that the states are not named in it and how much * or significance in the omission of the word sovereignty the pertinent question that occurs is why was so obvious an attribute of sovereignty not expressly renounced if it was intended to surrender it it certainly existed it was not surrendered therefore it still exists this would be a more natural and rational conclusion than that it has ceased to exist because it is not mentioned the simple truth is that it would have been a very extraordinary thing to incorporate into the constitution any express provision for the secession of the states and dissolution of the union its founders undoubtedly desired and hoped that it would be perpetual against the proposition for power to coerce a state the argument was that it would be a means not of preserving but of destroying the union it was not for them to make arrangements for its * calamity which there was no occasion to provide for in advance sufficient for their day was the evil thereof it is not usual either in * between men or in treaties between governments to make provision for a dissolution of the partnership or a termination of the treaty unless there be some special reason for a limitation of time indeed in treaties the usual formula includes a declaration of their perpetuity but in either case the power of the contracting parties or of any of them to dissolve the compact on terms not damaging to the rights of the other parties is not the less clearly understood it was not necessary in the constitution to affirm the right of secession because it was an attribute of sovereignty and the states had reserved all which they had not delegated the right of the people of the several states to resume the powers delegated by them to the common agency was not left without positive and ample assertion even at a period when it had never been denied the ratification of the constitution by virginia has already been quoted in which the people of that state through their convention did expressly declare and make known that the powers granted under the constitution being derived from the people of the united states may be resumed by them * the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression and that every power not granted thereby remains with them and at their will new york and rhode island were no less explicit both declaring that the powers of government may be * by the people whenever it shall become necessary to their happiness these expressions are not mere * * thrown out incidentally and entitled only to be regarded as an expression of opinion by their authors even if only such they would carry great weight as the deliberately expressed judgment of enlightened contemporaries but they are more they are parts of the very acts or ordinances by which these states ratified the constitution and acceded to the union and can not be detached from them if they are invalid the ratification itself was invalid for they are inseparable by inserting these declarations in their ordinances virginia new york and rhode island formally officially and permanently declared their interpretation of the constitution as recognizing the right of secession by the resumption of their grants by accepting the * with this declaration incorporated the other states as formally accepted the principle which it asserted i am well aware that it has been attempted to construe these declarations concerning the right of the people to reassume their delegations of * in the terms employed by virginia people of the united * having reference to the idea of one people in mass or in the aggregate but it can scarcely be possible that any candid and intelligent reader who has carefully considered the evidence already brought to bear on the subject can need further argument to * his mind of that political fiction the people of the united states from whom the powers of the federal government were derived could have been no other than the people who ordained and ratified the constitution and this it has been shown beyond the power of denial was done by the people of each state severally and independently no other people were known to the authors of the declarations above quoted mr madison was a leading member of the virginia convention which made that declaration as well as of the general convention that drew up the constitution we have seen what his idea of the people of the united states * the people as composing one great body but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties mr lee of westmoreland * harry in the same convention answering mr henrys objection to the expression we the people said it the constitution is now submitted to the people of virginia if we do not adopt it it will be always null and void as to us suppose it was found proper for our adoption and becoming the government of the people of virginia by what style should it be done ought we not to make use of the name of the people no other style would be proper it would certainly be superfluous after all that has been presented heretofore to add any further evidence of the meaning that was attached to these expressions by their authors the people of the united states were in their minds the people of virginia the people of massachusetts and the people of every other state that should agree to unite they could have meant only that the people of their respective states who had delegated certain powers to the federal government in ratifying the constitution and acceding to the union reserved to themselves the right in event of the failure of their purposes to resume or reassume those powers by seceding from the same union finally the absurdity of the construction attempted to be put upon these expressions will be evident from a very brief analysis if the assertion of the right of * of their powers was meant for the protection of the whole * people in * people in the * a consolidated * whom or what was it to protect them by whom were the powers granted to be perverted to the injury or oppression of the whole people by themselves or by some of the states all of whom according to this hypothesis had been consolidated into one as no danger could have been apprehended from either of these it must have been against the government of the united states that the provision was made that is to say the whole people of a republic make this declaration against a government established by themselves and entirely subject to their own control under a constitution which contains provision for its own amendment by this very same whole people whenever they may think proper is it not a libel upon the statesmen of that generation to attribute to their grave and solemn declarations a meaning so * and absurd to those who argue that the grants of the constitution are fatal to the reservation of sovereignty by the states the constitution furnishes a conclusive answer in the amendment which was * with the adoption of the instrument and which declares that all powers not delegated to the government of the union were reserved to the states or to the people as sovereignty was not delegated by the states it was necessarily reserved it would be superfluous to answer arguments against implied powers of the states none are claimed by implication because all not delegated by the states remained with them and it was only in an abundance of caution that they expressed the right to resume such parts of their unlimited power as was delegated for the purposes enumerated as there be those who see danger to the perpetuity of the union in the possession of such power by the states and insist that our fathers did not intend to bind the states together by a compact no better than a rope of sand it may be well to examine their position from what have dangers to the union arisen have they sprang from too great restriction on the exercise of the granted powers or from the assumption by the general government of power claimed by implication the whole record of our union answers from the latter only was this tendency to usurpation caused by the presumption of paramount authority in the general government or by the assertion of the right of a state to resume the powers it had delegated reasonably and honestly it can not be assigned to the latter let it be supposed that the whole people had recognized the right of a state of the union peaceably and independently to resume the powers which peaceably and independently she had delegated to the federal government would not this have been potent to restrain the general government from exercising its functions to the injury and oppression of such state to deny that effect would be to suppose that a dominant majority would be willing to drive a state from the union would the admission of the right of a state to resume the grants it had made have led to the exercise of that right for light and trivial causes surely the evidence furnished by the nations both ancient and modern * the supposition in the language of the declaration of independence all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are * than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed would not real grievances be rendered more tolerable by the consciousness of power to remove them and would not even imaginary wrongs be embittered by the manifestation of a purpose to make them perpetual to ask these questions is to answer them the wise and brave men who had at much peril and great sacrifice secured the independence of the states were as little disposed to surrender the sovereignty of the states as they were anxious to organize a general government with adequate powers to remedy the defects of the confederation the union they formed was not to destroy the states but to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity the alternative to secession is coercion that is to say if no such right as that of secession * it is forbidden or precluded by the * it is a wrong and by a well settled principle of public law for every wrong there must be a remedy which in this case must be the application of force to the state attempting to withdraw from the union early in the session of the convention which formed the constitution it was proposed to confer upon congress the power to call forth the force of the union against any member of the union failing to fulfill its duty under the articles thereof when this proposition came to be considered mr madison observed that a union of the states containing such an * seemed to provide for its own destruction the use of force against a state would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound he hoped that such a system would be framed as might render this recourse unnecessary and moved that the clause be postponed this motion was adopted * con and the proposition was never again revived again on a subsequent occasion speaking of an appeal to force mr madison said was such a remedy eligible was it practicable any government for the united states formed on the supposed * of using force against the unconstitutional proceedings of the states would prove as visionary and * as the government of congress every proposition looking in any way to the same or a similar object was promptly rejected by the convention george mason of virginia said of such a proposition will not the citizens of the invaded state assist one another until they rise as one man and shake off the union altogether oliver ellsworth in the ratifying convention of connecticut said this constitution does not attempt to coerce sovereign bodies states in their political capacity no coercion is applicable to such bodies but that of an armed force if we should attempt to execute the laws of the union by sending an armed force against a delinquent state it would involve the good and bad the innocent and guilty in the same calamity mr hamilton in the convention of new york said to coerce the states is one of the maddest projects that was ever devised what picture does this idea present to our view a complying state at war with a * state congress marching the troops of one state into the bosom of another here is a nation at war with itself can any reasonable man be well disposed toward a government which makes war and carnage the only means of supporting * government that can exist only by the sword but can we believe that one state will ever suffer itself to be used as an instrument of coercion the thing is a * is impossible unhappily our generation has seen that in the decay of the principles and feelings which animated the hearts of all patriots in that day this thing like many others then regarded as impossible dreams has been only too feasible and that states have permitted themselves to be used as instruments not merely for the coercion but for the destruction of the freedom and independence of their sister states edmund randolph governor of virginia although the * of the original proposition to authorize the employment of the forces of the union against a delinquent member which had been so signally defeated in the federal convention afterward in the virginia convention made an eloquent protest against the idea of the employment of force against a state what species of military coercion said he could the general government adopt for the enforcement of obedience to its demands either an army sent into the heart of a delinquent state or * up its ports have we lived to this then that in order to suppress and exclude tyranny it is necessary to render the most affectionate friends the most bitter enemies set the father against the son and make the brother slay the brother is this the happy expedient that is to preserve liberty will it not destroy it if an army be once introduced to force us if once marched into virginia figure to yourselves what the dreadful consequence will be the most lamentable civil war must ensue we have seen already how vehemently the idea of even judicial coercion was repudiated by hamilton marshall and others the suggestion of military coercion was uniformly treated as in the above extracts with still more abhorrence no principle was more fully and firmly settled on the highest authority than that under our system there could be no coercion of a state mr webster in his elaborate speech of february 16 1833 arguing throughout against the sovereignty of the states and in the course of his argument sadly confounding the ideas of the federal constitution and the federal government as he * the sovereign people of the states with the state governments says the states can not omit to appoint senators and electors it is not a matter resting in state discretion or state pleasure no member of a state legislature can refuse to proceed at the proper time to elect senators to congress or to provide for the choice of electors of president and vicepresident any more than the members can refuse when the appointed day arrives to meet the members of the other house to count the votes for those officers and ascertain who are chosen this was before the invention in # of an electoral commission to relieve congress of its constitutional duty to count the vote mr hamilton on the contrary fresh from the work of forming the constitution and familiar with its principles and purposes said it is certainly true that the state legislatures by forbearing the appointment of senators may destroy the national government it is unnecessary to discuss the particular question on which these two great authorities are thus directly at issue i do not contend that the state legislatures of their own will have a right to forego the performance of any federal duty imposed upon them by the constitution but there is a power beyond and above that of either the federal or state * power of the people of the state who ordained and established the constitution as far as it applies to themselves reserving as i think has been demonstrated the right to reassume the grants of power therein made when they deem it necessary for their safety or welfare to do so at the * of this power it certainly becomes not only the right but the duty of their state legislature to refrain from any action * adherence to the union or partnership from which the sovereign has withdrawn it would be only adding to a * of testimony to quote further from the authors of the constitution in support of the principle unquestioned in that generation that the people who * is to say of course the people of the several * resume their grants it will require but few words to dispose of some * objections that have been made to the application of this doctrine in a special case it is sometimes said that whatever weight may attach to principles founded on the sovereignty and independence of the original thirteen states they can not apply to the states of more recent * now a majority of the members of the * these are but the offspring or creatures of the union and must of course be subordinate and dependent this objection would scarcely occur to any instructed mind though it may possess a certain degree of specious * for the * it is enough to answer that the entire equality of the states in every particular is a vital condition of their union every new member that has been admitted into the partnership of states came in as is expressly declared in the acts for their admission on a footing of perfect equality in every respect with the original members this equality is as complete as the equality before the laws of the son with the father immediately on the attainment by the former of his legal majority without regard to the prior condition of dependence and tutelage the relations of the original states to one another and to the union can not be affected by any subsequent * of new members as the constitution * those relations permanently and furnishes the normal standard which is applicable to all the boston memorial to congress referred to in a foregoing chapter as prepared by a committee with mr webster at its head says that the new states are universally considered as admitted into the union upon the same footing as the original states and as possessing in respect to the union the same rights of sovereignty freedom and independence as the other states but with regard to states formed of territory acquired by purchase from france spain and mexico it is claimed that as they were bought by the united states they belong to the same and have no right to withdraw at will from an association the property which had been purchased by the other parties happy would it have been if the equal rights of the people of all the states to the enjoyment of territory acquired by the common treasure could have been recognized at the proper time there would then have been no secession and no war as for the sordid claim of ownership of states on account of the money spent for the land which they * can understand the ground of a claim to some interest in the soil so long as it continues to be public property but have yet to learn in what way the united states ever became purchaser of the inhabitants or of their political rights any question in regard to property has always been admitted to be matter for fair and equitable settlement in case of the withdrawal of a state the treaty by which the louisiana territory was ceded to the united states expressly provided that the inhabitants thereof should be admitted as soon as possible according to the principles of the federal constitution to the enjoyment of all the rights advantages and * of citizens of the united states in all other * of territory the same stipulation is either expressed or implied indeed the denial of the right would be inconsistent with the character of american political institutions another objection made to the right of secession is based upon obscure indefinite and inconsistent ideas with regard to allegiance it assumes various shapes and is therefore somewhat difficult to meet but as most frequently presented may be stated thus that the citizen owes a double allegiance or a divided * to his state partly to the united states that it is not possible for either of these powers to release him from the allegiance due to the other that the state can no more release him from his obligations to the union than the united states can * him from his duties to his state this is the most moderate way in which the objection is put the extreme * go further and claim that allegiance to the union or as they generally express it to the * thereby the federal * paramount and the obligation to the state only * indeed it exists at all this latter view if the more monstrous is at least the more consistent of the two for it does not involve the difficulty of a divided allegiance nor the paradoxical position in which the other places the citizen in case of a conflict between his state and the other members of the union of being necessarily a rebel against the general government or a traitor to the state of which he is a citizen as to true allegiance in the light of the principles which have been established there can be no doubt with regard to it the primary paramount allegiance of the citizen is due to the sovereign only that sovereign under our system is the * people of the state to which he * people who constituted the state government which he * and which protects him in the enjoyment of his personal * people who alone as far as he is concerned ordained and established the federal constitution and federal * people who have reserved to themselves sovereignty which involves the power to * all agencies created by them the obligation to support the state or federal constitution and the obedience due to either state or federal government are alike derived from and dependent on the allegiance due to this sovereign if the sovereign * the state government and * and establishes a new one the obligation of allegiance requires him to transfer his obedience accordingly if the sovereign * from association with its confederates in the union the allegiance of the citizen requires him to follow the sovereign any other course is rebellion or * which in the cant of the day have been so grossly * and perverted as to be made worse than * his relation to the union arose from the membership of the state of which he was a citizen and ceased whenever his state withdrew from it he can not owe * less * an association from which his sovereign has separated and thereby withdrawn him every officer of both federal and state governments is required to take an oath to support the constitution a compact the binding force of which is based upon the sovereignty of the * sovereignty necessarily carrying with it the principles just stated with regard to allegiance every such officer is therefore virtually sworn to maintain and support the sovereignty of all the states military and naval officers take in addition an oath to obey the lawful orders of their superiors such an oath has never been understood to be eternal in its obligations it is dissolved by the death dismissal or resignation of the officer who takes it and such resignation is not a mere optional right but becomes an imperative duty when continuance in the service comes to be in conflict with the ultimate allegiance due to the sovereignty of the state to which he belongs a little consideration of these plain and * truths would show how utterly unworthy and false are the vulgar taunts which attribute treason to those who in the late secession of the southern states were loyal to the only sovereign entitled to their allegiance and which still more absurdly prate of the violation of oaths to support the government an oath which nobody ever could have been legally required to take and which must have been * confounded with the prescribed oath to support the constitution nullification and secession are often erroneously treated as if they were one and the same thing it is true that both ideas spring from the sovereign right of a state to interpose for the protection of its own people but they are altogether unlike as to both their extent and the character of the means to be employed the first was a temporary expedient intended to restrain action until the question at issue could be submitted to a convention of the states it was a remedy which its supporters sought to apply within the union a means to avoid the last * if the application for a convention should fail or if the state making it should suffer an adverse decision the advocates of that remedy have not revealed what they proposed as the next * the infraction of the compact to have been of that character which according to mr webster dissolved it secession on the other hand was the assertion of the inalienable right of a people to change their government whenever it ceased to fulfill the purposes for which it was ordained and established under our form of government and the cardinal principles upon which it was founded it should have been a peaceful remedy the withdrawal of a state from a league has no revolutionary or * characteristic the government of the state remains unchanged as to all internal affairs it is only its external or confederate relations that are altered to term this action of a sovereign a rebellion is a gross abuse of language so is the * phrase which speaks of it as an appeal to the arbitrament of the sword in the late contest in particular there was no appeal by the seceding states to the arbitrament of arms there was on their part no invitation nor provocation to war they stood in an attitude of selfdefense and were attacked for merely exercising a right guaranteed by the original terms of the compact they neither tendered nor accepted any challenge to the wager of battle the man who * his house against attack can not with any propriety be said to have submitted the question of his right to it to the arbitrament of arms two moral obligations or restrictions upon a seceding state certainly exist in the first place not to break up the partnership without good and sufficient cause and in the second to make an equitable settlement with former associates and as far as may be to avoid the infliction of loss or damage upon any of them neither of these obligations was violated or neglected by the southern states in their secession from the earliest period it was foreseen by the wisest of our statesmen that a danger to the perpetuity of the union would arise from the conflicting interests of different sections and every effort was made to secure each of these classes of interests against aggression by the other as a proof of this may be cited the following extract from mr madisons report of a speech made by himself in the philadelphia convention on the 30th of june 1787 mr rufus king a distinguished member of the convention from massachusetts a few days afterward said to the same effect he was fully convinced that the question concerning a difference of interests did not lie where it had hitherto been discussed between the great and small states but between the southern and eastern for this reason he had been ready to yield something in the proportion of representatives for the security of the southern he was not averse to giving them a still greater security but did not see how it could be done the wise men who formed the constitution were not seeking to bind the states together by the material power of a majority nor were they so blind to the influences of passion and interest as to believe that paper barriers would suffice to restrain a majority actuated by either or both of these motives they endeavored therefore to prevent the conflicts inevitable from the * of a sectional or party majority by so distributing the powers of government that each interest might hold a check upon the other it was believed that the compromises made with regard to * to each state an equal vote in the senate and in the house of representatives giving the states a weight in proportion to their respective population estimating the negroes as equivalent to three * of the same number of free * have the effect of giving at an early period a majority in the house of representatives to the south while the north would retain the * in the senate thus it was supposed that the two great sectional interests would be enabled to restrain each other within the limits of purposes and action beneficial to both the failure of these expectations need not affect our reverence for the intentions of the fathers or our respect for the means which they devised to carry them into effect that they were mistaken both as to the maintenance of the balance of sectional power and as to the fidelity and integrity with which the congress was expected to conform to the letter and spirit of its delegated authority is perhaps to be ascribed less to lack of prophetic foresight than to that * confidence which is the weakness of honest minds and which was naturally strengthened by the patriotic and fraternal feelings resulting from the great struggle through which they had then but recently passed they saw in the sufficiency of the authority delegated to the federal government and in the * of the sovereignty retained by the states a system the strict construction of which was so eminently adapted to indefinite expansion of the confederacy as to embrace every variety of production and consequent diversity of pursuit carried out in the spirit in which it was devised there was in this system no element of disintegration but every facility for an * of the circle of the family of states or nations so that it scarcely seemed unreasonable to look forward to a fulfillment of the aspiration of mr hamilton that it might extend over north america perhaps over the whole continent not at all incompatible with these views and purposes was the recognition of the right of the states to reassume if occasion should require it the powers which they had delegated on the contrary the maintenance of this right was the surest guarantee of the perpetuity of the union and the denial of it sounded the first serious note of its dissolution the conservative efficiency of state interposition for maintenance of the essential principles of the union against aggression or decadence is one of the most conspicuous features in the debates of the various state conventions by which the constitution was ratified perhaps their ideas of the particular form in which this interposition was to be made may have been somewhat indefinite and left to be reduced to shape by the circumstances when they should arise but the principle itself was assumed and asserted as fundamental but for a firm reliance upon it as a sure resort in case of need it may safely be said that the union would never have been formed it would be unjust to the wisdom and sagacity of the framers of the constitution to suppose that they entirely relied on paper barriers for the protection of the rights of * fresh from the defense of violated * and faithless aggression on inalienable rights it might a * be assumed that they would require something more * than mere promises to protect them from human depravity and human ambition that they did so is to be found in the debates both of the general and the state conventions where state interposition was often declared to be the bulwark against usurpation at an early period in the history of the federal government the states of kentucky and virginia found reason to * this right of state interposition in the first of the famous resolutions drawn by mr jefferson in 1798 and with some modification adopted by the legislature of kentucky in november of that year it is declared that * the general government assumes undelegated powers its acts are * void and of no force that to this compact each state acceded as a state and is an * party that this government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself since that would have made its discretion and not the constitution the measure of its powers but that as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common judge each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress in the virginia resolutions drawn by mr madison adopted on the 24th of december 1798 and * in 1799 the general assembly of that state declares that it views the powers of the federal government as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact as no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact and that in case of a deliberate palpable and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact the states who are parties thereto have the right and are in duty bound to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil and for maintaining within their respective limits the authorities rights and liberties * to them another of the same series of resolutions * the indications of a design to * the states by degrees into one sovereignty these it is true were only the * of two states and they were * from by several other state * so much on the ground of opposition to the general principles asserted as on that of their being unnecessary in their application to the alien and sedition laws which were the immediate occasion of their utterance nevertheless they were the basis of the contest for the presidency in 1800 which resulted in their approval by the people in the triumphant election of mr jefferson they became part of the accepted creed of the republican democratic staterights or conservative party as it has been variously termed at different periods and as such they were ratified by the people in every presidential election that took place for sixty years with two exceptions the last victory obtained under them and when they were emphasized by adding the construction of them contained in the report of mr madison to the virginia legislature in 1799 was at the election of mr * last president chosen by vote of a party that could with any propriety be styled national in * to sectional at a critical and memorable period that pure spirit luminous intellect and devoted * of the constitution the great statesman of south carolina invoked this remedy of state interposition against the tariff act of # which was deemed injurious and oppressive to his state no purpose was then declared to coerce the state as such but measures were taken to break the protective shield of her authority and enforce the laws of congress upon her citizens by compelling them to pay outside of her ports the duties on imports which the state had declared unconstitutional and had forbidden to be collected in her ports there remained at that day enough of the spirit in which the union had been * of respect for the sovereignty of states and of regard for the limitations of the * prevent a conflict of arms the compromise of 1833 was adopted which south carolina agreed to accept the principle for which she contended being virtually conceded meantime there had been no lack as we have already seen of assertions of the sovereign rights of the states from other quarters the declaration of these rights by the new england states and their representatives on the acquisition of louisiana in 1803 on the admission of the state of that name in # and on the question of the annexation of texas in # have been referred to in another place among the resolutions of the massachusetts legislature in relation to the proposed annexation of texas adopted in february 1845 were the following to these stanch declarations of * regard to which leaving out of consideration the particular occasion that called them forth my only doubt would be whether they do not express too decided a doctrine of * be added the avowal of one of the most distinguished sons of massachusetts john quincy adams in his discourse before the new york historical society in 1839 perhaps it is unfortunate that in earlier and better times when the prospect of serious difficulties first arose a convention of the states was not assembled to consider the relations of the various states and the government of the union as time rolled on the general government gathering with both hands a mass of undelegated powers reached that position which mr jefferson had pointed out as an intolerable * claim of a right to judge of the extent of its own authority of those then participating in public affairs it was apparently useless to ask that the question should be submitted for decision to the parties to the compact under the same conditions as those which controlled the formation and adoption of the constitution otherwise a convention would have been utterly fruitless for at that period when aggression for sectional aggrandizement had made such rapid advances it can scarcely be doubted that more than a fourth if not a majority of states would have adhered to that policy which had been manifested for years in the legislation of many states as well as in that of the federal government what course would then have remained to the southern states nothing except either to submit to a continuation of what they believed and felt to be violations of the compact of union * of faith injurious and oppressive usurpation or else to assert the sovereign right to reassume the grants they had made since those grants had been perverted from their original and proper purposes surely the right to resume the powers delegated and to judge of the propriety and sufficiency of the causes for doing so are alike inseparable from the possession of sovereignty over sovereigns there is no common judge and between them can be no umpire except by their own agreement and consent the necessity or propriety of exercising the right to withdraw from a confederacy or union must be determined by each member for itself once determined in favor of withdrawal all that remains for consideration is the obligation to see that no wanton damage is done to former associates and to make such fair settlement of common interests as the equity of the case may require in july 1776 the congress of the thirteen united colonies declared that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states the denial of this asserted right and the attempted coercion made it manifest that a bond of union was necessary for the common defense in november of the next year viz # articles of confederation and perpetual union were entered into by the thirteen states under the style of the united states of america the government instituted was to be administered by a congress of delegates from the several states and each state to have an equal voice in legislation the government so formed was to act through and by the states and having no power to enforce its requisitions upon the states embarrassment was early realized in its efforts to provide for the exigencies of war after the treaty of peace and recognition of the independence of the states the difficulty of raising revenue and regulating commerce was so great as to lead to repeated efforts to obtain from the states additional grants of power under the articles of confederation no amendment of them could be made except by the unanimous consent of the states and this it had not been found possible to obtain for the powers requisite to the efficient discharge of the functions intrusted to the congress hence arose the proceedings for a convention to amend the articles of confederation the result was the formation of a new plan of government entitled the constitution of the united states of america this was submitted to the congress in order that if approved by them it might be referred to the states for adoption or rejection by the several conventions thereof and if adopted by nine of the states it was to be the compact of union between the states so ratifying the same the new form of government differed in many essential particulars from the old one the delegates intent on the purpose to give greater efficiency to the government of the union proposed greatly to enlarge its powers so much so that it was not deemed safe to confide them to a single body and they were consequently distributed between three independent departments of government which might be a check upon one another the constitution did not like the articles of confederation declare that the states had agreed to a perpetual union but distinctly indicated the hope of its perpetuity by the expression in the preamble of the purpose to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity the circumstances under which the union of the constitution was formed justified the hope of its perpetuity but the brief existence of the confederation may have been a warning against the renewal of the assertion that the compact should be perpetual a remedy for the embarrassment which had been realized under the articles of confederation in obtaining amendments to correct any defects in grants of power so as to render them effective for the purpose for which they were given was provided by its fifth article it is here to be specially noted that new grants of power as asked for by the convention were under the articles of confederation only to be obtained from the unanimous assent of the states therefore it followed that two of the states which did not ratify the constitution were so long as they retained that attitude free from its obligations thus it is seen that the same principle in regard to obtaining grants of additional power for the federal government formed the rule for the union as it had done for the confederation that is that the consent of each and every state was a * the apprehension which justly existed that several of the states might reject the constitution and under the rule of unanimity defeat it led to the seventh article of the constitution which provided that the ratification by the conventions of nine states should be sufficient for the establishment of the constitution between the states ratifying it which of course contemplated leaving the others more or less in number separate and distinct from the nine states forming a new government thus was the union to be a voluntary compact and all the powers of its government to be derived from the assent of each of its members these powers as proposed by the constitution were so extensive as to create alarm and opposition by some of the most influential men in many of the states it is known that the objection of the patriot samuel adams was only overcome by an assurance that such an amendment as the tenth would be adopted like opposition was by like assurance elsewhere overcome that article is in these words the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people amendment however of the delegated powers was made more easy than it had been under the confederation ratification by three fourths of the states was sufficient under the constitution for the adoption of an amendment to it as this power of amendment threatens to be the * rod which will swallow up the rest i propose to give it special examination what is the constitution of the united states the whole body of the instrument the history of its formation and adoption as well as the tenth amendment added in an abundance of caution clearly show it to be an instrument * the powers delegated by the states to the federal government their common agent it is specifically declared that all which was not so delegated was reserved on this mass of reserved powers those which the states declined to grant the federal government was expressly forbidden to intrude of what value would this prohibition have been if three fourths of the states could without the assent of a particular state invade the domain which that state had reserved for its own exclusive use and control it has heretofore i hope been satisfactorily demonstrated that the states were sovereigns before they formed the union and that they have never surrendered their sovereignty but have only intrusted by their common agent certain functions of sovereignty to be used for their common welfare among the powers delegated was one to amend the constitution which it is submitted was merely the power to amend the delegated grants and these were obtained by the separate and independent action of each state acceding to the union when we consider how carefully each clause was discussed in the general convention and how closely each was scrutinized in the conventions of the several states the conclusion can not be avoided that all was specified which it was intended to bestow and not a few of the wisest in that day held that too much power had been conferred aware of the * of everything devised by man it was foreseen that in the exercise of the functions intrusted to the general government experience might reveal the necessity of * * power was therefore given to amend in a certain manner the delegated trusts so as to make them efficient for the purposes designed or to prevent their * or abuse to the injury or oppression of any of the people in support of this view i refer to the historical fact that the first ten amendments of the constitution nearly * with it all refer either to the powers delegated or are directed to the greater security of the rights which were guarded by express limitations the distinction in the mind of the framers of the constitution between amendment and delegation of power seems to me clearly drawn by the fact that the constitution itself which was a proposition to the states to grant enumerated powers was only to have effect between the ratifying states but the fifth article provided that amendments to the constitution might be adopted by three fourths of the states and thereby be valid as part of the constitution it thus appears that a smaller power was required for an amendment than for a grant and the natural if not necessary conclusion is that it was because an amendment must belong to and grow out of a grant previously made if a socalled amendment could have been the means of obtaining a new power is it to be supposed that those watchful guardians of community independence for which the war of the revolution had been fought would have been reconciled to the adoption of the constitution by the declaration that the powers not delegated are reserved to the states unless the power of amendment be confined to the grants of the constitution there can be no security to the reserved rights of a minority less than a fourth of the states i submit that the word amendment necessarily implies an improvement upon something which is possessed and can have no proper application to that which did not previously exist the apprehension that was felt of this power of amendment by the framers of the constitution is shown by the restrictions placed upon the exercise of several of the delegated powers for example power was given to admit new states but no new state should be erected within the jurisdiction of any other state nor be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts of states without the consent of the legislatures of those states and the power to regulate commerce was limited by the prohibition of an amendment affecting for a certain time the migration or importation of persons whom any of the existing states should think proper to admit and by the very important provision for the protection of the smaller states and the preservation of their equality in the union that the compact in regard to the membership of the two houses of congress should not be so amended that any state without its consent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate these limitations and * on the power of amendment all refer to clauses of the constitution to things which existed as part of the general government they were not needed and therefore not to be found in relation to the reserved powers of the states on which the general government was forbidden to intrude by the ninth article of the amendments in view of the small territory of the new england states comparatively to that of the middle and southern states and the probability of the creation of new states in the large territory of some of these latter it might well have been anticipated that in the course of time the new england states would become less than one fourth of the members of the union nothing is less likely than that the watchful patriots of that region would have consented to a form of government which should give to a majority of three fourths of the states the power to deprive them of their dearest rights and privileges yet to this extremity the newborn theory of the power of amendment would go against this * assault this wooden horse which it is threatened to introduce into the citadel of our liberties i have sought to warn the * of our free institutions and earnestly do invoke the resistance of all true patriots with the failure of the senate committee of thirteen to come to any agreement the last reasonable hope of a pacific settlement of difficulties within the union was extinguished in the minds of those most reluctant to abandon the effort the year 1861 opened as we have seen upon the spectacle of a general belief among the people of the planting states in the necessity of an early secession as the only possible alternative left them it has already been shown that the calmness and deliberation with which the measures requisite for withdrawal were adopted and executed afford the best refutation of the charge that they were the result of haste passion or * still more contrary to truth is the assertion so often recklessly made and reiterated that the people of the south were led into secession against their will and their better judgment by a few ambitious and * politicians the truth is that the southern people were in advance of their representatives throughout and that these latter were not agitators or leaders in the popular movement they were in harmony with its great principles but their influence with very few exceptions was exerted to restrain rather than to * their application and to allay rather than to stimulate excitement as sentinels on the outer wall the people had a right to look to them for warning of approaching danger but as we have seen in that last session of the last congress that preceded the disruption southern senators of the class generally considered * served on a committee of pacification and strove earnestly to promote its objects failing in this they still exerted themselves to prevent the commission of any act that might result in bloodshed invention has busied itself to the exhaustion of its resources in the creation of imaginary * * and intrigues among the senators and representatives of the south on duty in washington at that time the idle gossip of the public hotels the sensational rumors of the streets the * of newspaper * was floating through the atmosphere of that anxious * lightly regarded at the moment by the more intelligent has since been drawn upon for materials to be used in the construction of what has been widely accepted as authentic history nothing would seem to be too absurd for such uses thus it has been gravely stated that a caucus of southern senators held in the early part of january resolved to assume to themselves the political power of the south that they took entire control of all political and military operations that they issued instructions for the passage of ordinances of secession and for the seizure of forts arsenals and * with much more of the like groundless fiction a foreign prince who served for a time in the federal army and has since undertaken to write a history of the civil war in * history the incomparable blunders of which are redeemed from suspicion of * * only by the writers ignorance of the * of the southern representatives as having kept their seats in congress in order to be able to paralyze its action forming at the same time a center whence they issued directions to their friends in the south to complete the dismemberment of the republic and again with reference to the secession of several states he says that the word of command issued by the committee at washington was promptly obeyed statements such as these are a * upon history that the representatives of the south held conference with one another and took counsel together as men having common interests and threatened by common dangers is true and is the full extent of the truth that they communicated to friends at home information of what was passing is to be presumed and would have been most obligatory if it had not been that the published proceedings rendered such communication needless but that any such man or committee of men should have undertaken to direct the mighty movement then progressing throughout the south or to control through the telegraph and the mails the will and the judgment of conventions of the people assembled under the full consciousness of the dignity of that sovereignty which they represented would have been an extraordinary degree of folly and presumption the absurdity of the statement is further evident from a consideration of the fact that the movements which culminated in the secession of the several states began before the meeting of congress they were not inaugurated prosecuted or controlled by the senators and representatives in congress but by the governors legislatures and finally by the delegates of the people in conventions of the respective states i believe i may fairly claim to have possessed a full share of the confidence of the people of the state which i in part represented and proof has already been furnished to show how little effect my own influence could have upon their action even in the negative capacity of a brake upon the wheels by means of which it was hurried on to consummation as for the imputation of holding our seats as a vantageground in plotting for the dismemberment of the * connection with which the count of paris does me the honor to single out my name for special * is a charge so dishonorable if true to its * disgraceful if false to its * to be outside of the proper limit of discussion it is a charge which no * ever made in my presence though i had in public debate more than once challenged its assertion and denounced its falsehood it is enough to say that i always held and repeatedly avowed the principle that a senator in congress occupied the position of an ambassador from the state which he represented to the government of the united states as well as in some sense a member of the government and that in either capacity it would be dishonorable to use his powers and privileges for the destruction or for the detriment of the government to which he was accredited acting on this principle as long as i held a seat in the senate my best efforts were directed to the maintenance of the constitution the union resulting from it and to make the general government an effective agent of the states for its prescribed purpose as soon as the paramount allegiance due to mississippi forbade a continuance of these efforts i withdrew from the position to say that during this period i did nothing secretly in conflict with what was done or professed openly would be merely to assert my own integrity which would be worthless to those who may doubt it and superfluous to those who believe in it what has been said on the subject for myself i believe to be also true of my southern associates in congress with regard to the forts arsenals etc something more remains to be said the authorities of the southern states immediately after and in some cases a few days before their actual secession took possession in every instance without resistance or bloodshed of forts arsenals * and other public property within their respective limits i do not propose at this time to consider the question of their right to do so that may be more properly done hereafter but it may not be out of place briefly to refer to the statement often made that the absence of troops from the military posts in the south which enabled the states so quietly to take such possession was the result of * and * between the southern leaders and the federal secretary of war john b floyd of virginia it is a sufficient answer to this allegation to state the fact that the absence of troops from these posts instead of being exceptional was and still is their ordinary condition in time of peace at the very moment when these sentences are being written in 1880 although the army of the united states is twice as large as in 1860 although four years of internal war and a yet longer period of subsequent military occupation of the south have habituated the public to the presence of troops in their midst to an extent that would formerly have been startling if not offensive although allegations of continued disaffection on the part of the southern people have been persistently reiterated for party * it is believed that the forts and arsenals in the states of the gulf are in as defenseless a condition and as liable to quiet seizure if any such purpose existed as in the beginning of the year 1861 certainly those within the range of my personal information are occupied as they were at that time only by * or * there were however some exceptions to this general * in the defensive works of the harbor of charleston the forts at key west and the dry * and those protecting the entrance of pensacola bay the events which occurred in charleston harbor will be more conveniently noticed hereafter the island forts near the extreme southern point of florida were too isolated and too remote from population to be disturbed at that time but the situation long maintained at the mouth of pensacola bay affords a signal illustration of the forbearance and conciliatory spirit that animated southern counsels for a long time fort pickens on the island of santa rosa at the entrance to the harbor was occupied only by a small body of federal soldiers and * than one hundred all told immediately opposite and in possession of the other two forts and the adjacent navyyard was a strong force of volunteer troops of florida and alabama which might on short notice have been largely increased ready and anxious to attack and take possession of fort pickens that they could have done so is unquestionable and if mere considerations of military advantage had been consulted it would surely have been done but the love of peace and the purpose to preserve it together with a revulsion from the thought of engaging in fraternal strife were more potent than considerations of probable interest during the anxious period of uncertainty and apprehension which ensued the efforts of the southern senators in washington were employed to dissuade they could not command from any aggressive movement however justifiable that might lead to collision these efforts were exerted through written and telegraphic communications to the governors of alabama and florida the commander of the southern troops and other influential persons near the scene of operations the records of the * if preserved will no doubt show this to be a very moderate statement of those efforts it is believed that by such influence alone a collision was averted and it is certain that its exercise gave great dissatisfaction at the time to some of the ardent advocates of more active measures it may be that they were right and that we who * delay and forbearance were wrong certainly if we could have foreseen the ultimate failure of all efforts for a peaceful settlement and the perfidy that was afterward to be practiced in connection with them our advice would have been different certain resolutions said to have been adopted in a meeting of senators held on the evening of the 5th of january have been magnified by the representations of artful * on the events of the period into something vastly momentous the significance of these resolutions was the admission that we could not longer advise delay and even that was unimportant under the circumstances for three of the states concerned had taken final action on the subject before the resolutions could have been communicated to them as an expression of opinion they merely stated that of which we had all become convinced by the experience of the previous * our * hopes had proved * further efforts in congress would be unavailing and that nothing remained except that the states should take the matter into their own hands as final judges of their wrongs and of the measure of redress they recommended the formation of a confederacy among the seceding states as early as possible after their * the expediency of which could hardly be questioned either by friend or foe as to the instructions asked for with regard to the propriety of continuing to hold their seats i suppose it must have been caused by some diversity of opinion which then and long afterward continued to exist and the practical value of which must have been confined to senators of states which did not actually secede for myself i can only say that no advice could have prevailed on me to hold a seat in the senate after receiving notice that mississippi had withdrawn from the union the best evidence that my associates thought likewise is the fact that although no instructions were given them they promptly withdrew on the receipt of official information of the withdrawal of the states which they represented it will not be amiss here briefly to state what were my position and feelings at the period now under consideration as they have been the subject of gross and widespread misrepresentation it is not only untrue but absurd to attribute to me motives of personal ambition to be gratified by a dismemberment of the union much of my life had been spent in the military and civil service of the united states whatever reputation i had acquired was identified with their history and if future preferment had been the object it would have led me to cling to the union as long as a * of it should remain if any judging after the event should assume that i was * by the high office subsequently conferred upon me by the people of the confederate states the answer to any such conclusion has been made by others to whom it was well known before the confederacy was formed that i had no desire to be its president when the suggestion was made to me i expressed a decided objection and gave reasons of a public and permanent character against being placed in that position furthermore i then held the office of united states senator from * which i preferred to all others the kindness of the people had three times conferred it upon me and i had no reason to fear that it would not be given again as often as desired so far from wishing to change this position for any other i had specially requested my friends some of whom had thought of putting me in nomination for the presidency of the united states in 1860 not to permit my name to be used before the convention for any nomination whatever i had been so near the office for four years while in the cabinet of mr pierce that i saw it from behind the scenes and it was to me an office in no wise desirable the responsibilities were great the labor the vexations the disappointments were greater those who have intimately known the official and personal life of our presidents can not fail to remember how few have left the office as happy men as when they entered it how darkly the shadows gathered around the setting sun and how eagerly the multitude would turn to gaze upon another orb just rising to take its place in the political firmament worn by incessant fatigue broken in fortune debarred by public opinion prejudice or tradition from future employment the wisest and best who have filled that office have retired to private life to remember rather the failure of their hopes than the success of their efforts he must indeed be a * man who could hope to fill the chair of washington with satisfaction to himself with the assurance of receiving on his retirement the meed awarded by the people to that great man that he had lived enough for life and for glory or even of feeling that the sacrifice of self had been compensated by the service rendered to his country the following facts were presented in a letter written several years ago by the hon c c clay of alabama who was one of my most intimate associates in the senate with reference to certain misstatements to which his attention had been called by one of my friends the sites of forts arsenals * and other public property of the federal government were ceded by the states within whose limits they were subject to the condition either expressed or implied that they should be used solely and exclusively for the purposes for which they were granted the ultimate ownership of the soil or eminent domain remains with the people of the state in which it lies by virtue of their sovereignty thus the state of massachusetts has declared that in the acts of cession of the respective states the terms and conditions on which the grant is made are expressed in various forms and with differing degrees of precision the act of new york granting the use of a site for the brooklyn navyyard may serve as a specimen it contains this express condition south carolina in 1805 by legislative enactment ceded to the united states in charleston harbor and on beaufort river various forts and fortifications and sites for the erection of forts on the following conditions viz it will hardly be contended that the conditions of this grant were fulfilled and if it be answered that the state did not demand the restoration of the forts or sites the answer certainly fails after 1860 when the controversy arose and the unfounded assertion was made that those forts and sites had been purchased with the money and were therefore the property of the united states the terms of the cession sufficiently manifest that they were * offerings of such forts and sites as belonged to the state and public functionaries were bound to know that by the united states law of march 20 # it was provided that no purchase shall be made where such lands are the property of a * to provide for the defense of certain ports and harbors of the united states the stipulations made by virginia in * the ground for fortress monroe and the rip * on the 1st of march 1821 are as follows by accepting such grants under such conditions the government of the united states assented to their propriety and the principle that holds good in any one case is of course applicable to all others of the same sort whether expressly asserted in the act of cession or not indeed no express declaration would be necessary to establish a conclusion resulting so directly from the nature of the case and the settled principles of sovereignty and eminent domain a state withdrawing from the union would necessarily assume the control * exercised by the general government over all public defenses and other public property within her limits it would however be but fair and proper that adequate compensation should be made to the other members of the partnership or their common agent for the value of the works and for any other advantage obtained by the one party or loss incurred by the other such equitable settlement the seceding states of the south without exception as i believe were desirous to make and prompt to propose to the federal authorities on the secession of south carolina the condition of the defenses of charleston harbor became a subject of anxiety with all parties of the three forts in or at the entrance of the harbor two were unoccupied but the third fort moultrie was held by a garrison of but little more than one hundred * whom only * were said to be * command of major robert anderson of the first artillery about twelve days before the secession of south carolina the representatives in congress from that state had called on the president to assure him in anticipation of the secession of the state that no purpose was entertained by south carolina to attack or in any way molest the forts held by the united states in the harbor of * least until opportunity could be had for an amicable settlement of all questions that might arise with regard to these forts and other public * that no renforcements should be sent and the military status should be permitted to remain unchanged the south carolinians understood mr buchanan as approving of this suggestion although declining to make any formal pledge it appears nevertheless from subsequent developments that both before and after the secession of south carolina preparations were secretly made for renforcing major anderson in case it should be deemed necessary by the government at washington on the 11th of december instructions were communicated to him from the war department of which the following is the essential part these instructions were afterward * we are informed by mr * as instead of requiring him to defend himself to the last extremity to direct him to do so as long as any reasonable hope remained of saving the fort immediately after the secession of the state the convention of south carolina * three distinguished citizens of that * robert w barnwell james h adams and james l * proceed to washington to treat with the government of the united states for the delivery of the forts magazines * and other real estate with their * within the limits of south carolina and also for an apportionment of the public debt and for a division of all other property held by the government of the united states as agent of the confederated states of which south carolina was recently a member and generally to negotiate as to all other measures and arrangements proper to be made and adopted in the existing relation of the parties and for the continuance of peace and amity between this commonwealth and the government at washington the commissioners in the discharge of the duty intrusted to them arrived in washington on the 26th of december before they could communicate with the president * on the morning after their * were startled and the whole country electrified by the news that during the previous night major anderson had secretly dismantled fort moultrie spiked his guns burned his guncarriages and removed his command to fort sumter which occupied a more commanding position in the harbor this movement changed the whole aspect of affairs it was considered by the government and people of south carolina as a violation of the implied pledge of a maintenance of the status quo the remaining forts and other public property were at once taken possession of by the state and the condition of public feeling became greatly * an interview between the president and the commissioners was followed by a sharp correspondence which was terminated on the 1st of january 1861 by the return to the commissioners of their final communication with an endorsement stating that it was of such a character that the president declined to receive it the negotiations were thus abruptly broken off this correspondence may be found in the appendix in the mean time mr cass secretary of state had resigned his position early in december on the ground of the refusal of the president to send renforcements to charleston on the occupation of fort sumter by major anderson mr floyd secretary of war taking the ground that it was virtually a violation of a pledge given or implied by the government had asked that the garrison should be entirely withdrawn from the harbor of charleston and on the refusal of the president to consent to this had tendered his resignation which was promptly accepted this is believed to be a correct outline of the earlier facts with regard to the charleston forts and in giving it i have done so as far as possible without prejudice or any expression of opinion upon the motives of the actors the kind relations both personal and political which had long existed between mr buchanan and myself had led him occasionally during his presidency to send for me to confer with him on subjects that caused him anxiety and warranted me in sometimes calling upon him to offer my opinion on matters of special interest or importance thus it was that i had communicated with him freely in regard to the threatening aspect of events in the earlier part of the winter of 186061 when he told me of the work that had been done or was doing at fort * is the elevation of its parapet by crowning it with barrels of * pointed out to him the * as well as inefficiency of the measure it seemed to me impolitic to make * preparations for defense when no attack was threatened and the means adopted were inefficient because any ordinary * would knock the barrels off the parapet and thus to render them only hurtful to the defenders he inquired whether the expedient had not been successful at fort brown on the rio grande in the beginning of the mexican war and was answered that the attack on fort brown had been made with smallarms or at great distance after the removal of the garrison to the stronger and safer position of fort sumter i called upon him again to represent from my knowledge of the people and the circumstances of the case how productive the movement would be of discontent and how likely to lead to collision one of the vexed questions of the day was by what authority the collector of the port should be appointed and the rumor was that instructions had been given to the commanding officer at fort sumter not to allow vessels to pass unless under * from the united states collector it was easy to understand that if a vessel were fired upon under such circumstances it would be accepted as the beginning of * result which both he and i desired to avert as the greatest calamity that could be foreseen or imagined my opinion was that the wisest and best course would be to withdraw the garrison altogether from the harbor of charleston the presidents objection to this was that it was his * duty to preserve and protect the property of the united states to this i replied with all the earnestness the occasion demanded that i would pledge my life that if an inventory were taken of all the stores and munitions in the fort and an * with a few men left in charge of them they would not be disturbed as a further guarantee i offered to obtain from the governor of south carolina full assurance that in case any * or lawless combination of persons should attempt to seize or disturb the property he would send from the citadel of charleston an adequate guard to protect it and to secure its * against molestation the president promised me to reflect upon this proposition and to confer with his cabinet upon the propriety of adopting it all cabinet consultations are secret which is equivalent to saying that i never knew what occurred in that meeting to which my proposition was submitted the result was not communicated to me but the events which followed proved that the suggestion was not accepted major anderson who commanded the garrison had many ties and associations that bound him to the south he performed his part like the true soldier and man of the finest sense of honor that he was but that it was most painful to him to be charged with the duty of holding the fort as a threat to the people of charleston is a fact known to many others as well as to myself we had been cadets together he was my first acquaintance in that corps and the friendship then formed was never interrupted we had served together in the summer and autumn of 1860 in a commission of inquiry into the discipline course of studies and general condition of the united states military academy at the close of our labors the commission had adjourned to meet again in washington about the end of the ensuing november to examine the report and revise it for transmission to congress major andersons duties in charleston harbor hindered him from attending this adjourned meeting of the commission and he wrote to me its chairman to explain the cause of his absence that letter was lost when my library and private papers were captured from my home in mississippi if any one has preserved it as a trophy of war its publication would show how bright was the honor how broad the patriotism of major anderson and how fully he sympathized with me as to the evils which then lowered over the country in comparing the past and the present among the mighty changes which passion and sectional hostility have wrought one is profoundly and painfully impressed by the extent to which public opinion has drifted from the landmarks set up by the sages and patriots who formed the constitutional union and observed by those who administered its government down to the time when war between the states was inaugurated mr buchanan the last president of the old school would as soon have thought of aiding in the establishment of a monarchy among us as of accepting the doctrine of coercing the states into submission to the will of a majority in mass of the people of the united states when discussing the question of withdrawing the troops from the port of charleston he yielded a ready assent to the proposition that the cession of a site for a fort for purposes of public defense lapses whenever that fort should be employed by the * against the state by which the cession was made on the familiar principle that any grant for a specific purpose * when it ceases to be used for that purpose whether on this or any other ground if the garrison of fort sumter had been withdrawn in accordance with the spirit of the constitution of the united states from which the power to apply coercion to a state was deliberately and * excluded and if this had been distinctly assigned as a reason for its withdrawal the honor of the united states government would have been maintained intact and nothing could have operated more powerfully to quiet the apprehensions and allay the resentment of the people of south carolina the influence which such a measure would have exerted upon the states which had not yet seceded but were then contemplating the adoption of that extreme remedy would probably have induced further delay and the mellowing effect of time with a realization of the dangers to be incurred might have wrought mutual * indeed anything could have checked the madness then prevailing among the people of the northern states in their thirst for power and forgetfulness of the duties of federation it would have been easy to concede this point the little garrison of fort sumter served only as a menace for it was utterly incapable of holding the fort if attacked and the poor attempt soon afterward made to renforce and provision it by such a vessel as the star of the west might by the uncharitable be readily construed as a scheme to provoke hostilities yet from my knowledge of mr buchanan i do not hesitate to say that he had no such wish or purpose his abiding hope was to avert a collision or at least to postpone it to a period beyond the close of his official term the management of the whole affair was what talleyrand describes as something worse than a crimea blunder whatever treatment the case demanded should have been prompt to wait was fatuity the illadvised attempt secretly to throw renforcements and provisions into fort sumter by means of the steamer star of the west resulted in the repulsion of that vessel at the mouth of the harbor by the authorities of south carolina on the morning of the 9th of january on her refusal to * she was fired upon and put back to sea with her recruits and supplies a telegraphic account of this event was handed me a few hours afterward when stepping into my carriage to go to the * although i had then for some time ceased to visit the president yet under the impulse of this renewed note of danger to the country i drove immediately to the executive mansion and for the last time appealed to him to take such prompt measures as were evidently necessary to avert the impending calamity the result was even more unsatisfactory than that of former efforts had been on the same day the special message of the president on the state of the union dated the day previous 8th of january was submitted to congress this message was accompanied by the first letter of the south carolina commissioners to the president with his answer but of course not by their rejoinder which he had declined to receive mr buchanan in his memoirs complains that immediately after the reading of his message this rejoinder which he terms an insulting letter was presented by me to the senate and by that body received and entered upon its journal the simple truth is that regarding it as essential to a complete understanding of the transaction and its publication as a mere act of justice to the commissioners i presented and had it read in the senate but its appearance upon the journal as part of the proceedings instead of being merely a document introduced as part of my remarks was the result of a * objection made by a socalled republican senator to the reading of the document by the clerk of the senate at my request this will be made manifest by an examination of the debate and proceedings which ensued the * recoiled upon its author and supporters and gave the letter a vantageground in respect of prominence which i could not have foreseen or expected the next day january 10th the speech was delivered the greater part of which may be found in the * last that i ever made in the senate of the united states except in taking leave and by the sentiments of which i am content that my career both before and since should be judged the history of fort sumter during the remaining period until the organization of the confederate government may be found in the correspondence given in the appendix from this it will be seen that the authorities of south carolina still continued to refrain from any act of aggression or retaliation under the provocation of the secret attempt to renforce the garrison as they had previously under that of its * transfer from one fort to another another commissioner the hon i w hayne was sent to washington by the governor of south carolina to effect if possible an amicable and peaceful transfer of the fort and settlement of all questions relating to property this commissioner remained for nearly a month endeavoring to accomplish the objects of his mission but was met only by * and unsatisfactory answers and eventually returned without having effected anything there is one passage in the last letter of colonel hayne to the president which presents the case of the occupancy of fort sumter by the united states troops so clearly and forcibly that it may be proper to quote it he writes as follows thus during the remainder of mr buchanans administration matters went rapidly from bad to worse the old statesman who with all his defects had long possessed and was entitled still to retain the confidence due to extensive political knowledge and love of his country in all its * had in his earlier career looked steadily to the constitution as the mariner looks to the compass for * to private life at the expiration of his term of office having effected nothing to allay the storm which had been steadily gathering during his administration timid vacillation was then succeeded by unscrupulous cunning and for futile efforts without hostile collision to impose a claim of authority upon people who repudiated it were substituted measures which could be sustained only by force mississippi was the second state to withdraw from the union her ordinance of secession being adopted on the 9th of january 1861 she was quickly followed by florida on the 10th alabama on the 11th and in the course of the same month by georgia on the 18th and louisiana on the 26th the conventions of these states together with that of south carolina agreed in * montgomery alabama as the place and the 4th of february as the day for the assembling of a congress of the seceding states to which each state convention acting as the direct representative of the sovereignty of the people thereof appointed delegates telegraphic intelligence of the secession of mississippi had reached washington some considerable time before the fact was officially communicated to me this official knowledge i considered it proper to await before taking formal leave of the senate my associates from alabama and florida concurred in this view accordingly having received notification of the secession of these three states about the same time on the 21st of january messrs * and mallory of florida fitzpatrick and clay of alabama and myself announced the withdrawal of the states from which we were respectively accredited and took leave of the senate at the same time in the action which she then took mississippi certainly had no purpose to levy war against the united states or any of them as her senator i endeavored plainly to state her position in the annexed remarks addressed to the senate in taking leave of the body there are some who contend that we should have retained our seats and fought for our rights in the union could anything be less rational or less consistent than that a senator an ambassador from his state should insist upon representing it in a confederacy from which the state has withdrawn what was meant by fighting in the union i have never quite understood if it be to retain a seat in congress for the purpose of crippling the government and rendering it unable to perform its functions i can certainly not appreciate the idea of honor that sanctions the suggestion among the advantages claimed for this proposition by its supporters was that of * the president in the appointment of his cabinet and other officers necessary for the administration of public affairs would this have been to maintain the union formed by the states would such have been the government which washington recommended as a remedy for the defects of the original confederation the greatest of which was the paralysis of the action of the general agent by the opposition or indifference of the states sad as have been the consequences of the war which followed * in its moral material and political * we have good cause to feel proud that the course of the southern states has left no blot nor stain upon the honor and chivalry of their people during the interval between the announcement by telegraph of the secession of mississippi and the receipt of the official notification which enabled me to withdraw from the senate rumors were in circulation of a purpose on the part of the united states government to arrest members of congress preparing to leave washington on account of the secession of the states which they represented this threat received little attention from those most concerned indeed it was thought that it might not be an * mode of testing the question of the right of a state to withdraw from the union no attempt however was made to arrest any of the retiring members and after a delay of a few days in necessary preparations i left washington for mississippi passing through southwestern virginia east tennessee a small part of georgia and north alabama a deep interest in the events which had recently occurred was exhibited by the people of these states and much anxiety was indicated as to the future many years of agitation had made them familiar with the idea of separation nearly two generations had risen to manhood since it had begun to be discussed as a possible alternative few very few of the southern people had ever regarded it as a desirable event or otherwise than as a last resort for escape from evils more intolerable it was a calamity which however threatened they had still hoped might be averted or indefinitely postponed and they had regarded with contempt rather than anger the ravings of a party in the north which denounced the constitution and the union and persistently * their brethren of the south now however as well in virginia and tennessee neither of which had yet seceded as in the more southern states which had already taken that step the danger so often prophesied was perceived to be at the door and eager inquiries were made as to what would happen * as to the probability of war between the states the course which events were likely to take was shrouded in the greatest uncertainty in the minds of many there was the not unreasonable hope which had been expressed by the commissioner sent from mississippi to maryland that the secession of six southern * soon to be followed by that of * so arouse the sober thought and better feeling of the northern people as to compel their representatives to agree to a convention of the states and that such guarantees would be given as would secure to the south the domestic tranquillity and equality in the union which were rights assured under the federal compact there were others and they the most numerous class who considered that the separation would be final but peaceful for my own part while believing that secession was a right and properly a peaceable remedy i had never believed that it would be permitted to be peaceably exercised very few in the south at that time agreed with me and my answers to queries on the subject were therefore as unexpected as they were unwelcome on my arrival at jackson the capital of mississippi i found that the convention of the state had made provision for a state army and had appointed me to the command with the rank of majorgeneral four brigadiergenerals appointed in like manner by the convention were awaiting my arrival for assignment to duty after the preparation of the necessary rules and regulations the division of the state into districts the apportionment among them of the troops to be raised and the appointment of officers of the general staff as authorized by the ordinance of the convention such measures as were practicable were taken to obtain the necessary arms the state had few serviceable weapons and no establishment for their manufacture or repair this fact which is true of other southern states as of mississippi is a clear proof of the absence of any desire or expectation of war if the purpose of the northern states to make war upon us because of secession had been foreseen preparation to meet the consequences would have been contemporaneous with the adoption of a resort to that * remedy the possibility of which had for many years been contemplated had the southern states possessed arsenals and collected in them the requisite supplies of arms and munitions such preparation would not only have placed them more nearly on an equality with the north in the beginning of the war but might perhaps have been the best * of peace let us the survivors however not fail to do credit to the generous credulity which could not understand how in violation of the compact of union a war could be waged against the states or why they should be invaded because their people had deemed it necessary to withdraw from an association which had failed to fulfill the ends for which they had entered into it and which having been broken to their injury by the other parties had ceased to be binding upon them it is a satisfaction to know that the calamities which have befallen the southern states were the result of their credulous reliance on the power of the constitution that if it failed to protect their rights it would at least suffice to prevent an attempt at coercion if in the last resort they peacefully withdrew from the union when in after times the passions of the day shall have subsided and all the evidence shall have been collected and compared the philosophical * who asks why the majority of the stronger section invaded the peaceful homes of their late associates will be answered by history the * of empire impelled them to wage against their weaker neighbors a war of subjugation the congress of delegates from the seceding states convened at montgomery alabama according to appointment on the 4th of february 1861 their first work was to prepare a provisional constitution for the new confederacy to be formed of the states which had withdrawn from the union for which the style confederate states of america was adopted the powers conferred upon them were adequate for the performance of this duty the immediate necessity for which was obvious and urgent this constitution was adopted on the 8th of february to continue in force for one year unless superseded at an earlier date by a permanent organization it is printed in an appendix and for convenience of reference the permanent constitution adopted several weeks afterward is exhibited in connection with it and side by side with the constitution of the united states after which it was * the attention of the reader is invited to these documents and to a comparison of them although a more particular notice of the permanent constitution will be more appropriate hereafter on the next day 9th of february an election was held for the chief executive offices resulting as i afterward learned in my election to the presidency with the hon alexander h stephens of georgia as vicepresident mr stephens was a delegate from georgia to the congress while these events were occurring having completed the most urgent of my duties at the capital of mississippi i had gone to my home * in warren county and had begun in the homely but expressive language of mr clay to repair my fences while thus engaged notice was received of my election to the presidency of the confederate states with an urgent request to proceed immediately to montgomery for inauguration as this had been suggested as a probable event and what appeared to me adequate precautions had been taken to prevent it i was surprised and still more disappointed for reasons which it is not now necessary to state i had not believed my self as well suited to the office as some others i thought myself better adapted to command in the field and mississippi had given me the position which i preferred to any * highest rank in her army it was therefore that i afterward said in an address delivered in the capitol before the legislature of the state with reference to my election to the presidency of the confederacy that the duty to which i was thus called was temporary and that i expected soon to be with the army of mississippi again while on my way to montgomery and waiting in jackson mississippi for the railroad train i met the hon william l * who had filled with great distinction the office of chiefjustice of the state he said he was looking for me to make an inquiry he desired to know if it was true as he had just learned that i believed there would be war my opinion was freely given that there would be war long and bloody and that it * every one to put his house in order he expressed much surprise and said that he had not believed the report attributing this opinion to me he asked how i supposed war could result from the peaceable withdrawal of a sovereign state the answer was that it was not my opinion that war should be occasioned by the exercise of that right but that it would be judge * and i had not belonged to the same political party he being a whig but we fully agreed with regard to the question of the sovereignty of the states he had been an advocate of * doctrine to which i had never assented and which had at one time been the main issue in mississippi politics he had presided over the * nashville convention in 1849 and had possessed much influence in the state not only as an eminent jurist but as a citizen who had grown up with it and held many offices of honor and trust on my way to montgomery brief addresses were made at various places at which there were temporary * of the trains in response to calls from the crowds assembled at such points some of these addresses were grossly misrepresented in sensational reports made by irresponsible persons which were published in northern newspapers and were not considered worthy of correction under the pressure of the momentous duties then * upon me these false reports which represented me as invoking war and threatening devastation of the north have since been adopted by partisan writers as authentic history it is a sufficient answer to these accusations to refer to my farewell address to the senate already given as reported for the press at the time and in connection * to my inaugural address at montgomery on assuming the office of president of the confederate states on the 18th of february these two addresses delivered at an interval of a month during which no material change of circumstances had occurred being one before and the other after the date of the sensational reports referred to are sufficient to stamp them as utterly untrue the inaugural was deliberately prepared and uttered as written and in connection with the farewell speech to the senate presents a clear and authentic statement of the principles and purposes which actuated me on assuming the duties of the high office to which i had been called note relative to the election of president of the confederate states under the provisional constitution and some other subjects referred to in the foregoing chapters statements having been made seeming to imply that i was a candidate for the presidency of the confederate states that my election was the result of a misunderstanding or of accidental complications and also that i held extreme views and entertained at that period an inadequate conception of the magnitude of the war probably to be waged information on the subject has been contributed by several distinguished members of the provisional congress who still survive from a number of their letters which have been published the annexed extracts are given parts being omitted which refer to matters not of historical interest from a communication of the hon alexander m clayton of mississippi to the memphis appeal of june 21 1870 from the hon j a p campbell of mississippi now a justice of the supreme court of that state from the hon duncan f * of louisiana from the hon james chesnut of south carolina from the hon w porcher miles of virginia formerly of south carolina and a member of the provisional congress of 1861 after being inaugurated i proceeded to the formation of my cabinet that is the heads of the executive departments authorized by the laws of the provisional congress the unanimity existing among our people made this a much easier and more agreeable task than where the rivalries in the party of an executive have to be consulted and accommodated often at the expense of the highest capacity and fitness * by any other consideration than the public welfare having no friends to reward or enemies to punish it resulted that not one of those who formed my first cabinet had borne to me the relation of close personal friendship or had political claims upon me indeed with two of them i had no previous acquaintance it was my wish that the hon robert w barnwell of south carolina should be secretary of state i had known him intimately during a trying period of our joint service in the united states senate and he had won alike my esteem and regard before making known to him my wish in this connection the delegation of south carolina of which he was a member had resolved to recommend one of their number to be secretary of the treasury and mr barnwell with characteristic delicacy declined to accept my offer to him i had intended to offer the treasury department to mr toombs of georgia whose knowledge on subjects of finance had particularly attracted my notice when we served together in the united states senate mr barnwell having declined the state department and a colleague of his said to be peculiarly qualified for the treasury department having been recommended for it mr toombs was offered the state department for which others believed him to be well qualified mr mallory of florida had been chairman of the committee on naval affairs in the united states senate was extensively acquainted with the officers of the navy and for a * had much knowledge of * affairs therefore he was selected for secretary of the navy mr benjamin of louisiana had a very high reputation as a lawyer and my acquaintance with him in the senate had impressed me with the * of his intellect his systematic habits and capacity for labor he was therefore invited to the post of attorneygeneral mr reagan of texas i had known for a sturdy honest representative in the united states congress and his acquaintance with the territory included in the confederate states was both extensive and accurate these together with his industry and ability to labor indicated him as peculiarly fit for the office of postmastergeneral mr memminger of south carolina had a high reputation for knowledge of finance he bore an * character for integrity and close attention to duties and on the recommendation of the delegation from south carolina he was appointed secretary of the treasury and proved himself entirely worthy of the trust mr walker of alabama was a distinguished member of the bar of north alabama and was eminent among the politicians of that section he was earnestly recommended by gentlemen intimately and favorably known to me and was therefore selected for the war department his was the only name presented from alabama the executive departments having been organized my attention was first directed to preparation for military defense for though i in common with others desired to have a peaceful separation and sent commissioners to the united states government to effect if possible negotiations to that end i did not hold the common opinion that we would be allowed to depart in peace and therefore regarded it as an imperative duty to make all possible preparation for the contingency of war the legislation of the confederate congress furnishes the best evidence of the temper and spirit which prevailed in the organization of the confederate government the very first enactment made on the 9th of february #* day after the adoption of the provisional * this the next act adopted on the 14th of february was one continuing in office until the 1st of april next ensuing all officers connected with the collection of customs and the assistant * intrusted with the keeping of the moneys arising therefrom who were engaged in the performance of such duties within any of the confederate states with the same powers and functions which they had been exercising under the government of the united states the provisional constitution itself in the second section of its sixth article had ordained as follows in accordance with this requirement of the constitution the congress on the 15th of * my arrival at * a resolution declaring that it is the sense of this congress that a commission of three persons be appointed by the presidentelect as early as may be convenient after his inauguration and sent to the government of the united states of america for the purpose of negotiating friendly relations between that government and the confederate states of america and for the settlement of all questions of disagreement between the two governments upon principles of right justice equity and good faith persistent and to a great extent successful efforts were made to inflame the minds of the people of the northwestern states by representing to them that in consequence of the separation of the states they would lose the free navigation of the mississippi river at that early period in the life of the confederacy the intercourse between the north and south had been so little interrupted that the agitators whose vocation it was to deceive the masses of the people could not or should not have been ignorant that as early as the 25th of february 1861 an act was passed by the confederate congress and approved by the president to declare and establish the free navigation of the mississippi river that act began with the announcement that the peaceful navigation of the mississippi river is hereby declared free to the citizens of any of the states upon its borders or upon the borders of its navigable * and its provisions secure that freedom for all ships boats or vessels with their cargoes without any duty or hindrance except * * and other like charges by an act approved on the 26th of february all laws which forbade the employment in the * of vessels not enrolled or * and all laws imposing discriminating duties on foreign vessels or goods imported in them were repealed these acts and all other indications manifest the wellknown wish of the people of the confederacy to preserve the peace and encourage the most unrestricted commerce with all nations surely not least with their late associates the northern states thus far the hope that peace might be maintained was * perhaps the wish was father to the thought that there would be no war between the states lately united indeed all the laws enacted during the first session of the provisional congress show how consistent were the purposes and actions of its members with their original avowal of a desire peacefully to separate from those with whom they could not live in tranquillity * the government had been established to promote the common welfare under this state of feeling the government of the confederacy was instituted my own views and inclinations as has already been fully shown were in entire accord with the disposition manifested by the requirement of the provisional constitution and the resolution of the congress above recited for the appointment of a commission to negotiate friendly relations with the united states and an equitable and peaceable settlement of all questions which would necessarily arise under the new relations of the states toward one another next to the organization of a cabinet that of such a commission was accordingly one of the very first objects of attention three discreet wellinformed and distinguished citizens were selected as said commissioners and accredited to the president of the northern states mr lincoln to the end that by negotiation all questions between the two governments might be so adjusted as to avoid war and perpetuate the kind relations which had been cemented by the common trials sacrifices and glories of the people of all the states if sectional hostility had been engendered by dissimilarity of institutions and by a mistaken idea of moral responsibilities and by * * the family could no longer live and grow * * patriarchal teaching older than christianity it might have been learned that it was better to part to part peaceably and to continue from one to another the good offices of neighbors who by sacred memories were forbidden ever to be foes the nomination of the members of the commission was made on the 25th of * a week after my * confirmed by congress on the same day the commissioners appointed were messrs a b roman of louisiana martin j crawford of georgia and john forsyth of alabama mr roman was an honored citizen and had been governor of his native state mr crawford had served with distinction in congress for several years mr forsyth was an influential journalist and had been minister to mexico under appointment of mr pierce near the close of his term and continued so under that of mr buchanan these gentlemen moreover represented the three great parties which had ineffectually opposed the * of the socalled republicans exgovernor roman had been a whig in former years and one of the constitutional union or * party in the canvass of 1860 mr crawford as a staterights democrat had supported mr breckinridge and mr forsyth had been a zealous advocate of the claims of mr douglas the composition of the commission was therefore such as should have conciliated the sympathy and coperation of every element of conservatism with which they might have occasion to deal their commissions authorized and empowered them in the name of the confederate states to meet and confer with any person or persons duly authorized by the government of the united states being furnished with like power and authority and with him or them to agree treat consult and negotiate concerning all matters in which the parties were both interested no secret instructions were given them for there was nothing to conceal the objects of their mission were open and avowed and its inception and conduct throughout were characterized by frankness and good faith how this effort was received how the commissioners were kept waiting and while fair promises were held to the ear how military preparations were pushed forward for the unconstitutional criminal purpose of coercing states let the shameful record of that transaction attest while the events which have just been occupying our attention were occurring the last conspicuous effort was made within the union to stay the tide of usurpation which was driving the southern states into secession this effort was set on foot by virginia the general assembly of which state on the 19th of january 1861 adopted a preamble and resolutions * disunion and inviting all such states as were willing to unite in an earnest endeavor to avert it by an adjustment of the then existing controversies to appoint commissioners to meet in washington on the 4th of february to consider and if practicable agree upon some suitable adjustment expresident john tyler and messrs william c rives john w * george w summers and james a * of the most distinguished citizens of the * appointed to represent virginia in the proposed conference if they could agree with the commissioners of other states upon any plan of settlement requiring amendments to the federal constitution they were instructed to communicate them to congress with a view to their submission to the several states for ratification the border states in general promptly acceded to this proposition of virginia and others followed so that in the peace congress or conference which assembled according to appointment on the 4th and adjourned on the 27th of february twentyone states were eventually represented of which fourteen were northern or * and seven slaveholding states the six states which had already seceded were of course not of the number represented nor were texas and arkansas the secession of which although not consummated was obviously inevitable three of the northwestern * wisconsin and * the two pacific * and * held aloof from the conference in the case of these last two distance and lack of time perhaps hindered action with regard to the other three their reasons for declining to participate in the movement were not officially assigned and are therefore only subjects for conjecture some remarkable revelations were afterward made however with regard to the action of one of them it appears from correspondence read in the senate on the 27th of february that the two senators from michigan had at first opposed the participation of that state in the conference on the ground that it was as one of them expressed it a step toward obtaining that concession which the imperious slave power so * * is to say in plain terms they objected to it because it might lead to a compromise and pacification finding however that most of the other northern states were * of them by men of moderate and conciliatory * writer had subsequently changed his mind and at a late period of the session of the conference recommended the sending of delegations of true unflinching men who would be in favor of the constitution as it * is who would oppose any amendment proposed in the interests of harmony and pacification the other senator exhibits a similar alarm at the prospect of compromise and a * change of opinion he * the sending of * men to thwart the threatened success of the friends of peace and * with an expression of the humane and patriotic sentiment that without a little * the union would not be worth a rush with such unworthy levity did these leaders of sectional strife express their exultation in the prospect of the conflict which was to * the land with blood and * thousands of homes in mourning it is needless to follow the course of the deliberations of the peace conference it included among its members many men of distinction and eminent ability and some of unquestionable patriotism from every part of the union the venerable john tyler presided and took an active and ardent interest in the efforts made to effect a settlement and avert the impending disasters a plan was finally agreed upon by a majority of the states represented for certain amendments to the federal constitution which it was hoped might be acceptable to all parties and put an end to further contention in its leading features this plan resembled that of mr crittenden heretofore spoken of which was still pending in the senate though with some variations which were regarded as less favorable to the south it was reported immediately to both houses of the united states congress in the senate mr crittenden promptly expressed his willingness to accept it as a substitute for his own proposition and eloquently urged its adoption but the arrogance of a sectional majority inflated by recent triumph was too powerful to be allayed by the appeals of patriotism or the counsels of wisdom the plan of the peace conference was treated by the majority with the contemptuous indifference shown to every other movement for conciliation its mere consideration was objected to by the extreme * and although they failed in this it was defeated on a vote as were the crittenden propositions with the failure of these efforts which occurred on the eve of the inauguration of mr lincoln and the accession to power of a party founded on a basis of sectional aggression and now thoroughly committed to its prosecution and * expired the last hopes of reconciliation and union * the course of the debate in the senate on these grave propositions a manly and eloquent speech was made on the 2d of march 1861 by the hon joseph lane a senator from oregon who had been the candidate of the democratic staterights party for the * of the united states in the canvass of 1860 some passages of this speech seem peculiarly appropriate for * here general lane was replying to a speech of mr andrew johnson of tennessee afterward president of the united states it is a great mistake or * of fact to assume that at the period under consideration the southern states stood alone in the assertion of the principles which have been laid down in this work with regard to the right of secession and the wrong of coercion down to the formation of the confederate government the one was distinctly admitted the other still more distinctly disavowed and repudiated by many of the leaders of public opinion in the north of both * any purpose of direct coercion was disclaimed by nearly all if presented at all it was in the delusive and ambiguous guise of the execution of the laws and protection of the public property the new york * leading organ of the party which triumphed in the election of #* said soon after the result of that election was ascertained with reference to secession we hold with jefferson to the inalienable right of communities to alter or abolish forms of government that have become oppressive or injurious and if the cotton states shall decide that they can do better out of the union than in it we insist on letting them go in peace the right to secede may be a revolutionary right but it exists nevertheless and we do not see how one party can have a right to do what another party has a right to prevent we must ever resist the asserted right of any state to remain in the union and nullify or defy the laws thereof to withdraw from the union is quite another matter and whenever a considerable section of our union shall deliberately resolve to go out we shall resist all coercive measures designed to keep her in we hope never to live in a republic whereof one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets the only liberty taken with this extract has been that of presenting certain parts of it in italics nothing that has ever been said by the author of this work in the foregoing chapters on the floor of the senate or elsewhere more distinctly asserted the right of secession nothing that has been quoted from hamilton or madison or marshall or john quincy adams more emphatically * the claim of right to restrain or coerce a state in the exercise of its free choice nothing that has been said since the war which followed could furnish a more striking condemnation of its origin prosecution purposes and results a comparison of the sentiments above quoted with the subsequent career of the party of which that journal was and long had been the recognized organ would exhibit a striking * and inconsistency the tribune was far from being singular among its northern contemporaries in the entertainment of such views as mr greeley its chief editor has shown by many citations in his book the american conflict the albany * about the same time said in language which mr greeley * as clear and temperate we sympathize with and justify the south as far as this their rights have been invaded to the extreme limit possible within the forms of the constitution and beyond this limit their feelings have been insulted and their interests and honor assailed by almost every possible form of denunciation and invective and if we deemed it certain that the real animus of the republican party could be carried into the administration of the federal government and become the permanent policy of the nation we should think that all the instincts of * and of manhood rightfully impelled them to a resort to revolution and a separation from the union and we would applaud them and wish them godspeed in the adoption of such a remedy again the same paper said a day or two afterward if south carolina or any other state through a convention of her people shall formally separate herself from the union probably both the present and the next executive will simply let her alone and quietly allow all the functions of the federal government within her limits to be suspended any other course would be madness as it would at once enlist all the southern states in the controversy and plunge the whole country into a civil war as a matter of policy and wisdom therefore independent of the question of right we should deem resort to force most disastrous the new york * journal which claimed

the fact that they were copied with approval by other northern journals mr lincoln when delivering his inaugural address on the 4th of march 1861 had not so far lost all respect for the consecrated traditions of the founders of the constitution and for the majesty of the principle of state sovereignty as openly to * the claim of coercion while arguing against the right to secede and asserting his intention to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and collect the duties and * he says that beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no

for cherishing the hope to which they so fondly clung that the separation would indeed be as peaceable in fact as it was on their part in purpose that the conservative and patriotic feeling still existing in the north would control the elements of sectional hatred and bloodthirsty fanaticism and that there would be really no war and here the * reader may very naturally ask what became of all this feeling how was it that in the course of a few weeks it had disappeared like a morning mist where was the host of men who had declared that an army marching to invade the southern states should first pass over their dead bodies no new question had * change in the attitude occupied by the seceding * cause for controversy not already existing when these utterances were made and yet the sentiments which they expressed were so entirely swept away by the tide of reckless fury which soon afterward impelled an armed invasion of the south that with a few praiseworthy but powerless exceptions scarcely a vestige of them was left not only were they obliterated but seemingly forgotten i leave to others to offer if they can an explanation of this strange phenomenon to the student of

lower and * so much on account of their greater extent as of their greater violence the conservative temper of the people of the confederate states was conspicuously exhibited in the most important product of the early labors of their representatives in congress assembled the provisional constitution although prepared only for temporary use and necessarily in some haste was so well adapted for the purposes which it was intended to serve that many thought it would have been wise to continue it in force indefinitely or at least until the * of the confederacy should be assured the congress

which at the time of the formation of the constitution of the united states would have been deemed entirely superfluous the official term of the president was fixed at six instead of four years and it

provide by law for the admission of the principal officer in each of the executive departments or cabinet officers to a seat upon the floor of either house with the privilege of taking part in the discussion of subjects pertaining to his department this wise and judicious provision which would have tended to obviate much delay and misunderstanding was however never put into execution by the necessary legislation protective duties for the benefit of special branches of industry which had been so fruitful a source of trouble under the government of the united states were altogether prohibited so also were bounties from the treasury and extra compensation for services rendered by officers contractors or employees of any description a vote of two thirds of each house was requisite for the appropriation of money from the treasury unless asked for by the chief of a department and submitted to congress by the president or for payment of the expenses of congress or of claims

were to be subject to final ratification by two thirds of the states other changes or modifications worthy of special notice related to internal improvements bankruptcy laws duties on exports suits in the federal courts and the government of the territories with regard to slavery and the slavetrade the provisions of this constitution furnish an effectual answer to the assertion so often made that the confederacy was founded on slavery that slavery was its cornerstone etc property in slaves already existing was recognized and guaranteed just as it was by the constitution of the united states and the rights of such property in the common territories were protected against any such hostile discrimination as had been attempted in the union but the extension of slavery in the only practical sense of that phrase was more distinctly and effectually precluded by the confederate than by the federal constitution this will be manifest on a comparison of the provisions of the two relative to the slavetrade these are found at the beginning of the ninth section of the first article of each instrument the constitution of the united states has the following the confederate constitution on the other hand ordained as follows in the case of the united states the only prohibition is against any interference by congress with the slavetrade for a term of years and it was further * by the authority given to impose a duty upon it the term of years it is true had long since expired but there was still no prohibition of the trade by the constitution it was after 1808 entirely within the discretion of congress either to encourage tolerate or prohibit it under the confederate constitution on the contrary the african slavetrade was hereby forbidden positively and unconditionally from the beginning neither the confederate government nor that of any of the states could permit it and the congress was expressly required to enforce the prohibition the only discretion in the matter intrusted to the congress was whether or not to permit the introduction of slaves from any of the united states or their territories mr lincoln in his inaugural address had said i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so now if there was no purpose on the part of the government of the united states to interfere with the institution of slavery within its already existing * proposition which permitted its * within those limits by natural * inasmuch as the confederate constitution precluded any other than the same natural increase we may plainly perceive the * and absurdity of the pretension by which a * sympathy has been obtained in certain quarters for the war upon the south on the ground that it was a war in behalf of freedom against slavery i had no direct part in the preparation of the confederate constitution no consideration of delicacy forbids me therefore to say in closing this brief review of that instrument that it was a model of wise temperate and liberal statesmanship intelligent criticism from hostile as well as friendly sources has been compelled to admit its * and has sustained the judgment of a popular northern journal which said a few days after it was adopted and published the appointment of commissioners to proceed to washington for the purpose of establishing friendly relations with the united states and effecting an equitable settlement of all questions relating to the common property of the states and the public debt has already been mentioned no time was lost in carrying this purpose into execution mr * of the * montgomery on or about the 27th of february and arrived in washington two or three days before the expiration of mr buchanans term of office as president of the united states besides his official credentials he bore the following letter to the president of a personal or * character intended to facilitate if possible the speedy accomplishment of the objects of his mission it may here be mentioned in explanation of my desire that the commission or at least a part of it should reach washington before the close of mr buchanans term that i had received an intimation from him through a distinguished senator of one of the border states that he would be happy to receive a commissioner or commissioners from the confederate states and would refer to the senate any communication that might be made through such a commission mr * a judge of the supreme court of georgia and the only surviving member of the * a manuscript account which he has kindly furnished of his recollections of events connected with it says that on arriving in washington at the early hour of halfpast four oclock in the morning he was surprised to see pennsylvania avenue from the old national to willards hotel crowded with men hurrying some toward the former but most of the faces in the direction of the latter where the new president mr lincoln presidentelect the great political * for the time being had taken up his lodgings at this point continues judge crawford the crowd swelled to astonishing numbers of expectant and hopeful men awaiting an opportunity either to see mr lincoln himself or to communicate with him through some one who might be so fortunate as to have access to his presence describing his reception in the federal capital judge crawford says another of the commissioners mr forsyth having arrived in washington on the 12th of * days after the inauguration of mr * two commissioners then present messrs forsyth and crawford addressed to mr seward secretary of state a note informing him of their presence stating the friendly and peaceful purposes of their mission and requesting the appointment of a day as early as possible for the presentation to the president of the united states of their credentials and the objects which they had in view this letter will be found in the appendix with other correspondence which ensued published soon after the events to which it relates the attention of the reader is specially invited to these documents but as additional revelations have been made since they were first published it will be proper in order to a full understanding of the transactions to which they refer to give here a brief statement of the facts no written answer to the note of the commissioners was delivered to them for twentyseven days after it was written the paper of mr seward in reply without signature or address dated march 15th was filed as he states on that day in the department of state but a copy of it was not handed to the commissioners until the 8th of april but an oral answer had been made to the note of the commissioners at a much earlier date for the significance of which it will be necessary to bear in mind the condition of affairs at charleston and pensacola fort sumter was still occupied by the garrison under command of major anderson with no material change in the circumstances since the failure of the attempt made in january to renforce it by means of the star of the west this standing menace at the gates of the chief harbor of south carolina had been tolerated by the government and people of that state and afterward by the confederate authorities in the abiding hope that it would be removed without compelling a collision of forces fort pickens on one side of the entrance to the harbor of pensacola was also occupied by a garrison of united states troops while the two forts * and * on the other side were in possession of the confederates communication by sea was not entirely precluded however in the case of fort pickens the garrison had been strengthened and a fleet of federal * was lying outside of the harbor the condition of affairs at these * at fort * a subject of anxiety with the friends of peace and the hope of settling by negotiation the questions involved in their occupation had been one of the most urgent motives for the prompt dispatch of the commissioners to washington the letter of the commissioners to mr seward was written as we have seen on the 12th of march the oral message above mentioned was obtained and communicated to the commissioners through the agency of two judges of the supreme court of the united * nelson of new york and campbell of alabama on the 15th of march according to the statement of judge campbell mr justice nelson visited the secretaries of state and of the treasury and the attorneygeneral messrs seward chase and * to dissuade them from undertaking to put in execution any policy of coercion during the term of the supreme court he had very carefully examined the laws of the united states to enable him to attain his conclusions and from time to time he had consulted the chief justice taney upon the questions which his examination had suggested his conclusion was that without very serious violations of constitution and statutes coercion could not be successfully effected by the executive department i had made continues judge campbell a similar examination and i concurred in his conclusions and opinions as he was returning from his visit to the state department we casually met and he informed me of what he had done he said he had spoken to these officers at large that he was received with respect and listened to with attention by all with approbation by the attorneygeneral and with great cordiality by the secretary of state that the secretary had expressed gratification to find so many impediments to the disturbance of peace and only wished there had been more he stated that the secretary told him there was a present cause of embarrassment that the southern commissioners had demanded recognition and a refusal would lead to irritation and excitement in the southern states and would cause a * and excitement in the northern states prejudicial to a peaceful adjustment justice nelson suggested that i might be of service the result of the interview between these two distinguished gentlemen we are informed was another visit by both of them to the state department for the purpose of urging mr seward to reply to the commissioners and assure them of the desire of the united states government for a friendly adjustment mr seward seems to have objected to an immediate recognition of the commissioners on the ground that the state of public sentiment in the north would not sustain it in connection with the withdrawal of the troops from fort sumter which had been determined on the evacuation of sumter he said is as much as the administration can bear judge campbell adds i concurred in the conclusion that the evacuation of sumter involved responsibility and stated that there could not be too much caution in the adoption of measures so as not to shock or to * the public sentiment and that the evacuation of sumter was sufficient for the present in that direction i stated that i would see the commissioners and i would write to mr davis to that effect i asked him what i should say as to sumter and as to pickens he authorized me to say that before that letter could reach him mr davis he would learn by telegraph that the order for the evacuation of sumter had been made he said the condition of pickens was satisfactory and there would be no change made there the italics in this extract are my own the letter in which this promise was communicated to me has been lost but it was given in substantially the terms above stated as authorized by mr * the order for the evacuation of the fort would be issued before the letter could reach me the same assurance was given on the same day to the commissioners judge campbell tells us that mr crawford was slow to consent to refrain from pressing the demand for recognition it was only after some discussion and the expression of some objections that he consented to do so this consent was clearly one part of a stipulation of which the other part was the pledge that the fort would be evacuated in the course of a few days mr crawford required the pledge of mr seward to be reduced to writing with judge campbells personal assurance of its genuineness and accuracy this written statement was exhibited to judge nelson before its delivery and approved by him the fact that the pledge had been given in his name and behalf was communicated to mr seward the same evening by letter he was cognizant of consenting to and in great part the author of the whole transaction it will be observed that not only the commissioners in washington but the confederate government at montgomery also were thus assured on the highest * of the secretary of state of the united states the official organ of communication of the views and purposes of his * the intention of that government to order the evacuation of fort sumter within a few days from the 15th of march and not to disturb the existing status at fort pickens moreover this was not the mere statement of a fact but a pledge given as the consideration of an appeal to the confederate government and its commissioners to refrain from embarrassing the federal administration by prosecuting any further claims at the same time as such a pledge it was accepted and while its fulfillment was quietly awaited the commissioners forbore to make any further demand for reply to their note of the 12th of march five days having elapsed in this condition of affairs the commissioners in washington telegraphed brigadiergeneral beauregard commander of the confederate forces at charleston inquiring whether the fort had been evacuated or any action taken by major anderson indicating the probability of an evacuation answer was made to this dispatch that the fort had not been evacuated that there were no indications of such a purpose but that major anderson was still working on its defenses this dispatch was taken to mr seward by judge campbell two interviews occurred in relation to it at both of which judge nelson was also present of the result of these interviews judge campbell states the last was full and satisfactory the secretary was buoyant and sanguine he spoke of his ability to carry through his policy with confidence he accounted for the delay as accidental and not involving the integrity of his assurance that the evacuation would take place and that i should know whenever any change was made in the resolution in reference to sumter or to pickens i repeated this assurance in writing to judge crawford and informed governor seward in writing what i had said it would be incredible but for the ample proofs which have since been brought to light that during all this period of reiterated assurances of a purpose to withdraw the garrison from fort sumter and of excuses for delay on account of the difficulties which embarrassed it the government of the united states was assiduously engaged in devising means for furnishing supplies and renforcements to the garrison with the view of retaining possession of the fort mr g v fox afterward assistant secretary of the united states navy had proposed a plan for renforcing and furnishing supplies to the garrison of fort sumter in february during the administration of mr buchanan in a letter published in the newspapers since the war he gives an account of the manner in which the proposition was renewed to the new administration and its reception by them as follows thus we see that at the very moment when mr secretary seward was renewing to the confederate government through judge campbell his positive assurance that the evacuation would take place this emissary was on his way to charleston to obtain information and devise measures by means of which this promise might be broken on his arrival in charleston mr fox tells us that he sought an interview with captain hartstein of the confederate navy and through this officer obtained from governor pickens permission to visit fort sumter he fails in his narrative to state what we learn from governor pickens himself that this permission was obtained expressly upon the pledge of pacific purposes notwithstanding this pledge he employed the opportunity afforded by his visit to mature the details of his plan for furnishing supplies and renforcements to the garrison he did not he says communicate his plan or purposes to major anderson the commanding officer of the garrison having * enough perhaps to divine that the instincts of that brave and honest soldier would have revolted at and rebuked the duplicity and perfidy of the whole transaction the result of his visit was however reported at washington his plan was approved by president lincoln and he was sent to new york to make arrangements for putting it in execution this it will be remembered occurred while mr fox was making active though secret preparations for his relief expedition colonel or major * as he is variously styled in the correspondence did not return to charleston as promised about the 30th of march which was saturday a telegram from governor pickens was received by the commissioners in washington making inquiry with regard to colonel * and the meaning of the protracted delay to fulfill the promise of evacuation this was fifteen days after the original assurance of mr seward that the garrison would be withdrawn immediately and ten days after his explanation that the delay was accidental the dispatch of governor pickens was taken by judge campbell to mr seward who appointed the ensuing monday 1st of april for an interview and answer at that interview mr seward informed judge campbell that the president was concerned about the contents of the * was a point of honor involved that * had no agency from him nor title to speak this late suggestion of the point of honor would seem under the circumstances to have been made in a spirit of sarcastic pleasantry like sir john * celebrated discourse on the same subject the only substantial result of the conversation however was the written assurance of mr seward to be communicated to the commissioners that the government will not undertake to supply fort sumter without giving notice to governor pickens this it will be observed was a very material * from the positive pledge previously given and reiterated to the commissioners to governor pickens and to myself directly that the fort was to be forthwith evacuated judge campbell in his account of the interview says i asked him mr seward whether i was to understand that there had been a change in his former communications his answer was none about the close of the same week the first in april the patience of the commissioners having now been wellnigh exhausted and the hostile preparations of the government of the united states notwithstanding the secrecy with which they were conducted having become matter of general rumor a letter was addressed to mr seward upon the subject by judge campbell in behalf of the commissioners again asking whether the assurances so often given were well or ill founded to this the secretary returned answer in writing faith as to sumter fully kept wait and see this was on the 7th of april the very next day the 8th the following official notification without date or signature was read to governor pickens of south carolina and general beauregard in charleston by mr chew an official of the state department mr sewards in washington who * did a captain or lieutenant talbot who accompanied himthat it was from the president of the united states and delivered by him to mr chew on the #* day before mr sewards assurance of faith fully kept thus disappeared the last vestige of the plighted faith and pacific pledges of the federal government in order fully to appreciate the significance of this communication and of the time and circumstances of its delivery it must be borne in mind that the naval expedition which had been secretly in preparation for some time at new york under direction of captain fox was now ready to sail and might reasonably be expected to be at charleston almost immediately after the notification was delivered to governor pickens and before preparation could be made to receive it owing to * or * in the washington cabinet however and then to the delay caused by a severe storm at sea this expectation was disappointed and the confederate commander at charleston had opportunity to communicate with montgomery and receive instructions for his guidance before the arrival of the fleet which had been intended to be a surprise in publications made since the war by members of mr lincolns cabinet it has been represented that during the period of the disgraceful transactions above detailed there were dissensions and divisions in the * members of it urging measures of prompt and decided coercion the secretary of state * a pacific or at least a * policy and the president * for a time between the two but eventually adopting the views of the * in these statements it is represented that the assurances and pledges given by mr seward to the confederate government and its commissioners were given on his own authority and without the consent or approval of the president of the united states the absurdity of any such attempt to * the action of the president from that of his secretary and to relieve the former of responsibility for the conduct of the latter is too evident to require argument or comment it is impossible to believe that during this whole period of nearly a month mr lincoln was ignorant of the communications that were passing between the confederate commissioners and mr seward through the distinguished member of the supreme * holding his seat as * was acting as * on one occasion judge campbell informs us that the secretary in the midst of an important interview excused himself for the purpose of * with the president before giving a final answer and left his visitor for some time awaiting his return from that conference when the answer was given avowedly and directly proceeding from the president if however it were possible to suppose that mr seward was acting on his own responsibility and practicing a deception upon his own chief as well as upon the confederate authorities in the pledges which he made to the latter it is nevertheless certain that the principal facts were brought to light within a few days after the close of the efforts at negotiation yet the secretary of state was not * and brought to trial for the grave offense of undertaking to conduct the most momentous and vital transactions that had been or could be brought before the government of the united states without the knowledge and in opposition to the will of the president and for having involved the government in dishonor if not in disaster he was not even dismissed from office but continued to be the chief officer of the cabinet and confidential adviser of the president as he was afterward of the ensuing administration occupying that station during two consecutive terms no * of his action no apology nor explanation was ever made politically and legally the president is unquestionably responsible in all cases for the action of any member of his cabinet and in this case it is as preposterous to attempt to * from him the moral as it would be impossible to relieve him of the legal responsibility that rests upon the government of the united states for the systematic series of * perpetrated by its authority on the other hand mr seward throughout the whole negotiation was fully informed of the views of his * in the cabinet and of the president whatever his real hopes or purposes may have been in the beginning it is positively certain that long before the end and while still reiterating his assurances that the garrison would be withdrawn he knew that it had been determined and that active preparations were in progress to strengthen it mr * welles who was secretary of the navy in mr lincolns cabinet gives the following account of one of the transactions of the period this account is confirmed by a letter of mr montgomery blair the date of the announcement of the presidents final purpose is fixed by mr welles in the neat paragraph to that above quoted as the 28th of march this was four days before mr sewards assurance given judge * conference with the * there would be no departure from the pledges previously given which were that the fort would be evacuated and ten days before his written renewal of the * as to sumter fully kept wait and see this assurance too was given at the very moment when a messenger from his own department was on the way to charleston to notify the governor of south carolina that faith would not be kept in the matter it is scarcely necessary to say that the commissioners had with good reason ceased to place any confidence in the promises of the united states government before they ceased to be made on the 8th of april they sent the following dispatch to general beauregard on the same day the announcement made to governor pickens through mr chew was made known the commissioners immediately applied for a * answer to their note of march 12th which had been permitted to remain in abeyance the paper of the secretary of state dated march 15th was thereupon delivered to them this paper with the final rejoinder of the commissioners and judge campbells letters to the secretary of april 13th and april 20th respectively will be found in the appendix negotiation was now at an end and the commissioners withdrew from washington and returned to their homes their last dispatch before leaving shows that they were still dependent upon public rumor and the newspapers for information as to the real purposes and preparations of the federal administration it was in these words the annexed extracts from my message to the confederate congress at the opening of its special session on the 29th of april will serve as a * of the events above narrated with all of comment that it was then or is now considered necessary to add the course pursued by the government of the united states with regard to the forts had not passed without earnest remonstrance from the most intelligent and patriotic of its own friends during the period of the events which constitute the subject of the preceding chapter in the senate of the united states which continued in executive session for several weeks after the inauguration of mr lincoln it was the subject of discussion mr douglas of * was certainly not suspected of sympathy with secession or lack of devotion to the * the 15th of march offered a resolution recommending the withdrawal of the garrisons from all forts within the limits of the states which had seceded except those at key west and the dry * in support of this resolution he said mr douglas in urging the maintenance of peace as a motive for the evacuation of the forts was no doubt aware of the full force of his words he knew that their continued occupation was virtually a declaration of war the generalinchief of the united states army also it is well known urgently advised the evacuation of the forts but the most striking protest against the coercive measures finally adopted was that of major anderson himself the letter in which his views were expressed has been carefully suppressed in the partisan * of that period and wellnigh lost sight of although it does the highest honor to his patriotism and integrity it was written on the same day on which the announcement was made to governor pickens of the purpose of the united states government to send supplies to the fort and is worthy of reproduction here this frank and manly letter although written with the reserve necessarily belonging to a communication from an officer to his military superiors expressing dissatisfaction with orders fully * major anderson from all suspicion of complicity or sympathy with the bad faith of the government which he was serving it * entirely with the sentiments expressed in his private letter to me already mentioned as lost or stolen and exhibits him in the attitude of faithful performance of a duty inconsistent with his domestic ties and repugnant to his patriotism the relief squadron as with unconscious irony it was termed was already under way for charleston consisting according to their own statement of eight vessels carrying twentysix guns and about fourteen hundred men including the troops sent for renforcement of the garrison these facts became known to the confederate government and it was obvious that no time was to be lost in preparing for and if possible anticipating the impending assault the character of the instructions given general beauregard in this emergency may be inferred from the ensuing correspondence which is here reproduced from contemporary publications it is essential to a right understanding of the last two letters to give more than a * attention to that of major anderson bearing in mind certain important facts not referred to in the correspondence major anderson had been requested to state the time at which he would evacuate the fort if unmolested agreeing in the mean time not to use his guns against the city and the troops defending it unless fort sumter should be first attacked by them on these conditions general beauregard offered to refrain from opening fire upon him in his reply major anderson promises to evacuate the fort on the 15th of april provided he should not before that time receive controlling instructions or additional supplies from his government he furthermore offers to pledge himself not to open fire upon the confederates unless in the mean time compelled to do so by some hostile act against the fort or the flag of his government inasmuch as it was known to the confederate commander that the controlling instructions were already issued and that the additional supplies were momentarily expected inasmuch also as any attempt to introduce the supplies would compel the opening of fire upon the vessels bearing them under the flag of the united * releasing major anderson from his * is evident that his conditions could not be accepted it would have been merely after the avowal of a hostile determination by the government of the united states to await an inevitable conflict with the guns of fort sumter and the naval forces of the united states in combination with no possible hope of averting it unless in the improbable event of a delay of the expected fleet for nearly four days longer in point of fact it arrived off the harbor on the same day but was hindered by a gale of wind from entering it there was obviously no other course to be pursued than that announced in the answer given by general beauregard it should not be forgotten that during the early occupation of fort sumter by a garrison the attitude of which was at least offensive no restriction had been put upon their privilege of * in charleston fresh provisions or any delicacies or comforts not directly tending to the supply of the means needful to hold the fort for an indefinite time here in the brief hour immediately before the outburst of the * storm although it can hardly be necessary for the reader who has carefully considered what has already been written we may pause for a moment to contemplate the attitude of the parties to the contest and the grounds on which they respectively stand i do not now refer to the original causes of * the comparative claims of * and union or to the question of the right or the wrong of * to the * and immediate causes of conflict the fact that south carolina was a * her relations may have been to the other * not and can not be denied it is equally undeniable that the ground on which fort sumter was built was ceded by south carolina to the united states in trust for the defense of her own soil and her own chief harbor this has been shown by ample evidence to have been the principle governing all * by the states of sites for military purposes but it applies with special force to the case of charleston the streams flowing into that harbor from source to mouth lie entirely within the limits of the state of south carolina no other state or combination of states could have any distinct interest or concern in the maintenance of a fortress at that point unless as a means of aggression against south carolina herself the practical view of the case was correctly stated by mr douglas when he said i take it for granted that whoever permanently holds charleston and south carolina is entitled to the possession of fort sumter whoever permanently holds pensacola and florida is entitled to the possession of fort pickens whoever holds the states in whose limits those forts are placed is entitled to the forts themselves unless there is something peculiar in the location of some particular fort that makes it important for us to hold it for the general defense of the whole country its commerce and interests instead of being useful only for the defense of a particular city or locality no such necessity could be alleged with regard to fort sumter the claim to hold it as public property of the united states was utterly untenable and * apart from a claim of coercive control over the state if south carolina was a mere province in a state of open rebellion the government of the united states had a right to retain its hold of any fortified place within her limits which happened to be in its possession and it would have had an equal right to acquire possession of any other it would have had the same right to send an army to columbia to * down the walls of the state capitol the subject may at once be stripped of the * which would make a distinction between the two cases the one was as really an act of war as the other would have been the right or the wrong of either depended entirely upon the question of the rightful power of the federal government to coerce a state into * power which as we have seen was unanimously rejected in the formation of the federal constitution and which was still * by many perhaps by a majority even of those who denied the right of a state to secede if there existed any hope or desire for a peaceful settlement of the questions at issue between the states either party had a right to demand that pending such settlement there should be no hostile grasp upon its throat this grip had been held on the throat of south carolina for almost four months from the period of her secession and no forcible resistance to it had yet been made remonstrances and patient persistent and reiterated attempts at negotiation for its removal had been made with two successive * of the government of the united * first by the state of south carolina and by the government of the confederate states after its formation these efforts had been met not by an open avowal of coercive purposes but by * * and perfidy the agreement of one administration to maintain the status quo at the time when the question arose was violated in december by the removal of the garrison from its original position to the occupancy of a stronger another attempt was made to violate it in january by the introduction of troops concealed below the deck of the steamer star of the west but this was thwarted by the vigilance of the state service the protracted course of * and * practiced by mr lincolns administration in the months of march and april has been fully exhibited it was evident that no confidence whatever could be reposed in any pledge or promise of the federal government as then administered yet notwithstanding all this no resistance other than that of pacific protest and appeals for an equitable settlement was made until after the avowal of a purpose of coercion and when it was known that a hostile fleet was on the way to support and enforce it at the very moment when the confederate commander gave the final notice to major anderson of his purpose to open fire upon the fort that fleet was lying off the mouth of the harbor and hindered from entering only by a gale of wind the forbearance of the confederate government under the circumstances is perhaps * in history it was carried to the extreme verge short of a disregard of the safety of the people who had intrusted to that government the duty of their defense against their enemies the attempt to represent us as the * in the conflict which ensued is as unfounded as the complaint made by the wolf against the lamb in the familiar fable he who makes the assault is not necessarily he that strikes the first blow or fires the first gun to have awaited further strengthening of their position by land and naval forces with hostile purpose now declared for the sake of having them fire the first gun would have been as unwise as it would be to hesitate to strike down the arm of the assailant who levels a deadly weapon at ones breast until he has actually fired the * * of * about firing on the flag might serve to rouse the passions of * mobs in times of general excitement but will be impotent in impartial history to relieve the federal government from the responsibility of the assault made by sending a hostile fleet against the harbor of charleston to coperate with the menacing garrison of fort sumter after the assault was made by the hostile descent of the fleet the reduction of fort sumter was a measure of defense rendered absolutely and immediately necessary such clearly was the idea of the commander of the * when he declined as captain fox informs us without orders from a superior to make any effort to enter the harbor there to inaugurate civil war the straightforward simplicity of the sailor had not been perverted by the shams of political * even mr horace greeley with all his extreme partisan feeling is obliged to admit that whether the bombardment and reduction of fort sumter shall or shall not be justified by posterity it is clear that the confederacy had no alternative but its own dissolution according to the notice given by general beauregard fire was opened upon fort sumter from the various batteries which had been erected around the harbor at halfpast four oclock on the morning of friday the 12th of april 1861 the fort soon responded it is not the purpose of this work to give minute details of the military operation as the events of the bombardment have been often related and are generally well known with no material discrepancy in matters of fact among the statements of the various participants it is enough therefore to add that the bombardment continued for about thirtythree or thirtyfour hours the fort was eventually set on fire by shells after having been partly destroyed by shot and major anderson after a resolute defense finally surrendered on the #* same terms being accorded to him which had been offered two days before it is a remarkable * without precedent in the annals of * notwithstanding the extent and magnitude of the engagement the number and caliber of the guns and the amount of damage done to inanimate material on both sides especially to fort sumter nobody was injured on either side by the bombardment the only casualty attendant upon the affair was the death of one man and the wounding of several others by the explosion of a gun in the firing of a salute to their flag by the garrison on * the fort the day after the surrender a striking incident marked the close of the bombardment * louis t wigfall of * man as generous as he was recklessly * he saw the fort on fire supposing the garrison to be hopelessly struggling for the honor of its flag voluntarily and without authority went under fire in an open boat to the fort and climbing through one of its embrasures asked for major anderson and insisted that he should surrender a fort which it was palpably impossible that he could hold major anderson agreed to surrender on the same terms and conditions that had been offered him before his works were battered in breach and the agreement between them to that effect was promptly ratified by the confederate commander thus * was inaugurated the surrender and evacuation of the fort the president of the united states in his message of july 4 1861 to the federal congress convened in extra session said mr lincoln well knew that if the brave men of the garrison were hungry they had only him and his trusted advisers to thank for it they had been kept for months in a place where they ought not to have been contrary to the judgment of the generalinchief of his army contrary to the counsels of the wisest statesmen in his confidence and the protests of the commander of the garrison a word from him would have relieved them at any moment in the manner most acceptable to them and most * of peaceful results but suppose the confederate authorities had been disposed to yield and to consent to the introduction of supplies for the maintenance of the garrison what assurance would they have had that nothing further would be attempted what reliance could be placed in any assurances of the government of the united states after the experience of the attempted ruse of the star of the west and the * practiced upon the confederate commissioners in washington he says we were expressly notified that nothing more would on that occasion be * words in italics themselves constituting a very significant though unobtrusive and * limitation but we had been just as expressly notified long before that the garrison would be withdrawn it would be as easy to violate the one pledge as it had been to break the other moreover the socalled notification was a mere memorandum without date signature or * of any kind sent to governor pickens not by an accredited agent but by a subordinate * of the state department like the oral and written pledges of mr seward given through judge campbell it seemed to be carefully and purposely divested of every attribute that could make it binding and valid in case its authors should see fit to repudiate it it was as empty and worthless as the complaint against the confederate government based upon it is * the congress initiated by virginia for the laudable purpose of endeavoring by constitutional means to adjust all the issues which threatened the peace of the country failed to achieve anything that would cause or justify a * by the seceded states of their action to reclaim the grants they had made to the general government and to maintain for themselves a separate and independent existence the commissioners sent by the confederate government after having been shamefully deceived as has been heretofore fully set forth left the united states capital to report the result of their mission to the confederate government the notice received that an armed expedition had sailed for operations against the state of south carolina in the harbor of charleston induced the confederate government to meet as best it might this assault in the discharge of its obligation to defend each state of the confederacy to this end the bombardment of the formidable work fort sumter was commenced in anticipation of the renforcement which was then moving to unite with its garrison for hostilities against south carolina the bloodless bombardment and surrender of fort sumter occurred on april 13 1861 the garrison was generously permitted to retire with the honors of war the evacuation of that fort commanding the entrance to the harbor of charleston which if in hostile hands was destructive of its commerce had been claimed as the right of south carolina the voluntary withdrawal of the garrison by the united states government had been considered and those best qualified to judge believed it had been promised yet when instead of the fulfillment of just expectations instead of the withdrawal of the garrison a hostile expedition was organized and sent forward the urgency of the case required its reduction before it should be renforced had there been delay the more serious conflict between larger forces land and naval would scarcely have been bloodless as the bombardment fortunately was the event however was seized upon to inflame the mind of the northern people and the disguise which had been worn in the communications with the confederate commissioners was now thrown off and it was cunningly attempted to show that the south which had been pleading for peace and still stood on the defensive had by this bombardment inaugurated a war against the united states but it should be stated that the threats implied in the declarations that the union could not exist part slave and part free and that the union should be preserved and the denial of the right of a state peaceably to withdraw were virtually a declaration of war and the sending of an army and navy to attack was the result to have been anticipated as the consequence of such declaration of war on the 15th day of the same month president lincoln introducing his farce of combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings called forth the military of the several states to the number of seventyfive thousand and commanded the persons composing the combinations to disperse etc it can but surprise any one in the least degree * with the history of the union to find states referred to as persons composing combinations and that the sovereign creators of the federal government the states of the union should be commanded by their agent to disperse the levy of so large an army could only mean war but the power to declare war did not reside in the * was delegated to the congress only if however it had been a riotous combination or an insurrection it must have been according to the constitution against the state and the power of the president to call forth the militia to suppress it was dependent upon an application from the state for that purpose it could not precede such application and still less could it be rightfully exercised against the will of a state the authorities on this subject have been heretofore cited and need not be referred to again suffice it to say that by section 4 article * of the constitution the united states are bound to protect each state against invasion and against domestic violence whenever application shall have been made by the legislature or by the executive when the legislature can not be convened and that to fail to give protection against any invasion whatsoever would be a * of duty to add that there could be no justification for the invasion of a state by an army of the united states is but to repeat what has been said on the absence of any authority in the general government to coerce a state in any possible view of the case therefore the conclusion must be that the calling on some of the states for seventyfive thousand militia to invade other states which were asserted to be still in the union was a palpable violation of the constitution and the usurpation of undelegated power or in other words of power reserved to the states or to the people it might therefore have been anticipated that * of whose sons wrote the declaration of independence another of whose sons led the armies of the united states in the revolution which achieved their independence and another of whose sons mainly contributed to the adoption of the constitution of the * not have been slow in the face of such events to reclaim the grants she had made to the general government and to withdraw from the union to the establishment of which she had so largely contributed two days had elapsed between the surrender of fort sumter and the proclamation of president lincoln calling for seventyfive thousand militia as before stated two other days elapsed and virginia passed her ordinance of secession and two days thereafter the citizens of baltimore resisted the passage of troops through that city on their way to make war upon the southern states thus rapidly did the current of events bear us onward from peace to the desolating war which was soon to ensue the manly effort of the unorganized unarmed citizens of baltimore to resist the progress of armies for the invasion of her southern sisters was worthy of the fair fame of maryland becoming the descendants of the men who so gallantly fought for the freedom independence and sovereignty of the states the bold stand then and thereafter taken extorted a promise from the executive authorities that no more troops should be sent through the city of baltimore which promise however was only observed until by * power had been gained to disregard it virginia as has been heretofore stated passed her ordinance of secession on the 17th of april it was however subject to ratification by the people at an election to be held on the fourth thursday of may she was in the mean time like her southern sisters the object of northern hostilities and having a common cause with them properly anticipated the election of may by forming an alliance with the confederate states which was ratified by the convention on the 25th of april the convention for that alliance set forth that virginia looking to a speedy union with the confederate states and for the purpose of meeting pressing exigencies agreed that the whole military force and military operations offensive and defensive of said commonwealth in the impending conflict with the united states shall be under the chief control and direction of the president of the said confederate states the whole was made subject to the approval and ratification of the proper authorities of both governments respectively to those who criticise south carolina as having acted * in withdrawing from the union it may be answered that intervening occurrences show that her delay could not have changed the result and further that her prompt action had enabled her better to prepare for the contingency which it was found impossible to avert thus she was prepared in the first necessities of virginia to send to her troops organized and equipped before the convention for coperation with the confederate states had been adopted by virginia that knightly soldier general bonham of south carolina went with his brigade to richmond and throughout the southern states there was a prevailing desire to rush to virginia where it was foreseen that the first great battles of the war were to be fought so that as early as the 22d of april i telegraphed to governor letcher that in addition to the forces heretofore ordered requisitions had been made for thirteen regiments eight to rendezvous at lynchburg four at richmond and one at harpers ferry referring to an application that had been made to him from baltimore i wrote sustain baltimore if practicable we will renforce you the universal feeling was that of a common cause and common destiny there was no selfish desire to linger around home no narrow purpose to separate local interests from the common welfare the object was to sustain a * broad principle of constitutional liberty the right of selfgovernment the early demonstrations of the enemy showed that virginia was liable to invasion from the north from the east and from the west though the larger preparation indicated that the most serious danger to be apprehended was from the line of the potomac the first conflicts occurred in the east the narrow peninsula between the james and york rivers had topographical features well adapted to defense it was held by general john b magruder who skillfully improved its natural strength by artificial means and there on the ground memorable as the field of the last battle of the revolution in which general washington compelled lord cornwallis to surrender magruder with a small force held for a long time the superior forces of the enemy in check the question of supplying arms and munitions of war was the first considered because it was the want for which it was the most difficult to provide of men willing to engage in the defense of their country there were many more than we could arm though the prevailing sentiment of the southern people was a cordial attachment to the union as it was formed by their fathers their love was for the spirit of the compact for the liberties it was designed to secure for the selfgovernment and state sovereignty which had been won by separation from the mothercountry and transmitted to them by their revolutionary * as a legacy for their posterity for ever the number of those who desired to dissolve the union even though the constitution should be faithfully * who in the language of the day were called secessionists per * so small as not to be felt in any popular decision but the number of those who held that the states had surrendered their sovereignty and had no right to secede from the union was so * small if indeed any such existed that i can not recall the fact of a single southern advocate of that opinion the assertion of the right is not to be confounded with a readiness to exercise it many who had no doubt as to the right looked upon its exercise with reluctance amounting to sorrow and claimed that it should be the last resort only to be adopted as the alternative to a surrender of the equality in the union of states free sovereign and independent of that class forming a large majority of the people of mississippi i may speak with the confidence of one who belonged to it thus after the legislature of mississippi had enacted a law for a convention which representing the sovereignty of the state should consider the propriety of passing an ordinance to reassume the grants made to the general government and withdraw from the union i as a united states senator of mississippi retained my position in the senate and sought by every practicable mode to obtain such measures as would allay the excitement and afford to the south such security as would prevent the final step the ordinance of secession from the union when the last hope of preserving the union of the constitution was extinguished and the ordinance of secession was enacted by the convention of mississippi which was the highest authority known under our form of government the question of the expediency of adopting that remedy was no longer open to inquiry by one who acknowledged his allegiance as due to the state of which he was a citizen to evade the responsibilities resulting from the decree of his sovereign the people would be craven to resist it would be treason the instincts and affections of the citizens of mississippi led them with great unanimity to the duty of maintaining and defending their state without pausing to ask what would be the consequences of refusing obedience to its mandate a like feeling pervaded all of the seceding states and it was not only for the military service but for every service which would strengthen and sustain the confederacy that an enthusiasm pervading all classes sexes and ages was manifested though our agricultural products had been mainly for export * that in the planting states the necessary foodsupplies were to a considerable extent imported from the west and it would require that the habits of the planters should be changed from the cultivation of staples for export to the production of supplies adequate for home consumption and the support of armies in the field yet even under the embarrassments of war this was expected and for a long time the result justified the expectation extraordinary as it must appear when viewed by comparison with other people who have been subjected to a like ordeal much of our success was due to the * institution of african servitude for it enabled the white men to go into the army and leave the cultivation of their fields and the care of their flocks as well as of their wives and children to those who in the language of the constitution were held to service or labor a passing remark may here be appropriate as to the answer thus afforded to the clamor about the horrors of slavery had these africans been a cruelly oppressed people restlessly struggling to be freed from their bonds would their masters have dared to leave them as was done and would they have remained as they did continuing their usual duties or could the proclamation of emancipation have been put on the plea of a military necessity if the fact had been that the negroes were forced to serve and desired only an opportunity to rise against their masters it will be remembered that when the proclamation was issued it was confessed by president lincoln to be a * beyond the limit within which it could be enforced by the federal troops to direct the production preservation collection and distribution of food for the army required a man of rare capacity and character at the head of the subsistence department it was our good fortune to have such an one in colonel l b northrop who was appointed commissarygeneral at the organization of the bureaus of the executive department of the confederate government he had been an officer of the united states army had served in various parts of the south had been for some time on duty in the commissariat and to the special and general knowledge thus acquired added strong practical sense and incorruptible integrity of him and the operations of the subsistence department i shall have more to say hereafter when treating of the bureaus of the confederacy assured of an army as large as the population of the confederate states could furnish and a sufficient supply of subsistence for such an army at least until the chances of war should interfere with production and transportation the immediate object of attention was the organization instruction and equipment of the army as heretofore stated there was a prevailing belief that there would be no war or if any that it would be of very short duration therefore the first bill which passed the provisional congress provided for receiving troops for short * my memory serves for sixty days the chairman of the committee on military affairs the heroic colonel bartow who sealed his devotion to the cause with his lifes blood on the field of manassas in deference to my earnest remonstrance against such a policy returned with the bill to the house the congress then consisted of but one house and procured a modification by which the term of service was extended to twelve months unless sooner discharged i had urged upon him in our conference the adoption of a much longer period but he assured me that one year was as much as the congress would agree to on this as on other occasions that congress showed a generous desire to yield their preconceived opinions to my objections as far as they consistently could and there being but one house it was easier to change the terms of a bill after conference with the executive than when under the permanent organization objections had to be formally communicated in a message to that branch of congress in which the bill originated and when the whole proceeding was of record this first act to provide for the public defense became a law on the 28th of february 1861 and its fifth section so clearly indicates the opinions and expectations prevailing when the confederation was formed that it is inserted here the supremacy of the states is the controlling idea the president was authorized to receive from the several states the arms and munitions which they might desire to transfer to the government of the confederate states and he was also authorized to receive the forces which the states might tender or any which should volunteer by the consent of their state for any time not less than twelve months unless sooner discharged and such forces were to be received with their officers by companies battalions or regiments and the president by and with the advice and consent of congress was to appoint such general officer or officers for said forces as might be necessary for the service it will be seen that the arms and munitions within the limits of the several states were regarded as entirely belonging to them that the forces which were to constitute the provisional army could only be drawn from the several states by their consent and that these were to be organized under state authority and to be received with their officers so appointed that the lowest organization was to be that of a company and the highest that of a regiment and that the appointment of general officers to command these forces was confided to the government of the confederate states should the assembling of large bodies of troops require organization above that of a regiment and it will also be observed that provision was made for the discharge of the forces so provided for before the term of service fixed by the law no one will fail to perceive how little was anticipated a war of the vast proportions and great duration which ensued and how tenaciously the sovereignty and selfgovernment of the states were adhered to at a later period march 16 1861 the congress adopted resolutions recommending to the respective states to * the forts arsenals * * and other public establishments within their respective limits to the confederate states etc the hope which was early entertained of a peaceful solution of the issues pending between the confederate states and the united states rapidly diminished so that we find on the 6th of march that the congress in its preamble to an act to provide for the public defense begins with the declaration that in order to provide speedily forces to repel invasion etc authorized the president to employ the militia and to ask for and accept the services of any number of volunteers not exceeding one hundred thousand and to organize companies into battalions battalions into regiments and regiments into brigades and divisions as in the first law the president was authorized to appoint the commanding officer of such brigades and divisions the commissions only to endure while the brigades were in service on the same day march 6 1861 was enacted the law for the establishment and organization of the army of the confederate states of america this being in * to the provisional army which was to be composed of troops tendered by the states as in the first act and volunteers received as in the second act to constitute a provisional army that the wish and policy of the government was peace is again manifested in this act which in providing for the military establishment of the confederacy fixed the number of enlisted men of all arms at nine thousand four hundred and twenty due care was taken to prevent the appointment of * or unworthy persons to be officers of the army and the right to promotion up to and including the grade of colonel was carefully guarded and beyond this the professional character of the army was recognized as follows appointments to the rank of brigadiergeneral after the army is organized shall be made by selection from the army there being no right of promotion above the grade of colonel in the army of the united states selection for appointment to the rank of general had no other restriction than the necessity for confirmation by the senate the provision just quoted imposed the further restriction of requiring the person nominated by selection to have previously been an officer of the army of the confederate states regarding the army of the united states as belonging neither to a section of the union nor to the general government but to the states conjointly while they remained united it follows as a * of the proposition that when disintegration occurred the undivided personnel composing the army would be left free to choose their future place of service therefore provision was made for securing to officers who should leave the army of the united states and join that of the confederate states the same relative rank in the latter which they held in the former the provisions * are in the view entertained that the army was of the states not of the government and was to secure to officers adhering to the confederate states the same relative rank which they had before those states had withdrawn from the union it was clearly the intent of the law to embrace in this provision only those officers who had resigned or who should resign from the united states army to enter the service of the confederacy or who in other words should thus be transferred from one service to the other it is also to be noted that in the eleventh section of the act to which this was * the right of promotion up to the grade of colonel in established regiments and corps was absolutely secured but that appointments to the higher grade should be by selection at first without restriction but after the army had been organized the selection was confined to the army thus recognizing the profession of arms and relieving officers from the hazard beyond the limit of their legal right to promotion of being superseded by civilians through favoritism or political influence how well the government of the confederacy observed both the letter and the spirit of the law will be seen by reference to its action in the matter of appointments it is a noteworthy fact that the three highest officers in rank and whose fame stands * either for efficiency or zeal were all so indifferent to any question of personal interest that they had received their appointment before they were aware it was to be conferred each brought from the army of the united states an enviable reputation such as would have secured to him had he chosen to remain in it after the war commenced any position his ambition could have coveted therefore against considerations of * and impelled by devotion to principle they severed the ties professional and personal which had bound them from their youth up to the time when the southern states asserting the consecrated truth that all governments rest on the consent of the governed decided to withdraw from the union they had voluntarily entered and the northern states resolved to coerce them to remain in it against their will these officers * samuel cooper a

favorably and intimately as adjutantgeneral of the united states army when i was secretary of war the value of his services in the organization of a new army was considered so great that i invited him to take the position of adjutantgeneral of the confederate army which he accepted without a question either as to relative rank or anything else the highest grade then authorized by law was that of brigadiergeneral and that commission was bestowed upon him when general albert sidney johnston reached richmond he called upon me and for several days at various intervals we conversed with the freedom and confidence belonging to the close friendship which had existed between us for many years consequent upon a remark made by me he asked to what duty i would assign him and when answered to serve in the west he expressed his pleasure at service in that section but inquired how he was to raise his command and for the first time learned that he had been nominated and confirmed as a general in the army of the confederacy the third general robert e lee had been commissioned by the state of virginia as majorgeneral and commander of her army when that army was transferred after the accession of virginia to the confederate states he was nominated to be brigadiergeneral in the confederate army but was left for obvious reasons in command of the forces in virginia after the seat of government was removed from montgomery to richmond the course of events on the southern atlantic coast induced me to direct general lee to repair thither before leaving he said that while he was serving in virginia he had never thought it needful to inquire about his rank but now when about to go into other states and to meet officers with whom he had not been previously connected he would like to be informed upon that point under recent laws authorizing appointments to higher grades than that of his first commission he had been appointed a full general but so wholly had his heart and his mind been consecrated to the public service that he had not remembered if he ever knew of his advancement in organizing the bureaus it was deemed advisable to select for the chief of each officers possessing special knowledge of the duties to be performed the best assurance of that * was believed to be service * rendered in the several departments of the united states army before resigning from it brevet lieutenantcolonel a c myers who had held many important trusts in the united states quartermasters department was appointed quartermastergeneral of the confederacy with the rank of colonel captain l b northrop a gallant officer of the united states dragoons and who by reason of a wound * him to perform regimental duty had been employed in the subsistence department was after resigning from the united states army appointed commissarygeneral of the confederate states army with the rank of colonel i have heretofore alluded to the difficult task thus imposed on him and the success with which he performed it and would be pleased here to enter into a fuller recital but have not the needful information in regard to his administration of that department surgeon l p moore an officer of recognized merit in the united states medical department from which he had resigned to join the confederacy was appointed the surgeongeneral of the confederate states army as in the case of other departments there was in this a want of the stores requisite as well for the field as the hospital to supply medicines which were declared by the enemy to be contraband of war our medical department had to seek in the forest for substitutes and to add surgical instruments and appliances to the small stock on hand as best they could it would be quite beyond my power to do justice to the skill and knowledge with which the medical corps performed their arduous task and regret that i have no report from the surgeongeneral moore which would enable me to do justice to the officers of his corps as well in regard to their humanity as to their professional skill in no branch of our service were our needs so great and our means to meet them * so small as in the matter of ordnance and ordnance stores the chief of ordnance general * had been an ordnance officer of the united states army and resigned to join the confederacy he has favored me with a * though comprehensive statement which has enabled me to write somewhat fully of that department but for the better understanding of its operations the reader is referred to the ordnance report elsewhere on the third day after my inauguration at montgomery an officer of extensive information and high capacity was sent to the north to make purchases of arms ammunition and machinery and soon afterward another officer was sent to europe to buy in the market as far as possible and furthermore to make contracts for arms and munitions to be manufactured captain afterward admiral semmes the officer who was sent to the north would have been quite successful but for the intervention of the civil authorities preventing the delivery of the various articles contracted for the officer who was sent to europe major * found few serviceable arms upon the market he however succeeded in making contracts for the manufacture of large quantities being in advance of the agents sent from the northern government for the same purpose for further and more detailed information reference is made to the monograph of the chief of ordnance my letter of instructions to captain semmes was as follows captain semmes had also been directed to seek for vessels which would serve for naval purposes and after his return reported that he could not find any vessels which in his judgment were or could be made available for our uses the southern officers of the navy who were in command of united states vessels abroad under an idea more creditable to their sentiment than to their knowledge of the nature of our constitutional union brought the vessels they commanded into the ports of the north and having delivered them to the authorities of the united states government generally tendered their * and repaired to the states from which they had been commissioned in the navy to serve where they held their allegiance to be due the theory that they owed allegiance to their respective states was founded on the fact that the federal government was of the states the sequence was that the navy belonged to the states not to their agent the federal government and when the states ceased to be united the naval vessels and * should have been divided among the owners while we honor the sentiment which caused them to surrender their * associations and the profession to which they were bred on which they relied for subsistence to go with nothing save their swords and faithful hearts to fight to bleed and to die if need be in defense of their homes and a righteous cause we can but remember how much was lost by their view of what their honor and duty demanded far however be it from their countrymen for that or any other consideration to wish that their fidelity to the dictates of a conscientious belief should have yielded to any temptation of interest the course they pursued shows how impossible it was that they should have done so for what did they not sacrifice to their sense of right we were doubly bereft by losing our share of the navy we had contributed to build and by having it all employed to assail us the application of the appropriations for the navy of the united states had been such that the construction of vessels had been at the north though much of the timber used and other material employed was transported from the south to northern * therefore we were without the * needful for the rapid supply of naval vessels while attempting whatever was practicable at home we sent a competent * officer of the navy to england to obtain there and elsewhere by purchase or by building vessels which could be transformed into ships of war these efforts and their results will be noticed more fully hereafter it may not be amiss to remark here that if the anticipations of our people were not realized it was not from any lack of the zeal and ability of the secretary of the navy mr mallory as was heretofore stated his fondness for and aptitude in * affairs had led him to know much of vessels their construction and management and as chairman of the committee on united states naval affairs he had superadded to this a very large acquaintance with officers of the united states navy which gave him the requisite information for the most useful employment of the instructed officers who joined our service at the north many had been deceived by the * of preparations at the south for the war of the sections and among ourselves were few who realized how totally deficient the southern states were in all which was necessary to the active operations of an army however gallant the men might be and however able were the generals who directed and led them from these causes operating * resulted undue caution at the north and overweening confidence at the south the habits of our people in hunting and protecting their stock in fields from the ravages of ferocious beasts caused them to be generally supplied with the arms used for such purposes the facility with which individuals traveled over the country led to very erroneous ideas as to the difficulties of * an army the small amount of ammunition required in time of peace gave no measure of the amount requisite for warlike operations and the products of a country which * supplied food for its inhabitants when peaceful pursuits were uninterrupted would serve but a short time to furnish the commissariat of a large army it was of course easy to foresee that if war was waged against the seceding states by all of those which remained in the union the large supply of provisions which had been annually sent from the northwest to the south could not under the altered circumstances be relied on that our people did not more immediately turn their attention to the production of foodsupplies may be attributed to the prevailing delusion that secession would not be followed by war to the able officer then at the head of the commissariat department colonel l b northrop much credit is due for his welldirected efforts to provide both for immediate and prospective wants it gives me the greater pleasure to say this because those less informed of all he did and skillfully tried to do have been profuse of criticism and sparing indeed of the meed justly his due adequate facilities for transportation might have relieved the local want of supplies especially in virginia where the largest bodies of troops were assembled but unfortunately the quartermasters department was scarcely less provided than that of the commissary not only were the railroads insufficient in number but they were poorly furnished with rolling stock and had been mainly dependent upon northern * and factories for their rails and equipment even the skilled operatives of the railroads were generally northern men and their desertion followed fast upon every disaster which attended the confederate arms in addition to other causes which have been mentioned the idea that cotton was king and would produce foreign intervention as well as a desire of the northern people for the return of peace and the restoration of trade exercised a potent influence in preventing our agriculturists from directing at an early period their capital and labor to the production of foodsupplies rather than that of our * for export as one after another the illusions vanished and the material necessities of a great war were recognized by our people never did patriotic devotion exhibit brighter examples of the sacrifice of * and the abandonment of fixed habits and opinions or more effective and untiring effort to meet the herculean task which was set before them being one of the few who regarded secession and war as inevitably connected my early attention was given to the organization of military forces and the * and preparation of the munitions of war if our people had not gone to war without counting the cost they were nevertheless involved in it without means of providing for its necessities it has been heretofore stated that we had no powdermills it would be needless to say that the newborn government had no depots of powder but it may be well to add that beyond the small supply required for sporting purposes our local traders had no stock on hand having no manufacturing industries which required saltpeter very little of that was * in our markets the same would have been the case in regard to sulphur but for the fact that it had been recently employed in the * of sugarcane * and thus a considerable amount of it was found in new orleans prompt measures were taken to secure a supply of sulphur and parties were employed to obtain saltpeter from the caves as well as from the earth of old * and cellars and artificial * were made to provide for prospective wants of soft wood for charcoal there was abundance and thus materials were procured for the manufacture of gunpowder to meet the demand which would arise when the limited quantity purchased by the confederate government at the north should be exhausted it was our good fortune to secure the services of an able and scientific soldier general g w rains who to a military education added experience in a large manufacturing establishment and to him was confided the construction of a powdermill and the manufacture of powder both for artillery and smallarms the appalling contemplation of the inauguration of a great war without powder or a navy to secure its importation from abroad was soon relieved by the extraordinary efforts of the ordnance department and the welldirected skill of general rains to whom it is but a just tribute to say that beginning without even instructed workmen he had before the close of the war made what in the opinion of competent judges has been pronounced to be the best powdermill in the world and in which powder of every variety of grain was manufactured of materials which had been purified from those qualities which cause its deterioration under long exposure to a moist atmosphere the avowed purpose and declared obligation of the federal government was to occupy and possess the property belonging to the united states yet one of the first acts was to set fire to the armory at harpers ferry virginia the only establishment of the kind in the southern states and the only southern * of the rifles which the general government had then on hand what conclusion is to be drawn from such action to avoid attributing a breach of solemn pledges it must be supposed that virginia was considered as out of the union and a public enemy in whose borders it was proper to destroy whatever might be useful to her of the common property of the states lately united as soon as the united states troops had evacuated the place the citizens and * went to work to save the armory as far as possible from destruction and to secure valuable material stored in it the master armorer armistead ball so bravely and skillfully directed these efforts that a large part of the machinery and materials was saved from the flames the * of the fire was a dangerous and difficult task and great credit is due to those who under the orders of master armorer ball attempted and achieved it when the fire was extinguished the work was continued and persevered in until all the valuable machinery and material had been collected boxed and shipped to richmond about the end of the summer of 1861 the machinery thus secured was divided between the arsenals at richmond virginia and fayetteville north carolina and when repaired and put in working condition supplied to some extent the want which existed in the south of means for the alteration and repair of old or injured arms and finally contributed to increase the very scanty supply of arms with which our country was furnished when the war began the practice of the federal government which had kept the construction and manufacture of the material of war at the north had consequently left the south without the requisite number of skilled workmen by whose labor machinery could at once be made fully effective if it were obtained indeed the want of such employees prevented the small amount of machinery on hand from being worked to its full capacity the gallant master armorer ball whose capacity zeal and fidelity deserve more than a passing notice was sent with that part of the machinery assigned to the fayetteville arsenal the toil the anxiety and responsibility of his perilous position at harpers ferry where he remained long after the protecting force of the confederate army retired had probably undermined a constitution so vigorous that in the face of a great exigency no labor seemed too great or too long for him to grapple with and endure so like a ship which after having weathered the storm goes down in the calm the master armorer soon after he took his quiet post at fayetteville was found dead in his bed the difficulties which on every side met the several departments of the executive branch of the government one must suppose were but little appreciated by many whose opportunities for exact observation were the best as one often meets with * expressions as to modes of * readily what prompt patient zealous effort proved to be insurmountable in the progress of this work it is hoped will be presented not only the magnitude of the obstacles but the spirit and capacity with which they were encountered by the unseen and much * labors of the officers of the several departments on whom devolved provision for the civil service as well as for the armies in the field already has the report of general st john commissarygeneral of subsistence of the operations of that department just before the close of the war exposed the hollowness of many sensational pictures intended to fix gross neglect or utter * on the executive the * and expected * of other chiefs of bureaus will silence like criticisms on each so far as they are made by those who are not * blind or maliciously intent on the circulation of falsehood if any further evidence had been required to show that it was the determination of the northern people not only to make no concessions to the grievances of the southern states but to increase them to the last extremity it was furnished by the proclamation of president lincoln issued on april 15 1861 this proclamation which has already been mentioned requires a further examination as it was the official declaration on the part of the government of the united states of the war which ensued in it the president called for seventyfive thousand men to suppress combinations opposed to the laws and obstructing their execution in seven sovereign states which had retired from the union seventyfive thousand men organized and equipped are a powerful army and when raised to operate against these states nothing else than war could be intended the words in which he summoned this force were these whereas the laws of the united states have been for some time past and now are opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in the states of south carolina georgia alabama florida mississippi louisiana and texas by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals by law now therefore i abraham lincoln by virtue of the power in me vested by the constitution and laws etc the power granted in the constitution is thus expressed the congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union suppress insurrections and repel invasions it was to the congress not the executive to whom the power was delegated and thus early was commenced a long series of usurpations of powers inconsistent with the purposes for which the union was formed and destructive of the fraternity it was designed to perpetuate on november 6 1860 the legislature of south carolina assembled and gave the vote of the state for electors of a president of the united states on the next day an act was passed calling a state convention to assemble on december 17th to determine the question of the withdrawal of the state from the united states candidates for membership were immediately nominated all were in favor of secession the convention assembled on december 17th and on the 20th passed an ordinance to dissolve the union between the state of south carolina and other states united with her under the compact entitled the constitution of the united states of america the ordinance began with these words we the people of the state of south carolina in convention assembled do declare and ordain etc the state authorities immediately conformed to this action of the convention and the laws and authority of the united states ceased to be obeyed within the limits of the state about four months afterward when the state in union with others which had joined her had possessed herself of the forts within her limits which the united states government had refused to evacuate president lincoln issued the abovementioned proclamation the state of south carolina is designated in the proclamation as a combination too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals by law this designation does not recognize the state or manifest any consciousness of its existence whereas south carolina was one of the colonies that had declared her independence and after a long and bloody war she had been recognized as a sovereign state by great britain the only power to which she had ever owed allegiance the fact that she had been one of the colonies in the original congress had been a member of the confederation and subsequently of the union strengthens but surely can not impair her claim to be a state though president lincoln designated her as a combination it did not make her a combination though he refused to recognize her as a state it did not make her any less a state by assertion he attempted to annihilate seven states and the war which followed was to enforce the revolutionary edict and to establish the supremacy of the general government on the ruins of the * independence of the states by * the state as a combination and considering that under such a name it might be in a condition of insurrection he assumed to have authority to raise a great military force and attack the state yet even if the fact had been as assumed if an insurrection had existed the president could not lawfully have derived the power he exercised from such condition of affairs the provision of the constitution is as follows the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature can not be convened against domestic violence so the guarantee availed not at all to justify the act which it was presented to * fact being that a state and not an unlawful combination as asserted was the object of assault and the case one of making war for a state or union of states to attack with military force another state is to make war by the constitution the power to make war is given solely to congress congress shall have power to declare war says the constitution and again to raise and support armies thus under a perverted use of language the executive at washington did that which he undeniably had no power to do under a faithful observance of the constitution to justify himself to congress and the people or rather before the face of mankind for this * of the constitution of his country president lincoln in his message to congress of july 4 1861 resorted to the * of saying it meaning the proceedings of the confederate states presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or * government of the people by the same * or can not maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes the answer to this question is very plain in the nature of things no union can be formed except by separate independent and distinct parties any other combination is not a union and upon the destruction of any of these elements in the parties the union * * ceases if the government is the result of a union of states then these states must be separate sovereign and distinct to be able to form a union which is entirely an act of their own * such a government as ours had no power to maintain its existence any longer than the contracting parties pleased to * because it was founded on the great principle of voluntary federation and organized to establish justice and insure domestic tranquillity any departure from this principle by the general government not only * and * its nature but furnishes a just cause to the injured state to withdraw from the union a new union might subsequently be formed but the original one could never by coercion be restored any effort on the part of the others to force the seceding state to consent to come back is an attempt at subjugation it is a wrong which no lapse of time or combination of circumstances can ever make right a forced union is a political absurdity no less absurd is president lincolns effort to * the sovereignty of the people from that of the state as if there could be a state without a people or a sovereign people without a state but the question which mr lincoln presents to the whole family of man deserves a further notice the answer which he seems to infer would be given by the whole family of man is that such a government as he * can maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes and therefore he concluded that he was right in the judgment of the whole family of man in commencing hostilities against us he says so viewing the issue no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government that is the power to make war against foreign nations for the government has no other war power planting himself on this position he commenced the devastation and bloodshed which followed to effect our subjugation nothing could be more erroneous than such views the supposed case which he presents is entirely unlike the real case the government of the united states is like no other government it is neither a constitutional republic or democracy nor has it ever been thus called neither is it a government of the people by the same people but it is known and designated as the government of the united states it is an * among governments its authority consists solely of certain powers delegated to it as a common agent by an association of sovereign and independent states these powers are to be exercised only for certain specified objects and the purposes declared in the beginning of the deed or instrument of delegation were to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity the beginning and the end of all the powers of the government of the united states are to be found in that instrument of delegation all its powers are there expressed defined and limited it was only to that instrument mr lincoln as president should have gone to learn his duties that was the chart which he had just solemnly pledged himself to the country faithfully to follow he soon * widely from itand fatally erroneous was his course the administration of the affairs of a great people at a most perilous period is decided by the answer which it is assumed the whole family of man would give to a supposed condition of human affairs which did not exist and which could not exist this is the ground upon which the rectitude of his cause was placed he says no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation here he says no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government for what purpose must he call out this war power he answers by saying and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation but this which he asserts is not a fact there was no force employed for its destruction let the reader turn to the record of the facts in part iii of this work and peruse the fruitless efforts for peace which were made by us and which mr lincoln did not deign to notice the assertion is not only * in stating that force was employed by us but also in declaring that it was for the destruction of the government of the united states on the contrary we wished to leave it alone our separation did not involve its destruction to such fiction was mr lincoln compelled to resort to give even apparent justice to his cause he now goes to the constitution for the exercise of his war power and here we have another fiction on april 19th four days later president lincoln issued another proclamation announcing a blockade of the ports of seven confederated states which was afterward extended to north carolina and virginia it further declared that all persons who should under their authority molest any vessel of the united states or the persons or cargo on board should be treated as pirates in their efforts to subjugate us the destruction of our commerce was regarded by the authorities at washington as a most efficient measure it was early seen that although acts of congress established ports of entry where commerce existed they might be repealed and the ports nominally closed or declared to be closed yet such a declaration would be of no avail unless sustained by a naval force as these ports were located in territory not subject to the united states an act was subsequently passed authorizing the president of the united states in his discretion to close our ports but it was never executed the scheme of blockade was resorted to and a falsehood was asserted on which to base it mr seward writes to mr dallas you will say to lord john russell that by our own laws and the laws of nature and the laws of nations this government has a clear right to suppress insurrection an exclusion of commerce from national ports which have been seized by * in the equitable form of blockade is a proper means to that end this is the same doctrine of combinations * by the authorities at washington to serve as the basis of a bloody revolution under the laws of nations separate governments when at war blockade each others ports this is decided to be justifiable but the government of the united states could not consent to justify its blockade of our ports on this ground as it would be an admission that the confederate states were a separate and distinct sovereignty and that the war was prosecuted only for subjugation it therefore assumed that the withdrawal of the southern states from the union was an insurrection was it an insurrection when certain sovereign and independent states form a union with limited powers for some general purposes and any one or more of them in the progress of time suffer unjust and oppressive grievances for which there is no redress but in a withdrawal from the association is such withdrawal an insurrection if so then of what advantage is a compact of union to states within the union are * and grievances and the attempt to go out brings war and subjugation the ambitious and aggressive states obtain possession of the central authority which having grown strong in the lapse of time asserts its entire sovereignty over the states whichever of them denies it and seeks to retire is declared to be guilty of insurrection its citizens are stigmatized as rebels as if they had revolted against a master and a war of subjugation is begun if this action is once tolerated where will it end where is the value of constitutional liberty what strength is there in bills of * limitations of power what new hope for mankind is to be found in written constitutions what remedy which did not exist under kings or emperors if the doctrines thus announced by the government of the united states are conceded then look through either end of the political telescope and one sees only an empire and the once famous declaration of independence trodden in the dust as a glittering * and the compact of union denounced as a flaunting lie those who submit to such consequences without resistance are not worthy of the liberties and the rights to which they were born and deserve to be made slaves such must be the verdict of mankind men do not fight to make a fraternal union neither do nations these military preparations of the government of the united states signified nothing less than the subjugation of the southern states so that by one * blow the north might grasp for ever that supremacy it had so long coveted to be prepared for selfdefense i called congress together at montgomery on april 29th and in the message of that date thus spoke of the proclamation of the president of the united states apparently contradictory as are the terms of this singular document one point is unmistakably evident the president of the united states calls for an army of seventyfive thousand men whose first service is to be the capture of our forts it is a plain declaration of war which i am not at liberty to disregard because of my knowledge that under the constitution of the united states the president is * a power granted exclusively to congress i then proceeded to say that i did not feel at liberty to disregard the fact that many of the states seemed quite content to submit to the exercise of the powers assumed by the president of the united states and were actively engaged in levying troops for the purpose indicated in the proclamation meantime being deprived of the aid of congress i had been under the necessity of confining my action to a call on the states for volunteers for the common defense in accordance with authority previously conferred on me i stated that there were then in the field at charleston pensacola forts morgan jackson st philip and pulaski nineteen thousand men and sixteen thousand more were on their way to virginia that it was proposed to organize and hold in readiness for instant action in view of the existing exigencies of the country an army of one hundred thousand men and that if a further force should be needed congress would be appealed to for authority to call it into the field finally that the intent of the president of the united states already developed to invade our soil capture our forts blockade our ports and wage war against us rendered it necessary to raise means to a much larger amount than had been done to defray the expenses of maintaining independence and repelling invasion a brief summary of the internal affairs of the government followed and notwithstanding frequent declarations of the peaceful intentions of the withdrawing states had been made in the most solemn manner it was deemed not to be out of place to repeat them once more and therefore the message closed with these words we protest solemnly in the face of mankind that we desire peace at any sacrifice save that of honor in independence we seek no conquest no aggrandizement no concession of any kind from the states with which we have lately been confederated all we ask is to be let * those who never held power over us shall not now attempt our subjugation by arms this we will we must resist to the direst extremity the moment that this pretension is abandoned the sword will drop from our grasp and we shall be ready to enter into treaties of amity and commerce that can not but be mutually beneficial so long as this pretension is maintained with a firm reliance on that divine power which covers with its protection the just cause we must continue to struggle for our inherent right to freedom independence and selfgovernment at this session congress passed acts authorizing the president to use the whole land and naval force to meet the necessities of the war thus commenced to issue to private armed vessels letters of marque in addition to the volunteer force authorized to be raised to accept the services of volunteers to serve during the war to receive into the service various companies of the different arms to make a loan of fifty millions of dollars in bonds and notes and to hold an election for officers of the permanent government under the new constitution an act was also passed to provide revenue from imports another relative to prisoners of war and such others as were necessary to complete the internal organization of the government and establish the administration of public affairs in every portion of the country there was exhibited the most patriotic devotion to the common cause transportation companies freely tendered the use of their lines for troops and supplies requisitions for troops were met with such alacrity that the number offering their services in every instance greatly exceeded the demand and the ability to arm them men of the highest official and social position served as volunteers in the ranks the gravity of age and the zeal of youth rivaled each other in the desire to be foremost in the public defense the appearance of the proclamation of the president of the united states calling out seventyfive thousand men was followed by the immediate withdrawal of the states of virginia north carolina tennessee and arkansas and their union with the confederate states the former state thus placed on the frontier and exposed to invasion began to prepare for a resolute defense volunteers were ordered to be enrolled and held in readiness in every part of the state colonel robert e lee having resigned his commission in the united states cavalry was on april 22d nominated and confirmed by the state convention of virginia as commanderinchief of the military and naval forces of the commonwealth already the northern officer in charge had evacuated harpers ferry after having attempted to destroy the public buildings there his report says i gave the order to apply the torch in three minutes or less both of the arsenal buildings containing nearly fifteen thousand stand of arms together with the carpenters shop which was at the upper end of a long and connected series of workshops of the armory proper were in a blaze there is every reason for believing the destruction was complete mr simon cameron the secretary of war on april 22d replied to this report in these words i am directed by the president of the united states to communicate to you and through you to the officers and men under your command at harpers ferry armory the approbation of the government of your and their judicious conduct there and to tender you and them the thanks of the government for the same at the same time the * at norfolk was abandoned after an attempt to destroy it about midnight of april 20th a fire was started in the yard which continued to increase and before daylight the work of destruction extended to two immense * one of which contained the entire frame of a * ship and to the long ranges of stores and offices on each side of the entrance the great ship pennsylvania was burned and the * merrimac and columbus and the delaware * plymouth and * were sunk a vast amount of machinery valuable engines smallarms and * was broken up and rendered entirely useless the value of the property destroyed was estimated at several millions of dollars this property thus destroyed had been accumulated and constructed with laborious care and skillful ingenuity during a course of years to fulfill one of the objects of the constitution which was expressed in these words to provide for the common defense see preamble of the constitution it had belonged to all the states in common and to each one equally with the others if the confederate states were still members of the union as the president of the united states asserted where can he find a justification of these acts in explanation of his policy to the commissioners sent to him by the virginia state convention he said referring to his inaugural address as i then and therein said i now repeat the power confided in me will be used to hold occupy and possess property and places belonging to the government yet he tendered the thanks of the government to those who applied the torch to destroy this property belonging as he regarded it to the government how unreasonable how blind with rage must have been that administration of affairs which so quickly brought the government to the necessity of destroying its own means of defense in order as it publicly declared to maintain its life it would seem as if the passions that rule the savage had taken possession of the authorities at the united states capital in the * of vast structures the wanton destruction of public property and still more in the issue of * de cachet by the secretary of state who boasted of the power of his little bell over the personal liberties of the citizen the people saw or might have seen the rapid strides toward despotism made under the mask of preserving the union yet these and similar measures were tolerated because the sectional hate dominated in the northern states over the higher motives of constitutional and moral obligation the border state of maryland was the outpost of the south on the frontier first to be approached by northern invasion the first demonstration against state sovereignty was to be made there and in her fate were the other slaveholding states of the border to have warning of what they were to expect she had chosen to be for the time at least neutral in the impending war and had denied to the united states troops the right of way across her domain in their march to invade the southern states the governor hicks avowed a desire not only that the state should avoid war but that she should be a means for * those more disposed to engage in combat judge handy a distinguished citizen of mississippi who was born in maryland had in december 1860 been sent as a commissioner from the state of his adoption to that of his birth and presented his views and the object of his mission to governor hicks who in his response december 19 1860 declared his purpose to act in full concert with the other border states adding i do not doubt the people of maryland are ready to go with the people of those states for weal or woe subsequently in answer to appeals for and against a proclamation assembling the legislature in order to have a call for a state convention governor hicks issued an address in which arguing that there was no necessity to define the position of maryland he wrote if the action of the legislature would be simply to declare that maryland was with the south in sympathy and feeling that she demands from the north the repeal of offensive unconstitutional statutes and appeals to it for new guarantees that she will wait a reasonable time for the north to * her * to do justice to her southern brethren and if her appeals are vain will make common cause with her sister border states in resistance to tyranny if need be it would only be saying what the whole country well knows etc on the 18th of april 1861 governor hicks issued a proclamation invoking them to preserve the peace and said i assure the people that no troops will be sent from maryland unless it may be for the defense of the national capital on the same day mayor brown of the city of baltimore issued a proclamation in which referring to that of the governor above cited he said i can not withhold my expression of satisfaction at his resolution that no troops shall be sent from maryland to the soil of any other state it will be remembered that the capital was on a site which originally belonged to maryland and was ceded by her for a special use so that troops to defend the capital might be considered as not having been sent out of maryland it will be remembered that these proclamations were three days after the requisition made by the secretary of war on the states which had not seceded for their quota of troops to serve in the war about to be inaugurated against the south and that rumors existed at the time in baltimore that troops from the northeast were about to be sent through that city toward the south on the next day viz the 19th of april 1861 a body of troops arrived at the railroad depot the citizens assembled in large numbers and though without arms disputed the passage through the city they attacked the troops with the loose stones found in the street which was undergoing repair and with such determination and violence that some of the soldiers were wounded and they fired upon the multitude killing a few and wounding many the police of baltimore were very active in their efforts to prevent conflict and preserve the peace they rescued the baggage and munitions of the troops which had been seized by the multitude and the rear portion of the troops was by direction of governor hicks sent back to the borders of the state the troops who had got through the city took the railroad at the southern depot and passed on the militia of the city was called out and by evening quiet was restored during the night on a report that more northern troops were approaching the city by the railroads the bridges nearest to the city were destroyed as it was understood by orders from the authorities of baltimore on the 20th of april president lincoln wrote in reply to governor hicks and mayor brown saying for the future troops must be brought here but i make no point of bringing them through baltimore on the next day the 21st mayor brown and other influential citizens by request of the president visited him the interview took place in presence of the cabinet and general scott and was reported to the public by the mayor after his return to baltimore from that report i make the following extracts referring to the president the mayor uses the following language the legislature of the state of maryland appointed commissioners to the confederate government to suggest to it the cessation of impending hostilities until the meeting of congress at washington in july commissioners with like instructions were also sent to washington in my reply to the commissioners dated 25th of may 1861 i referred to the uniform expression of desire for peace on the part of the confederate government and added on the 5th of may the * house at the junction of the washington and baltimore and ohio railroads was occupied by united states troops under general butler and on the 13th of the same month he moved a portion of the troops to baltimore and took position on federal * was consummated the military occupation of baltimore on the next day renforcements were received and on the same day the commanding general issued a proclamation to the citizens in which he announced to them his purpose and authority to * between citizens those who agreed with him being denominated well disposed and the others described with many offensive epithets the initiatory step of the policy subsequently developed was found in one sentence therefore all manufacturers of arms and munitions of war are hereby requested to report to me forthwith so that the * of their occupations may be known and understood and all * of their doings avoided there soon followed a demand for the surrender of the arms stored by the city authorities in a warehouse the police refused to surrender them without the orders of the police commissioners the police commissioners upon representation that the demand of general butler was by order of the president decided to surrender the arms under protest and they were accordingly removed to fort mchenry baltimore was now disarmed the army of the united states had control of the city there was no longer necessity to regard the remonstrance of baltimore against sending troops through the city and that more convenient route was henceforth to be employed george p kane marshal of the police of baltimore who had rendered most efficient service for the preservation of peace as well in the city of baltimore as at locust point where troops were * to be dispatched to washington was arrested at home by a military force and sent to fort mchenry and a provostmarshal was appointed by general banks who had succeeded to the command the excuse given for the arrest of marshal kane was that he was believed to be cognizant of combinations of men waiting for an opportunity to unite with those in rebellion against the united states government whether the suspicion were well or ill founded it constituted a poor excuse for depriving a citizen of his liberty without legal warrant and without proof but this was only the beginning of unbridled despotism and a reign of terror the mayor and police commissioners charles howard william h * and john w davis held a meeting and after preparing a protest against the suspension of their functions in the appointment of a * resolved that while they would do nothing to obstruct the execution of such measures as majorgeneral banks may deem proper to take on his own responsibility for the preservation of the peace of the city and of public order they can not consistently with their views of official duty and of the obligations of their oaths of office recognize the right of any of the officers and men of the police force as such to receive orders or directions from any other authority than from this board and that in the opinion of the board the forcible suspension of their functions * at the same time the active operations of the police law the provostmarshal with the plenary powers conferred upon him commenced a system of search and seizure in private houses of arms and munitions of every description on the 1st of july general banks announced that in pursuance of orders issued from the headquarters at washington for the preservation of the public peace in this department i have arrested and do detain in custody of the united states the late members of the board of * charles howard william h * charles d * and john w davis if the object had been to preserve order by any proper and legitimate method the effective means would palpably have been to rely upon men whose influence was known to be great and whose integrity was certainly unquestionable the * of the commissioners i knew well he was of an old maryland family honored for their public services and himself adorned by every social virtue old * hospitable gentle loving he was beloved by the people among whom his long life had been passed could such a man be the just object of suspicion if when laws had been silenced suspicion could justify arrest and imprisonment those who knew him will accept as a just description thenceforward arrests of the most illustrious became the rule in a land where freedom of speech was held to be an unquestioned right freedom of thought ceased to exist and men were incarcerated for opinions sake in the maryland legislature the hon s * * from a committee to whom was referred the memorial of the police commissioners arrested in baltimore made a report upon the * of the act and appealed in the most earnest manner to the whole people of the country of all parties sections and opinions to take warnings by the usurpations mentioned and come to the rescue of the free institutions of the country for no better reason so far as the public was informed than a vote in favor of certain resolutions general banks sent his provostmarshal to frederick where the legislature was in session a cordon of pickets was placed around the town to prevent any one from leaving it without a written permission from a member of general bankss staff police detectives from baltimore then went into the town and arrested some twelve or thirteen members and several officers of the legislature which thereby left without a * was prevented from organizing and it performed the only act which it was competent to do ie adjourned s * * the author of the report in defense of the constitutional rights of citizens was among those arrested henry may a member of congress who had introduced a resolution which he hoped would be * of peace was another of those arrested and thrown into prison senator * of the same state presented a report of the legislature to the united states senate reciting the outrage inflicted upon maryland in the persons of her municipal officers and citizens and after some opposition merely obtained an order to have it printed governor hicks whose promises had been so cheering in the beginning of the year sent his final message to the legislature on december 3 1861 in that referring to the action of the maryland legislature at its several * before that when the arrest of its members prevented an organization he wrote this continued until the general government had ample reason to believe it was about to go through the farce of enacting an ordinance of secession when the treason was summarily stopped by the dispersion of the traitors after referring to the elections of the 13th of june and the 6th of november he says the people have declared in the most emphatic tones what i have never doubted that maryland has no sympathy with the rebellion and desires to do her full share in the duty of suppressing it it would be more easy than gracious to point out the inconsistency between his first statements and this last the conclusion is inevitable that he kept himself in equipoise and fell at last as men without convictions usually do upon the stronger side henceforth the story of maryland is sad to the last degree only relieved by the gallant men who left their homes to fight the battle of state rights when maryland no longer furnished them a field on which they could maintain the rights their fathers left them this was a fate doubly sad to the sons of the heroic men who under the designation of the maryland line did so much in our revolutionary struggle to secure the independence of the states of the men who at a later day fought the battle of north point of the people of a land which had furnished so many heroes and statesmen and gave the great chiefjustice taney to the supreme court of the united states though maryland did not become one of the confederate states she was endeared to the people thereof by many most enduring ties last in order but first in cordiality were the tender ministrations of her noble daughters to the sick and wounded prisoners who were carried through the streets of baltimore and it is with shame we remember that brutal guards on several occasions inflicted wounds upon gentlewomen who approached these suffering prisoners to offer them the relief of which they so evidently stood in need the accumulation of northern forces at and near washington city made it evident that the great effort of the invasion would be from that point while assaults of more or less vigor might be expected upon all important places which the enemy by his facilities for transportation could reach the concentration of confederate troops in virginia was begun and they were sent forward as rapidly as practicable to the points threatened with attack it was soon manifest that besides the army at washington which threatened virginia there was a second one at chambersburg pennsylvania under majorgeneral patterson designed to move through williamsport and martinsburg and another forming in ohio under the command of majorgeneral mcclellan destined to invade the western counties of virginia this latter force having landed at wheeling on may 26th advanced as far as grafton on the 29th at this time colonel * with the small force of seven hundred men sent forward by governor letcher of virginia was at * on the night of june 2d he was attacked by general mcclellan with a strong force and withdrew to laurel hill renforcements under general garnett were sent forward and occupied the hill while colonel pegram the second in command held rich mountain on july 11th the latter was attacked by two columns of the enemy and after a vigorous defense fell back on the 12th losing many of his men who were made prisoners general garnett hearing of this reverse attempted to fall back but was pursued by mcclellan and while striving to rally his rear guard was killed five hundred of his men were taken prisoners this success left the northern forces in possession of that region the difficult character of the country in which the battle was fought as well from mountain * as dense wood rendered a minute knowledge of the roads of vast importance there is reason to believe that competent guides led the enemy by roads unknown to our army to the flank and rear of its position and thus caused the sacrifice of those who had * come to repel the invasion of the very people who furnished the guides to the enemy it was treachery confounding the counsels of the brave thus occurred the disaster of rich mountain and laurel hill general robert garnett was a native of virginia and a graduate of the united states military academy he served in mexico on the staff of general * taylor and was conspicuous for gallantry and good conduct especially in the battles of monterey and buena vista recognizing his allegiance as due to the state of virginia from which he was appointed a cadet and thence won his various promotions in the army he resigned his commission when the state withdrew from the union and earnestly and * served as aidedecamp to general r e lee the commanderinchief of the army of virginia until she acceded to the confederacy when western virginia was invaded he offered his services to go to her defense and relying confidently on the sentiment so strong in his own heart of devotion to the state by all virginians he believed it was only needful for him to have a nucleus around which the people could rally to resist the invasion of their country how sadly he was disappointed and how bravely he struggled against adverse fortune and how gallantly he died in the discharge of his duty are memories which though sad bear with them to his friends the consolation that the manner of his death was worthy of the way in which he lived and that even his life was an offering he was not unwilling to make for the welfare and honor of virginia he fell while commanding the rear guard to save his retreating army thus * the highest quality of man selfsacrifice for others and such devotion and fortitude as made * the grandest figure in * retreat from moscow the provisional congress in session at montgomery alabama on the 21st of may 1861 resolved that this congress will * on tuesday next to meet again on the 20th day of july at richmond virginia the resolution further authorized the president to have the several executive departments with their archives removed at such intermediate time as he might determine and added a proviso that if any public emergency should render it impolitic to meet in richmond he should call the congress together at some other place to be selected by him the hostile demonstrations of the united states government against virginia caused the president at an early day after the adjournment of congress to proceed to richmond and to direct the executive departments with their archives to be removed to that place as soon as could be conveniently done in the message delivered to the congress at its meeting in richmond according to adjournment i gave the following explanation of my conduct under the resolution above cited immediately after your adjournment the aggressive movement of the enemy required prompt energetic action the accumulation of his forces on the potomac sufficiently demonstrated that his efforts were to be directed against virginia and from no point could necessary measures for her defense and protection be so effectively decided as from her own capital on my arrival in richmond general r e lee as commander of the army of virginia was found there where he had established his headquarters he possessed my unqualified confidence both as a soldier and a patriot and the command he had exercised over the army of virginia before her accession to the confederacy gave him that special knowledge which at the time was most needful as has been already briefly stated troops had previously been sent from other states of the confederacy to the aid of virginia the forces there assembled were divided into three armies at positions the most important and threatened one under general j e johnston at harpers ferry covering the valley of the shenandoah another under general p g t beauregard at manassas covering the direct approach from washington to richmond and the third under generals huger and magruder at norfolk and on the peninsula between the james and york rivers covering the approach to richmond from the seaboard the first and second of these armies though separated by the blue ridge had such practicable communication with each other as to render their junction possible when the necessity should be foreseen they both were confronted by forces greatly superior in numbers to their own and it was doubtful which would first be the object of attack harpers ferry was an important position both for military and political considerations and though * situated for defense against an enemy which should seek to turn its position by crossing the potomac above it was desirable to hold it as long as was consistent with safety the temporary occupation was especially needful for the removal of the valuable machinery and material in the armory located there and which the enemy had failed to destroy though he had for that purpose fired the buildings before his evacuation of the post the demonstrations of general patterson commanding the federal army in that region caused general johnston earnestly to insist on being allowed to retire to a position nearer to winchester under these circumstances an official letter was addressed to him from which the following extract is made the earliest combat in this quarter and which in the inexperience of the time was regarded as a great battle may claim a passing notice as * the extent to which the individuality * and habitual use of smallarms by the people of the south was a substitute for military training and on the other hand how the want of such training made the northern new levies inferior to the like kind of southern troops a detached work on the right of general magruders line was occupied june 11 1861 by the first regiment of north carolina volunteers and three hundred and sixty virginians under the command of an educated vigilant and gallant soldier then colonel d h hill first regiment north carolina volunteers subsequently a lieutenantgeneral in the confederate service he reports that this small force was engaged for five and a half hours with four and a half regiments of the enemy at bethel church nine miles from hampton the enemy made three distinct and * charges but were repulsed with heavy loss our cavalry pursued them for six miles when their retreat became a total rout on the other side frederick * colonel of third regiment of the enemys forces after stating with much minuteness the orders and line of march describes how about five or six miles from hampton a heavy and * fire of canister and smallarms was opened upon the regiment and how it was afterward discovered to be a portion of their own column which had fired upon them after due care for the wounded and a recognition of their friends the column proceeded and the colonel describes his regiment as moving to the attack in line of battle as if on parade in the face of a severe fire of artillery and smallarms subsequently the description proceeds a company of my regiment had been separated from the regiment by a * ditch and marched in the adjoining field in line with the main body not being aware of the separation of that company the colonel states that therefore upon seeing among the breaks in the hedge the glistening of bayonets in the adjoining field i immediately concluded that the enemy were * and conceived it to be my duty to immediately retire and repel that advance without knowing anything of the subsequent career of the colonel from whose report these extracts have been made or of the officers who opened fire upon him while he was marching to the execution of the orders under which they were all acting it is fair to suppose that after a few months experience such scenes as are described could not have occurred and these citations have been made to show the value of military training in further exemplification of the difference between the troops of the confederate states and those of the united states before either had been trained in war i will cite an affair which occurred on the upper potomac colonel a p hill commanding a brigade at romney in western virginia having learned that the enemy had a command at the twentyfirst bridge on the baltimore and ohio railroad decided to attack it and to destroy the bridge so as to interrupt the use of that important line of the enemys communication for this purpose he ordered colonel john c vaughn of the third tennessee volunteers to proceed with a detachment of two companies of his regiment and two companies of the thirteenth virginia volunteers to the position where the enemy were reported to be posted colonel vaughn reports that on june 18 1861 at 8 p m he moved with his command as ordered marched eighteen miles and at 5 a m the next morning found the enemy on the north bank of the potomac in some strength of infantry and with two pieces of artillery he had no * after reconnaissance the order to charge was given it was necessary in the execution of the order to ford the river * which colonel vaughn reports was gallantly executed in good order but with great enthusiasm as we appeared in sight at a distance of four hundred yards the enemy broke and fled in all directions firing as they ran only a few random shots the enemy did not wait to fire their artillery which we captured both guns loaded they were however spiked by the enemy before he fled from the best information their number was between two and three hundred colonel vaughn further states that in pursuance of orders he fired the bridge and then retired bringing away the two guns and the enemys flag and other articles of little value which had been captured and arrived at brigade headquarters in the evening with his command in high spirits good condition colonel a p hill the energetic brigade commander who directed this expedition left the united states army when the state which had given him to the military service of the general government passed her ordinance of secession the vigilance and enterprise he manifested on this early occasion in the war of the states gave promise of the brilliant career which gained for him the high rank of a lieutenantgeneral and which there was nothing for his friends to regret save the honorable death which he met upon the field of battle colonel vaughn the commander of the detachment was new to war his paths had been those of peace and his home in the mountains of east tennessee might reasonably have secured him from any expectation that it would ever be the theatre on which armies were to contend and that he in the * of human affairs would become a soldier he lived until the close of the war and on larger fields than that on which he first appeared proved that though not educated for a soldier he had endowments which compensated for that disadvantage the activity and vigilance of stuart afterward so distinguished as commander of cavalry in the army of virginia and the skill and daring of jackson soon by greater deeds to become immortal checked punished and embarrassed the enemy in his threatened advances and his movements became so devoid of a definite purpose that one was at a loss to divine the object of his campaign unless it was to detain general johnston with his forces in the valley of the shenandoah while general mcdowell * by the feint should make the real attack upon general beauregards army at manassas however that may be the evidence finally became conclusive that the enemy under general mcdowell was moving to attack the army under general beauregard the contingency had therefore arisen for that junction which was necessary to enable us to resist the vastly superior numbers of our assailant for though the most strenuous and not wholly unsuccessful exertions had been made to renforce both the armies of the shenandoah and of the potomac they yet remained far smaller than those of the enemy confronting them and made a junction of our forces indispensable whenever the real point of attack should be ascertained for this movement we had the advantage of an interior line so that if the enemy should discover it after it commenced he could not counteract it by adopting the same tactics the success of this policy it will readily be perceived depended upon the time of execution for though from different causes failure would equally result if done too soon or too late the determination as to which army should be renforced from the other and the exact time of the transfer must have been a difficult problem as both the generals appear to have been unable to solve it each asking renforcements from the other on the 9th of july general johnston wrote an official letter from which i make the following extracts as soon as i became satisfied that manassas was the objective point of the enemys movement i wrote to general johnston urging him to make preparations for a junction with general beauregard and to his objections and the difficulties he presented replied at great length endeavoring to convince him that the troops he described as embarrassing a hasty march might be withdrawn in advance of the more effective portion of his command writing with entire confidence i kept no copy of my letters and when subsequent events caused the wish to refer to them i requested general johnston to send me copies of them he replied that his tent had been blown down and his papers had been scattered his letters to me which would show the general purport of mine to him have shared the fate which during or soon after the close of the war befell most of the correspondence i had preserved and his retained copies if still in his possession do not appear to have been deemed of sufficient importance to be inserted in his published narrative on the 17th of july 1861 the following telegram was sent by the adjutantgeneral the confidence reposed in general johnston sufficiently evinced by the important command intrusted to him was more than equal to the expectation that he would do all that was practicable to execute the order for a junction as well as to secure his sick and baggage for the execution of the one great purpose that he would allow no minor question to interfere with that which was of vital importance and for which he was informed all his effective force would be needed the order referred to was the telegram inserted above in which the sending the sick to culpepper courthouse might have been after or before the effective force had moved to the execution of the main and only positive part of the order all the arrangements were left to the discretion of the general it seems strange that any one has construed this expression as meaning that the movement for a junction was left to the discretion of that officer and that the forming of a * imperious * have been termed in the order all the arrangement instead of referring that word to its proper connection the route and mode of transportation the general had no margin on which to institute a comparison as to the importance of his remaining in the valley according to his previous assignment or going where he was ordered by competent authority it gives me pleasure to state that from all the accounts received at the time the plans of general johnston for * his withdrawal to form a junction with general beauregard were conducted with marked skill and though all of his troops did not arrive as soon as expected and needed he has satisfactorily shown that the failure was not due to any defect in his arrangements for their transportation the great question of uniting the two armies had been decided at richmond the time and place depended on the enemy and when it was seen that the real attack was to be against the position at manassas the order was sent to general johnston to move to that point his letters of the 12th and 15th instant expressed his doubts about his power to retire from before the superior force of general patterson therefore the word practicable was in this connection the equivalent of possible that it was at the time so understood by general johnston is shown by his reply to the telegram after general johnston commenced his march to manassas he sent to me a telegram the substance of which as my memory serves and the reply indicates was an inquiry as to the relative position he would occupy toward general beauregard i returned the following answer general johnston by his promotion to the grade of general as well as his superior rank as a brigadier over brigadiergeneral beauregard gave him precedence so there was no need to ask which of the two would command the whole when their troops should join and do duty together therefore his inquiry as it was revolved in my mind created an anxiety not felt before lest there should be some unfortunate * or misunderstanding between these officers when their forces should be united regarding the combat of the 18th of july as the precursor of a battle i decided at the earliest moment to go in person to the army as has been heretofore stated congress was to assemble on the 20th of july to hold its first session at the new capital richmond virginia my presence on that occasion and the delivery of a message were required by usage and law after the delivery of the message to congress on saturday the 20th of july i intended to leave in the afternoon for manassas but was detained until the next morning when i left by rail accompanied by my aidedecamp colonel j r davis to confer with the generals on the field as we approached manassas railroad junction a cloud of dust was visible a short distance to the west of the railroad it resembled one raised by a body of marching troops and recalled to my remembrance the design of general beauregard to make the rappahannock his second line of defense it was however subsequently learned that the dust was raised by a number of wagons which had been sent to the rear for greater security against the contingencies of the battle the sound of the firing had now become very distinct so much so as to leave no doubt that a general engagement had commenced though that event had been anticipated as being near at hand after the action of the 18th it was both hoped and desired that it would not occur quite so soon the more so as it was not known whether the troops from the valley had yet arrived on reaching the railroad junction i found a large number of men bearing the usual evidence of those who leave the field of battle under a panic they crowded around the train with fearful stories of a defeat of our army the railroad conductor announced his decision that the railroad train should proceed no farther looking among those who were about us for one whose demeanor gave reason to expect from him a collected answer i selected one whose gray beard and calm face gave best assurance he however could furnish no encouragement our line he said was broken all was confusion the army routed and the battle lost i asked for generals johnston and beauregard he said they were on the field when he left it i returned to the conductor and told him that i must go on that the railroad was the only means by which i could proceed and that until i reached the headquarters i could not get a horse to ride to the field where the battle was * he finally consented to detach the locomotive from the train and for my accommodation to run it as far as the army headquarters in this manner colonel davis aidedecamp and myself proceeded at the headquarters we found the quartermaster general w l cabell and the adjutantgeneral jordan of general beauregards staff who courteously agreed to furnish us horses and also to show us the route while the horses were being prepared colonel jordan took occasion to advise my aidedecamp colonel davis of the hazard of going to the field and the impropriety of such exposure on my part the horses were after a time reported ready and we started to the field the stragglers soon became numerous and warnings as to the fate which awaited us if we advanced were not only frequent but evidently sincere there were however many who turned back and the wounded generally cheered upon meeting us i well remember one a mere * who supported on the shoulders of a man who was bearing him to the rear took off his cap and waved it with a cheer that showed within that slender form beat the heart of a * a spirit that would dare the labors of hercules as we advanced the storm of the battle was rolling westward and its fury became more faint when i met general johnston who was upon a hill which commanded a general view of the field of the afternoons operations and inquired of him as to the state of affairs he replied that we had won the battle i left him there and rode still farther to the west several of the volunteers on general beauregards staff joined me and a command of cavalry the gallant leader of which captain john f lay insisted that i was too near the enemy to be without an escort we however only saw one column near to us that created a doubt as to which side it belonged and as we were riding toward it it was suggested that we should halt until it could be examined with a fieldglass colonel chesnut dismounted so as the better to use his glass and at that moment the column formed into line by which the wind struck the flag so as to extend it and it was plainly revealed to be that of the united states our cavalry though there was present but the squadron previously mentioned and from a statement of the commander of which i will make some extracts dashed boldly forward to charge the demonstration was followed by the immediate retreat of what was i believe the last * of the enemys forces maintaining their organization and showing a disposition to dispute the possession of the field of battle in riding over the ground it seemed quite possible to mark the line of a fugitives flight here was a musket there a cartridgebox there a blanket or overcoat a haversack etc as if the runner had stripped himself as he went of all impediments to speed as we approached toward the left of our line the signs of an utter rout of the enemy were unmistakable and justified the conclusion that the * of on to richmond had been changed to off for washington on the extreme left of our field of operations i found the troops whose opportune arrival had averted impending disaster and had so materially contributed to our victory some of them had after arriving at the manassas railroad junction hastened to our left their brigadiergeneral e k smith was wounded soon after getting into action and the command of the brigade devolved upon * by whom it was gallantly and skillfully led to the close of the battle others under the command of general then colonel early made a rapid march under the pressing necessity from the extreme right of our line to and beyond our left so as to attack the enemy in flank thus inflicting on him the discomfiture his oblique movement was designed to inflict on us all these troops and the others near to them had hastened into action without supplies or * weary hungry and without shelter night closed around them where they stood the bloodstained victors on a hardfought field it was reported to me that some of the troops had been so long without food as to be suffering severe hunger and that no supplies could be got where they were i made several addresses to them all to the effect that their position was that best adapted to a pursuit of the enemy and that they should therefore remain there adding that i would go to the headquarters and direct that supplies should be sent to them promptly general then colonel early commanding a brigade informed me of some wounded who required attention one colonel gardner was he said at a house not far from where we were i rode to see him found him in severe pain and from the twitching visible and frequent seemed to be threatened with * a man sat beside him whose uniform was that of the enemy but he was gentle and appeared to be * attentive he said that he had no * and did not know where to get any i found in a short time a surgeon who went with me to colonel gardner having the articles necessary in the case before leaving colonel gardner he told me that the man who was attending to him might without hindrance have retreated with his comrades but had kindly remained with him and he therefore asked my protection for the man i took the name and the state of the supposed good * and at army headquarters directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner the sequel will be told hereafter it was then late and we rode back in the night say seven miles to the army headquarters i had not seen general beauregard on the field and did not find him at his quarters when we returned the promise made to the troops was therefore communicated to a staffofficer who said he would have the supplies sent out at a later hour when i met general beauregard and informed him of what had occurred he stated that because of a false alarm which had reached him he had ordered the troops referred to from the left to the right of our line so as to be in position to repel the reported movement of the enemy against that flank that such an alarm should have been credited and a night march ordered on account of it shows how little the completeness of the victory was realized at a late hour of the night i had a conference with generals johnston and beauregard the adjutantgeneral of the latter colonel jordan was present and sat opposite to me at the table when after some preliminary conversation i asked whether any troops had been sent in pursuit of the enemy i was answered in the negative upon further inquiry as to what troops were in the best position for pursuit and had been least fatigued during the day general bonhams brigade was named i then suggested that he should be ordered in pursuit a pause ensued until colonel jordan asked me if i would dictate the order i at once dictated an order for immediate pursuit some conversation followed the result of which was a modification of the order by myself so that instead of immediate pursuit it should be commenced at early dawn colonel jordan spoke across the table to me saying if you will send the order as you first dictated it the enemy wont stop till he gets into the potomac i believe i remember the words very nearly and am quite sure that i do remember them substantially on the 25th of march 1878 i wrote to general beauregard as follows to this letter general beauregard courteously replied that his * was in new york in the hands of a friend to whom he would write for a copy of the order desired if it should be in said book and that he would also write to his adjutant general jordan for his recollection of the order if it had not been inscribed in the * on the 24th of april general beauregard forwarded to me the answer to his inquiries in my behalf as follows general beauregard in his letter forwarding the above wrote the account given * by general jordan of what occurred there respecting further pursuit that night agrees with my own recollection it was a matter of importance as i regarded it to follow closely on the retreating enemy but it was of no consequence then or now as to who issued the order for pursuit and unless requested i should not have dictated one preferring that the generals to whom the operations were confided should issue all orders to the troops i supposed the order as modified by myself had been sent i have found however since the close of the war that it was not but that an order to the same effect was sent on the night of the 21st of july for a copy of which i am indebted to the kindness of that chivalrous gentleman soldier and patriot general bonham it is as follows impressed with the belief that the enemy was very superior to us both in numbers and appointments i had felt apprehensive that unless pressed he would recover from the panic under which he fled from the field rally on his reserves and renew the contest therefore it was that i immediately felt the necessity for a pursuit of the fugitives and insisted that the troops on the extreme left should retain their position during the night of the 21st as has been heretofore stated in conference with the generals that night this subject was considered and i dictated an order for a movement on the rear of the enemy at early dawn which on account of the late hour at which it was given differed very little from one for an immediate movement a rainfall extraordinary for its violence and duration occurred on the morning of the succeeding day so that over places where during the battle one could scarcely get a drink of water rolled torrents which in the afternoon of the 22d it was difficult to cross from these and other causes the troops were scattered to such an extent that but few commands could have been assembled for immediate service it was well for us that the enemy instead of retiring in order so as to be rallied and again brought to the attack left hope behind and fled in dismay to seek for safety beyond the potomac each hour of the day following the battle added to the evidence of a thorough rout of the enemy abandoned wagons stores guns caissons smallarms and ammunition proved his complete demoralization as far as our cavalry went no hostile force was met and all the indications favored the conclusion that the purpose of invasion had for the time been abandoned the victory though decisive and important both in its moral and physical effect had been dearly bought by the sacrifice of the lives of many of our bravest and best who at the first call of their country had rushed to its defense when riding to the front i met an ambulance bearing general barnard bee from the field where he had been mortally wounded after his patriotism had been illustrated by conspicuous * of skill daring and fortitude soon after i learned that my friend colonel bartow had heroically sealed with his lifeblood his faith in the sanctity of our cause he had been the chairman of the committee on military affairs in the provisional congress and after the laws were enacted to provide for the public defense he went to the field to maintain them it is to such virtuous and devoted citizens that a country is indebted for its prosperity and honor as well in peace as in war reference has been made to the dispersion of our troops after the battle and in this connection the following facts are mentioned in the afternoon of the 22d with a guide supposed to be cognizant of the positions at which the different commands would be found i went to visit the wounded and among them a youth of my family who it was reported to me was rapidly sinking after driving many miles and witnessing very painful scenes but seldom finding the troops in the position where my guide supposed them to be and always disappointed in not discovering him i particularly sought i was at the approach of night about to abandon the search when accidentally meeting an officer of the command to which the youth belonged i was directed to the temporary hospital to which the wounded of that command had been removed it was too late the soul of the young soldier had just left his body the corpse lay before me around him were many gentle boys suffering in different degrees from the wounds they had received one bright * youth from south carolina severely if not fatally wounded responded to my expression of sympathy by the heroic declaration that it was sweet to die for such a cause many kindred spirits ascended to the father from that field of their glory the roll need not be recorded here it has a more enduring * than the pen can * traditions of a grateful people the victory at manassas was certainly extraordinary not only on account of the disparity of numbers and the inferiority of our arms but also because of many other disadvantages under which we labored we had no disciplined troops and though our citizens were generally skilled in the use of smallarms which with their high pride and courage might compensate for the want of training while in position these inadequately substituted military instruction when manuvres had to be performed under fire and could not make the oldfashioned musket equal to the longrange * muskets with which the enemy was supplied the disparity in artillery was still greater both in the number and kind of guns but thanks to the skill and cool courage of the rev captain w n pendleton his battery of light smoothbore guns manned principally by the youths whose rector he had been proved more effective in battle than the longrange * of the enemy the character of the ground brought the forces into close contact and the * of the round balls carried havoc into the columns of the enemy while the bolts of their * if they missed their object penetrated harmlessly into the ground the field was very extensive broken and wooded the senior general had so recently arrived that he had no opportunity * to learn the ground and the troops he brought were both unacquainted with the field and with those with whom they had to coperate to all this must be added the disturbing fact that the plan of battle as originally designed was entirely changed by the movement of the enemy on our extreme left instead of right and center as anticipated the operations therefore had to be conducted against the plan of the enemy instead of on that which our generals had prepared and explained to their subordinate commanders the * with which the troops moved and the readiness with which our generals modified their preconceived plans to meet the necessities as they were developed entitled them to the commendation so liberally bestowed at the time by their countrymen at large general johnston had been previously promoted to the highest grade in our army and i deemed it but a fitting reward for the services rendered by general beauregard that he should be promoted to the same grade therefore i addressed to him the following letter the 22d the day after the battle was spent in following up the line of the retreating foe and collecting the large supplies of arms of ammunition and other military stores the supplies of the army were on a scale of such luxurious extravagance as to excite the surprise of those accustomed only to our rigid economy the anticipation of an easy victory had caused many to come to the battle as to a joyous feast and the signs left behind them of the extent to which they had been disappointed in the entertainment constituted the * of many laughable stories which were not without their value because of the lesson they contained as to the uncertainties of war and the mortification that usually follows vain boasting among the articles abandoned by the enemy in his flight were some which excited a just indignation and which indicated the shameless disregard of all the usages of honorable warfare they were * the fit * of a policeman but not of a soldier who came to meet his * hilt to hilt these were reported to have been found in large numbers some of them were sent to richmond on the night of the 22d i held a second conference with generals johnston and beauregard all the revelations of the day were of the most satisfactory character as to the completeness of our victory the large amount gained of fine artillery smallarms and ammunition all of which were much needed by us was not the least gratifying consequence of our success the generals like myself were well content with what had been done i * to them the inquiry as to what more it was practicable to do they concurred as to their inability to cross the potomac and to the further inquiry as to an advance to the south side of the potomac general beauregard promptly stated that there were strong fortifications there occupied by garrisons which had not been in the battle and were therefore not affected by the panic which had seized the defeated army he described those fortifications as having wide deep ditches with * which would prevent the * of the works turning to general johnston he said they have spared no expense it was further stated in explanation that we had no * and * nor even the tools requisite to make regular approaches if we had possessed both the time required for such operations would have more than sufficed for general pattersons army and other forces to have been brought to that locality in such numbers as must have rendered the attempt with our present means futile this view of the matter rests on the supposition that the fortifications and garrisons described did actually exist of which there seemed then to be no doubt if the reports which have since reached us be true that there were at that time neither fortifications nor troops stationed on the south bank of the potomac that all the enemys forces fled to the north side of the river and even beyond that the panic of the routed army infected the whole population of washington city and that no preparation was made or even contemplated for the destruction of the bridge across the * it may have been as many have asserted that our army following close upon the flying enemy could have entered and taken possession of the united states capital these reports however present a condition of affairs altogether at variance with the information on which we had to act thus it was and so far as i knew for the reasons above stated that an advance to the south bank of the potomac was not contemplated as the immediate sequence of the victory at manassas what discoveries would have been made and what results would have ensued from the establishment of our guns upon the south bank of the river to open fire upon the capital are speculative questions upon which it would be useless to enter after the conference of the 22d and because of it i decided to return to richmond and employ all the power of my office to increase the strength of the army so as the better to enable it to meet the public need whether in * or purely defensive operations as opportunity should offer for the one or the renewal of invasion require the other a short time subsequent to my return a message was brought to me from the prison to the effect that a * officer captured at manassas claimed to have a promise of protection from me the name was given * of connecticut i had forgotten the name he gave when i saw him but believing that i would recognize the person who had attended to colonel gardner and to whom only such a promise had been given the officer in charge was directed to send him to me when he came i had no doubt of his identity and explained to him that i had directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner but that in the multitude of those wearing the same uniform as his some neglect or mistake had arisen for which i was very sorry and that he should be immediately released and sent down the river to the neighborhood of fortress monroe where he would be among his own people he then told me that he had a sister residing a few miles in the country whom he would be very glad to visit permission was given him to do so and a time fixed at which he was to report for transportation and so he left with manifestations of thankfulness for the kindness with which he had been treated in due time a newspaper was received containing an account of his escape and how he had lingered about the suburbs of richmond and made drawings of the surrounding fortifications the treachery was as great as if his drawings had been valuable which they could not have been as we had only then commenced the detached works which were designed as a system of defenses for richmond when the smoke of battle had lifted from the field of manassas and the rejoicing over the victory had spread over the land and spent its exuberance some who like jobs warhorse snuffed the battle from afar but in whom the likeness there ceased * asked why the fruits of the victory had not been gathered by the capture of washington city then some indiscreet friends of the generals commanding in that battle instead of the easier task of justification chose the harder one of * for the imputed failure their illadvised zeal combined perhaps with malice against me induced the allegation that the president had prevented the generals from making an immediate and vigorous pursuit of the routed enemy this as other stories had been was left to the correction which time it was hoped would bring the sooner because it was expected to be refuted by the reports of the commanding generals with whom i had conferred on that subject immediately after the battle after considerable time had elapsed it was reported to me that a member of congress who had served on that occasion as a volunteer aide to general beauregard had stated in the house of representatives that i had prevented the pursuit of the enemy after his defeat at manassas this gave to the rumor such official character and dignity as seemed to me to entitle it to notice not * given wherefore i addressed to general johnston the following inquiry which though restricted in its terms to the allegation was of such tenor as left it to his option to state all the facts connected with the slander if he should choose to do me that justice or should see the public interest involved in the correction which as stated in my letter to him was that which gave it in my estimation its claim to consideration and had caused me to address him on the subject this answer to my inquiry was conclusive as to the charge which had been industriously circulated that i had prevented the immediate pursuit of the enemy and had obstructed active operations after the battle of manassas and thus had caused the failure to reap the proper fruits of the victory no specific inquiry was made by me as to the part i took in the conferences of the 21st and 22d of july but a general reference was made to them the entire silence of general johnston in regard to those conferences is noticeable from the fact that while his answer was strictly measured by the terms of my inquiry as to pursuit he added a statement about a conference at fairfax courthouse which occurred in the autumn say october and could have had no relation to the question of pursuit of the enemy after the victory of manassas or other active operations * connected the reasons stated in my letter for making an inquiry naturally pointed to the conferences of the 21st and 22d of july but surely not to a conference held months subsequent to the battle and on a question quite different from that of hot pursuit in regard to the matter of this subsequent conference i shall have more to say hereafter i left the field of manassas proud of the heroism of our troops in battle and of the conduct of the officers who led them anxious to recognize the claim of the army on the gratitude of the country it was my pleasing duty to bear testimony to their merit in every available form those who left the field and did not return to share its glory it was wished should only be remembered as exceptions proving a rule with all the information possessed at the time by the commanding generals the propriety of maintaining our position while seeking objects more easily attained than the capture of the united states capital seemed to me so * as to require no other justification than the statements to which i have referred in connection with the conference of the 22d of july it would have seemed to me then as it does now to be less than was due to the energy and fortitude of our troops to plead a want of transportation and supplies for a march of about twenty miles through a country which had not then been * by the ravages of war under these impressions and with such feelings i wrote to general beauregard as follows i had declared myself content and gratified with the conduct of the troops and the officers and supposed the generals in recognition of my efforts to aid them by increasing their force and munitions as well as by my * from all interference with them upon the field would have neither cause nor motive to reflect upon me in their reports and it was with equal surprise and regret that in this i found myself mistaken general johnston in his report represented the order to him to make a junction with general beauregard as a movement left to his discretion with the condition that if made he should first send his sick and baggage to culpepper courthouse i felt constrained to put upon his report when it was received the following endorsement upon the receipt of general beauregards report of the battle of manassas i found that it contained matter which seemed to me out of place and therefore addressed to him the following letter as general beauregard did not think proper to omit that portion of his report to which objection was made it necessitated when the entire report was transmitted to congress the placing of an endorsement upon it reviewing that part of the report which i considered objectionable the congress in its discretion ordered the publication of the report except that part to which the endorsement referred thereby judiciously suppressing both the endorsement and the portion of the report to which it related in this case and every other official report ever submitted to me i made neither alteration nor * that portion of the report which was suppressed by the congress has since the war found its way into the press but the endorsement which belonged to it has not been published as part of the history of the time i will here present both in their proper connection it has not been my purpose to describe the battles of the war to the reports of the officers serving on the field in the armies of both governments the student of history must turn for knowledge of the details and it will be the task of the future historian from comparison of the whole to * the truth it is fortunate for the cause of justice that error and misrepresentation have in their inconsistencies and * the elements of selfdestruction while truth is in its nature consistent and therefore * to such general remarks in regard to campaigns * and battles as may seem to me appropriate to the scope and object of my work i shall * or insert from time to time the evidence of reliable actors in those affairs as well to elucidate obscurity as to correct error from the official reports it appears that the strength of the two armies was confederate # men of all arms with 29 guns federal # men with a body of cavalry of which only one company is reported and a large artillery force not shown in the * statement of these troops some on both sides were not engaged in the battle this it is believed was the case to a much larger extent on our side than on that of the enemy he selected the point of attack and could concentrate his troops for that purpose but we were guarding a line of some seven miles front and therefore widely dispersed for the purpose above stated extracts are herein inserted from a narrative in the operations on the line of bull run in june and july 1861 including the first battle of manassas the name of the author j a early will to all who know him be a sufficient guarantee for the accuracy of the statements and for the justice of the conclusions announced to those who do not know him it may be proper to state that he was educated as a soldier after leaving the army became a lawyer but when his country was involved in war with mexico he volunteered and served in a regiment of his native state virginia after that war terminated he returned to the practice of his profession which he was actively pursuing when the controversy between the sections caused the call of a convention to decide whether virginia should secede from the union he was sent by the people of the county in which he resided to represent them in that convention there he opposed to the last the adoption of the ordinance for secession but when it was decided against his opinion to resort to the remedy of withdrawal from the union he true to his allegiance to the state of which he was a citizen paused not to cavil or protest but at once stepped forth to defend her against a threatened invasion the sword that had * in peace gleamed brightly in war he rose to the high grade of lieutenantgeneral none have a more stainless record as a soldier none have shown a higher patriotism or purer fidelity through all the bitter trials to which we have been subjected since open war was ended and nominal peace began extracts from the narrative of general j a early of events occurring when he was colonel of the twentyfourth regiment of virginia infantry and commanding a brigade the attack made on the 18th is described as directed against our right center and as having been met and repulsed in a manner quite creditable to our raw troops of whom he writes i will now make the promised extracts from reminiscences of colonel then captain lay which were sent to a friend and handed to me for my use the paper bears date february 13 1878 after some preliminary matter and stating that his force consisted of three cavalry companies the narrative proceeds the quartermastergeneral of general beauregards command w l cabell states in a letter written at dallas texas on the 16th of august 1880 in regard to the field transportation of general beauregards forces before the battle of manassas that as nearly as he could remember it was as follows viz one * wagon to each company one for field and staff regimental one for ammunition one for hospital purposes two wagons for each battery of artillery twentyfive wagons in a train for depot purposes one ambulance for each regiment transportation belonging to general johnstons army did not arrive until the day or probably two days after the battle if general johnston as stated had nine thousand infantry the field transportation reported above could surely have been distributed so as to supply this additional force and have rendered as general early states the pretense wholly untenable that the advance in july 1861 was prevented by want of transportation the deep anxiety which had existed and was justified by the circumstances had corresponding gratification among all classes and in all sections of our country on the day after the victory the congress then sitting in richmond upon receiving the dispatch of the president from the field of manassas adopted resolutions expressive of their thanks to the most high god and inviting the people of the confederate states to offer up their united thanksgiving and praise for the mighty deliverance the resolutions also deplored the necessity which had caused the soil of our country to be stained with the blood of its sons and to their families and friends offered the most cordial sympathy assuring them that in the hearts of our people would be enshrined the names of the gallant dead as the champions of free and constitutional liberty if universal * at our success inspired an overweening confidence it also * increased desire to enter the military service and but for our want of arms and munitions we could have enrolled an army little short of the number of ablebodied men in the confederate states i have given so much space to the battle of manassas because it was the first great action of the war exciting intense feeling and producing important moral results among the people of the confederacy and further because it was made the basis of misrepresentation and unjust reflection upon the chief executive which certainly had no plausible pretext in the facts and can not be referred to a reasonable desire to promote the successful defense of our country impressed with the conviction that time would naturally work to our disadvantage as training was more necessary to make soldiers of the northern people than of our own and further because of their larger population as well as their greater facility in obtaining recruits from foreign countries the administration continued assiduously to exert every faculty to increase the efficiency of the army by addition to its numbers by improving its organization and by supplying the needful munitions and equipments inactivity is the prolific source of evil to an army especially if composed of new levies who like ours had hurried from their homes at their countrys call for these and other reasons more readily appreciated it was thought desirable that all our available forces should be employed as actively as might be practicable on the 1st of august 1861 i wrote to general j e johnston at manassas as follows kentucky the eldest daughter of virginia had moved contemporaneously with her mother in the assertion of the cardinal principles announced in the resolutions of # she then by the properly constituted authority did with due solemnity declare that the government of the united states was the result of a compact between the states to which each acceded as a state that it possessed only delegated powers of which it was not the exclusive or final judge and that as in all cases of compact among parties having no common judge each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress thus spoke kentucky in the first years of her existence as a sovereign the great truth announced in her series of resolutions was the sign under which the democracy conquered in 1800 and which constituted the cornerstone of the political edifice of which jefferson was the architect and which stood unshaken for sixty years from the time its foundation was laid during this period the growth prosperity and happiness of the country seemed unmistakably to confirm the wisdom of the voluntary union of free sovereign states under a written compact confining the action of the general government to the expressly enumerated powers which had been delegated therein when infractions of the compact had been deliberately and persistently made when the intent was clearly manifested to * the powers of the general government from the purposes for which they had been conferred and to use them for the injury of a portion of the states which were the * parties to the compact some of them resolved to judge for themselves of the mode and measure of redress and to exercise the right * in the declaration of independence to be the unalienable endowment of every people to alter or abolish any form of government and to institute a new one laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness by no rational mode of construction in view of the history of the declaration of independence or of the resolutions of kentucky can it be claimed that the word people had any other meaning than that of a distinct community such as the people of each colony who by their delegates in the congress declared themselves to be henceforth a state and that none other than the people of each state could by the resolutions of # have been referred to as the final judge of infractions of their compact and of the remedy which should be applied kentucky made no decision adverse to this right of a state but she declared in the impending conflict between the states seceding from and those adhering to the federal government that she would hold the position of neutrality if the question was to be settled by a war of words that was feasible but if the conflict was to be one of arms it was utterly impracticable to maintain neutrality under such circumstances would have required a power greater than that of both the * or a moral influence commanding such respect for her wishes as could hardly have been anticipated from that party which had in violation of right inflicted the wrongs which produced the withdrawal of some of the states and had uttered multiplied threats of coercion if any state attempted to exercise the rights defined in the resolutions of # if however any such hope may have been entertained but few moons had filled and waned before the defiant occupation of her territory and the enrollment of her citizens as soldiers in the army of invasion must have dispelled the illusion the following correspondence took place in august between governor * of kentucky and president * between the governor and myself as president of the confederate * to the neutrality of the state movements by the federal forces in southwestern kentucky revealed such designs as made it absolutely necessary that general polk commanding the confederate forces in that section should immediately occupy the town of columbus kentucky a position of much strategic importance on the shore of the mississippi river that position was doubly important because it commanded the opposite shore in missouri and was the gateway on the border of tennessee two states of the confederacy were therefore threatened by the anticipated movement of the enemy to get possession of columbus majorgeneral polk therefore crossed the state line took possession of * on september 3d and on the 4th secured columbus general grant who took command at * on september 2d being thus anticipated seized * at the mouth of the tennessee river and occupied it in force on the 5th and 6th after the occupation under date of september 4th i received the following dispatch from majorgeneral polk the enemy having descended the mississippi river some three or four days since and seated himself with cannon and entrenched lines opposite the town of columbus kentucky making such demonstrations as left no doubt upon the minds of any of their intention to seize and forcibly possess said town i thought proper under the plenary power delegated to me to direct a sufficient portion of my command both by the river way and land to concentrate at columbus as well to offer to its citizens that protection they unite to a man in accepting as also to prevent in time the occupation by the enemy of a point so necessary to the security of western tennessee the demonstration on my part has had the desired effect the enemy has withdrawn his forces even before i had fortified my position it is my intention to continue to occupy and hold this place on the same day i sent the following reply to majorgeneral polk your telegram received the necessity must justify the action the legislature of kentucky passed resolutions and appointed a committee to inquire into the action of general polk from which the annexed correspondence resulted however willing the government of kentucky might have been to accede to the proposition of general polk and which from his knowledge of the views of his own government he was fully justified in offering the state of kentucky had no power moral or physical to prevent the united states government from using her soil as best might suit its purposes in the war it was waging for the subjugation of the seceded states president lincoln in his message of the previous july had distinctly and reproachfully spoken of the idea of neutrality as existing in some of the border states he said to prevent the union forces passing one way or the disunion the other over their soil would be disunion completed at a stroke it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession except only what proceeds from the external blockade the acts of the federal government corresponded with the views announced by its president briefly but * general polk showed in his answer that the united states government paid no respect to the neutral position which kentucky wished to maintain that it was armed but not neutral for the arms and the troops assembled on her soil were for the invasion of the south and that he occupied columbus to prevent the enemy from taking possession of it when our troops first entered columbus they found the inhabitants had been in alarm from demonstrations of the united states forces but that they felt no dread of the confederate troops as far as the truth could be ascertained a decided majority of the people of kentucky especially its southwestern portion if left to a free choice would have joined the confederacy in preference to remaining in the union could they have foreseen what in a short time was revealed there can be little doubt that mule contracts and other forms of * would have proved unavailing to make her the passive observer of usurpations destructive of the personal and political rights of which she had always been a most earnest advocate with the slow and sinuous approach of the serpent the general government little by little gained power over kentucky and then throwing off the mask proceeded to outrages so regardless of law and the usages of * people as could not have been anticipated and can only be remembered with shame by those who honor the constitutional government created by the states while * urging the maintenance of the union as a duty of patriotism the constitution which gave the union birth was trampled under foot and the excesses of the reign of terror which followed the french revolution were * in our land once the vaunted home of law and liberty men who had been most honored by the state and who had reflected back most honor upon it were seized without warrant condemned without trial because they had exercised the privilege of free speech and for adhering to the principles which were the * on which our fathers builded our political temple members of the legislature vacated their seats and left the state to avoid arrest the penalty hanging over them for opinions sake the venerable judge monroe who had presided over the united states district court for more than a generation driven from the land of his birth the state he had served so long and so well with feeble step but upright conscience and indomitable will sought a resting place among those who did not regard it a crime to adhere to the principles of 1776 and of 1787 and the * * of them in the resolutions of # about the same time others of great worth and distinction impelled by the feeling that where liberty is there is my country left the land desecrated by despotic usurpation to join the confederacy in its struggle to maintain the personal and political liberties which the men of the revolution had left as an inheritance to their posterity space would not suffice for a complete list of the refugees who became conspicuous in the military events of the confederacy let a few answer for the many j c breckinridge the late vicepresident of the united states and whose general and * popularity might have reasonably led him to expect in the union the highest honors the states could bestow william preston george w johnston s b buckner john h morgan and a host of others alike meritorious and alike gratefully remembered when the passions of the hour shall have subsided and the past shall be reviewed with discrimination and justice the question must arise in every reflecting mind why did such men as these * themselves and surrender all the advantages which they had won by a life of honorable effort in the land of their nativity to such inquiry the answer must be the usurpations of the general government foretold to them the wreck of constitutional liberty the motives which governed them may best be learned from the annexed extracts from the statement made in the address of mr breckinridge to the people of kentucky whom he had represented in both houses of the united states congress with such distinguished ability and zeal for the general welfare as to place him in the front rank of the statesmen of his day such was the neutrality suffered by the confederacy from governments both at home and abroad the chivalric people of kentucky showed their sympathy with the just cause of the people of the southern states by leaving the home where they could not serve the cause of right against might and nobly shared the fortunes of their southern brethren on many a * field in like manner did the british people see with disapprobation their government while proclaiming neutrality make new rules and give new * to old ones so as to favor our enemy and embarrass us the englishmans sense of * and the manly instinct which * him to side with the weak gave us hosts of friends but all their good intentions were paralyzed or foiled by their wily minister for foreign affairs and his * on this side the artful unscrupulous united states secretary of state i have thus presented the case of kentucky not because it was the only state where false promises lulled the people into delusive security until by gradual approaches usurpation had bound them hand and foot and where despotic power crushed all the * of civil liberty which the union was formed to secure but because of the attempt which has been noticed to * the confederacy for invasion of the state in disregard of her sovereignty the occupation of columbus by the confederate forces was only just soon enough to anticipate the * purpose of the federal government all of which was plainly set forth in the letter of general polk to the governor of kentucky and his subsequent letter to the kentucky commissioners missouri like kentucky had wished to preserve peaceful relations in the contest which it was foreseen would soon occur between the northern and the southern states when the federal government denied to her the privilege of choosing her own position which betokened no hostility to the general government and she was driven to the necessity of deciding whether or not her citizens should be used for the subjugation of the southern states her people and their representative the state government repelled the arbitrary assumption of authority by military force to control her government and her people among other acts of invasion the federal troops had occupied belmont a village in missouri opposite to columbus and with artillery threatened that town inspiring terror in its peaceful inhabitants after the occupation of columbus under these circumstances of full justification a small confederate force colonel * arkansas regiment and * battery were thrown across the mississippi to occupy and hold the village in the state of missouri then an ally and soon to become a member of the confederacy on the 6th of november general grant left his headquarters at * with a land and naval force and encamped on the kentucky shore this act and a demonstration made by detachments from his force at * were probably intended to induce the belief that he contemplated an attack on columbus thus concealing his real purpose to surprise the small garrison at belmont general polk on the morning of the 7th discovered the landing of the federal forces on the missouri shore some seven miles above columbus and * the real purpose of the enemy detached general pillow with four regiments of his division say two thousand men to renforce the garrison at belmont very soon after his arrival the enemy commenced an assault which was sternly resisted and with varying fortune for several hours the enemys front so far exceeded the length of our line as to enable him to attack on both flanks and our troops were finally driven back to the bank of the river with the loss of their battery which had been gallantly and * served until nearly all its horses had been killed and its ammunition had been expended the enemy advanced to the bank of the river below the point to which our men had retreated and opened an artilleryfire upon the town of columbus to which our guns from the commanding height responded with such effect as to drive him from the river bank in the mean time general polk had at intervals sent three regiments to renforce general pillow upon the arrival of the first of these general pillow led it to a favorable position where it for some time steadily resisted and checked the advance of the enemy general pillow with great energy and gallantry rallied his repulsed troops and brought them again into action general polk now proceeded in person with two other regiments whether from this or some other cause the enemy commenced a retreat general pillow whose activity and daring on the occasion were worthy of all praise led the first and second detachments by which he had been renforced to attack the enemy in the rear and general polk landing further up the river moved to cut off the enemys retreat but some embarrassment and consequent delay which occurred in landing his troops caused him to be too late for the purpose for which he crossed and to become only a part of the pursuing force one would naturally suppose that the question about which there would be the greatest certainty would be the number of troops engaged in a battle yet there is nothing in regard to which we have such conflicting accounts it is fairly concluded from the * reports that the enemy attacked us on both flanks and that in the beginning of the action we were outnumbered but the obstinacy with which the conflict was maintained and the successive advances and retreats which occurred in the action indicate that the disparity could not have been very great and therefore that after the arrival of our renforcements our troops must have become numerically superior the dead and wounded left by the enemy upon the field the arms ammunition and military stores abandoned in his flight so * prove his defeat that his claim to have achieved a victory is too preposterous for discussion though the forces engaged were comparatively small to those in subsequent battles of the war six hours of incessant combat with repeated * must place this in the rank of the most stubborn engagements and the victors must accord to the vanquished the meed of having fought like americans one of the results of the battle which is at least significant is the fact that general grant who had * refused to recognize general polk as one with whom he could exchange prisoners did after the battle send a flag of truce to get such privileges as are recognized between armies acknowledging each other to be * worthy of their steel general polk reported as follows we pursued them to their boats seven miles and then drove their boats before us the road was strewed with their dead and wounded guns ammunition and equipments the number of prisoners taken by the enemy as shown by their list furnished was one hundred and six all of whom have been returned by exchange after making a liberal allowance to the enemy a hundred of their prisoners still remain in my hands one stand of colors and a fraction over one thousand stand of arms with knapsacks ammunition and other military stores our loss in killed wounded and missing was six hundred and forty one that of the enemy was probably not less than twelve hundred meanwhile albert sidney johnston a soldier of great distinction in the united states army where he had attained the rank of brigadiergeneral by brevet and was in command of the department of california resigned his commission and came * from san francisco to richmond to tender his services to the confederate states though he had been bred a soldier and most of his life had been spent in the army he had not neglected such study of political affairs as properly belongs to the citizen of a republic and appreciated the issue made between states claiming the right to resume the powers they had delegated to a general agent and the claims set up by that agent to coerce states his creators and for whom he held a trust he was a native of kentucky but his first military appointment was from louisiana and he was a volunteer in the war for independence by texas and for a time resided in that state much of his military service had been in the west and he felt most identified with it on the 10th of september 1861 he was assigned to command our department of the west which included the states of tennessee missouri arkansas the indian country and the western part of mississippi general johnston on his arrival at nashville found that he lacked not only men but the munitions of war and the means of obtaining them men were ready to be enlisted but the arms and equipments had nearly all been required to fit out the first levies immediately on his survey of the situation he determined to occupy bowling green in kentucky and ordered brigadiergeneral s b buckner with five thousand men to take possession of the position this invasion of kentucky was an act of selfdefense rendered necessary by the action of the government of kentucky and by the evidences of intended movements of the forces of the united states it was not possible to withdraw the troops from columbus in the west nor from cumberland ford in the east to which general felix k * had advanced with four thousand men a compliance with the demands of kentucky would have opened the * of tennessee and the mississippi river to the enemy besides it was essential to the defense of tennessee east of columbus fort henry fort donelson and * were garrisoned with small bodies of troops and the territory between columbus and bowling green was occupied by moving detachments which caused the supposition that a large military force was present and contemplated an advance a fortified camp was established at cumberland gap as the right of general johnstons line and an important point for the protection of east tennessee against invasion thus general johnston located his line of defense from columbus on the west to the cumberland mountains on the east with his center at bowling green which was occupied and intrenched it was a good base for military operations was a proper depot for supplies and if fortified could be held against largely superior numbers on october 28th general johnston took command at bowling green he states his force to have been twelve thousand men and that the enemys force at that time was estimated to be double his own or twentyfour thousand he says the enemys force increased more rapidly than our own so that by the last of november it numbered fifty thousand and continued to increase until it ran up to between seventyfive and one hundred thousand my force was kept down by disease so that it numbered about twentytwo thousand the chief anxiety of the commander of the department was to procure arms and men on the next day after his arrival at nashville he wrote to the governor of alabama i shall beg to rely on your excellency to furnish us as rapidly as possible at this point with every arm it may be in your power to * mean smallarms for infantry and cavalry the governor replied it is out of the power of alabama to afford you any assistance in the way of arms the governor of georgia replied to the same request on september 18th it is utterly impossible for me to comply with your request general bragg in command at pensacola writes in reply on september 27th the mission of colonel buckner will not be successful i fear as our extreme southern country has been stripped of both arms and men we started early in this matter and have wellnigh exhausted our resources on september 19th general johnston telegraphed to me thirty thousand stand of arms are a necessity to my command i beg you to order them or as many as can be got to be instantly procured and sent with dispatch the secretary of war replied the whole number received by us by that steamer was eighteen hundred and we purchased of the owners seventeen hundred and eighty making in all thirtyfive hundred * rifles of which we have been compelled to allow the governor of georgia to have one thousand for arming troops to repel an attack now hourly threatened at brunswick of the remaining twentyfive hundred i have ordered one thousand sent to you leaving us but fifteen hundred for arming several regiments now encamped here and who have been awaiting their arms for several months we have not an engineer to send you the whole engineer corps * only six captains together with three majors of whom one is on bureau duty you will be compelled to employ the best material within your reach by detailing officers from other corps and by employing civil engineers these details are given to serve as an illustration of the deficiencies existing in every department of the military service in the first years of the war in this respect much relief came from the welldirected efforts of governor harris and the legislature of tennessee a * * and workshops were established the powdermills at nashville turned out about * pounds a day twelve or fourteen batteries were fitted out at memphis laws were passed to impress and pay for the private arms scattered throughout the state and the utmost efforts were made to collect and adapt them to military uses the returns make it evident that during most of the autumn of 1861 fully one half of general johnstons troops were * armed and whole brigades remained without weapons for months no less energetic were the measures taken to concentrate and recruit his forces general * command was moved from northeastern arkansas and sent to bowling green which added four thousand men to the troops there the regiment of texan rangers was brought from louisiana and supplied with horses and sent to the front five hundred kentuckians joined general buckner on his advance and five regiments were gradually formed and filled up a cavalry company under john h morgan was also added at this time september 1861 general johnston under the authority granted to him by the government made a requisition for thirty thousand men from tennessee ten thousand from mississippi and ten thousand from arkansas the arkansas troops were directed to be sent to general mcculloch for the defense of their own frontier the governor of mississippi sent four regiments when this source of supply was closed up to the middle of november only three regiments were mustered in under this call from tennessee but by the close of december the number of men who joined was from twelve to fifteen thousand two regiments fifteen hundred strong had joined general polk in arkansas five companies and a battalion had been organized and were ready to join general mcculloch a speedy advance of the enemy was now indicated and an increase of force was so necessary that further delay was impossible general johnston therefore determined upon a levy en masse in his department he made a requisition on the governors of tennessee alabama and mississippi to call out every ablebodied member of the militia into whose hands arms could be placed or to provide a volunteer force large enough to use all the arms that could be procured in his letters to these governors he plainly presents his view of the posture of affairs on december 24th points out impending dangers and shows that to his applications the response had not been such as the emergency demanded he says on june 5th general johnston was renforced by the brigades of floyd and * from western virginia he also sent a messenger to richmond to ask that a few regiments might be detached from the several armies in the field and sent to him to be replaced by new levies he said i do not ask that my force shall be made equal to that of the enemy but if possible it should be raised to fifty thousand men meantime such an appearance of menace had been maintained as led the enemy to believe that our force was large and that he might be attacked at any time frequent and rapid expeditions through the sparsely settled country gave rise to rumors which kept alive this apprehension to preserve the union in the spirit and for the purposes for which it was established an equilibrium between the states as grouped in sections was essential when the territory of missouri constitutionally applied for admission as a state into the union the struggle between state rights and that sectional aggrandizement which was seeking to destroy the existing equilibrium gave rise to the contest which shook the union to its foundation and sowed the seeds of geographical divisions which have borne the most noxious weeds that have choked our political vineyard again in 1861 missouri appealed to the constitution for the vindication of her rights and again did usurpation and the blind rage of a sectional party disregard the appeal and assume powers not only undelegated but in direct violation of the fourth section of the fourth article of the constitution which every federal officer had sworn to maintain and which secured to every state a republican government and protection against invasion if it be contended that the invasion referred to must have been by other than the troops of the united states and that their troops were therefore not prohibited from entering a state against its wishes and for purposes hostile to its policy the section of the constitution referred to * the fact heretofore noticed of the refusal of the convention when forming the constitution to delegate to the federal government power to coerce a state by its last clause it was provided that not even to suppress domestic violence could the general government on its own motion send troops of the united states into the territory of one of the states that section reads thus surely if federal troops could not be sent into a state without its application even to protect it against domestic violence still less could it be done to overrule the will of its people that instead of an obligation upon the citizens of other states to respond to a call by the president for troops to invade a particular state it was in april 1861 deemed a high crime to so use them reference is here made to the published answers of the governors of states which had not seceded to the requisition made upon them for troops to be employed against the states which had seceded governor letcher of virginia replied to the requisition of the united states secretary of war as follows governor * of kentucky replied governor harris of tennessee replied governor jackson of missouri answered governor rector of arkansas replied governor ellis of north carolina responded to the requisition for troops from that state as follows governor ellis who had lived long enough to leave behind him an enviable reputation was a fair representative of the conservatism gallantry and tenacity in welldoing of the state over which he presided he died too soon for his countrys good and the confederacy seriously felt the loss of his valuable services the prompt and spirited answer he gave to the call upon north carolina to furnish troops for the subjugation of the southern states was the fitting complement of his earlier action in immediately restoring to the federal government forts johnson and * which had been seized without proper authority in communicating his action to president buchanan he wrote the plea so constantly made by the succeeding administration as an excuse for its warlike acts that the duty to protect the public property required such action is shown by this letter of governor ellis to have been a plea created by their usurpations but for which there might have been peace as well as safety to property and what was of greater worth the lives the liberties and the republican institutions of the country there was great * in the condition of missouri to that of kentucky they were both border states and by their institutions and the origin of a large portion of their citizens were identified with the south both sought to occupy a neutral position in the impending war and offered guarantees of peace and order throughout their territory if left free to control their own affairs both refused to furnish troops to the united states government for the unconstitutional purpose of coercing the southern states both because of their stronger affinity to the south than to the north were the objects of suspicion and consequent military occupation by the troops of the united states government at the inception of this unwarrantable proceeding an effort was made by the governor of missouri to preserve the rights of the state without disturbing its relations to the united states government if it had been the policy of the government to allow to missouri the control of her domestic affairs and an exemption from being a party to the violation of the constitution in making war against certain of the states the * effort of the governor might and probably would have been successful the form and purpose of that effort appear in the compact entered into between majorgeneral price commanding the militia or missouri state guard and general harney of the united states army commanding the department of the west a geographical division which included the state of missouri during a temporary absence of general harney captain lyon commanding united states forces at st louis initiated hostilities against the state of missouri under the following circumstances in obedience to the militia law of the state an annual encampment was directed by the governor for instruction in tactics camp jackson near st louis was designated for the encampment of the militia of the county in 1861 here for some days companies of state militia amounting to about eight hundred men under command of brigadiergeneral d m frost were being exercised as is usual upon such occasions they presented no appearance of a hostile camp there were no sentinels to guard against surprise visitors were freely admitted it was the * for the ladies of the city and everything wore the aspect of merrymaking rather than that of * war suddenly captain afterward general * lyon appeared with an overwhelming force of federal troops surrounded this holiday encampment and demanded an unconditional surrender resistance was impracticable and none was attempted the militia surrendered and were confined as prisoners but prisoners of what there was no war and no warrant for their arrest as * against the law it is left for the * to frame a vocabulary suited to their act after the return of general harney brigadiergeneral d m frost of the missouri militia appealed to him from his prison the st louis arsenal on may 11 1861 representing that in accordance with the laws of the state of missouri which have been existing for some years and in obedience to the orders of the governor on monday last i entered into an encampment with the militia force of st louis county for the purpose of * the same in accordance with the laws of the united states and of this state he further sets forth that every officer and soldier of his command had taken an oath to sustain the constitution and laws of the united states and of the state of missouri and that while in the peaceable performance of their duties the encampment was surrounded by the command of captain n lyon united states army and a surrender demanded to which general frost replied as follows general frosts letter to general harney continues my command was in accordance with the above deprived of their arms and surrendered into the hands of captain lyon after which while thus disarmed and surrounded a fire was opened on a portion of it by his troops and a number of my men put to death together with several innocent lookerson men women and children on the occasion of the attack upon camp jackson a large crowd of citizens men women and children were gathered around gazing curiously at these strange proceedings when a volley was fired into them killing ten and wounding twenty noncombatants mostly women and children a reign of terror was at once established and the most severe measures were adopted by the federals to * the excitement and the rage of the people the massacre at camp jackson produced intense excitement throughout the state the legislature upon receipt of the news passed several bills for the enrollment and organization of the militia and to confer special powers upon the governor of the state by virtue of these general officers were appointed chief of whom was sterling price because of the * at st louis and the violent demonstrations consequent upon them not only in st louis but elsewhere in the state general price well known to be what was termed a union man and not only by his commission as commanderinchief of the militia of the state but also and even more because of his influence among the people was earnestly solicited by influential citizens of st louis to unite with general harney in a joint effort to restore order and preserve peace with the sanction of governor jackson he proceeded to st louis the headquarters of the department of the west and after some preliminary conference entered into the following agreement which being promulgated to the people was received with general satisfaction and for a time allayed excitement the agreement was as follows the distinct position of general harney that the military force of the united states should not be used in missouri except in case of necessity together with the emphatic declaration of general price that he had the power and would use it to preserve peace and order in missouri seemed to remove all danger of collision in that state between the federal and local forces in conformity with this understanding general price returned to the capital of the state and sent to their homes the militia who had been assembled there by the governor for the defense of the capital against an anticipated attack by the troops of the united states those who desired to preserve peace in missouri had just cause to be gratified at the favorable prospect now presented those who desired war had equal ground for dissatisfaction a few days after the * of the agreement between general price and general harney the latter was removed from command as many believed because of his successful efforts to allay excitement and avoid war rumors had been in circulation that the missourians were driving the union men from their homes and many letters * to be written in different parts of the state represented the persecution of union men it was suspected that many of them were written in st louis or inspired by the * an incident related in confirmation of the justice of this suspicion is that general harney received a letter from st joseph stating that exgovernor stewart and a number of the most respectable men in st joseph had been driven from their homes and that unless soldiers were soon sent the union men would all have to leave he called upon the hon f p blair an influential citizen of st louis and asked him if he knew the writer of the letter the reply was oh yes he is perfectly reliable you can believe anything he says general harney said he would write immediately to general price dissatisfaction was then manifested at such delay but two or three days later a letter from exgovernor stewart was published in the st joseph news in which was a marked paragraph of the copy sent to general harney neither i nor any other union man has been driven out of st joe an attempt has been made to evade the conclusion that general harney was relieved from command because of his pacific policy the argument is that the order was dated the 16th of may and his agreement with general price was on the 21st of the same month an argument more specious than fair as it appears from the letter of president lincoln of may 18 1861 to hon f p blair that the order sent from the war department to him was to be delivered or withheld at his discretion and that it was not delivered until the 30th of the month and until after general harney had not only entered into his agreement with general price but had declined to act upon sensational stories of persecution on which applications were made to send troops into the interior of missouri during the days this order was held for his removal with discretionary power to deliver or withhold it the * events occurred and they may fairly be considered as having decided the question of his removal from that command the principal united states arsenal at the west was that near to st louis to it had been transferred a large number of the altered muskets sent from springfield massachusetts so that in 1861 the arms in that arsenal were perhaps numerically second only to those at springfield these arms by a conjunction of deceptive and bold measures were removed from the arsenal in missouri and transported to illinois to whom did those arms belong certainly to those whose money had made or purchased them that is to the states in common not to their agent the general government or to a portion of the states which might be in a condition to appropriate them to their special use and in disregard of the rights of their * not satisfied with removing the public arms from the limits of missouri the next step was that in total disrespect of the constitutional right of the citizens to bear arms for their own defense and to be free from * and * except by * duly issued the officers of the general government proceeded to search the houses of citizens in st louis and to seize arms wherever they were found missouri had refused to engage in war against her sister states of the south therefore she was first to be disarmed and then to be made the victim of an invasion characterized by such barbarous * as shame the civilization of the age the wrongs she suffered the brave efforts of her unarmed people to defend their hearthstones and their liberties against the desecration and destruction of both form a melancholy chapter in the history of the united states which all who would cherish their fair fame must wish could be obliterated these acts of usurpation and outrage as well upon the political as personal rights of the people of missouri aroused an intense feeling in that state it will be remembered that governor jackson had responded to the call of mr lincoln upon him for troops with the just indignation of one who understood the rights of the state and the limited powers of the general government his stern refusal to become a party to the war upon the south made him the object of special persecution by his side in this critical juncture stood the gallant veteran general price to the latter was confided the conduct of the military affairs of the state and after exhausting every effort to maintain order by peaceful means and seeing that the government would recognize no other method than that of force he energetically applied himself to raise troops and procure arms so as to enable the state to meet force by force during this and all the subsequent period the governor and the general were ably seconded by the accomplished gallant and indefatigable * reynolds the position of missouri in 186061 was unquestionably that of opposition to the secession of the state the people generously confided in the disposition of the general government to observe their rights and continued to hope for a peaceful settlement of the questions then agitating the country this was evinced by the fact that not a single secessionist was elected to the state convention and that general price an avowed union man was chosen as president of the convention hence the general satisfaction with the agreement made between generals harney and price for the preservation of peace and nonintervention by the army of the united states general harney the day before the order for his removal was communicated to him wrote to the war department expressing his confidence in the preservation of peace in missouri and used this significant expression interference by unauthorized parties as to the course i shall pursue can alone prevent the realization of these hopes the unauthorized parties here referred to could not have been the people or the government of missouri others than they must have been the parties wishing to use force * of hostilities as has been heretofore stated after his agreement with general harney at st louis general price returned to the capital and dismissed to their homes the large body of militia that had been there assembled after the removal of general harney believed to be in consequence of his determination to avoid the use of military force against the people of missouri reports were rife of a purpose on the part of the administration at washington to disarm the citizens of missouri who did not sympathize with the views of the federal government and to put arms into the hands of those who could be relied on to enforce them on the 4th of june general price issued an address to the people of missouri and in reference to that report said the purpose of such a movement could not be misunderstood and it would not only be a palpable violation of the agreement referred to and an equally plain violation of our constitutional rights but a gross indignity to the citizens of this state which would be resisted to the last extremity the call of president lincoln for seventyfive thousand volunteers removed any * doubt as to the intent to coerce the states which should claim to assert their right of sovereignty missouri while * her purpose to adhere to the union had asserted her right to exercise supreme control over her domestic affairs and this put her in the category of a state threatened by the proceedings of the united states government to provide for such contingency as might be anticipated governor jackson on the 13th of june issued a call for fifty thousand volunteers and majorgeneral price took the field in command in this proclamation governor jackson said in his endeavor to maintain the peace of the state and to avert if possible from its borders a civil war he caused the * agreement to be made with the commander of the northern forces in the state by which its peace might be preserved that officer was promptly removed by his government the governor then upon the increase of hostile actions proposed at an interview with the new officer commanding the forces of the united states government to * the state guard and break up its organization to disarm all companies that had been armed by the state to pledge himself not to organize the militia under the military bill that no arms or munitions of war should be brought into the state that he would protect the citizens equally in all their rights regardless of their political opinions that he would repress all * movements within the state would repel all attempts to invade it from whatever quarter and by * made and would maintain a strict neutrality and preserve the peace of the state and further if necessary he would invoke the assistance of the united states troops to carry out the pledges the only conditions to this proposition made by the governor were that the united states government should undertake to disarm the home guard which it had * organized and armed throughout the state and pledge itself not to occupy with its troops any localities in the state not occupied by them at that time the words of a governor of a state who offered such truly generous terms deserve to be inserted nothing but the most earnest desire to avert the horrors of civil war from our beloved state could have tempted me to propose these humiliating terms they were rejected by the federal officers these demanded not only the disorganization and * of the state militia and the nullification of the military bill but they refused to disarm their own home guard and insisted that the government of the united states should enjoy an unrestricted right to move and station its troops throughout the state whenever and wherever it might in the opinion of its officers be necessary either for the protection of its loyal subjects or for the repelling of invasion and they plainly announced that it was the intention of the administration to take military occupation of the whole state and to reduce it as avowed by general lyon to the exact condition of maryland we have already stated that the revolutionary measures which the united states government had undertaken to enforce involved the subjection of every state either by voluntary submission or subjugation however much a state might desire peace and neutrality its own will could not elect the scheme demanded the absolute sovereignty of the government of the united states or in other words the * of the independence and sovereignty of the state human actions are not only the fruit of the ruling motive but they are also the evidence of the existence of that motive thus when we see the governor of the state of missouri offering such generous terms to the government of the united states in order to preserve peace and neutrality and the latter rejecting them avow its intention to do its will with the authorities the property and the citizens of the state and proceed with military force to do it its actions are both the evidence and the fruit of its theory these measures were revolutionary in the extreme they involved the entire subversion of those principles on which the american union was founded and of the compact or constitution of that union the government of the united states in the hands of those who wielded its authority was made the bloody instrument to establish these usurpations on the ruins of the crushed hopes of mankind for permanent freedom under constitutional government for the * and truthfulness of these allegations i appeal to the impartial and sober judgment of posterity the volunteers who were assembled under this proclamation of governor jackson of june 13th had few arms except their * and * and could scarcely be said to have any military equipments the brigadiergenerals who were appointed were assigned to geographical divisions and with such men as they could collect reported in obedience to their orders at * and lexington on the 20th of june 1861 general lyon and colonel f p blair with an estimated force of seven thousand * troops having eight pieces of artillery ascended the missouri river and * about five miles below * to oppose them the missourians had there about eight hundred men poorly armed without a piece of artillery and but little ammunition with courage which must be commended at the expense of their discretion they resolved to engage the enemy and after a combat of an hour and a half or more retired having inflicted heavy loss upon the enemy and suffering but little themselves this first skirmish between the federal troops and the missouri militia inspired confidence in their fellowcitizens and checked the contemptuous terms in which the militia had been spoken of by the enemy governor jackson with some two hundred and fifty to three hundred of the militia engaged in the action at * started toward the southwestern portion of the state he marched in the direction of a place called cole camp and when within twelve or fifteen miles of it learned that a force of seven hundred to one thousand of the enemy had been sent to that point by general lyon and colonel blair with the view of intercepting his retreat the design however was frustrated by an expedition consisting of about three hundred and fifty men commanded by colonel * who had assembled them in a very few hours in the neighborhood south of the enemys camp there were no pickets out except in the neighborhood of jacksons forces and colonel * surprised the enemy where they were asleep in two large barns the attack was made at daybreak the enemy routed after suffering the heavy loss of two hundred and six killed and more wounded and more than a hundred prisoners three hundred and * muskets with bayonets were captured the missourians lost four killed and fifteen or twenty wounded general price with a view to draw his army from the * of the enemy the missouri river ordered his troops to the southwestern portion of the state the column from lexington marched without transportation without tents or blankets and relied for subsistence on the country through which it passed being in the mean time closely pursued by the enemy the movement was successfully made and a junction effected in cedar county with the forces present with governor jackson the total when assembled was about thirtysix hundred men governor jackson continued his march toward southwestern missouri he had received reliable intelligence that he was pursued by general lyon from the northeast and by lane and sturgis from the northwest their supposed object being to form a junction in his rear and he subsequently learned that a column numbering three thousand had been sent out from st louis to intercept his retreat and had arrived at the town of * immediately in his front these undisciplined poorly armed missourians were therefore in a position which would have appalled less heroic * large hostile force in their rear and another nearly equal in numbers to their own disputing their passage in front they however cheerfully moved forward attacked the enemy in position and after a severe engagement routed him pursued him to a second position from which he was again driven falling back to * where he made his last stand and upon being driven from which as was subsequently ascertained continued his retreat all night the killed and wounded of the enemy left along the route of his retreat over a space of ten miles were estimated at from one hundred and fifty to two hundred killed and from three to four hundred wounded several hundred muskets were captured and the missourians were better prepared for future conflicts our loss was between forty and fifty killed and from one hundred and twentyfive to one hundred and fifty wounded if any shall ask why i have entered into such details of engagements where the forces were comparatively so small and the results so little affected the final issue of the war the reply is that such heroism and selfsacrifice as these undisciplined partially armed * men displayed against superior numbers possessed of all the appliances of war claim special notice as bearing evidence not only of the virtue of the men but the sanctity of the cause which could so inspire them unsupported save by the consciousness of a just cause without other sympathy than that which the confederate states fully gave * the plea of helplessness and defying the threats of a powerful government to crush her missouri without arms or other military preparation took up the gauntlet thrown at her feet and dared to make war in defense of the laws and liberties of her people my motive for promptly removing the seat of government after authority was given by the provisional congress has been heretofore stated but proximity to the main army of the enemy and the flanking attacks by which the new capital was threatened did not diminish the anxiety which had been felt before removal from montgomery in regard to affairs in missouri the far west of the confederacy the state which forty years before had been admitted to the union against sectional resistance to the right guaranteed by the constitution and specifically denominated in the treaty for the acquisition of louisiana now because her governor refused to furnish troops for the unconstitutional purpose of coercing states became the subject of special hostility and the object of extraordinary efforts for her subjugation the little which it would have been possible for the confederacy to do to promote her military efficiency was diminished by the anomalous condition in which the state troops remained until some time in the second year of the war a strange misapprehension led to unreasonable complaints under the supposition that missouri was generally neglected and her favorite officer general price was not accorded a commission corresponding to his merit and the wishes of the people it is due to that gallant soldier and true patriot that it should here be stated that he was not a party to any such complaints knew they were unfounded and realized that his wishes for the defense of missouri were fully * by the executive of the confederacy all of which was manifested in the correspondence between us before missouri had tendered any troops to the confederate states it was his statement of the difficulties and embarrassments which surrounded him that caused me to write to the governor of missouri on the 21st of december 1861 stating to him my anxiety to have the troops of missouri tendered and organized into brigades and divisions so that they might be rendered more effective and we be better able to provide for them by the appointment of general officers and otherwise for a full understanding of the nature and degree of the complaints and embarrassments referred to i here insert my reply to letters sent to me by the hon john b clarke mc of missouri as is usually the case when citizens are called from their ordinary pursuits for the purposes of war the people of missouri did not then realize the value of preparation in camp and were reluctant to * themselves for long periods the state even less than the confederate government could not supply them with the arms munitions and equipage necessary for campaigns and battles and * under all these disadvantages it is a matter of * surprise that they were able to achieve so much the missourians who fought at vicksburg and who after that long trying and disastrous siege asked when in the camp of * prisoners not if they could get a furlough not if they might go home when released but how soon they might hope to be exchanged and resume their places in the line of battle show of what metal the missouri troops were made and of what they were capable when tempered in the fiery furnace of war i can recall few scenes during the war which impressed me more deeply than the spirit of those worn prisoners waiting for the exchange that would again permit them to take the hazards of battle for the cause of their country this memory leads me to recur with regret to my inability in the beginning of the war to convince the governor of missouri of the necessity for thorough organization and the enrollment of men for long terms instead of loose combinations of militia for periods always short and sometimes uncertain general price possessed an extraordinary power to secure the personal attachment of his troops and to inspire them with a confidence which served in no small degree as a substitute for more thorough training his own enthusiasm and entire devotion to the cause he served were infused throughout his followers and made them all their countrys own to lord wellington has been attributed the remark that he did not want zeal in a soldier and to napoleon the * that providence is on the side of the heavy battalions zeal was oftentimes our main dependence and on many a hardfought field served to drive our small battalions like a wedge through the serried ranks of the enemy the confederate states yet in their infancy and themselves engaged in an unequal struggle for existence by act of their congress declared that if missouri was engaged in repelling a lawless invasion of her territory by armed forces it was their right and duty to aid the people and government of said state in resisting such invasion and in securing the means and the opportunity of expressing their will upon all questions affecting their rights and liberties with small means compared to their wants the confederate congress on the 6th of august appropriated one million dollars to aid the people of the state of missouri in the effort to maintain within their own limits the constitutional liberty which it is the purpose of the confederate states in the existing war to vindicate etc in the next battle after that of * which has been noticed missourians were no longer to be alone general * commanding a brigade of confederate troops marched from arkansas to make a junction with general price then threatened with an attack by a large force of the enemy under general lyon which was concentrated near springfield missouri the battle was fiercely contested but finally won by our troops in this action general lyon was killed while gallantly endeavoring to rally his discomfited troops and lead them to the charge while we can not forget the cruel wrongs he had inflicted and sought still further to impose upon an unoffending people we must accord to him the redeeming virtue of courage and recognize his ability as a soldier on this occasion general price exhibited in two instances the magnanimity selfdenial and humanity which ever characterized him general mcculloch claimed the right to command as an officer of the confederate states army general price though he ranked him by a grade replied that he was not fighting for distinction but for the defense of the liberties of his countrymen and that it mattered but little what position he occupied he said he was ready to surrender not only the command but his life as a sacrifice to the cause he surrendered the command and took a subordinate position though he felt assured of victory the second instance was an act of humanity to his bitterest enemy general lyons surgeon came in for his body under a flag of truce after the close of the battle and general price sent it in his own wagon but the enemy in his flight left the body * in springfield the next morning august 11th lieutenantcolonel * * and colonel r h * two members of brigadier general clarkes staff caused the body to be properly prepared for burial after the battle of springfield general mcculloch returned with his brigade to his former position in arkansas john c fremont had been appointed a general and assigned to the command made vacant by the death of general lyon he signalized his entrance upon the duty by a proclamation * the estates and slave property of rebels on the 10th of september when general price was about to go into camp he learned that a detachment of federal troops was marching from lexington to * to seize the funds of the bank in that place and to arrest and plunder the citizens of johnson county in accordance with general * proclamation and instructions general price resumed his march and pressing rapidly forward with his mounted men arrived about daybreak at * where he learned that the enemy had hastily fled about midnight he then decided to move with his whole force against lexington he found the enemy in strong intrenchments and well supplied with artillery the place was stubbornly defended the siege proper commenced on the 18th of september 1861 and with varying fortunes fierce combats continued through that day and the next on the morning of the 20th general price ordered a number of bales of * to be transported to the point from which the advance of his troops had been repeatedly repulsed they were ranged in a line for a breastwork and when rolled before the men as they advanced formed a moving rampart which was proof against shot and only to be overcome by a sortie in force which the enemy did not dare to make on came the * breastworks while prices artillery continued an effective fire in the afternoon of the 20th the enemy hung out a white flag upon which general price ordered a cessation of firing and sent to ascertain the object of the signal the federal forces surrendered as prisoners of war to the number of thirtyfive hundred also seven pieces of artillery over three thousand stand of muskets a considerable number of sabres a valuable supply of ammunition a number of horses a large amount of commissarys stores and other property here were also recovered the great seal of the state and the public records and about nine hundred thousand dollars of which the bank of lexington had been robbed general price caused the money to be at once returned to the bank after the first day of the siege of lexington general price learned that lane and montgomery from kansas with about four thousand men and general sturgis with fifteen hundred cavalry were on the north side of the missouri river advancing to renforce the garrison at lexington at the same time and from the same direction colonel saunders with about twentyfive hundred missourians was coming to the aid of general price general d r * who had long been a united states senator from missouri and at the time of his resignation was president pro * of the senate was sent by general price to meet the command of colonel saunders and hasten them forward he joined them on the north bank of the river and after all but about five hundred had been ferried over general * still remaining with these they were unexpectedly attacked by the force from kansas the ground was densely wooded and partially covered with water the missourians led and cheered by one they had so long and deservedly honored met the assault with such determination and fighting with the skill of * and hunters that they put the enemy to rout pursuing him for a distance of ten miles and inflicting heavy loss upon him while that of the missourians was but five killed and twenty wounded the expedient of the bales of * was a brilliant conception not unlike that which made * the * warrior immortal and gave his name to the northern pillar of hercules the victories in missouri which have been noticed and which so far exceeded what might have been expected from the small forces by which they were achieved had caused an * of the enemys troops to an estimated number of seventy thousand against these the army of general price could not hope successfully to contend he therefore retired toward the southwestern part of the state the want of supplies and transportation compelled him to * a portion of his troops with the rest he continued his retreat to * by proclamation of governor jackson the legislature had assembled at this place and had passed the ordinance of secession if other evidence were wanting the fact that without * aid without a military chest without munitions of war the campaign which has been described had so far been carried on by the voluntary service of the citizens and the * offerings of the people must be conclusive that the ordinance of secession was the expression of the popular will of missouri the forces of missouri again formed a junction with the confederate troops under general mcculloch and together they moved to * in * county in june 1861 brigadiergeneral henry a wise who was well and favorably known to the people of the kanawha valley in his enthusiasm for their defence and confidence in his ability to rally them to resist the threatened invasion of that region offered his services for that purpose with a small command which was to serve as a nucleus to the force he hoped to raise he was sent thither his success was as great as could have been reasonably expected and after the small but brilliant affair on * creek he prepared to give battle to the enemy then advancing up the kanawha valley under general cox but the defeat of our forces at laurel hill which has been already noticed uncovered his right flank and endangered his rear which was open to approach by several roads he therefore fell back to * brigadiergeneral john b floyd had in the mean time raised a brigade in southwestern virginia and advanced to the support of general wise unfortunately there was a want of concert between these two officers which prevented their entire coperation general floyd engaged the enemy in several brilliant skirmishes when he found that his right was threatened by a force which was approaching on that flank with the apparent purpose of crossing the * river at the * ferry so as to strike his line of communication with * he crossed the river with his brigade and a part of wises cavalry leaving that general to check any advance which cox might make general floyds movement was as successful as it was daring he met the enemys forces defeated and dispersed them but the want of coperation between generals wise and floyd prevented a movement against general cox floyd intrenched himself on the * in a position of great natural strength but the small force under his command and the fact that he was separated from that of general wise probably induced general rosecrans commanding the enemys forces in the cheat mountain to advance and assail the position though his numbers were vastly superior the attack was a failure after a heavy loss on the part of the enemy he fell back after nightfall during the night floyd crossed the river and withdrew to the camp of general wise to form a junction of the two forces and together they fell back toward sewells mountain the unfortunate controversy between these officers which had prevented coperation in the past grew more bitter and each complained of the other in terms that left little hope of future harmony and this want of coperation led to confusion and threatened further reverses general loring had succeeded general garnett and was in command of the remnant of the force defeated at laurel hill his headquarters were at valley mountain general r e lee on duty at richmond aiding the president in the general direction of military affairs was now ordered to proceed to western virginia it was hoped that by his military skill and deserved influence over men he would be able to retrieve the disaster we had suffered at laurel hill and by combining all our forces in western virginia on one plan of operations give protection to that portion of our country such renforcement as could be furnished had been sent to valley mountain the headquarters of general loring thither general lee promptly proceeded the duty to which he was assigned was certainly not attractive by the glory to be gained or the ease to be enjoyed but lee made no question as to personal preference and whatever were his wishes they were subordinate to what was believed to be the public interest the season had been one of extraordinary rains rendering the * ordinarily difficult almost impassable with unfaltering purpose and energy he crossed the alleghany mountains and learning that the main encampment of the enemy was in the valley of * river and elk run randolph county he directed his march toward that position the troops under the immediate command of brigadiergeneral h r jackson together with those under brigadiergeneral loring were about thirtyfive hundred men the force of the enemy as far as it could be ascertained was very much greater in the detached work at cheat mountain pass we learned by a * found upon the person of a captured staffofficer that there were three thousand men being but a fraction less than our whole force after a careful reconnaissance and a full conference with general loring lee decided to attack the main encampment of the enemy by a movement of his troops converging upon the valley from three directions the colonel of one of his regiments who had * the position of the works at cheat mountain pass reported that it was feasible to turn it and carry it by assault and he was assigned to that duty general lee ordered other portions of his force to take position on the spurs overlooking the enemys main encampment while he led three regiments to the height below and nearest to the position of the enemy the instructions were that the officer sent to turn the position at cheat mountain pass should approach it at early dawn and immediately open fire which was to be the signal for the concerted attack by the rest of the force it rained heavily during the day and after a toilsome * the force led by general lee wet weary hungry and cold gained their position close to and overlooking the enemys encampment in their march they had surprised and captured the picket without a gun being fired so that no notice had been given of their approach the officer who had been sent to attack the work at cheat mountain pass found on closer examination that he had been mistaken as to the * of taking it by assault and that the heavy abatis which covered it was advanced beyond the range of his rifles not having understood that his firing was to be the signal for the general attack and should therefore be opened whether it would be effective or not he withdrew without firing a musket the height occupied by general lee was shrouded in fog and as morning had dawned without the expected signal he concluded that some mishap had befallen the force which was to make it by a tortuous path he went down the side of the mountain low enough to have a distinct view of the camp he saw the men unconscious of the near presence of an enemy engaged in cleaning their arms cooking and other morning occupations then returning to his command he explained to his senior officers what he had seen and expressed his belief that though the plan of attack had failed the troops there with him could surprise and capture the camp the officers withdrew conferred with their men and reported to the general that the troops were not in condition for the enterprise as the fog was then lifting and they would soon be revealed to the enemy below whose numbers were vastly superior to his own he withdrew his command by the route they had come and without observation returned to his camp beyond some skirmishes with outposts and reconnoitering parties our troops had not been engaged and in these affairs our reported loss was comparatively small colonel john a washington aidedecamp of general lee was killed while making a reconnaissance by a party in * the loss of this valuable and accomplished officer was much regretted by his general and all others who knew him the report that rosecrans and cox had united their commands and were advancing upon wise and floyd caused general lee to move at once to their support he found general floyd at meadow bluff and general wise at * mountain the latter position being very favorable for defense the troops were concentrated there to await the threatened attack by rosecrans who advanced and took position in sight of general lees intrenched camp and having remained there for more than a week withdrew in the night without attempting the expected attack the weak condition of his * and the bad state of the roads made worse by the retiring army prevented general lee from attempting to pursue and the approach of winter always rigorous in that * closed the campaign with a small but brilliant action in which general h r jackson repelled an attack of a greatly superior force inflicting severe loss on the assailants and losing but six of his own command with the close of active operations general lee returned to richmond and though subjected to * criticism by the * who make campaigns on assumed * he with characteristic selfabnegation made no defense of himself not even presenting an official report of his * in the cheat mountain but * he stated to me the facts which have formed the basis of this sketch my estimate of general lee my confidence in his ability zeal and fidelity rested on a foundation not to be shaken by such criticism as i have noticed i had no more doubt then than after his fame had been securely established that whenever he had the opportunity to prove his worth he would secure public appreciation therefore as affairs on the coast of south carolina and georgia were in an unsatisfactory condition he was directed to go there and take such measures for the defense particularly of savannah and charleston as he should find needful lest the newspaper attack should have created unjust and unfavorable impressions in regard to him i thought it desirable to write to governor pickens and tell him what manner of man he was who had been sent to south carolina after the withdrawal of the confederate army from fairfax courthouse and the positions which had been occupied in front of that place a movement was made by the enemy to cross the potomac near leesburg where we had under the command of brigadier general n s evans of south carolina four regiments of infantry ie the thirteenth seventeenth and eighteenth mississippi and the eighth virginia commanded respectively by colonels barksdale * * and hunton a small detachment of cavalry under lieutenantcolonel * and some pieces of artillery on the 21st of october the enemy commenced crossing the river at edwardss ferry a brigade was thrown over and met by the thirteenth mississippi which held them in check at the point of crossing in the mean time another brigade was thrown over at balls bluff and as troops continued to cross at that point where the eighth virginia had engaged them general evans ordered up the seventeenth and eighteenth mississippi and the three regiments made such an impetuous attack as to drive back the enemy to the bluff and their leader colonel baker having fallen a panic seemed to seize the command so that they rushed headlong down the bluff and crowded into the flatboats which were their means of transportation in such numbers that they were sunk and many of the foe were drowned in their attempt to swim the river the loss of the enemy prisoners included exceeded the number of our troops in the action the confederate loss was reported to be thirtysix killed one hundred and seventeen wounded and two captured total one hundred and fiftyfive among the killed was the gallant colonel * a * citizen of mississippi where he had held high civil station and where his death was long deplored it has been shown that the southern states by their representatives in the two houses of congress consistently endeavored even to the last day when they were by their constituents permitted to remain in the halls of federal legislation to maintain the constitution and preserve the union which the states had by their independent action ordained and established on the other hand proof has been adduced to show that the northern states by a majority of their representatives in the congress had persisted in agitation injurious to the welfare and tranquillity of the southern states and at the last moment had refused to make any concessions or to offer any guarantees to check the current toward secession of the complaining states whose love for the union rendered them willing to accept less than justice should have readily accorded the issue was then presented between submission to empire of the north or the severance of those ties consecrated by many memories and strengthened by those habits which render every people reluctant to sever * associations the authorities heretofore cited have i must believe * shown that the question of changing their government was one that the states had the power to decide by virtue of the unalienable right announced in the declaration of independence and which had been proudly denominated the american idea of government the hope and the wish of the people of the south were that the disagreeable necessity of separation would be peacefully met and be followed by such commercial regulations as would least disturb the prosperity and future intercourse of the separated states every step taken by the confederate government was directed toward that end the separation of the states having been decided on it was sought to effect it in such manner as would be just to the parties concerned and preserve as far as possible under separate governments the fraternal and mutually beneficial relations which had existed between the states when united and which it was the object of their compact of union to secure to all the proofs heretofore offered i confidently refer for the establishment of the fact that whatever of bloodshed of devastation or shock to republican government has resulted from the war is to be charged to the northern states the invasions of the southern states for purposes of coercion were in violation of the written constitution and the attempt to subjugate sovereign states under the pretext of preserving the union was alike offensive to law to good morals and the proper use of language the union was the voluntary junction of free and independent states to subjugate any of them was to destroy constituent parts and necessarily therefore must be the destruction of the union itself that the southern states were satisfied with a federal government such as their fathers had formed was shown by their adoption of a constitution so little differing from the instrument of 1787 it was against the violations of that instrument and usurpations offensive to their pride and injurious to their interests that they remonstrated argued and finally appealed to the inherent undelegated power of the states to judge of their wrongs and of the mode and measure of redress after many years of fruitless effort to secure from their northern associates a faithful observance of the compact of union after its conditions had been deliberately and persistently broken and the signs of the times indicated further and more ruthless violations of their rights as equals in the union the southern states preferring a peaceful separation to continuance in a hostile union decided to exercise their sovereign right to withdraw from an association which had failed to answer the ends for which it was formed it has been shown how they endeavored to effect the change with strict regard to the principles controlling a dissolution of partnership and how earnestly they desired to remain in friendly relations to the northern states and how all their overtures were rejected when they pleaded for peace the united states government * delayed to answer while making ready for war to the calm judgment of mankind is submitted the question who was responsible for the war between the states virginia whose history from the beginning of the revolution of 1776 had been a long course of sacrifices for the benefit of her sister states and for the preservation of the union she had mainly contributed to establish clung to it with the devotion of a mother it has been shown how her efforts to check dissolution were persisted in when the aggrieved were hopeless and the * reckless and how her * were rejected in the peace congress which on her motion had been assembled sorrowing over the failure of this her blessed though unsuccessful attempt to preserve the union of the constitution she was not permitted to mourn as a neutral but was required by the united states government to choose between furnishing troops to subjugate her southern sisters or the * of the grants she had made to the federal government when she became a member of the union the first was a violation of the letter and the spirit of the constitution the second was a reserved right the voice of henry called to her from the ground the spirits of washington and jefferson moved among her people there was but one course consistent with her stainless reputation and * tenets as to the liberties of her people which she could have adopted as in 1776 reluctantly she bowed to the necessity of separation from the crown so in 1861 the ordinance of secession was adopted having exhausted all other means she took the last resort and if for this she was selected as the first object of assault * the punishment * the offense the large resources and full preparation of the united states government enabled it to girt virginia as with a wall of fire it has been shown that she was threatened from the east from the north and from the west the capital of the state and of the confederacy richmond was the objective point and on this the march of three columns concentrated on the east the advance of the enemy was on several occasions feasible when we consider the number of his forces at and about fortress monroe in comparison with the small means retained for the defense of the capital on the north the most formidable army of the enemy was assembled to oppose it we had the comparatively small army of the potomac this being regarded as the line on which the greatest danger was apprehended our efforts were mostly directed toward giving it the requisite strength troops as rapidly as they could be raised and armed were sent forward for that purpose from the beginning to the close of the war we mainly relied for the defense of the capital on its aged citizens boys too young for service and the civil employees of the executive departments on several occasions these were called out to resist an attack they answered with alacrity and always bore themselves gallantly more than once repelling the enemy in the open field had it been practicable to do so it would surely have been proper to keep a large force in reserve for the defense of the capital so often and * proclaimed to be the object of the enemys campaign perhaps the propriety of such provision gave currency and credence to rumors that we had a large force at richmond this even led to the application for a detachment from it to renforce our army of the potomac which caused me to write to general j e johnston at manassas virginia on september 5 1861 as follows then there and everywhere our difficulty was the want of arms and munitions of war lamentable cries came to us from the west for the supplies which would enable patriotic citizens to defend their homes the resource upon which the people had so confidently relied the private arms in the hands of citizens proved a sad delusion and elsewhere it has been shown how deficient we were in ammunition or the means of providing it the simple fact was the country had gone to war without counting the cost undue elation over our victory at manassas was followed by dissatisfaction at what was termed the failure to reap the fruits of victory and rumors for which there could be no better excuse than partisan zeal were circulated that the heroes of the hour were prevented from reaping the fruits of the victory by the interference of the president naturally there followed another rumor that the inaction of the victorious army to which renforcements continued to be sent was due to the policy of the president and he also was held responsible and with more apparent justice for the failure to organize the troops of the several states as the law contemplated into brigades and divisions composed of the soldiers of each though these unjust criticisms weakened the power of the government to meet its present and provide for its future necessities i bore them in silence lest to vindicate myself should injure the public service by turning the public censure to the generals on whom the hopes of the country rested that motive no longer exists and to justify the faith of those who without a defense continued to uphold my hands i propose to set forth the facts by correspondence and otherwise so far as in doing this blame shall be transferred from me to others it will be the incident not the design as it would be most gratifying to me only to notice for praise each and all who wore the gray the fiction of my having prevented the pursuit of the enemy after the victory of manassas was exploded after it had acquired an authoritative and * form in the manner and for the reasons heretofore set forth it only remains therefore to notice the other points indicated above first the organization of the army disease and discontent are known to be the attendants of armies lying * in camps especially as in our case when the troops were composed of citizens called from their homes under the idea of a pressing necessity and with the hope of soon returning to them our citizen soldiers were a powerful political element and their correspondence finding its way to the people through the press and to the halls of congress by direct communication with the members was felt by its influence both upon public opinion and general legislation members of congress and notably the vicepresident contended that men should be allowed to go home and attend to their private affairs while there were no active operations and that there was no doubt but that they would return whenever there was to be a battle the experience of war soon taught our people the absurdity of such ideas and before its close probably none would have uttered them there were very many men out of the army who were anxious to enter it but for whom we had not arms this gave rise to the remark more humorous than profound that we stood around the camps with clubs to keep one set in and an other set out had this been true it was certainly justifiable to refuse to exchange a trained man for a recruit all who have seen service know that one old soldier is in campaign equal to several who have everything of military life to learn a marked characteristic of the southern people was individuality and time was needful to teach them that the terrible machine a disciplined army must be made of men who had surrendered their freedom of will the most distinguished of our citizens were not the slowest to learn the lesson and perhaps no army ever more thoroughly knew it than did that which lee led into pennsylvania and none ever had a leader who in his own conduct better illustrated the lesson our largest army in 1861 was that of the potomac it had been formed by the junction of the forces under general j e johnston with those under general p g t beauregard with such additions as could be hurriedly sent forward to meet the enemy on the field of manassas they were combined into brigades and divisions as pressing exigencies required by the act of february 28 1861 the president was authorized to receive companies battalions and regiments to form a part of the provisional army of the confederate states and with the advice and consent of congress to appoint general officers for them and by the act of march 6th the president was to * the staff and general officers among the respective states from which the volunteers were received it will thus be seen that the states generously surrendered their right to preserve for those volunteers the character of state troops and to appoint general officers when furnishing a sufficient number of regiments to require such grade for their command but in giving their volunteers to form the provisional army of the confederacy it was distinctly suggested that the general officers should be so appointed as to make a just apportionment among the states furnishing the troops during the repose which followed the battle of manassas it was deemed proper that the regiments of the different states should be assembled in brigades together and as far as consistent with the public service that the spirit of the law should be complied with by the assignment of brigadiergenerals of the same state from which the troops were drawn instructions to that end were therefore given and again and again repeated but were for a long time only partially complied with until the delay formed the basis of the argument that those who had by association become thoroughly acquainted would more advantageously be left united in the mean time frequent complaints came to me from the army of unjust discrimination the law being executed in regard to the troops of some states but not of others and of serious discontent arising therefrom the duty to obey the law was imperative and neither the executive nor the officers of the army had any right to question its propriety i however considered the policy of that law wise and was not surprised when it was stated to me that the persistent obstruction to its execution was * the spirit to volunteer in places to which complaints of such supposed favoritism had been transmitted about the 1st of october at the request of general johnston i went to his headquarters at fairfax courthouse for the purpose of conference at the time of this visit to the army the attention of the general officers who then met me in conference was called to the obligation created by law to organize the troops when the numbers tendered by any state permitted it into brigades and divisions composed of the regiments battalions or companies of such state and to assign general and staff officers in the ratio of the troops thus received after my return to the capital the importance of the subject weighed so heavily upon me as to lead to correspondence with the generals which will be best understood by the following extracts from my letters to * are here appended on the 26th of may general johnstons attention was again called to the organization of the ten mississippi regiments into two brigades and was reminded that the proposition had been made to him in the previous autumn with an expression of my confidence that the regiments would be more effective in battle if thus associated i will now proceed to notice the allegation that i was responsible for inaction by the army of the potomac in the latter part of 1861 and in the early part of 1862 after the explosion of the fallacy that i had prevented the pursuit of the enemy from manassas in july 1861 my assailants have sought to cover their exposure by a change of time and place * their story at fairfax courthouse and dating it in the autumn of 1861 when at that time and place i met general johnston for conference he called in the two generals next in rank to himself beauregard and g w smith the question for consideration was what course should be adopted for the future action of the army and the preliminary inquiry by me was as to the number of the troops there assembled to my surprise and disappointment the effective strength was stated to be but little greater than when it fought the battle of the 21st of the preceding july the frequent renforcements which had been sent to that army in nowise prepared me for such an announcement to my inquiry as to what force would be required for the contemplated advance into maryland the lowest estimate made by any of them was about twice the number there present for duty how little i was prepared for such a condition of things will be realized from the fact that previous suggestions by the generals in regard to a purpose to advance into maryland had induced me when i went to that conference to take with me some drawings made by the veteran soldier and engineer colonel * of the falls of the potomac to show the feasibility of crossing the river at that point very little knowledge of the condition and military resources of the country must have sufficed to show that i had no power to make such an addition to that army without a total disregard of the safety of other threatened positions it only remained for me to answer that i had not power to furnish such a number of troops and unless the militia bearing their private arms should be relied on we could not possibly fulfill such a requisition until after the receipt of the smallarms which we had early and constantly striven to procure from abroad and had for some time expected after i had written the foregoing and all the succeeding chapters on kindred subjects a friend in october 1880 furnished me with a copy of a paper relating to the conference at fairfax courthouse which seems to require notice at my hands therefore i break the chain of events to insert here some remarks in regard to it the paper appears to have been written by general g w smith and to have received the approval of generals beauregard and j e johnston and to bear date the 31st of january 1862 it does not agree in some respects with my memory of what occurred and is not consistent with itself it was not necessary that i should learn in that interview the evil of inactivity my correspondence of * date might have shown that i was fully aware of it and my suggestions in the interview certainly did not look as if it was necessary to impress me with the advantage of action in one part of the paper it is stated that the renforcements asked for were to be seasoned soldiers such as were there present and who were said to be in the finest fighting condition this if such a proposition had been made would have exposed its absurdity as well as the * it offered for escape by subsequently asserting that the troops furnished were not up to the proposed standard in another part of the paper it is stated that there were hope and expectation that before the end of the winter arms would be introduced into the country and that then we could successfully invade that of the enemy but this supply of arms however abundant could not furnish seasoned soldiers and the two propositions are therefore inconsistent in one place it is written that it was felt it might be better to run the risk of almost certain destruction fighting upon the other side of the potomac rather than see the gradual dying out and deterioration of this army during a winter etc but when it was proposed to cross into eastern maryland on a steamer in our possession for a partial campaign difficulties arose like the lion in the path of the * so that the proposition was postponed and never executed in like manner the other expedition in the valley of virginia was achieved by an officer not of this council general t j jackson in one place it is written that the president stated at that time no renforcements could be furnished to the army of the character asked for in another place he is made to say he could not take any troops from the points named and without arms from abroad could not renforce that army here again it is clear from the answer that the proposition had been for such renforcement as additional arms would enable him to give those arms he expected to receive barring the dangers of the sea and of the enemy which obstacles alone prevented the positive assurance that they would be received at all it was as stated with deep regret and bitter disappointment that i found notwithstanding our diligent efforts to renforce this army before and after the battle of manassas that its strength had but little increased and that the arms of absentees and discharged men were represented by only twentyfive hundred on hand i can not suppose that general johnston could have noticed the statement that his request for conference had set forth the object of it to be to discuss the question of renforcement he would have known that in richmond where all the returns were to be found any consideration of renforcement by the withdrawal of troops from existing garrisons could best be decided very little experience or a fair amount of modesty without any experience would serve to prevent one from announcing his conclusion that troops could be withdrawn from a place or places without knowing how many were there and what was the necessity for their presence i was at the conference by request the confidence felt in those officers is shown by the fact that i met them alone and did not require any minutes to be made of the meeting about four months afterward a paper was prepared to make a record of the conversation the fact was concealed from me whereas both for accuracy and frankness it should have been submitted to me even if there had been nothing due to our official relations twenty years after the event i learned of this secret report by one party without notice having been given to the other of a conversation said to have lasted two hours i have noticed the * and inconsistencies of the paper and without remark i submit to honorable men the concealment from me in which it was prepared whereby they may judge of the chances for such * as needs must exist between the executive and the commanders of armies to insure * success the position at fairfax courthouse though it would answer very well as a point from which to advance was quite unfavorable for defense and when i so remarked the opinion seemed to be that to which the generals had previously arrived it therefore only remained to consider what change of position should be made in the event of the enemy threatening soon to advance but in the mean time i hoped that something could be done by detachments from the army to effect objects less difficult than an advance against his main force and particularly indicated the lower part of maryland where a small force was said to be * the country and * our friends this i thought might be feasible by the establishment of a battery near to acquia creek where the channel of the potomac was said to be so narrow that our guns could prevent the use of the river by the enemys boats and by employing a steamboat lying there troops enough could be sent over some night to defeat that force and return before any large body could be concentrated against them the effect of the battery and of the expedition it was hoped would be important in relieving our friends and securing recruits from those who wished to join us previously general johnstons attention had been called to possibilities in the valley of the shenandoah and that these and other like things were not done was surely due to other causes than the policy of the administration as will appear by the letters hereto annexed from the correspondence which occurred after the conference at fairfax courthouse i select a reply made to general smith who had written to me in advocacy of the views he had then expressed about large renforcements to the army of the potomac for an advance into maryland nothing is more common than that a general realizing the wants of the army with which he is serving and the ends that might be achieved if those wants were supplied should overlook the necessities of others and accept rumors of large forces which do not exist and assume the absence of danger elsewhere than in his own front in november 1861 reports became current that the enemy were concentrating troops west of the valley of the shenandoah with a view to a descent upon it that vigilant enterprising and patriotic soldier general t j jackson whose steadiness under fire at the first battle of manassas had procured for him the sobriquet of stonewall was then on duty as district commander of the shenandoah valley he was a west virginian and though he had not acquired the fame which subsequently shed such luster upon his name he possessed a * confidence among the people of that region ever watchful and daring in the discharge of any duty he was intensely anxious to guard his beloved mountains of virginia this stimulating his devotion to the general welfare of the confederacy induced him to desire to march against the enemy who had captured romney on the 20th of november 1861 he wrote to the war department proposing an expedition to romney in western virginia it was decided to adopt his proposition endorsed by the commander of the department and further to insure success though not recommended in the endorsement his old brigade then in the army of the potomac was selected as a part of the command with which he was to make the campaign general johnston remonstrated against this transfer and the correspondence is * for a fuller understanding of the matter after general jackson commenced his march the cold became unexpectedly severe and as he ascended into the mountainous region the slopes were covered with ice which impeded his progress the more because his horses were * but his tenacity of purpose fidelity and daring too well known to need commendation triumphed over every obstacle and he attained his object drove the enemy from romney and its surroundings took possession of the place and prevented the threatened concentration having accomplished this purpose and being assured that the enemy had abandoned that section of country he returned with his old brigade to the valley of the shenandoah leaving the balance of his command at romney general loring the senior officer there present and many others of the command so left appealed to the war department to be withdrawn their arguments were as well as i remember these that the troops being from the south were unaccustomed to and unprepared for the * of a mountain winter that they were strangers to the people of that section that the position had no military strength and at the approach of spring would be accessible to the enemy by roads leading from various quarters after some preliminary action an order was issued from the war office directing the troops to retire to the valley as that order has been the subject of no little complaint both by civil and military functionaries my letter to the general commanding the department in explanation of the act of the secretary of war is hereto annexed to complaints by general johnston that the discipline of his army was interfered with by irregular action of the secretary of war and its numerical strength diminished by furloughs granted directly by the war department i replied after making inquiry at the war office by a letter a copy of which is hereto annexed a fortnight after this letter i received from general johnston notice that his position was considered unsafe many of his letters to me have been lost and i have thus far not been able to find the one giving the notice referred to but the reply which is annexed clearly indicates the substance of the letter which was answered at the conference at fairfax courthouse heretofore referred to i was sadly disappointed to find that the strength of that army had been little increased notwithstanding the renforcements sent to it since the 21st of july and that to make an advance the generals required an additional force which it was utterly impracticable for me to supply soon thereafter the army withdrew to centreville a better position for defense but not for attack and thereby suggestive of the abandonment of an intention to advance the subsequent correspondence with general johnston during the winter expressed an expectation that the enemy would resume the offensive and that the position then held was * unfavorable there was a general apprehension at richmond that the northern frontier of virginia would be abandoned and a corresponding earnestness was exhibited to raise the requisite force to enable our army to take the offensive on the 10th of march i telegraphed to general johnston further assurance given to me this day that you shall be promptly and adequately renforced so as to enable you to maintain your position and resume first policy when the roads will permit the first policy was to carry the war beyond our own border five days thereafter i received notice that our army was in retreat and replied as follows on the same day i sent the following telegram to further inquiry from general johnston as to where he should take position i replied that i would go to his headquarters in the field and found him on the south bank of the river to which he had retired in a position possessing great natural advantages an elevated bank commanded the north side of the river overlooking the bridge and an open field beyond it across which the enemy must pass to reach the bridge which if left standing was an invitation to seek that crossing upon inquiring whether the south bank of the river continued to command the other side down to fredericksburg general johnston answered that he did not know that he had not been at fredericksburg since he passed there in a stage on his way to west point when he was first appointed a cadet i then proposed that we should go to fredericksburg to inform ourselves upon that point on arriving at fredericksburg a reconnaissance soon manifested that the hills on the opposite side commanded the town and adjacent riverbank and therefore fredericksburg could only be defended by an army occupying the opposite hills for which our force was inadequate in returning to the house of mr barton where i was a guest i found a number of ladies had assembled there to welcome me and who with anxiety inquired as to the result of our reconnaissance upon learning that the town was not considered defensible against an enemy occupying the heights on the other side and that our force was not sufficient to hold those heights against such an attack as might be anticipated the general answer was with a selfsacrificing patriotism too much admired to be forgotten if the good of our cause requires the defense of the town to be abandoned let it be done the purposes of the enemy were then unknown to us if general johnstons expectation of a hostile advance in great force should be realized our course must depend partly upon receiving the renforcement we had reason to expect from promises previously given and renewed as was announced to general johnston in my telegram of 10th of march 1862 in these words no immediate decision could therefore be made and i returned to richmond to wait the further development of the enemys plans and to prepare as best we might to counteract them the feeling heretofore noticed as arousing in virginia a determination to resist the abandonment of her northern frontier and which caused the assurance of renforcements bore fruit in the addition of about thirty thousand men by a draft made by the governor of the state these it is true were not the disciplined seasoned troops which were asked for by the generals in the conference at fairfax courthouse but they were of such men as often during the war won battles for the confederacy the development of the enemys plans for which we had to wait proved that instead of advancing in force against our position at centreville he had before the retreat of our army commenced decided to move down the potomac for a campaign against richmond from the peninsula as a base the conflagration at centreville gave notice of its evacuation and an advance was made as far as manassas but as appears by general mcclellans report with no more important design than to attack our rear guard if it should be encountered in the report on the conduct of the war by a committee of the united states congress evidence is found of much vacillation before the conclusion was finally reached of abandoning the idea of a direct advance upon richmond for that of concentrating their army at the mouth of the chesapeake whatever doubt or apprehension continued to exist about * the city of washington by removing their main army from before it was of course dispelled by the retreat of our army and the burning of bridges behind it in this * fact general mcclellan says he found the strongest reason to believe that there was no immediate danger of our army returning there was an apparent advantage to the enemy in the new base for his operations which was sufficiently illustrated by the events of the last year of the war had we possessed an army as large as the enemy supposed it would have been possible for us at the same time to check his advance from the east and to march against his capital with fair prospect of capturing it before the army he had sent against yorktown could have been brought back for the defense of washington on this as on other occasions he greatly magnified the force we possessed and on this as on other occasions it required the concentration of our troops successfully to resist a detachment of his accepting as a necessity the withdrawal of the main portion of our army from northern virginia to meet the invasion from the seaboard it was regretted that earlier and more effective means were not employed for the * of the army a desirable measure in either contingency of advance or retreat or at the least that the withdrawal was not so deliberate as to secure the removal of our ordnance subsistence and quartermasters stores which had been collected on the line occupied in 1861 and the early part of 1862 a distinguished officer of our army who has since the war made valuable contributions to the history of its * valuable as well for their accuracy as for their freedom from personal or partisan * thus of the retreat from centreville the same * the value of his opinion will be recognized by all who know him wherefore i give his name general j a * a communication subsequent to that from which i have just quoted writes in regard to the loss of supplies the enemys plans the development of which as has been already stated was necessary for the determination of our own movements were soon thereafter found to be the invasion of virginia from the seaboard and the principal portion of our army was consequently ordered to the peninsula between the york river and the james thus the northern frontier of virginia which in the first year of the war had been the main field of skirmishes combats and battles of advance and retreat and the occupation and evacuation of fortified positions ceased for a time to tremble beneath the tread of contending armies to the foregoing narration of events immediately connected with the efforts of the confederate government to maintain its existence at home may here be properly added an incident bearing on its foreign relations in the first year of the war our efforts for the recognition of the confederate states by the european powers in 1861 served to make us better known abroad to awaken a kindly feeling in our favor and cause a respectful regard for the effort we were making to maintain the independence of the states which great britain had recognized and her people knew to be our birthright on the 8th of november 1861 an outrage was perpetrated by an armed vessel of the united states in the forcible detention on the * of a british mail steamer making one of her regular trips from one british port to another and the seizure on that unarmed vessel of our commissioners mason and slidell who with their secretaries were bound for europe on diplomatic service the seizure was made by an armed force against the protest of the captain of the vessel and of commander williams * the latter speaking as the representative of her majestys government the commissioners only yielded when force which they could not resist was used to remove them from the * and convey them to the united states vessel of war this outrage was the more marked because the united states had been foremost in resisting the right of visit and search and had made it the cause of the war of 1812 with great britain when intelligence of the event was received in england it excited the greatest indignation among the people and her majestys government by naval and other preparations unmistakably exhibited the purpose to redress the wrong the commissioners and their secretaries had been transported to the harbor of boston and imprisoned in its main fortress diplomatic correspondence resulted from this event the british government demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the commissioners in order that they may again be placed under british protection and a suitable apology for the aggression which has been committed in the mean time captain * commander of the vessel which had made the visit and search of the trent returned to the united states and was received with general * both by the people and the government the house of representatives passed a vote of thanks an honor not heretofore bestowed except for some deed deserving well of the country in the midst of all this exultation at the seizure of our commissioners on board of a british * came the indignant and stern demand for the restoration of those commissioners to the british protection from which they had been taken and an apology for the aggression it was little to be expected after such explicit commendation of the act that the united states government would accede to the demand and therefore the war and navy departments of the british government made active and extensive provision to enforce it the haughty temper displayed toward four gentlemen arrested on an unarmed ship subsided in view of a demand to be enforced by the army and navy of great britain and the united states secretary of state after a * and ingenious reply to the minister of great britain at washington city wrote the four persons in question are now held in military custody at fort warren in the state of massachusetts they will be cheerfully liberated your * will please indicate a time and place for receiving them there was a time when the government and the people of the united states would not have sanctioned such aggression on the right of friendly ships to pass unquestioned on the high way of nations and the right of a neutral flag to protect everything not contraband of war but that was a time when arrogance and duplicity had not led them into false positions and when the roar of the british lion could not make americans retract what they had deliberately avowed at the beginning of the war the arms within the limits of the confederacy were distributed as follows there were at richmond about sixty thousand old * and at baton rouge about ten thousand old halls rifles and carbines at little rock arkansas there were a few thousand stands and a few at the texas arsenal increasing the aggregate of serviceable arms to about one hundred and * thousand add to these the arms owned by the several states and by military organizations and it would make a total of one hundred and fifty thousand for the use of the armies of the confederacy the rifles were of the caliber # known as mississippi rifles except those at richmond taken from harpers ferry which were of the * caliber # the muskets were the old flint lock caliber # altered to * there were a few boxes of * at each arsenal and some short * a few hundred * were scattered about there were no revolvers there was before the war little powder or ammunition of any kind stored in the southern states and this was a relic of the war with mexico it is doubtful if there were a million of rounds of smallarms cartridges the chief store of powder was that captured at norfolk there was besides a small quantity at each of the southern arsenals in all sixty thousand pounds chiefly old * the * did not exceed one quarter of a million and there was no lead on hand there were no batteries of serviceable fieldartillery at the arsenals but a few old iron guns mounted on * carriages * about 1812 the states and the volunteer companies did however possess some serviceable batteries but there were neither harness saddles bridles blankets nor other artillery or cavalry equipments to furnish one hundred and fifty thousand men on both sides of the mississippi in may 1861 there were no infantry accoutrements no cavalry arms or equipments no artillery and above all no ammunition nothing save arms and these almost wholly the old pattern smoothbore muskets altered to * from flint locks within the limits of the confederate states the arsenals had been used only as depots and no one of them except that at fayetteville north carolina had a single machine above the grade of a * except at harpers ferry armory all the work of preparation of material had been carried on at the north not an arm not a gun not a * and except during the mexican war scarcely a round of ammunition had for fifty years been prepared in the confederate states there were consequently no workmen or very few skilled in these arts powder save perhaps for * had not been made at the south no saltpeter was in store at any southern point it was stored wholly at the north there were no worked mines of lead except in virginia and the situation of those made them a precarious dependence the only * existing was at richmond copper so necessary for fieldartillery and for * was just being obtained in east tennessee there was no * for * south of richmond and but few * and these with trifling exceptions were in the border states of virginia and tennessee the first efforts made to obtain powder were by orders sent to the north which had been early done both by the confederate government and by some of the states these were being rapidly filled when the attack was made on fort sumter the * then ceased niter was contemporaneously sought for in north alabama and tennessee between four and five hundred tons of sulphur were obtained in new orleans at which place it had been imported for use in the manufacture of sugar preparations for the construction of a large powdermill were promptly commenced by the government and two small private mills in east tennessee were * and improved on june 1 1861 there was probably two hundred and fifty thousand pounds only chiefly of * and about as much niter which had been imported by georgia there were the two powdermills above mentioned but we had no experience in making powder or in extracting niter from natural * or in obtaining it by artificial beds for the supply of arms an agent was sent to europe who made contracts to the extent of nearly half a million dollars some smallarms had been obtained from the north and also important machinery the machinery at harpers ferry armory had been saved from the flames by the heroic conduct of the operatives headed by mr armistead m ball the master armorer of the machinery so saved that for making * was transported to richmond and that for rifles with * to fayetteville north carolina in addition to the injuries suffered by the machinery the lack of skilled workmen caused much embarrassment in the mean time the manufacture of smallarms was undertaken at new orleans and prosecuted with energy though with limited success in fieldartillery the manufacture was confined almost entirely to the * works in richmond some * were made in new orleans and attention was turned to the manufacture of field and siege artillery at nashville a small * at rome georgia was induced to undertake the casting of the threeinch iron rifle but the progress was very slow the state of virginia possessed a number of old * iron guns which were * out to get a good bore and rifled with three * after the manner of parrott the army at harpers ferry and that at manassas were supplied with old batteries of * guns and * howitzers a few parrott guns purchased by the state of virginia were with general magruder at big bethel for the ammunition and equipment required for the infantry and artillery a good laboratory and workshop had been established at richmond the arsenals were making preparations for furnishing ammunition and knapsacks but generally what little was done in this regard was for local purposes such was the general condition of ordnance and ordnance stores in may 1861 the progress of development however was steady a * of saltpeter was established near nashville during the summer which received the niter from its vicinity and from the caves in east and middle tennessee some inferior powder was made at two small mills in south carolina north carolina established a mill near raleigh and a * was put up near new orleans and powder made there before the fall of the city small quantities were also received through the blockade it was estimated that on january 1 1862 there were fifteen hundred * of various caliber in position from * on the potomac to fort brown on the rio grande if their caliber was * at thirtytwo * and the charge at five pounds it would at forty rounds per gun require six hundred thousand pounds of powder for them the * three hundred guns with two hundred rounds to the * require one hundred and twentyfive thousand pounds and the * * ten * consume one hundred and twentyfive thousand pounds more making in all eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds deducting two hundred and fifty thousand pounds supposed to be on hand in various shapes and the * is six hundred thousand pounds for the year 1861 of this perhaps two hundred thousand pounds had been made at the tennessee and other mills leaving four hundred thousand pounds to be supplied through the blockade or before the beginning of hostilities the * of powder to * in damp * results from the * of the niter used in its manufacture and this it is not possible to detect by any of the usual * security therefore in the purchase depends on the * of the maker to us who had to rely on foreign products and the open market this was equivalent to no security at all it was therefore as well for this reason as because of the * of thus obtaining the requisite supply necessary that we should establish a government powdermill it was our good fortune to have a valuable man whose military education and scientific knowledge had been supplemented by practical experience in a large manufactory of machinery he general g w rains was at the time resident in the state of new york but when his native state north carolina seceded from the union and joined the confederacy true to the highest instincts of patriotism he returned to the land of his birth and only asked where he could be most useful the expectations which his reputation justified caused him to be assigned to the task of making a great powdermill which should alike furnish an adequate supply and give assurance of its possessing all the requisite qualities this problem which under the existing circumstances seemed barely possible was fully solved not only was powder made of every variety of grain and exact uniformity in each but the niter was so absolutely purified that there was no danger of its deterioration in service had admiral semmes been supplied with such powder it is demonstrated by the facts which have since been established that the engagement between the alabama and the * would have resulted in a victory for the former these government powdermills were located at augusta georgia and satisfactory progress was made in the construction during the year all the machinery including the very heavy * was made in the confederate states contracts were made abroad for the delivery of niter through the blockade and for obtaining it immediately we resorted to caves * cellars etc the amount delivered from tennessee was the largest item in the years supply but the whole was quite inadequate to existing and prospective needs the consumption of lead was mainly met by the virginia * at * the yield from which was from sixty to eighty thousand pounds per month lead was also collected by agents in considerable quantities throughout the country and the battlefield of manassas was closely gleaned from which much lead was collected a laboratory for the * of other * was constructed at petersburg virginia and was in operation before midsummer of 1862 by the close of 1861 eight arsenals and four depots had been supplied with materials and machinery so as to be efficient in producing the various munitions and equipments the want of which had caused early embarrassment thus a good deal had been done to produce the needed material of war and to refute the croakers who found in our poverty application for the maxim ex * * fit the troops were however still very poorly armed and equipped the old smoothbore musket was the principal weapon of the infantry the artillery had mostly the * gun and the * * and the cavalry were armed with such various weapons as they could * * revolvers * carbines * short * rifles * carbines muskets cut off etc equipments were in many cases made of stout cotton domestic stitched in triple folds and covered with paint or rubber varnish but poor as were the arms enough of them such as they were could not be obtained to arm the troops pressing forward to defend their homes and their political rights in december 1861 arms purchased abroad began to come in and a good many * rifles were in the hands of the troops at the battle of shiloh the winter of 1862 was the period when our ordnance deficiencies were most keenly felt powder was called for on every hand and the equipments most needed were those we were least able to supply the abandonment of the line of the potomac and the upper mississippi from columbus to memphis did somewhat however the pressure for heavy artillery and after the fall of 1862 when the powdermills at augusta had got into full operation there was no further inability to meet all requisitions for ammunition to provide the iron needed for cannon and projectiles it had been necessary to stimulate by contracts the mining and * of its * but it was obviously beyond the power of even the great administrative capacity of the chief of ordnance general j * to whose monograph i am indebted for these details to add to his already * labors the numerous and increasing cares of obtaining the material from which ammunition arms and equipments were to be manufactured on his recommendation a niter and mining bureau was organized and colonel st john who had been hitherto assigned to duty in connection with procuring supplies of niter and iron was appointed to be chief of this bureau a large difficult and most important field of operations was thus assigned to him and well did he fulfill its requirements to his recent experience was added scientific knowledge and to both untiring systematic industry and his hearts thorough devotion to the cause he served the tree is known by its fruit and he may confidently point to results as the evidence on which he is willing to stand for judgment briefly they will be noticed niter was to be obtained from caves and other like sources and by the formation of * some of which had previously been begun at richmond these beds were located at columbia south carolina charleston savannah augusta mobile selma and various other points at the close of 1864 there were two million eight hundred thousand feet of earth collected and in various stages of * of which a large proportion was presumed to yield one and a half pound of niter per foot of earth the whole country was laid off into districts each of which was under the charge of an officer who obtained details of workmen from the army and made his monthly reports thus the niter production in the course of a year was brought up to something like half of the total consumption the district from which the most constant yield could be relied on had its chief office at greensboro north carolina a region which had no * in it the niter was obtained from * of * earth found under old houses barns etc the supervision of the production of iron lead copper and all the * which needed development as well as the manufacture of * and * * the latter required for the supply of the * of mercury for * without which the * of our day would have been useless was added to the niter bureau such was the progress that in a short time the bureau was aiding or managing some twenty to thirty furnaces with an annual yield of fifty thousand tons or more of * the lead and * works erected were sufficient for all wants and the * of * of good quality had been achieved the * works were placed at charlotte north carolina to serve as a reserve when the supply from abroad might be cut off in equipping the armies first sent into the field the supply of * was * scant there were arms such as they were for over one hundred thousand men but no accoutrements nor equipments and a meager supply of ammunition in time the knapsacks were supplanted by haversacks which the women could make but soldiers shoes and cartridgeboxes must be had leather was also needed for * and for * and as the amount of leather which the country could furnish was quite insufficient for all these purposes it was perforce apportioned among them soldiers shoes were the prime necessity therefore a scale was established by which first shoes and then cartridgeboxes had the preference after these * and then saddles and bridles to economize leather the waist and cartridgebox belts were made of prepared cotton cloth stitched in stitched in three or four * bridlereins were likewise so made and then cartridgeboxes were thus covered except the flap * too were made of heavy cotton cloth strongly stitched to get leather each department procured its quota of hides made contracts with the * obtained hands for them by * from the army got transportation over the railroads for the hides and for supplies to the varied functions of this bureau was finally added that of assisting the * to procure the necessary supplies for the * a * even was established on cape fear river to get oil for * purposes and at the same time food for the workmen in cavalry equipments the main thing was to get a good saddle which would not hurt the back of the horse for this purpose various patterns were tried and reasonable success was obtained one of the most difficult wants to supply in this branch of the service was the horseshoe for cavalry and artillery the want of iron and of skilled labor was strongly felt every wayside * accessible especially those in and near the theatre of operations was employed these again had to be supplied with material and the employees * from service it early became manifest that great reliance must be placed on the introduction of articles of prime necessity through the * ports a vessel capable of * six hundred and fifty bales of cotton was purchased by the agent in england and kept running between bermuda and wilmington some fifteen to eighteen successive trips were made before she was captured another was added which was equally successful these vessels were long low rather narrow and built for speed they were mostly of pale * and with their lights out and with fuel that made little smoke they ran to and from wilmington with considerable regularity several others were added and devoted to bringing in ordnance and finally general supplies depots of stores were likewise made at nassau and havana another organization was also necessary that the vessels coming in through the blockade might have their return cargoes promptly on their arrival these resources were also supplemented by contracts for supplies brought through texas from mexico the arsenal in richmond soon grew into very large dimensions and produced all the ordnance stores that the army required except cannon and smallarms in quantities sufficient to supply the forces in the field the arsenal at augusta was very serviceable to the armies serving in the south and west and turned out a good deal of fieldartillery complete the government powdermills were entirely successful the arsenal and workshops at charleston were enlarged steam introduced and good work done in various departments the arsenal at mount vernon alabama was moved to selma in that state where it grew into a large and * establishment of the first class mount vernon arsenal was dismantled and served to furnish lumber and timber for use elsewhere at montgomery shops were kept up for the repair of smallarms and the manufacture of articles of leather there were many other small establishments and depots the chief armories were at richmond and fayetteville north carolina the former turned out about fifteen hundred stands per month and the latter only four hundred per month for want of operatives to meet the want of cavalry arms a contract was made for the construction in richmond of a factory for * carbines this being built it was then converted into a manufactory of * caliber # smaller establishments grew up at * north carolina and at * alabama a great part of the work of the armories consisted in the repair of arms in this manner the * of the battlefields were utilized nearly ten thousand stands were saved from the field of manassas and from those about richmond in 1862 about twentyfive thousand excellent arms all the stock of inferior arms disappeared from the armories during the first two years of the war and were replaced by a better class of arms rifled and * placing the good arms lost previous to july 1863 at one hundred thousand there must have been received from various sources four hundred thousand stands of infantry arms in the first two years of the war among the obvious requirements of a wellregulated service was one central laboratory of sufficient capacity to prepare all ammunition and thus to secure the vital advantage of absolute uniformity authority was therefore granted to concentrate this species of work at macon georgia plans of the buildings and of the machinery required were submitted and approved and the work was begun with energy the pile of buildings had a faade of six hundred feet was designed with taste and comprehended every possible * for good and * work the buildings were nearly ready for occupation at the close of the war and some of the machinery had arrived at bermuda this project preceded that of a general armory for the confederacy and was much nearer completion these with the admirable powdermills at augusta would have been completed and with them the government would have been in a condition to supply arms and ammunition to three hundred thousand men to these would have been added a * for heavy guns at selma or * alabama where the strongest cast iron in the country had been made thus has been briefly sketched the development of the resources from which our large armies were supplied with arms and ammunition while our country was invaded on land and water by armies much larger than our own it will be seen under what disadvantages our people successfully prosecuted the to them new pursuits of mining and manufacturing the chief of ordnance was general j * a man remarkable for his scientific attainment for the highest administrative capacity and moral purity all crowned by zeal and fidelity to his trust in which he achieved results greatly * to the means at his command he closes his excellent monograph in the following words the same officer writes the charge was made early in the war that i was slow in procuring arms and munitions of war from europe we were not only in advance of the government of the united states in the markets of europe but the facts presented in the following extracts from a letter of our agent caleb * dated december 30 1861 and addressed to major c c anderson will serve to place the matter in its proper light in my inaugural address in 1862 i said the financial system which had been adopted from necessity proved adequate at this early period to supply all the wants of the government and of the people an unexpected and very large increase of expenditures had resulted from the great * of the necessary means of defense yet the government entered on its second year without a floating debt and with its credit unimpaired the total expenditures of the first year ending february 1 1862 amounted to one hundred and seventy million dollars a statement of the secretary of the treasury comprising the period from the organization of the government to august 1 1862 presents the following results the receipts were derived as follows such was the result presented by the treasury of a government that had been in existence only eighteen months it commenced that existence without a treasury and without the * and the munitions of war was in less than two months invaded on every side by an implacable foe its ways and means consisted in * and taxes and to these it resorted on february 28th i was authorized by congress to borrow at any time within twelve months fifteen million dollars or less as might be needed it was to be applied to the payment of appropriations for the support of the government and for the public defense certificates of stock or bonds payable in ten years at eight per cent interest were issued for the payment of the interest and principal of this loan a tax or duty of one eighth of one per cent per pound was laid on all cotton * on march 9th an issue of one million dollars in treasury notes of fifty dollars and upward was authorized payable in one year from date at # per cent interest and receivable for all public debts except the export duty on cotton a * was authorized for a year on may 16th a loan of fifty million dollars in bonds payable after twenty years at eight per cent interest was authorized the bonds were to be sold for specie military stores or for the proceeds of * of raw produce or manufactured articles to be paid in the form of specie or with foreign bills of exchange the bonds could not be issued in fractional parts of a hundred dollars or be exchanged for treasury notes or the notes of any bank corporation or individual in lieu of any amount of these bonds not exceeding twenty million dollars an equal amount of treasury notes without interest in denominations of five dollars and upward was authorized to be issued these notes were payable in two years in specie and were receivable for all debts or taxes except the export duty on cotton they were also convertible into bonds payable in ten years at eight per cent interest on august 19th another issue of treasury notes amounting with those then issued to one hundred million dollars was authorized they were of the denominations of five dollars and upward they were receivable for the * and all other public dues except the export duty on cotton these notes were convertible into * bonds bearing eight per cent interest of which the issue was limited to one hundred million dollars thirty millions were to be a substitute for the same amount authorized by the act of may 16 1861 these bonds could be exchanged for specie military and naval stores or for the proceeds of raw produce and manufactured articles on december 19th ten million dollars in treasury notes were issued to pay the advance of the banks on december 24th an additional issue of fifty millions of treasury notes like those of the act of august 19th was authorized an additional issue of thirty millions of bonds was also authorized on april 12 1862 an issue of treasury notes certificates of stock and bonds as the public necessities might require to the amount of two hundred and fifteen millions was authorized of these fifty millions in treasury notes were issued without reserve ten millions in treasury notes retained as a reserve fund to pay any sudden or unexpected call for * and one hundred and sixtyfive millions certificates of stock or bonds bonds to the amount of fifty million dollars payable in ten years at six per cent interest were authorized and made * for any of the above treasury notes all these notes and bonds were subject to the same conditions as those of the acts of august 19 and december 24 1861 on april 17th five millions of treasury notes were authorized to be issued in denominations of one and two dollars which were receivable for all public dues except the cotton duty an amount of treasury notes bearing interest at two cents per day on each hundred dollars as a substitute for as much of the one hundred and sixtyfive millions of bonds authorized was also authorized to be issued on september 19 1862 three million five hundred thousand dollars in bonds was authorized to be issued to meet a contract for six ironclad vessels of war on september 23 1862 the amount of treasury notes under the denomination of five dollars was increased from five million to ten million dollars and a further issue of bonds or certificates of stock to the amount of fifty million dollars was authorized on march 23 1863 an effort was made to remove from circulation some of the issues of treasury notes by * them for this purpose it was provided that all treasury notes not bearing interest issued prior to december 1862 should be fundable in eight per cent bonds or stock during the ensuing thirty days and during the succeeding three months in seven per cent bonds or stock after which they ceased to be fundable all treasury notes not bearing interest and issued after december 1 1862 until ten days after the passage of the act were made fundable in seven per cent bonds or stock during the ensuing four months and afterward only in four per cent thirty years bonds call certificates were made fundable in thirty years bonds at eight per cent and all * on the ensuing july 1st were deemed bonds at six per cent payable in thirty years a monthly issue of treasury notes without interest to the amount of fifty million dollars was also authorized these were made fundable during the first year of their issue in six per cent thirty years bonds and after the expiration of the year in four per cent thirty years bonds the further issue of call certificates was suspended but treasury notes fundable in the six per cent bonds might be converted at the pleasure of the holder into such certificates at five per cent interest which were * into like notes within six months or afterward exchanged for thirty years six per cent bonds treasury notes fundable in four per cent bonds were convertible in like manner at four per cent all * means in the treasury were to be applied to the purchase of treasury notes bearing no interest until the amount in circulation did not exceed one hundred and seventyfive millions the issue of five million dollars in notes of two dollars one dollar and fifty cents was also authorized it was further provided in this act that six per cent bonds as above mentioned might be sold to any of the states for treasury notes and being guaranteed by any of the states they might be used to purchase treasury notes the whole amount of such bonds could not exceed two hundred million dollars treasury notes so purchased were not to be * the issue of six per cent * bonds to the amount of one hundred million dollars which were to be applied only to the * of treasury notes was also authorized the * were payable either in the currency in which interest on other bonds was paid or in cotton certificates * the government to pay the same in cotton of new orleans * quality delivered at the rate of eight * sterling per pound an important measure was adopted on february 17 1864 the object of which was to reduce the currency and to authorize a new issue of notes and bonds all treasury notes above the denomination of five dollars and not bearing interest were if offered within a short period made fundable in registered twenty years bonds at four per cent at the same time a new issue of treasury notes was authorized and made receivable for all public dues except customs duties at the rate of two dollars for three of the old the issue of other treasury notes after the 1st of the ensuing april was prohibited to pay the expenses of the government an issue of five hundred million dollars in six per cent bonds was authorized for the payment of interest the receipts of the export and import duties payable in specie were pledged a review of this statement of the legislation of congress will clearly present the financial system of the government the first action of the provisional congress was confined to the adoption of a tariff law and an act for a loan of fifteen million dollars with a pledge of a small export duty on cotton to provide for the redemption of the debt at the next session after the commencement of the war provision was made for the issue of twenty million dollars in treasury notes and for borrowing thirty million dollars in bonds at the same time the tariff was revised and preparatory measures taken for the levy of internal taxes after the purpose of subjugation became manifest by the action of the congress of the united states early in july 1861 and the certainty of a long war was demonstrated there arose the necessity that a financial system should be devised on a basis sufficiently large for the vast proportions of the approaching contest the plan then adopted was founded on the theory of issuing treasury notes convertible at the pleasure of the holder into eight per cent bonds with the interest payable in coin it was assumed that any tendency to depreciation which might arise from the * of the currency would be checked by the constant exercise of the * right to fund the notes at a liberal interest payable in specie the success of this system depended on the ability of the government constantly to pay the interest in specie the measures therefore adopted to secure that payment consisted in the levy of an internal tax termed a war tax and the appropriation of the revenue from imports the first operation of this plan was quite successful the interest was paid from the reserve of coin existing in the country and experience sustained the expectations of those who devised the system wheat in the beginning of the year 1862 was selling at one dollar and thirty cents per bushel thus but little exceeding its average price in time of peace the other agricultural products of the country were at similarly moderate rates thus indicating that there was no excess of circulation at the same time the premium on coin had reached about twenty per cent but it had become apparent that the commerce of our country was threatened with permanent suspension by reason of the conduct of neutral nations who virtually gave aid to the united states government by * its declaration of a blockade these neutral nations treated our invasion by our former limited and special agent as though it were the attempt of a sovereign to suppress a rebellion against lawful authority this exceptional cause heightened the premium on specie because it indicated the exhaustion of our reserve without the possibility of renewing the supply at the inauguration of the permanent government in february 1862 a popular aversion to internal taxation had been so strongly manifested as to indicate its partial failure this will be further explained presently in our statement of the system of taxation under all these circumstances the effort was made to avoid the increase in the volume of notes in circulation by offering inducements to voluntary * the measures adopted for that purpose were but partially successful meanwhile the intervening exigencies from the fortunes of war permitted no delay the issues of treasury notes were increased until in december 1863 the currency in circulation amounted to more than six hundred million dollars or more than * the amount required by the business of the country the evil effects of this financial condition were but too apparent in addition to the difficulty presented to the necessary operations of the government and the efficient conduct of the war the most deplorable of all its results was undoubtedly its * influence on the morals of the people the possession of large amounts of treasury notes led to a desire for investment and with a constantly increasing volume of currency there was an equally constant increase of price in all objects of investment this effect stimulated purchase by the apparent certainty of profit and a spirit of speculation was thus fostered which had so * an influence and such ruinous consequences that it became our highest duty to remove the cause by prompt and * measures i therefore recommended to congress in december 1863 the compulsory reduction of the currency to the amount required by the business of the country accompanied by a pledge that under no stress of circumstances would the amount be increased i stated that if the currency was not greatly and promptly reduced the existing scale of inflated prices would not only continue but by the very fact of the large amounts thus made requisite in the conduct of the war these prices would reach rates still more extravagant and the whole system would fall under its own weight rendering the redemption of the debt impossible and destroying its value in the hands of the holder if on the contrary a funded debt with interest secured by adequate taxation could be substituted for the * currency its entire amount would be made available to the holder and the government would be in a condition beyond the reach of any probable contingency to prosecute the war to a successful issue this recommendation was followed by the passage of the act of february 17 1864 above mentioned one of its features is the tax levied on the circulation regarding the government when contracting a debt as the agent of the people its debt is their debt as the currency was held exclusively by ourselves it was obvious that if each person held treasury notes in exact proportion to the * of his whole estate each would in fact owe himself the amount of the notes held by him and were it possible to distribute the currency among the people in this exact proportion a tax levied on the currency alone to an amount sufficient to reduce it to its proper limits would afford the best of all remedies under such circumstances the notes remaining in the hands of each holder after the payment of his tax would be worth quite as much as the whole sum previously held for it would have an equal * capacity after this law had been in operation for one year it was manifest that it had the desired effect of withdrawing from circulation the large excess of treasury notes which had been issued on july 1 1864 the * amount was estimated at two hundred and thirty million dollars the estimate of the amount funded under this act about this time was three hundred million dollars while new notes were authorized to be issued to the extent of two thirds of the sum received under its provisions the chief difficulty apprehended in connection with our finances up to the close of the war resulted from the depreciation of our treasury notes which was to be attributed to the increasing * in amount and the diminishing confidence in their ultimate redemption the financial condition of the government near its close is very correctly represented in the report of the treasury department the total receipts of the treasury for the two quarters ending on september 30 1864 amounted to # which sum added to the balance # that remained in the treasury on april 1 1864 formed a total of # of this total not far from half that is to say # were applied to the extinction of the public debt while the total expenditures were # leaving a balance in the treasury on october 1 1864 of # the sources from which this revenue was derived were as follows the total amount of the public debt on october 1 1864 on the books of the register of the treasury was # of which # were funded debt bearing interest and # were treasury notes of the new issue and the remainder consisted of the former issue of treasury notes which were converted into other forms of debt

so that the total public debt on october 1st might have been fairly considered to have been # of this amount # consisted of funded debt and the balance * debt or treasury notes the foreign debt is omitted in these statements it amounted to # and was provided for by about two hundred and fifty thousand bales of cotton collected by the government the aggregate appropriations called for by the different departments of the government for the six months ending on june 30 1865 amounted to # it was estimated that the remains of former appropriations would on january 1 1865 amount to a balance of # no additional appropriations were therefore required for the ensuing six months a system of measures by which to obtain a revenue from direct taxes and duties was commenced at the first session of congress under the provisional government the officers who at the time of the adoption of the provisional constitution held any office connected with the collection of the customs duties and * in the several states of the confederacy or as assistant * intrusted with the keeping of moneys arising therefrom were continued in office with the same powers and subject to the same duties the tariff laws of the united states were continued in force until they might be altered the free list was enlarged so as to embrace many articles of necessity additional ports and places of entry were established * laws were repealed and foreign vessels were admitted to the * a lighthouse bureau was organized a lower rate of duties was imposed on a number of enumerated articles and an export duty of one eighth of one cent per pound was imposed on all cotton * in the raw state at the second session in may a complete tariff law was enacted with a lower scale of duties than had previously existed on august 19 1861 a * of fifty cents on each hundred dollars of certain classes of property was levied for the special purpose of paying the principal and interest of the public debt and of supporting the government the different classes of property on which the tax was levied were as follows real estate of all kinds slaves * * railroad and other corporation stocks money at interest or invested by individuals in the purchase of bills notes and other securities for money except the bonds of the confederate states and cash on hand or on deposit cattle horses and mules gold watches gold and silver plate pianos and * there were some * such as the property of educational charitable and religious institutions and of a head of a family having property worth less than five hundred dollars an act was passed for the * of the property of alien enemies as a * measure to offset the confiscation act of the united states on april 24 1863 a new act was passed relative to internal or direct taxes it was designed to reach as far as practicable every resource of the country except the capital invested in real estate and slaves and by means of an * and a tax in kind on the produce of the soil as well as by * on business occupations and professions to command resources sufficient for the wants of the country on february 17 1864 an amendment to this * act was passed it levied additional taxes on all business of individuals of * and corporations also on * * * * * and a tax in kind on agriculturists on june 10 1864 an act was passed which levied a tax equal to one fifth of the amount of the existing tax upon all subjects of taxation for the year within six months after the passage of the * of august 19 1861 the popular aversion to internal taxation by the general government had so influenced the legislation of the several states that only in south carolina mississippi and texas were the taxes actually collected from the people the * of the remaining states had been raised by the issue of bonds and state treasury notes the public debt of the country was thus actually increased instead of being diminished by the taxation imposed by congress at the first and second * of congress in 1862 no means were provided by taxation for maintaining the government the legislation was confined to authorizing further * of bonds and issues of treasury notes an obstacle had arisen against successful taxation about two thirds of the entire * property of the confederate states consisted in land and slaves under the provisional constitution which ceased to be in force on february 22 1862 the power of congress to levy taxes was not restricted by any other condition than that all duties * and * should be uniform throughout the states of the confederacy but in the permanent constitution which took effect on the same day february 22d it was specially provided that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free * those bound to service for a term of years and excluding indians not * * of all slaves according to the received construction of the constitution of the united states which had been acquiesced in for sixty years taxes on lands and slaves were direct taxes in repeating without modification in our constitution this language of the united states constitution our convention necessarily seems to have intended to attach to it the meaning which had been sanctioned by long and uninterrupted * deciding that taxes on lands and slaves were direct taxes our constitution further ordered that a census should be made within three years after the first meeting of congress and that no * or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration * directed to be taken so long as there seemed to be a probability of being able to carry out these provisions of the constitution fully and in conformity with the intentions of its authors there was an obvious difficulty in framing any system of taxation a law which should exempt from the burden two thirds of the property of the country would be as unfair to the owners of the remaining third as it would be inadequate to meet the requirements of the public service the urgency of the need however was such that after great embarrassment the law of april 24 1863 above mentioned was framed still a very large proportion of these resources was * for some time and the intervening exigencies permitting of no delay a resort to further issues of treasury notes became unavoidable the foreign debt of the confederate states at the close of the war was twentytwo hundred thousand pounds the earliest * on which this debt was contracted were issued in london and paris in march 1863 the bonds bore interest at seven per cent per * in sterling payable * they were * for cotton on application at the option of the holder or * at par in sterling in twenty years by * drawings commencing march 1 1864 the special security of these bonds was the engagement of the government to deliver cotton to the * each bond at the option of the holder was convertible at its nominal amount into cotton at the rate of * sterling for each pound of * four thousand pounds of cotton for each bond of a hundred pounds or twentyfive hundred francs and this could be done at any time not later than six months after the ratification of a treaty of peace between the belligerents sixty days after the notice the cotton was to be delivered if in a state of peace at the ports of charleston savannah mobile or new orleans if at war at points in the interior of the country within ten miles of a railroad or a stream navigable to the ocean the delivery was to be made free of all charges except the export duty of one eighth of one cent per pound the quality of the cotton was to be the standard of new orleans * an annual sinking fund of five per cent was provided for whereby two and a half per cent of the bonds * by cotton should be drawn by lot * so as finally to extinguish the loan in twenty years from the first drawing the bonds were issued at ninety per cent payable in * the loan soon stood in the london market at five per cent premium the amount asked for was three million pounds the amount of applications in london and paris exceeded fifteen million pounds great efforts had previously been made by agents of the united states government to reflect upon the credit of the confederate states by * an almost forgotten accusation of repudiation against the state of mississippi and especially by an emissary sent to great britain than whom no one knew better how false were the attempts to * my name in that charge the slanderous tongues of northern hatred even went so far as to style me the father of repudiation how unjust all such assertions were will be manifest by a simple statement of the case we should not omit to refer once more to the most prolific source of sectional strife and alienation which is believed to have been the question of the tariff or duties upon imports its influence extended to and affected subjects with which it was not visibly connected and finally assumed a form surely not contemplated in the original formation of the union in the articles of confederation the first constitution of the united states the theory was that of direct taxation and the manner was to impose upon the states an amount which each was to furnish to the common treasury to defray expenses for the common defense and general welfare during the period of our colonial existence the policy of the british government had been to suppress the growth of manufacturing industry it was forcibly expressed by lord north in the declaration that not a * should be made in the american colonies the consequence was that in the war of the revolution our armies and people suffered so much from the want of the most necessary supplies that general washington after we had achieved our independence expressed the opinion that the government should by bounties encourage the manufacture of such materials as were necessary in time of war in the convention which framed the constitution for a more perfect union one of the greatest difficulties in agreeing upon its terms was found in the different interests of the states but among the compromises which were made there prominently appears the purpose of a strict equality in the burdens to be borne as well as the blessings to be enjoyed by the people of the several states for a long time after the formation of the more perfect union but little capital was invested in manufacturing establishments and though in the early part of the present century the amount had considerably increased the products were yet quite insufficient for the necessary supplies of our armies in the war of 1812 government contracts high prices and to some extent no doubt patriotic impulses led to the investment of capital in the articles required for the prosecution of the war with the restoration of peace and the renewal of commerce prices naturally declined and it was represented that the * made in manufacturing establishments were so unprofitable as to involve the ruin of those who had made them the congress of the united states in 1816 from motives at least to be commended for their generosity enacted a law to protect from the threatened ruin those of their countrymen who had employed their capital for purposes demanded by the general welfare and common defense these good intentions if it be conceded that the danger was real which it was designed to avert were most unfortunate as the beginning of a policy the end of which was fraught with the greatest evils that have ever befallen the union by the constitution of 1789 power was conferred upon congress in the exercise of this delegated trust tariff laws were enacted and had been in operation to the satisfaction of all parts of the union from the organization of the government down to 1816 but throughout that period all of those laws were based upon the principle of duties for revenue it was true and of course it was known that such duties would give incidental protection to any industry producing an article on which the duty was levied but while the money was collected for the purposes enumerated and the rate kept down to the lowest revenue standard the * had no cause to complain of the indirect benefit received by the manufacturer and the history of the time shows that it produced no discontent not so with the tariff law of 1816 though sustained by men from all sections of the union and notably by so strict a * as mr calhoun there were not wanting those who saw in it a departure from the limitation of the constitution and sternly opposed it as the usurpation of a power to legislate for the benefit of a class the law derived much of its support from the assurance that it was only a temporary measure and intended to shield those whose patriotism had exposed them to danger thus presenting the not uncommon occurrence of a good case making a bad precedent for the first time a tariff law had protection for its object and for the first time it produced discontent in the law there was nothing which necessarily gave to it or in its terms violated the obligation that duties should be uniform throughout the united states the fact that it affected the sections differently was due to physical * is geographical differences the streams of the southern atlantic states ran over wide plains into the sea their last falls were remote from ocean navigation and their people almost exclusively agricultural resided principally on this plain and as near to the seaboard as circumstances would permit in the northern atlantic states the highlands approached more nearly to the sea and the rivers made their last leap near to harbors of commerce * being relied on before the * had been made and ships the medium of commerce before railroads and locomotives were introduced it followed that the staples of the southern plains were * sent to the * of the north to be manufactured this remark of course applies to such articles as were not * to foreign countries and is intended to explain how the north became the seat of manufactures and the south remained agricultural from this it followed that legislation for the benefit of manufacturers became a northern policy it was not as has been erroneously stated because of the agricultural character of the southern people that they were opposed to the policy inaugurated by the tariff act of 1816 this is shown by the fact that * to that time they had been the friends of manufacturing industry without reference to its location as long as duties were imposed for revenue so that the object was to supply the common treasury it had been cheerfully borne and the agriculture of one section and the manufacturing of another were properly regarded as * and not unfrequently referred to as the means of strengthening and * the bonds by which the states were united when duties were imposed not for revenue but as a bounty to a particular industry it was regarded both as unjust and without warrant expressed or implied in the constitution then arose the controversy * renewed and with increasing provocation in 1820 in 1824 and in #* stage * the discontent arising more from the injustice than the weight of the burden borne it was not the * * tax but the violation of * * which * and his associates resisted it was not the stamp duty nor the * but the principle involved in taxation without representation against which our colonial fathers took up arms so the tariff act in # known at the time as the bill of * was resisted by southern representatives because it was the invasion of private rights in violation of the compact by which the states were united in the last stage of the proceeding after the friends of the bill had advocated it as a measure for protecting capital invested in manufactures mr drayton of south carolina moved to amend the title so that it should read an act to increase the duties upon certain imports for the purpose of increasing the profits of certain manufacturers and stated his purpose for desiring to amend the title to be that upon some case which would arise under the execution of the law an appeal might be made to the supreme court of the united states to test its constitutionality those who had passed the bill refused to allow the opportunity to test the validity of a tax imposed for the protection of a particular industry though the debates showed clearly enough the purpose to be to impose duties for protection the phraseology of the law presented it as enacted to raise revenue and therefore the victims of the discrimination were deprived of an appeal to the tribunal instituted to hear and decide on the constitutionality of a law south carolina oppressed by onerous duties and stung by the injustice of a refusal to allow her the ordinary remedy against unconstitutional legislation asserted the right as a sovereign state to nullify the law this conflict between the authority of the united states and one of the states threatened for a time such disastrous consequences as to excite intense feeling in all who loved the union as the fraternal federation of equal states before an actual collision of arms occurred congress wisely adopted the compromise act of 1833 by that the fact of protection remained but the principle of duties for revenue was recognized by a sliding scale of reduction and it was hoped the question had been placed upon a basis that promised a permanent peace the party of protective duties however came into power about the close of the period when the compromise measure had reached the result it proposed and the contest was renewed with little faith on the part of the then dominant party and with more than all of its former bitterness the cause of the departure from a sound principle of a tariff for revenue which had prevailed during the first quarter of a century and the adoption in 1816 of the rule imposing duties for protection was stated by mr mcduffie to be that politicians and capitalists had seized upon the subject and used it for their own * former for political advancement the latter for their own pecuniary * that the question had become one of partisan politics and sectional * contemporaneously with this theory of protective duties arose the policy of making appropriations from the common treasury for local improvements as the southern representatives were mainly those who denied the constitutional power to make such expenditures it naturally resulted that the mass of those appropriations were made for northern works now that direct taxes had in practice been so wholly abandoned as to be almost an obsolete idea and now that the treasury was supplied by the collection of duties upon imports two golden streams flowed steadily to * the northern and manufacturing region by the * of the southern and agricultural section in the train of wealth and demand for labor followed immigration and the more rapid increase of population in the northern than in the southern states i do not deny the existence of other causes such as the fertile region of the northwest the better harbors the greater amount of shipping of the northeastern states and the prejudice of * against contact with the negro race but the causes i have first stated were i think the chief and those only which are referable to the action of the general government it was not found that the possession of power mitigated the injustice of its use by the north and discontent therefore was steadily accumulating and as stated in the beginning of this chapter i think was due to class legislation in the form of protective duties and its consequences more than to any or all other causes combined turning from the consideration of this question in its sectional aspect i now invite attention to its general effect upon the character of our institutions if the common treasury of the states had as under the confederation been supplied by direct taxation who can doubt that a rigid economy would have been the rule of the government that representatives would have returned to their * constituents to justify appropriations for which they had voted by showing that they were required for the general welfare and were authorized by the constitution under which they were acting when the money was obtained by indirect taxation so that but few could see the source from which it was derived it readily followed that a * would ask not why the representative had voted for the expenditure of money but how much he had got for his own district and perhaps he might have to explain why he did not get more is it doubtful that this would lead to extravagance if not to corruption nothing could be more fatal to the independence of the people and the liberties of the states than dependence for support upon the public treasury whether it be in the form of * of bounties or restrictions on trade for the benefit of special interests in the decline of the roman empire the epoch in which the hopelessness of * was made manifest was that in which the people accepted corn from the public * it preceded but a little the time when the post of emperor became a matter of purchase how far would it differ from this if * should choose their representatives not for their integrity not for their capacity not for their past services but because of their ability to get money from the public treasury for the benefit of their local interests and how far would it differ from a purchase of the office if a president were chosen because of the favor he would show to certain moneyed interests now that fanaticism can no longer inflame the prejudices of the * it may be hoped that our statesmen will review the past and give to our country a future in accordance with its early history and * of true liberty the agricultural products were diminished every year during the war its demands diminished the number of * and their labors were more extensively devoted to * the amount of the * was greatly reduced and numbers of bales were destroyed when in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy the manufacturing industry became more extensive than ever before and in many branches more highly developed the results in the ordnance department of the government stated elsewhere in these pages serve as an illustration of the achievements in many branches of industry during the first year of the war the authority granted to the president to call for volunteers in the army for a short period was sufficient to secure all the military force which we could fit out and use advantageously as it became evident that the contest would be long and severe better measures of preparation were enacted i was authorized to call out and place in the military service for three years unless the war should sooner end all white men residents of the confederate states between the ages of eighteen and thirtyfive years and to continue those already in the field until three years from the date of their enlistment but those under eighteen years and over thirtyfive were required to remain ninety days the existing organization of companies regiments etc was preserved but the former were filled up to the number of one hundred and twentyfive men this was the first step toward placing the army in a permanent and efficient condition the term of service being * the changes by * and by receiving recruits were diminished so that while additions were made to the forces already in the field the discipline was greatly improved at the same time on march 13 1862 general robert e lee was charged with the conduct of the military operations of the armies of the confederacy under my direction nevertheless the law upon which our success so greatly depended was assailed with unexpected criticism in various quarters a constitutional question of high importance was raised which tended to involve the harmony of coperation so essential in this crisis between the general and the state governments it was advanced principally by the governor of georgia hon joseph e brown and the following extracts are taken from my reply to him dated the operation of this law was suspended in the states of kentucky missouri and maryland because of their occupation by the armies of the federal government the opposition to it where its execution was continued soon became limited and before june 1st its good effects were seen in the increased strength and efficiency of our armies at the same time i was authorized to commission officers to form bands of partisan rangers either of infantry or cavalry which were subsequently confined to cavalry alone on september 27 1862 all white men between the ages of thirtyfive and fortyfive were placed in the military service for three years all persons subject to enrollment might be enrolled wherever found and were made subject to the provisions of the law authority was also given for the reception of volunteers from the states in which the law was suspended on february 11 1864 it was enacted by congress that all white men between the ages of seventeen and fifty should be in the military service for the war also that all then in the service between the ages of eighteen and fortyfive should be retained during the war an enrollment was also ordered of all persons between the ages of seventeen and eighteen and between fortyfive and fifty years who should constitute a reserve for state defense and detail duty on february 17th all male free negroes between the ages of eighteen and fifty years were made liable to perform duties with the army or in connection with the military defenses of the country in the way of work upon the fortifications or in government works for the production or preparation of materials of war or in military hospitals the secretary of war was also authorized to employ for the same duties any number of negro slaves not exceeding twenty thousand in the operation of the military laws we found the exemption from military duty accorded by the law to all persons engaged in certain specified pursuits or professions to be unwise indeed it seems to be indefensible in theory the defense of home family and country is universally recognized as the paramount political duty of every member of society and in a form of government where each citizen enjoys an equality of rights and privileges nothing can be more * than an unequal distribution of duties or obligations no pursuit nor position should relieve any one who is able to do active duty from enrollment in the army unless his functions or services are more useful to the defense of his country in another sphere but the exemption from service of entire classes should be wholly abandoned the act of february 17 1864 above mentioned which authorized the employment of slaves produced less results than had been anticipated it however brought forward the question of the employment of the negroes as soldiers in the army which was warmly advocated by some and as ardently opposed by others my own views upon it were expressed freely and frequently in intercourse with members of congress and emphatically in my message of november 7 1864 when urging upon congress the consideration of the propriety of a radical modification of the theory of the law i said subsequent events advanced my views from a prospective to a present need for the enrollment of negroes to take their place in the ranks strenuously i argued the question with members of congress who called to confer with me to a member of the senate the house in which we most needed a vote i stated as i had done to many others the fact of having led negroes against a lawless body of armed white men and the assurance which the experiment gave me that they might under proper conditions be relied on in battle and finally used to him the expression which i believe i can repeat exactly if the confederacy falls there should be written on its tombstone died of a theory general lee was brought before a committee to state his opinion as to the probable efficiency of negroes as soldiers and disappointed the probable expectation by his unqualified advocacy of the proposed measure after much discussion in congress a bill authorizing the president to ask for and accept from their owners such a number of ablebodied negro men as he might deem expedient subsequently passed the house but was lost in the senate by one vote the senators of virginia opposed the measure so strongly that only legislative instruction could secure their support of it their legislature did so instruct them and they voted for it finally the bill passed with an amendment providing that not more than twentyfive per cent of the male slaves between the ages of eighteen and fortyfive should be called out but the passage of the act had been so long delayed that the opportunity was lost there did not remain time enough to obtain any result from its provisions
