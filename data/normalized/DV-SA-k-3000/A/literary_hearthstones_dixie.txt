and * into the * of past things * left the friend of his heart alone with the soft * and memories of that quiet * * by circumstances to leave the pines before their * breath had given him of their

a * over the situation at least i was not * * nor treated to a * view of uncle * * in the distance so i considered myself fortunate i told him that i had called up by * that morning to speak to him i never talk through the * he said i do not like to talk in a * i look into a mans eyes when i talk to him when uncle * was * run to earth and could not escape he was quite human in his * toward his * his only fault being that he was * to talk of his visitors work rather than his own and a question that would seem to lead up to any personal * on his part would result in so strong an * of a desire for flight that the conversation would be directed long * away from * * and the * baby he was a born * and had not the made * * * to * upon high places and * his wisdom to the passing crowd the expression literary as applied to him filled him with surprise he called himself an * author said he had never had an opportunity of * style and probably should not have taken advantage of it if he had he was always as much * by his success as other people are by their * i met him once at a confederate * in * where i took my little * who had been brought up on uncle * to see him having heard their beauty * he * them not to think too much of their looks telling them that appearance was of little consequence he gave each of them a * saying i dont believe in giving money to boys i believe in their working for it well said little george * we * it listening to uncle * if that is so * afraid i * money enough to pay you what i * you he was at ease and natural and like other people with children he invited them to come to his farm and see the flowers and trees telling them how his home received the name of the * * as he sat one morning on the * he saw a * building a * on his * by the

told the boys * one hand into an * * holding an * * he * over it with the other hand * it gently * to the boys who watched him with * interest how the * would change to a beautiful * of * and music and after a while would * away among the trees and fill the woods with sweet sounds if you destroy the * you kill all that beauty and music and there will be no little bird to sit on the tree and sing to you the boys assured him that they had never taken an * nor even so much as looked into the * because some birds will leave their * if you just look into them at the reception given to mrs jackson mrs stuart * davis and myself mr * was invited to stand in line but declined it would be difficult to imagine him as standing with a receiving party * hands with the public he was asked to speak but that was even less to be expected the * he ever came to making a speech was once when he sat upon the * while his friend henry o * was * a large * with all that * for which he was noted when he had finished the call for * came with great volume and * he arose and said i am coming walked down from the * and was lost in the crowd uncle * wrote his stories at * * farm in west end a * of * they

which to a great extent shared the * and * of the period it was published in 1864 by west johnson of richmond being * on * paper and soon became a favorite with the southern soldiers who probably found in it more human nature and more of the * of possible events than it revealed to the general reader their own experience in those days having led them to grave * as to the * of the * theory that
