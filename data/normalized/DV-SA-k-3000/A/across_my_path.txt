* why do not you write some good words to that * air the thought had never occurred to me and it did not seem possible that i ever could write anything of that kind i said i wish i could with a

she * the value of this * for she was never known to be out of touch with the interests of the moment and her help in every useful * was given with all the enthusiasm of her vigorous nature she * the * of the past but never for a moment of her long life did she live in the past her pen and voice were always ready and * in * of the good cause and time did not leave her on the * * the work she did in her last year was filled with the old strength applied to the new things of advancing thought at a reception in richmond i stood beside mrs davis as thousands of old soldiers passed by * to give us the * of affection and to look into our faces with eyes that held loving memories of past days and of those for whose sake we were dear to the veterans of the south after they were gone she turned to me and said is not love the most wonderful thing in life we should be the two * women on earth to have had the love of two such men as your husband and mine who could * the hearts of so many from the * with his rough * hand to the great * man with soft white hand and strong brain with such affection for us as is shown in the warm * and the loving eyes and here we are both forced to live apart from them i in washington because i must * a living and you still farther away it seems strange to some that i live so far away from my old home and my southern friends but it is not for * of love god * for the best in sending me to the north and * to her western home when she and her confederate soldier husband went to * they were not * received the only thought in the community was that they had

from us we scarcely realize that her memory extended back to the days of men who passed from earth before the beginning of the war for which they had * the way about the time that mr davis was * to congress she said mr * came to * and my husband was asked to welcome him in a speech we became good friends and he * my always * interest in * our friendship * me in difficulties for i entered into a

explanation and he said i know what i think on this subject but cannot * what i wrote i still clung to his friendship and was * for my * by the * of his expression when he was talking instead of writing i quite agreed with mr * in the view that one of his greatest powers was in his conversation but heaven help the * * caught in the * of his writing you escaped those * when you went to washington where he could * his thought to you without the * of a pen think of the * of * to the capital in those days we had no * cars with velvet * and lofty porter to * a * * in the air and demand a * we had to make a * journey in a carriage over * and * and * ways falling down an * was a cheerful incident of our trip and our arrival at the national hotel was surely an * of the * of the * mr

the first telegram one of my friends said she knew it was a * but put in two * to get the news that it was a fine day somebody wrote me of a * that * i suppose some of the things that we regard as

there i made my first appearance on the stage shall i tell you the thing that pleased me most of all that ever happened to me it is that the old house on richmond street where i was born is a school now and is named * school it is the first school in boston to be named after a woman and i think that is the greatest honor i could have i was not in a reading part at first i started out with the impression that i had a singing voice people said that i had and when i tried it they listened as if they * it but it gave out down in new orleans and i went to the * of a * and asked him * place in his company he had lost his lady * and offered me the part if i could do it the thought of playing lady * filled me with such delight that i dared not tell him that i had no * for the character lest i should be prevented from taking it i * the melancholy * until the day before the * he sent me to the leading lady of the french * who was much * by the idea of * my * five and a half foot figure in * * for her * four foot ten * form but she was * and cut down and * out and otherwise * her * until i was * out for lady * which unfortunate * i became when i was * was lady * the character you * best to play no i preferred * to all others he has such a * career and so many different * and each one is so * felt that nearly all the * of * life are presented then it gave me a chance to fight a real * which is always a triumph for a woman on one occasion i * an emotion not set down in the book i was playing * to miss * * when just as i was * the * of my love a man in the audience gave * to a * so loud and * that i knew he had * it for that occasion i * making love and led my lady off the stage with i hope a fair degree of the * of the * i returned and announced that if some man did not put that person out i would have to do it it was done and i got more cheers for that * * than for any of the scenes written for the original * i * my * back to the stage and the play went on i noticed a black * ring that she always wore and she took it off and showed me the * on it kind words * * january # # i care more for it than i could * whole mine of * every word in it is a * of greater value than the * and every line of * is a golden * of love the dear people to think of the little i could do for them and to feel how i * to be a real help and comfort to them their love was a * * for the little word here and there which i could not have kept back if i had tried i knew that all the love that the * world could give would be slight * of what she had done for all who came near her she was the good angel of the stage and no effort was too great for her if it brought comfort or help to * else while we were fellow guests in a delightful richmond home i learned that her * of character the * dignity of her manner and the love in her heart * all who knew her * said that when playing * to her lady * he felt himself to be less than of * importance in fact a mere thing of * the queen of the tragic stage her own life was a tragedy a long * battle with the * that took her away all too soon from a world that can ill spare such as she she died in her native city among the people who as she said in her farewell to the stage from the beginning to the end of my career from my first appearance on the stage to my last appearance have been truly brothers friends and * the plain * * which * her grave in mount * * no * except the name which stands for all that is brilliant in art all that is noble and good * * * * * * * * member of a corps de * doing * in her * moments and giving * * with her * for audience could scarcely have looked forward to the time when she would be * * the one * on the * stage a radiant * spirit the * of spring of dawn of moonlight of love and hope and dreams the vision of the poet when he * that * * of eternal youth i * over her * * of that spirit of love and morning and sunshine and once asked her how did you learn to play * so well oh one does not learn to play * either one is * or is not that is all the reason that * have no * is that they think she must be learned and they do not * an atmosphere in which she can be born the consequence is that an * * years in trying to learn * and then when she * the part * that she is long past the time when there is a possibility of ever being * if there was such a period in her life it was away back when life was young when the sun had just * on the new day when the rose was in the * and the * lay * on the folded * when life was * with youth and the first * of loves vision when all is emotion and * and the cold and * * reason has not appeared with the * but * would not have said it in that way she would have used a falling * here and an * there and an * glance somewhere else when reason takes hold of * she * more promptly than * * could have done away with her there is a time in the life of every woman when she knows what * would have done and if she does not do it then ah it is too late i am glad that you selected the right moment and did not wait for time and reason oh but i did not select no one ever * in regard to * a man may select an * opportunity for doing * or reason as to the proper

to do in the beginning of my stage life when the fate of some poor victim * upon my * * children do such unexpected things i had one in * once who * all my tragic * one of the children had a speaking

* my * in * style when the little stranger being seized with stage * and possibly * for his life in my deadly hands * up * and ran with all speed across the stage and took * in a wing the audience had been much impressed by the tragic scene but what human could view * a dead child * up without warning and * across the stage a wave of laughter * that scene i could not * for i had * * the first scene in which i appeared at the age of three months in a new years * basket in which i had been introduced into the family with the * and * for the purpose of * peace between my reckless * and my *

while the audience went into * of laughter its a bad thing * for an audience to laugh when the play does not call for * sometimes it * * * into a good * and makes them more friendly to a play that

went out to all in trouble one of her * * was in * the life of a poor soldier who was under sentence of death for * his hand on the * of his sword when his superior officer had struck him * at the *

begged for the life of the unfortunate man after a time so long that the audience became * she secured an order for * the sentence which reached the prison just as the * were * to the * man the last

* * the * of her * and * * for her * * before her * * * * his opinion that she * nothing but to be a french woman and the famous * * * * i will break the * of tragedy i have made for * has taught me that it was but the * of * said one of her * the only fault that mrs * has is that knowing her makes all other women seem * there was a * in mrs * s nature that caused her to be regarded as above the rest of humanity yet not too far away for any wounded or * soul to * upon her and find support she was * to * but tenderly human to * and love she wore a gold ring which * to her * of feeling and the * that it * from those whom she served some years after the close of the war between the states upon the conclusion of a * delivered by mrs * in a community to which she was a stranger a woman came to her and asked if she remembered a letter that she had written to the wife and mother of a dying soldier giving his name mrs * had written so many letters for soldiers who would never again see their dear ones on earth that she could not recall this one until the woman showed her the old letter worn and * but still * i recall that letter said mrs * i hope that it brought at least a little comfort to you it helped us to live through that awful time it has helped others we sent it to those who had suffered like sorrow until it was so worn that i had to * the paper together then i * sending it out and made * for those who might be * by your loving thought and tender words the poor young wife kept up for a few years and then died of sorrow on her * she told me to take her wedding ring which she should wear until her death and give it to you as a * of * of your * to our soldiers so when i found you were coming i made up my mind that i would hear you and give you the ring * her a * of gold which mrs * accepted * and * you have had an * life i said to her please tell me some of the * and * things you have known i think she said the time of greatest excitement i have ever known was in the * in * when * lincoln was first * for the * to me the most remarkable * of the occasion was my being there so close to the * of action there were women in the * stretched away in so large a circle that they could not hear anything that went on except the * when it was all over greatly to my surprise i was sent by my paper to report the convention it was the first time a woman had ever been appointed to report a meeting of that kind so * of a thing could not pass * and the * of the day came to me and told me that i must go into the gallery as women were not allowed on the floor my husband who was * for his own paper tried to explain my position but was not permitted to do so the other * came to my defence and told me to sit still and * the * to dry up as they expressed it so i stayed in the heart of the battle and witnessed every scene and heard every word the * was * an immense crowd was gathered around the building and * posted upon the roof to give the signal to the * below when the decisive moment should come it came it seemed to me that the mighty * * from that great * went around the world and came back with renewed strength and * thus i saw mr lincoln on his most * day and yet not in triumph for his face showed a * such as i had never seen on any other and the pain and * of it impressed me more and more every time i saw him afterward i recall his saying at a time when the darkness was * around him oh if there is a man out of * that * more than i do i pity him mrs * was a leading * in the * commission fair to which president lincoln sent the original * of the * * thereby * the * offered by a gentleman of * for the * single * a gold watch which the president wore with great satisfaction he had promised mrs * that lie would be present at a fair to be given in may 1865 but before the time arrived his * that he would not live long after the close of the war had been * realized in passing from earth mary * * left a memory that is a rock of strength and a garden of * and * to the many who knew her as a friend and the many more who from * felt the influence of her good deeds and noble character a * character of the highest * it was the unhappy fate of * * to have a part in the most terrible tragedy that has ever * our nation into darkness though she lived nine years afterward and played with her old fire she never recovered from the * of that night the blood that * her stage * as she held the wounded head of president lincoln was a crimson river that * through the rest of her life stuart * said of her i consider * * to have been in many * the most able woman connected with the stage of her time her best * was perhaps * * in * and faces to have learned the long list of * in which she appeared would be no light task for * and when we * upon her wide range of characters from * to the * light * and upon the fact that she was also one of the best * * of her day and a brilliant writer on art subjects we can but wonder over the * * which she * oh but one must know how to * many things if one is to put a play through successfully think of that night that we were to open in much * about nothing and the * clothes were not ready if i had not been something of a * what could i have done but * i * though i just called all those people around and set them to work upon the * and then finished off with * and put those men far enough apart not to * each other off and then went away to * my * * and nobody in that audience ever knew that those fancy clothes were not straight from the * * after the most * style that was a triumph certainly i admitted and people say that you have the most beautiful * in the world i do try to make it a home why not when we poor * have to spend all our * hours in a * we do not want it to be like a * we want graceful * and * and flowers and soft * and all those things that come * to the mind at the thought of home does it * to you sometimes that the * of some * who really have * is due to the rough and bare * in which they spend their lives they have the feeling of * and so are never quite at home in their parts * * had the good fortune to live in a time when * presented a play instead of a * it * more that they should * a character with a new fresh atmosphere than that they should * themselves with * new * of clothes fresh from the * of the leading * * then were real live human * with thought and feeling * somewhere in their * and * * you really do feel what you speak and act i once said after hearing her in an * part otherwise i could not speak and act she replied oh i can be * enough to wait in the wings until i am sure of my money but before the * i forget all about * * with a whole world of * * in * life and really fancy myself * or * or * with a world of * different interests had * * been less * she might have * better and perhaps lived a longer life leaving the stage for a time she gave herself up to the fine * * which she * and * it was intended for readers who were interested in the high * of art * and otherwise and only the art * gave it support it soon * and with it much of * * s money she had lived up and burned out her life in a * time than it takes most people to reach that end and she passed from earth when she should have been in the * of her genius when mrs * was playing an engagement in richmond mrs * gave a tea * her guests to meet the * who was a social favorite as well as a * star i * to be sitting by mrs * when tea was served on little * placed before us to hold the * * which our * had prepared for us how very delightful this is said mrs * it gives me a beautiful chance to talk to you and we can say friendly and * things under the * of the * what pretty little * i have heard of maryland * are these the same i have never * maryland * * but they * in virginia and our * maryland * the * then i shall eat them with a clear virginia conscience and a good * replied mrs * with an air of entire satisfaction opposite us was a window from which the * eyes of the * were * in one of the most beautiful views in richmond how exquisite she said softly and this is * old home it was for a little while i replied when it was quite new and he was on the * of life with dreams and hopes and * in his soul there is sunshine and beauty enough in that view to * a mans whole life wherever it may have been spent afterward how could he ever have seen anything but light and joy in the world i think he had a world of his own i said into which he turned his vision and found things that no one else would have discovered in a whole * and such * * * he saw * mrs * and sometimes such * beautiful things more beautiful than * else could have found his pictures were so * if they were views of * things they were so real that we were * by the strength of them if they were * of the golden side of life we were * by their * and beauty a * * at a table near came over to speak to us and as he went back to his place i saw mrs * eyes follow him with a sad light in them and knew that she was thinking of her * general * west * who died in the second year of the war after his death she and her mother had charge of a hospital at port royal the loving * which followed her through the rest of her life for the work that she did in * for sick and wounded soldiers was * to her than all the fame she won in her art in 1865 she returned to the

on her lap and talked to me seriously giving me wise advice i suppose but i did not hear a word she said for looking at her exquisite face when she paused to note the effect of her * i exclaimed in a * of admiration what lovely eyes you have she gave me up in despair put me down on the floor and walked off laughing i was not a born * i went on the stage because i had to do something and there was nothing else for me you had the * at least i have heard that you were the real * herself when you were * and six weeks after you first thought of going on the stage that was because my beautiful

waited till i found the * before * the * * of charity with the * from her * the radiant * * a cottage in * and spent her * years there in * the events of her long and * life and in her peaceful * * succeeded in finding herself as she had wished the beautiful anna * * whom we knew as a retired * in richmond had not that * love of the stage which * those who * such brilliant * in the * world through the influence of a * of rigid views upon the subject she had been * with the impression that the * was the * of all evil the first time i ever felt even the * * to subject myself to * with so * a thing was when * * was playing in a * near our home i wanted to see her more than i had ever wanted anything else but dared not let my wish be known through fear of being laughed at for * to see something of which i had always before expressed so strong a * as i walked one day with my older sister our father came to us and asked her if she would like to go to see * * i wished that he would ask me but he went on talking as if so wild an idea could not * to him after * he turned to me and said i suppose you would not care to go i admitted that i should like to see the * * and so received

remained * when sorrow fell upon me and want came * near i gave public * but when success brought me a * offer to go upon the stage i felt almost * though i trust that i declined with a proper feeling

what the * means than he does himself and smiles at the * of the * author that he knows the meaning of his own words three weeks after i had determined to take up the work i appeared in the lady of * with but one * when the play was over the audience all rose and * a wealth of flowers over me such beautiful things * to stage ladies dont they sometimes and then again things are not so pleasant i used to think that the property man was the one * memory * who could not possibly forget anything this * remained with me until one evening when i was playing * that * one forgot the * containing the sleeping * some kind of a * was necessary and the property man picked up the first at hand and * it over at the words * this do i drink to * i placed the * to my lips and * the * when the scene closed the * rushed up with the cry good * you have been * from my * of * i felt like the dying * who having been * given * instead of * asked for * of * paper which he might * as a child notwithstanding her * to the stage anna * was the * and star of the * family cast though she said that her little sister * had the greatest * in the household her play of * had no hero the only * character in it being a

* when the companion of that life had lost fortune and wealth and was compelled to give the * of business government into her * hands well did she accomplish her task * all the while the same loving

nothing but her * presence for he immediately * crying and fixed his eyes upon her face until he was * to sleep she invited the general and me to the * that evening to see her and mr * in * meeting her after i had returned to my own country and name she said you look so much like a mrs * whom i met in * when i was there again i tried to find her and the dear little baby george who had such * cheeks and glorious eyes but they had gone and i could find no * of them i am mrs * i replied and explained the name by which she had known me and introduced her again to the little boy whom she remembered as a baby and who still had the * cheeks and glorious eyes she was very glad to see us again and have a pleasant talk of the old * days how you made me cry my eyes out and then in the * * made me laugh until the tears came again i said i am glad that you laughed afterward replied * for i do not like to send my audience home crying it seems too ill a * for the * of people in * * for me and it is * to make * unhappy i thought you were unhappy too i am older now and have learned that people both on and off the stage learn to * * at will but i was unhappy i suppose returned * i recall one play in which it was my * fate to see my husband die in the last scene he was not only my play husband but my own charles off the stage it would seem that i might have been accustomed to the * by that time having suffered it often before but i threw myself upon the body in a burst of * grief * * him to tell me that he was not dead he gave the desired information in terms so * and so nearly * upon * that i felt instantly assured that he was not * near * the audience could not hear what he said and took my passionate grief for a part of the play so i let myself be carried off the stage amid * * when the only * over mr * * body was his faithful dog the * was lost and the audience went off into * of laughter that quite * the tragedy mr * dog loved him with a devotion of which not many human hearts are * watching from the wings the faithful animal saw his master fall under the attack of the stage * whose * duty was to kill the star with a * thrust * out the dog * the dead man and * * at the * whose next business was to carry off the * body as the dog could not be * to leave his dead master and the * dared not approach the * * the * hastily fell amid the laughter and * * of the * that was the * first and last appearance upon any stage but if a human * had made so great a * at his * he would immediately have * into a star of the first * * tree had the most * and * laugh on the stage and many an * * of the gay and laughing * * in the * corner of his heart the * of the merry * behind the scenes which announced the approach of * pet * when * * wrote of kate field she is a * of light to me from which i can always strike a * by thinking of her he expressed the feeling that most people had in meeting her even though it might not have occurred to them to voice the impression there was in her radiant * a glow that flashed a * light into the lives that came near her own while still a * kate field had known and loved and been loved by many of the great souls which had been * to the world for a time to show how grand a thing a human mind could be when god had smiled upon it as it started upon its flight to earth among the * ones she knew in her early days in * were the * and their circle who became her * friends and you even got something out of the * * soul of * * * i asked when she talked of those days oh that mad * as the * called him i think i did get more of * and perhaps * out of his nature than * else ever did so the people of * said but they did not know him and never could though he had lived within view of them a hundred * how could the * * * * know anything about the * and * * and * and * of such a nature as that of mr * mr and mrs * were his friends i think they were born the friends of everybody only a few had the advantage of * in their * on the * bank of affection because ill health kept mrs * in a * life and they were so all in all to each other that they had little need of the outside world but oh how good they were to those who entered their circle their friendship * blessing upon all who came near it was natural that they should care for the strange lonely * old man who having few of his own time to draw into his life circle went back to the dead * of * and * for most of his companions that is what makes it seem so strange that you and * should have been such good friends he was of a long gone yesterday you are of a tomorrow that we are hoping for * i cannot see the ground on which you could meet i suppose said kate that is the very reason that we were interested in each other he was an * * to me i must have seemed a * and * * to him whatever may have been the reason i think the dear old man really was my friend and was glad to see me when i came back to * after years of absence the * of pictures he gave me then the last time i ever saw him is one of my * * now and shall be put into a place that is worthy of it when i am gone the remarkable * of kate field was indicated by her brilliant * * so well remembered by all who knew her * as well as by her success as * * * * editor and author and with it all a * which * to a * genius for * through life the many friends won by her * * and kept by her earnest purpose and * of character kate field lived a brilliant and * life and had the good fortune which comes to few * of giving herself to her work up to the last day she spent one morning writing in her vigorous manner upon the subject which had led her upon a * of * in the * * at noon she took ship from a * island to * the next day with the * waves all around her as the boat * its way to port she went to her eternal home as * as a * summer day * to rest through a * that was dear to me long ago a * ran * with blue and white violets it * down from a mountain and * through the forest * over white * that * like * through the * water i had never seen another * so clear and so * pure a * would now and then drop from a tree * over would * and dance a moment in the air * * to the water and * like a little boat with a * of * hopes bound for a wide unknown sea as i watched the * and listened to their soft * there came to my thought some * of * i had seen in a * * lucy * an assumed name i had supposed as it was in the days of * pen names there was the same * music in the lines as in the * of the * and the * of thought and expression were of the same * * meeting miss * i spoke of what i had though about her name and she told me that it was from the old family name * the home of the * i do not like it myself as a name to write under she said for the reason that it is so * to be taken for a cover of a * * lucy * s home was by the sea about ten miles from the * of * * but she * to me what she regarded as the * fact that she did not love the sea as much as the mountains of course i love the sea she said i am never tired of the * that * in like * and * back and * in the * i like to see the great waves go by with * shining silver in the sun the grand * that * out from the heart of the ocean * me with * but i do not need the sea as i need the mountains they are so strong they give protection just by standing like a * wall between us and any possible foe they are like a great soul reaching up to the sky miss * seemed to me the great soul that * * she was so calm and steady and * by the * that at times * * * and i tried to tell her my thought she looked * and said i am only a very small * of grass growing at the foot of the mountain and looking up to my * the beauty of the sea was * to her and brought to us * * through her * high * and the year at * the sea is a dream today the sky is a * * of * * and gray in a new england * she felt as she expressed it that she was just taking a little journey * into her childhood and the young * spent in the * * where her first writing was done as a * to the * offering from which a volume of * was made and published in london under the title of mind among the * in a course of * on * delivered in paris one * was devoted entirely to the * and * of the * which was * the * of the * * this was not the least useful period of lucy * education for in it she learned many * of patience * and * it cannot be known how much of her strength of character and * * are due to those early years when she * the * of work and life as she * her perfect * with the passing of * * there went from earth a soul so great that one is * to * by the effort to measure the height and * of the * thought that came to humanity in the brave strong * heart of the * gentle soft * angel of the battlefield she had just returned from a great foreign war when i first drew near enough to her to feel the * of her * love and sympathy how did you first make up your mind to do this great work i asked i did not make up my mind she replied with a smile of * at my question things came to me as if ordered by a * power when i was a * child afraid of all things my brother had an illness that was thought to be * in my care for him i lost all thought of * and lived only in my love for him and sympathy with his suffering for two years my life was * absorbed in * him and while i was happy and * when he came back to life and health i felt as if my work was over it was not to be over until you had * your mission i never had a mission and dont know what i could have done with one but * always had all that i could possibly do and as soon as one thing was done another stepped in you were one of the first to * when the war began were you not my * was so * that i had no thought of going out with the army until i was on the field i was in washington when the wounded were brought in from baltimore under the care of dr joseph * of * plain whom i saw here in your home for the first time since that awful day i went to the station to meet the soldiers and their pain and their courage took possession of me and i felt that the opportunity to help them was all that life held for me when they began to think again and memories of home came to them it was a joy * to write to their loved ones and tell them that all was well so the dear ones at home would send * for their boys and ask me to see that they went to their * and in a little while * of things were coming to me to be * where needed soon it became necessary to carry supplies for the wounded to the front then came the battlefield with all its horrors and the long fight with death the victory or the * at the end in it all i learned that life is the giving of * to save others you are so brave that you can face any danger * i brave it always seems strange when * calls me that i am the most * person on earth i think i was always afraid of everything except when so absorbed in * the unfortunate that thought of * was impossible i never could * myself in any way except when some one was to be * from danger or pain even now i would rather work on the field with * flying around me or * the guns in battle than * at a public meeting * * was a christmas * to the world and was most * * with the spirit of that holy day on which she came to humanity many women win admiration and fame in the exercise of various * but none other has come so near the great * heart of life as she who brought help and comfort not on the battlefield alone but wherever sorrow and * had brought * from her * home in * * her soul passed beyond to the * spirits who through sorrow and * had found eternal life over almost * roads loving friends took her back to her childhood home in one part of the route it was necessary to go by wagon through * and snow and the progress was very slow one of the * group urged the * to make all speed he could to catch a boat he promised to use his best effort and asked who was in the coffin upon being informed he said * * she saved my fathers life when he was wounded in battle do not be afraid do not be afraid i will take you there in time so on her last journey the angel of pain was helped along the way by a grateful heart when colonel robert e lee of the united states army decided to cast in his lot with his native state his wife said to him * way you go will be the path of duty you will think it right and i shall be satisfied she bravely kept her word though years later she could not * the * if i could forget my old home i think i should be happy to forget the * and the * * of arlington with its * of washington * which had come down to the mistress of that magnificent home from her great grandmother * custis washington was an * her thoughts often turned back to the stately mansion and the * trees and the clear * of * * down to the river as she sat in her richmond home in a room looking out upon a * * by * trees and * * and * for the soldiers which was all that she could do to help for she could not leave her chair except when she was carried she and her daughters in one month gave # * of * and * to one brigade though she was an * and her daughters worked in the city * i am * there is one thing i can do she said putting a * finished pair of * on the * which represented the days work who else can do it so well and so quickly t no one else has so much experience other people can do other and more important things none of us can do anything as important as you do in * us an example of patience and * but are you not in your heart wild with joy when general lee * i am * my dear i know the general always does his best and am * to be quiet when he * and calm when he * mrs lee took up a pair of * and began to * them with fingers so * to work that they never waited upon conversation i * the generals * and give them to the

perhaps that the influence of a mans spirit remains in everything he has touched can you * she asked me not very much i tried to round off a * once lest she should think me * * of useful * i added i

that part but you dont want to put in anything about general lee that is not true the * was * only once after the * parting at the beginning of the war did she see that dear home for which she so * all the * that had once made it an * garden of dreams had changed to * that * the sad old place and * * * early days she and her boy * robert lee had * an avenue of trees that * their * in after years she could not endure the * and said let me get a drink of water from the spring and then take me away she spent some days in alexandria and on sunday the young men carried her chair into christ church that she might join in the service where her great grandmother had * and where george washington was a * in all the lexington years she was a prisoner to pain and general lee would always bring in at the * the most beautiful event of the day to * her * life mrs lee he said once i i have such a nice thing to tell you today i have had a letter from one of my boys and he tells me that he is going to

things in your life my dear miss * and still you always remain the same my most * visit to the north was made in the beginning of the war when i was called to new * by the illness of my * who was the wife of an officer on the staff of general scott the newspapers promptly * me as a spy * me the high * of * me as brilliant enough to take in the plan of a * at a glance and * enough to act as the * in * and daring * they asserted that i was sent by general beauregard to * the * and by mr james m * to * up the * the only association i found with humanity outside of our own household was in * early mass * i was * of going early to church to * with my * existence was * there but dangerous and any attempt to escape would have led to my arrest some sisters who thought that i would * in getting away * brought letters written by * and mothers to their husbands and sons in richmond * i dared not try to take them but learned them by heart and afterward had the good fortune to keep my promise to give the * to the prisoners through the kindness of a friendly northern officer i went to richmond and found myself in about as bad a position as i had held in the north for i was taken * spy sent by the government at washington on the way i found my work while waiting on a steamer on which we had taken * after an accident to our own boat a number of wounded men were put * i spent the rest of the waiting time in * the * and left them in good care when i went on my way oh how well i know what you were to the hospital service in richmond my dear thank you i did try to do what i could and for all alike it made no difference whether a wounded man was northern or southern if he suffered and needed care our men had the same spirit and when we divided supplies with the * in the city * would send them the white bread saying that northern soldiers were not used to corn bread and could not eat it we had never heard of the red cross in those days but miss * hospital was * on the same principles it made no difference what cause a man supported the fact that he was suffering brought to him warm sympathy and * aid * just had such a sweet visit with * davis we talked of you and she said beautiful things about you yes we are good friends when i was in paris a few years after the war closed mr davis wrote me that * was there in school and asked me to call on her she was * to see * from home who knew and loved her people and asked many questions about the war but what happened just after the war she asked what did papa do first # i was too little then to know anything about it and no one has ever told me what happened next after the war closed i saw that she had been * kept in * and did not tell her but wrote to mr davis asking him why she had not been told the truth he replied that he did not wish his daughter to know anything that had happened to him after the fall of the confederacy because this * country and he wanted her to live in it and love it and she never could if she knew what he had suffered when i went to see miss * on her * * i found her lying on the sofa * the unusual * by saying that she was not feeling quite so well as usual she spoke of a * article which she had written some years before and said that she would go upstairs and get it as her maid did not know where it was i begged her not to make the effort but she said that she was in the habit of walking upstairs and was not so ill as to be unable to go so she went and soon came down apparently on the feet of * which i thought doing well for one of her ill days but she always was the * woman i knew whatever she might say of her years on her * * she received her friends giving them the welcome of one in the full * of health and * and * every moment of the day a short time later she passed from earth when my soldier was in command of the department of virginia and north carolina and our home was in petersburg i knew and loved the beautiful and brilliant mrs * so well known for years in old washington the deep interest with which i listened to her stories of life in the capital * her to tell me many memories of what was to her the * time she had ever known * a wide * to those dark days of war and * she told me that she had known the little * of * and my cousin mr * * of virginia who were good friends it was an * * in * to see them together judge * the * man in washington and mr * almost a * in height and with weight in * the judge really had the fixed idea that he would be president some day and had already considered the * which he would * upon his friends passing the white house with his tall friend mr * he asked with a * wave of his hand toward the home of presidents * what do you want me to give you when i go there to live * not a thing * replied mr * with his * little * not a thing * take me on your knee and call me * * all mrs * laughed * at the mental picture of that * * on the knee of the little * when * made her * in * mr * listened for a while in a * way and then asked me what is it all about i told him that it was * bride of * set to music he * * and asked with * interest whose bride was she where did she live i told him i was afraid that she was only a * and that she never lived * then i dont see what she is for he replied in a tone of disappointment and turned away * his interest lay in * * information and if * was not an * fact of life he did not want to hear about her even through the * of the most glorious voice on earth mrs * or s experience and the * of her observation seemed very wonderful to me and i said i wonder if i shall ever go to washington and see great * and * if you do child it will all be different she said sadly the old life will not come back and the old friends are gone you cannot see washington * with his * atmosphere and the melancholy * that always * him like the * of * in an old * why are people who write * things always sad * for the reason that we do not see the * of life until most other

of the confederacy and lived many years after its fall to give to the reading world beautiful pictures of the * and shadows that had fallen over her life miss * was the faithful * of the life and character of old new england as is mary * * of the new england of today the daughter of the village doctor the little * * * absorbed the life of her * as she drove with her father when he made his *

up that long brown road leading off to * places in some * * when the * call was long and the * * away i would go into the yard and play with the children who always brought me something new in childish character and point of view when people sometimes remark upon the * * of one of my book children i go back in thought to some moment of childish play and say that did not take any work it is just a child i knew once lifted out of those days and * * to my book i ought to be arrested for * because it was nothing else if more people could * to such good effect that crime would become the * * of the age i replied it would be a crime or a * easily * if the world had the * that were thrust upon me without my * a * little country village is just the place to find the real * of life in the

do the village doctor comes nearer than * else to the true springs of village life nearer even than the * of the one little church that points to the only way to heaven for all alike the * however * comes with the * of the spirit life that people like to hear about on sunday * when they * their sunday clothes and come together for their * * and * in the * after service is over but the doctor *
