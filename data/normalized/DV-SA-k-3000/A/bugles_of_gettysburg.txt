the morning come back to me radiant with faith and hope and love even though * sometimes by clouds of war from the memory * made of all those golden dreams that * around my first soldier i take the * to * this little story of * days * * to his * son major george e pickett us army my last soldier whose life * those * days with the present and who came home across the sea from the * * with eyes closed to earth to be forever opened to the light of eternal day half a century has passed since the * of gettysburg first * from height to height over hill and valley the thunder of the red artillery the rush of the * cavalry the * of the advancing infantry * with * roll of * over the field * and torn by shot and shell * and * by the * of friend and foe alike today the * of gettysburg are heard again not by armed men with * * putting a question of * to the * of the sword but a quiet * with the * * of their nature * to sad and * memories of those battle days in which a nation was saved and a nation was lost three persons are standing in the valley looking in * silence at seminary ridge and across the * space to the range opposite as if the long ranks of men who passed over that ground fifty years ago were before their eyes and they heard the * of the guns that made deadly * in the line one of them is an old man * and stooped with a step that has lost its youthful * he is in the * shadows of * * * and yet as he * over the * field the * of the past * in his heart and his * bound again with the * of youth the winds of battle * around him as he follows the flag up that * height to the mouth of the * guns beside him is a * woman with a wealth of gray hair in soft waves around her face and dark eyes that hold sad memories of one who lost his life there her gaze is lifted above the old line of march * * beyond the mountains an officer in the blue uniform of the united states army looks down at her with * love i was thinking my son of him whose name you bear my cousin garnett she said in a tone that * * upon the name she loved the colonel pressed her hand tenderly he was one of the first to answer president * call for volunteers side by side with his father who confederate * as he was had * with him and * the federal blue at his * need he served through the * war and was * in the regular army now he heard * the * of the * notes of those * days and looked * into the future * that it might hold for him the glory even though it threw over him the gloom of those * hills * of the day that seemed to belong to a lost age came * back to the older man here garnett my son is where we marched through the * of destruction up yes up to the very * of * it was terrible terrible magnificent but not war no not war not war the woman clung * to his arm and looked up into his face * and where where over there i think my dear over there he replied in a tone dropped low in tenderness * toward the * edge of the field yes somewhere over there my son is the grave of my comrade to whom i * life and you and all that is good how much the old * word comrade means * as you say it today * the woman the * man stood silent looking * at them both and then across the field * over the vision his father called up of half a century gone yes my son the god of battles who * the * in the * of his hand knew that the safety of the union was the safety of the states and he * that they should be brought back each for each the * of the * of gettysburg will forever carry around the world the fame of lee and of meade of longstreet and pickett and * hill * * * * and * they tell us * of the daring deeds of the philadelphia brigade they sound * over the unknown grave of garnett sleeping where he fell they sound a * for * son * and * his last words as with cap on sword he led his brigade up to the federal guns calling out remember boys remember follow me strike for your homes your * and your * come follow me they * with memories of the brave men of his brigade of his * * magruder * * all of whom were killed and of his * * white * all wounded of colonel charles * * the leader of the * regiment going into battle with the one arm left to him from an early battle of * * * and * yes the * will ever tell of * and * of * and * and * and * and the many who bore well their part here in those fiery days to meet no more till they had passed into the * land with those names that are * upon the page of history go the spirit and the force and the courage of the thousands of * * who reached the last great height of sacrifice and left the memory of the private soldier as a * * to their country the * of gettysburg bear a message of peace today the peace which the battle * and to which it led a soft sweet * of those * has swept over the old battlefield and * the hearts of * * who have become friends it has been the * of the * * ever * the * of friendship and love into which the years have * the mournful sounds of that field of darkness and blood the * have * in * tones * that are clasped across a sea of tears all the more * because of the distance and the darkness over which they have met they played softly around the scene when the sword of an unknown hero who fell on the slope of cemetery ridge was returned upon that field by colonel * of * battery who had kept it through many years * * some one with title to receive that sacred * dropped from the brave hand that bore it with honor * death they rang out in * music when the sword of * was returned to picketts men beside the * which * the spot where it fell from the hand that had borne it through fire and blood to the * * of the high * at gettysburg and which fell * when that * * above the plain over the range of hills and around the desolate * of the round * that keep solemn guard over the ground on which the greatest chapter of our history was written the * of the * of gettysburg yet * with * memories of the days that * those hills to * and to the three who stand there together hand clasped in hand eyes * with tears this is the story the * tell he * news is that virginia has * yes i wonder what the captain will do the young lieutenant sitting just within the door raised his head as the * passed the lines of his mouth drew * and his brown eyes * almost to black whatever the captain may do there is only one thing the lieutenant can do he said to himself * only one thing and it is like * out the hearts blood to do it the one thing that the lieutenant could do must be done at once the first * east must carry his resignation to the war department but at what cost at what * cost he sat long in the * * out upon the flag * * from its staff the waving of its red white and blue folds * him as in the * times he could not recall a day when that * had not been to him a sacred thing there came memories of * days in his home city when he watched it * in the wind borne at the head of a long line of veterans of # * the * they had won in their * youth he remembered the ambition that filled his heart as he thought that some day he too would be one of a long blue line to * * battles the old time at west point its * and * its work and fun its * dreams they all came back now that the old life was done and over them all the old flag had waved before his hearts vision waved another flag deep blue bearing the * * * * the * of virginia mother of states mother of presidents and nearer and * to him mother of his home and of all most loved by him over mountain and plain across * and forest came that loved and loving voice come back to virginia come home come home come back to virginia he would answer the call through all the long and weary miles that lay between the * coast and the dear old state that called him what would she think * * his promised wife surely she would know that it had taken the news long to reach him surely she must realize that the return home would require many weeks yet she might wait and wonder and * over his delay when virginia called him would she doubt and the captain his beloved captain * on knees he * his head in his hands how could he meet the * which would look out of those * eyes when he announced his determination to * from the service under the flag they had both loved so well and suppose it were more than * suppose his superior officer * in his devotion to duty should consider him a * should * his leaving the post should place him under arrest he rose * with white lips and set * he would go at once before his courage failed he found captain pickett * for a dinner at governor * a handsome figure in his * uniform erect as a young pine * as a * his * eyes gray with * of blue in * * glittering like * when he led his men to battle * in moments of deep emotion now flashed out * * as he smiled a welcome perhaps captain you may * the * on which i have come you have of course heard the news of virginia that she has * yes he spoke in the low tone that had been called a velvet * around a charge of * there was a pause jasper * * his hat * * conscious that he was * like a * he * himself to the effort it was * news to me he said i have been * with myself for hours he paused again perhaps the captain would say something would ask a question but the captain was waiting with official courtesy for the * man to tell his story i have loved the flag the union so well * voice was not quite steady i had thought that they would always be as dear even * as the years went by and now this comes and * things so # seem to love my country as much or * only knows how it * to have to choose but virginia the state that gave me * and my father and grandfather before me she needs me she calls me he took a step forward as if he saw a vision his voice broke and sank almost to a * she calls me and i cannot choose but go he stepped back and * himself against a chair forgive me captain he bowed i beg your pardon be seated lieutenant there was no change in the * tone but the * face was white be seated please and after a moment have you anything further to say only this captain pickett i should like to add that as it has been no small part of my happiness in the army to be under your command so the leaving of that command is no small part of my * in * from the army i have been proud very proud of my captain i am sorry more than sorry to go again he bowed with military * and now i must not * you longer i should not have come at such an hour he awaited permission to retire but it did not come there is no haste lieutenant there is still time before dinner the captain spoke * and * with an * * lying on his desk for use as a * then he rose and began to * back and forth in the * space between the walls you know of course lieutenant that i also am a * yes captain did you suppose did you think that i should not be * that it would be no struggle for me to remain with the flag we have served together so long his head was bent and jasper could not see his face i could not judge for any but myself captain he said at length in other circumstances i should have come to you and * you and been * by the course you took * have a mother and sister in virginia they and the old home must be guarded * have a * the woman who is to be my wife has no brother to fight for her there are many reasons why i should return when my state calls me captain pickett still * slowly back and forth hands behind him paused before the lieutenant and raised his head lieutenant * he said i too have * with myself have felt my * * to breaking point as i thought of the old flag have heard virginia calling calling he put his two hands on the * shoulders and i too cannot choose but go they stood thus * into one * eyes then lieutenant * fell * my captain he whispered the captain turned slowly to his desk and laid his hands heavily on a large official * i * this a few moments before you came he said in a low tone it * my resignation from the united states army god forgive me but it must be so he held out his hand and the two soldiers who had * so much clasped hands now said the captain we are no longer officers of the united states army we are soldiers of virginia with no * of rank between us one in devotion to her service after the lieutenant had gone the captain stood long in sad * not like one who * but as a man who takes leave of all his past life he thought of the man who had first made the * of his youth the * of his * a heavy * came with the memory how that dear old friend now the head of the nation the man at the * of the ship of state would * when he knew that at the parting of the ways his * had taken the opposite road he recalled his first experience of the * of war the war with mexico which had first * his youthful * that his country could not even by a * be anything but right the memory of those early days of battle returned through the years the * march over * roads under * * the rush up * heights to * * then came the * of the * * the sharp * conflict the triumph and * part that he loved the * of the * to a higher life a knowledge of the ways of peace of something better than * * and the * of enemies whatever might come to him in after life he should remember with joy that he had brought some of the light of knowledge into the lives of the children of the * and the flag waved over it all always the flag always its blue sky with the fixed stars shining down and its red and white folds waving in the * always the flag * leading on to victory always the flag the flag he winds were * the dust of * * into the face of a man who had just * from a * steamer and was walking up clay street from the * old * his hat was * low upon his forehead his gray * almost hidden by its * he was * a strong front against the wind like one used to battle so absorbed was he in the conflict and so * by the dust that he did not see a fellow * coming in the opposite direction until made aware of him by a sudden * which thrust them both into the friendly * of an * entrance where they looked at each other * * cried he of the * * it possible how very remarkable after * our * they clasped hands in a way that * not only * friendship but a * * so strong that it needed not words to * its * it is indeed remarkable captain * been * how on earth we should find each other yes i * able to leave the post five days after you as i * and through that i * a boat * only just got in i was going to hunt for you but had no idea where to begin the wind swept around the corner and * off with the * hat which his companion caught and restored to its * then with a start of surprise he said it is you captain all right but * without his * * without his * * he went on what on earth did you do it for how did it * i * do it for it was an accident an accident you dont say so yes just before i left the post i went into the * to have my hair * as usual and it seems the * was a new man he says he asked me about it and i said yes or * something he took to be yes i was naturally very much absorbed in thought and perhaps i did * i noticed nothing till my * lay on the floor but * realized since that it was a good thing perhaps it * be safe for me to be standing talking to you here otherwise i suppose not and we must get away as soon as possible but dont * captain your own mother * recognize you when * not speaking i knew your voice but if i had seen you before you spoke i never in the world should have * that it was you this * wind has its * then it has saved us our search for one another but you * oh * safe enough as you see * * it and nobody but a faithful friend with eyes and heart like yours would know me come * go over to * * * * that sounds rather too * and * of * for a pair of rough soldiers it is * and * of * at any * and we can get a spread and a * of good * and * our souls in golden memories before the * events become too heavy to be forgotten into the driving wind they went again crossing to washington street and passing the * house to * * where they secured a table in an * hidden by a * it was the * time between * and dinner and most of the * were deserted later two men in the uniform of the united states army came in and took * at a table near them looking carefully around the room and afterward * their heads together over a piece of paper * * good * graceful form long * brown hair gray eyes with * of blue fair * * appearance one of them * after * his third glass hair is always * it might be cut eyes ought to have a * * but if sometimes blue and sometimes gray how the * can you tell fair * all right unless he * * probably he does * hidden behind the * exchanged * with his companion and * waited till their * were gone as they went down the street they saw the two officers opposite at the corner the captain and jasper turned down a cross street the * men followed as if they too might have been * going in that direction when they reached the next corner the * turned again and looked the officers still followed them at the next turning were two men fighting a group of street * * the way * * the * the captain and jasper had the satisfaction on looking back of seeing the unknown officers caught in the * and * to the * while the * were * themselves jasper drew his companion down a flight of steps into a * apartment the room was empty and jasper hurried through it holding the captain by the hand they passed through the door on the opposite side and came into the open street where they called a * giving an order to the * they * up the street they did not see a dark man of * * who looked in vain for another * and went his way * * done said the captain that comes of knowing your * * i am taking you to my quarters when you * upon the importance of quiet you will understand that they cannot be of a magnificent description but they will give us a safe * tomorrow the uncle * will set * for new york and two * very much unknown will be among the * see i shall * the name of our host of this afternoon and become * * a * * and you you shall be a * * from * and from the * century you look enough like it and your * will come in place what name shall you take they talked and * far into the night but were up * and went early * the uncle * they stood together and watched the * * come up the * jasper made * * in an * though captain pickett * him that their conversation must be limited and of the most * character * * * a * and hungry look whispered jasper as a tall spare man his * hat low over his eyes and his * * in his * passed them with a keen glance a few feet away the man turned and again looked at them but captain pickett clever in his part of * * * at him and he went on the ship * * and the long weary * began she was * out of sight of land before it began to be whispered about that two of her * were of unusual interest even in that * crowd one was * * a * whose * * * the * of the * * the other was * * from south europe a slender graceful man having but slight acquaintance with the english language he would listen to the stories of his * companion now with interest and again with * as a confusion of new words would * the * of the narrative when alone he would take his * and sing a * * of france or a * * playing an * as he sang a group of music * would * round him in * * to the * of his * or the melancholy of his love songs lieutenant have you an enemy the two * stood in a * part of the boat and trusted themselves to speak naturally i hope so captain i should not like to be so * as not to have one but an * enemy i mean one who * you * as a supreme object in life like the * in the play on the * of the noble hero i have never * as a noble hero sufficiently to know possibly if i should ever * myself in that way such a * might * it would be necessary as the play could scarcely go on without him i am in dead earnest jasper * #* and this may be a tragedy for you i am trying to * you dont do it not that i am * but you know what the * * say on two days it * not to run from thy grave on the appointed and the * day on the first neither * nor physician can save nor * on the second the * * but what on earth has put it into your head just now that i have what did you call him an * enemy you do not fancy that something is about to * * do you what shadow do you see upon the * it is worse than a shadow it is a * and * looking * that has caused me anxiety for some days the spare man with a dark gloomy * determined face * * in a word why i never saw the fellow before nor i but he * you most * he may be mad but i dont like it and if i were you * be on the * when * around it must be then captain that there is some one on board who does not like me i am grateful to him you * me of him i am even more grateful to you he seems to be one of our own * strange to say he * most * the * of the blessed state to which we are bound i cant think who he is unless it is that * * they call him the * because he is dark and gloomy and * of evil but i beg the * pardon this * is more than that he is thoroughly * and desperate i myself dont know him but have been told that he * me with * * because he is * the * has the * and * to imagine himself in love with one whose heart is in my keeping ah that sounds * though not the less * but stay some one is coming and the captain * gently on his * and turned a melancholy gaze * * the uncle * * * in new york harbor two of her * were standing a little apart from the others silent amid the * of arrival but watching * all that occurred and listening with quiet attention to the conversation that went on around them their anxiety hidden by an air of * interest the dark man they called * stood near them when the * came on board the captain of the ship with the * of one who has had no word from shore for weeks called out * the news its a black * here was the reply and it * * and * till a man * know which way * * * the particular blow today * for * and all that one man just brought here in a boat in * * see * his name * a * * * yes thats it * * started like one who had received a sudden * and his friend * moved toward him as if to defend him from a blow the dark man smiled * i cant help feeling that its kind o * to think of * being brought to for that sort o thing and one with the * too the * captain spoke * but * not saying anything except its a time when it * a man to keep his * close * and * the shore the two quiet * had no * to * them he of the * * having left all papers and * in the care of the british officers who had occupied * * with him and jasper having abandoned in * * everything that could have * him they left the ship * meeting a half hour later at a * point above the * from which they walked on along the waters edge where are we going jasper new york ought to be big enough to afford us a * of safety somewhere yes but well have to be careful where we * there are * of * bars on which to * our * and * enough to * us to the * i see you think we are * upon an unknown sea almost captain though i do know one harbor * it is kept by an old sea captain who is laid up now but never * * from the ocean he must be where he can hear it roll and see it * up its waves to the sun he would be * without that so he * down here in a place called * rest he says because * have never been known to rest there he is out of * has never been in says he found the water * enough for him the silent man knew that his friend was talking against time talking against thought talking against feeling he took his hand and gently spoke his name the two went on in silence until they reached * rest where they were received by a * old * * and * with a walk like the * of the waves jasper * * the storm your uncle the * and i have * together and * the * * taken over waves that * as gently as a * jasper introduced his companion and the * went on * both as welcome as a * morning after a * night and you captain pickett i am as glad to see you as if you had * the * with us he led the way upstairs with * * of delight when they were in his * he shut the door and turned to jasper with a serious look i know about uncle said jasper i heard it as i * you * cast * here very long * nothing you can do and * only make things worse by getting * yourself he has * here and * do everything that can be done to get him into safe water again i know you will do all that is possible ill set your * for a safe harbor where you can look around a bit and get your * of course they cant do anything to the * * to keep him in the hold * i thought * rest was as good a harbor as could be found said jasper it looks like it but loyal as i am and quiet as i am they have an eye on my place for some reason a * below called the old * away and his guests heard him saying on with your serious * and * coat * he went on down the * and his voice came back to them in * to apparently * visitors officers is it you want you wont find * here what do you think i want o * * and * things around * rest this is a peaceful harbor for * * to * into and put up for * you wont find anything here but * gone to * and * on their last * i suppose you will let us look around over your upper * will you not this young man was on the boat with them and heard them * to come here * no one come yet but go right ahead no wait better ask old * first * a sick man up there * straight for * world with a * * * him in and you might have to step in quiet here comes the * * these gentlemen want to go up * they cant unless they want to have murder on their souls after a moments * they decided to give the sick man his one chance and * the * returned to his guests i made them believe old * * was a * and he * know a * from a * but its getting rough weather here for you * a * coming up from the north and * better up * and * before the wind to a * port none of your * up this way seem to be very safe replied jasper well you might have struck a * landing than this but * a * * up in the city * to a ship of * away up among the high * * * you along into * * and land you on to * where the green * of peace will lie all around you the * * mentioned by the old * was the * of a popular church in new york though he was of a northern family brother of a man * won * in the federal army his * went out to the south many a * * * to offer his sword to his country had been * and helped on his way by the * * the two soldiers knew of the minister and his friendship for their cause and gladly followed the suggestion of their friend so often had similar * occurred that dr * was not surprised that morning to receive a call from the two who were * from the * * of the otherwise * north george pickett and jasper * you say good names names that are both dear to me nevertheless i am not sure that i am glad to see you for the atmosphere here is not very * for such as you my friends any atmosphere should be * where you are doctor ah if it were said the minister i would * it all over the country and * * and good * you are doing useful work as * in making a * of * and safety for those who are * to the defense of their homes and * i do the little that god has given me the power to do but come you have not * no our late host generous as he #* had good reason for not * upon our company at breakfast then you shall give me that pleasure breakfast is served and i hope we may be allowed to take it in peace but the good man was not permitted to realize his hope they had just taken places at table when the bell * and the host * himself returning he said they have begun early today it is the third time within a week that my house has been thus * come down this hall and find a * outside while my faithful butler looks for the * which he has * dropped he * them through a * into a small garden * by a high wall * to two men who were * to a * a * which had been torn * by the wind the * came promptly forward as if accustomed to such * and put their rough * and * upon the * saying quick take our places at the roses and disappeared the officers and their * guide having reached the diningroom in their search looked from the window and saw two men who seemed absorbed in * raising the window one of them called have you seen any men going through here this morning no sir said jasper we aint * nobody he spoke with a * * and * * with his hat the other * looked on with an expression of curiosity as if but half * what was said returning to the library the officers took an * leave of dr * that is all right gentlemen said the doctor these times require * * good morning when the * * were gone dr * invited the * * to return to their breakfast at the close of which he said i hope you will not think it * if i * your going at once it is sometimes far more * to speed the parting guest we thank you doctor with all our hearts for this the * * but the question is how are we to get away * a friend is leaving for * i have just sent a message to him * his departure by a day or two his love for me and * to our cause is * you will be safe with him go to virginia by way of * it is a case in which the * way around is the * way home he laughed that evening george pickett and jasper * took the train for * every revolution of the * carrying them farther and farther away from the home and friends they were so eager to reach he dim old library at * lawn was very cool and quiet the sun which all day had * somewhat too * down upon the thick * and closed * now sent his last * * * through the wide * windows one of them * silently * by * at last touched the * face of a girl sitting in a low chair by the * she glanced at the west windows then closed the book which had * * on her knee it was useless to try to read she had not turned a page since first sitting down some twenty minutes before she walked slowly to the end of the long room and stood with her hands behind her looking * she did not see the wide * nor the fields beyond she saw * of miles away the northern camp * * above it were the once beloved stars and * she saw the long ranks of men in blue and among them preparing to fight perhaps already fighting against his home his friends his brothers was the man she loved dear god could she bear anything so horrible surely her heart must break surely some terrible illness must * her * to * out consciousness memory * why shut up in the library cousin kate * been looking for you everywhere oh is that you garnett she turned with a * smile as he crossed the room i thought you were busy * been trying to read why trying if you are not in the * oh because it * do to think too much i cant keep my thoughts from those of our boys who * come home yet * have come you know from all over the country but there were a good many on the * coast and nothing has been heard of them there is captain pickett for one it surely cannot be that he would remain with the north and yet where is he no one has heard no one has any idea it seems so terrible not to know * it she was silent for a few moments there are others we know * lieutenant * of * the big place over by the gap i dont believe * ever met him the family * the place and came there when you were away his mother and sister are nearly wild some one but an enemy of his sent word that he was seen in new york days ago so he must have come east and his not coming home looks so * can you imagine anything that would * him that would * any one after landing there are always * cousin mine and of course if our men walked out with french leave they may not have been allowed to * you know if they deserted to put it * they are * to arrest and what then the words were only a * he glanced at her white * face then closed his big hand over her small one as it hung at her side nothing perhaps he said * a few days * or a mere * probably you really think so cousin garnett she looked up at him like an eager child he turned away his head he was not used to lying this * young soldier surely cousin mine but why * tender sympathy over * and * you have hardly seen when they may not be in need of it and god knows he added * we may all be in * need of it before many * have passed how * * blessed are those of us for whom your special prayers will * ah kate if i might go into battle tomorrow with a word of more than * affection if you would give me hope hope i will wait for years if it need be i wont * you if you will only tell me that i carry your love with me when i go can * * me that you have had my love so long the girls eyes filled with tears garnett dear dear garnett i do love you but not that way please dont be unhappy about it and you make me unhappy too and we should have only sweet tender memories of your last evening before you go out to fight for us you go to fight for the south garnett above all but you have no sister when the other men are thinking of their mothers and sisters if they seem to be fighting for them i shall be * proud if you will think of me we have been more to one another than cousins garnett dear you have been to me the brother i have never had and i perhaps to you the sister who died when you were little you may fight for the south and and for me dear cousin she turned to the window where the * was * her voice sank and each morning and evening wherever i am i shall pray for you that god may bless and keep you and bring you back to us he bent and kissed her two hands * it is as god * he said gently though i may not have your heart i am more than blessed in having your prayers he left the room slowly as if * to go the girl still stood by the window he was very dear to her this soldier cousin it hurt her to give him pain she wondered * how girls could glory in their * when it hurt so much she thought of one man whose * had frightened her the only one among many for whom she had felt no * when she refused him she had since heard that he had * * upon jasper what a * what a * step to take it was he who had sent word that jasper had returned to the east but remained in the union army she lifted a white face dear god make it not true make it not true from * our * rode * keeping to * wilderness and mountain roads after some days they struck a narrow pass in the * mountains where the range * the golden fields of old kentucky from the * lands of tennessee a storm had swept down upon the heights and a * of strong winds * itself * over the * gray * and against the * walls of the dark * * flashed into the black * and * * from wall to wall like the * of guns in a great artillery battle riding through the pass the captain and jasper stopped under a * * * themselves from the * * of rain i say captain well this * seem like * kentucky it does not when kentucky was * all the * * which might have been scattered through her and * into the hearts of her people were * up along the * line where nobody but * like you and me need ever meet them * kentucky is down there on the * green and gold * where the people open houses and hearts to all who come their way jasper looked * down

with the * celebrated in their song the * of a * expedition against a * farm where the remains of last years * were * a * of voices * * and * joined * jasper * in the * * * * * * * * * how * * * * they fell to with renewed * as the * of their song rolled from tree to tree and out over the river jasper finished his * and lay looking * through the * of the great oak that spread its * over him singing with * * * * * to a gray * * at him from the * of the tree it * off to a very high * from which it * an * and * it * the cup on the * face of the * man who * by throwing the empty shell of the

two were one was he who on the * of september nearly two years before had * in the army of the confederacy and on the following day had been * captain now he was commander of a division of longstreets corps his hair long and * now floated in the wind like a * he was not above * height and the lines of grace he * followed suggested that his * in the drawingroom might be no less * than those he had won on the battlefield his face was of that * which * the * effect of sun and the * * of time an expression of * thought was the only change that had come to it in nearly two fiery years which had passed since that wild ride from the north into the * storm born of a race of * * in military art * in camp and * and on the field a boy soldier in the land of the * * the flag from the hand of his fallen friend captain longstreet and carrying it to the height of * a determined man * with slender force the gate of the west to a foreign foe he looked not like one to * in * deeds because of the wide and deep and high humanity * all * * as the spirit of god * supreme over the world as he came riding down from the west his form was * * against the red wine of the sunset that * in crimson * upon an * sky the general * one of the * * * on the * the cry swept from group to group and the air was * with cheers the * raised his cap and the smile that * his face brought the rare blue * to his

lees old war horse whose corps was said by the federals to be the terror of their army the * officer put his horse at speed and was soon beside the tall handsome corps commander how are you pickett said the lieutenant general * his hand on the shoulder of his companion the two rode on together talking not as commanding and * officer but as old friends who had met * on the road of life you saw her last evening asked the older man turning his * eyes upon his friend eyes that were stern and * except when the * of his * made them * with * the * was in them now you gave her my message she sent

and over * and past * * of nights just for a look and a word and come * back to the field with the first * of morning a look and a word but they are worth the * ride that ever soldier took they rode on in silence for * then general longstreet said if we go into the north but what do you think of the plan i think not well of it nor i i cannot take the cheerful * presented by one of our * that * has at last * to come down and take a proper view of the situation i like not to strike at other * homes said the * officer to defend my own i think my sword would of itself * out of its * his hand went to his side the lieutenant general was filled * with * that so slight a hand could * so heavy a sword but he had seen the * of that * in the front of the battle like * in a storm and men * after its * to the * of death to choose our ground and let the enemy attack us is the way to win as at fredericksburg said general longstreet there was a battle i dream nights of the glory of that day and hear general lee say it is well that war is so terrible else we should become too fond of it it must have a horrible * if it could * him when every man who is killed is a personal loss and sorrow to

paused a moment both led to * the left * and * more time the right * and * by * she turned to the right and had * a short distance when she heard voices and the tramp of horses behind her the * ceased and she heard the * * the question of which path to take after a short * they rode to the left you can tell us the way to * if you will well cut it then and come to the point and tell us about the road * you what do you mean by telling us all this * i wonder if you are telling us the truth old man uncle * * on his way satisfied that one young confederate officer * his life to him * was riding

and he fell * the * * clung around him with * hands of * a bird * and * out a * to the night he passed a narrow path that made a * into the woods and came back to the main road a short distance ahead a man who was following him came to this point and * into the side path at the * he awaited the approach of * who was * from his * by the * of a ball over his head when you have succeeded in * your pistol at me you will please be so good as to explain who you are and why you are making so * an effort to murder a man in the dark take all the time you want and dont be frightened i have no pistol

some one else give it to uncle * she said and tell him not to forget my message throwing his * to * he entered the * tent darkness yet * inside and on a small table was a * * which had burned nearly down to the * * that served as a * its * light * over a * spread upon the table above which two men were * in * study a majorgeneral seated on a * and a * looking over his shoulder the * was tall and * with dark face deeply marked as if each experience of life had * its line in the history written on his countenance there was nothing of the reckless * of the * * in his * yet one looking at him felt that when the time should come he would lead a * hope to the mouth of the guns and fall before them it must have been in a * * of youthful spirits that he had made an * upon his comrade * a early at west point and had been * from that * institution for such * * of * the man sitting at the table leaned back and looked up at his companion do you know * he said i am * the true value of a war * delighted to know that it has a value pickett i have always thought that the one * to the theory set forth by the poet nothing * with * feet was the man who attempted to follow a war * just so the real value of a war * is in * out with * one of the many * * of the country and * it beyond the limits of the possible leaving us free range to choose among the rest i used to fancy that if an earth man should be turned * on * * would lead him somewhere since this war began i have learned more about the * of the race once on the chickahominy i sent for immediate * a detachment of picked men started out under the * of one of the most accomplished officers in the service they marched all night and in the morning found themselves * of the camp from which they had started what had become of you pickett in the * i had caught another detachment which had been ordered * and had * due south till it * fell in with me yet our men have * over this region since the days of their * ah here is colonel * jasper * and handed a paper to the general thank you colonel you carried my message promptly and have returned earlier than i expected my return was hastened general by the necessity of * a pressing invitation from our northern friends to remain with them for a time northern * is occasionally * to the busy * in haste to get on with his work i * your strength of mind in * their * colonel jasper * and withdrew returning to his tent where * had prepared a breakfast that did honor to his title of * general * kate returned home the next morning she found her father in his office leaning back in his big * * a * * * a young man whose face she could not see was talking to him black * was sitting on the floor making other * of * and * them to long * * * * here comes my * where have you been you little * nobody on the plantation could tell me where you were come * account for your early morning ride but first here is a surprise for you how do you do cousin kate said the surprise i am

* sight of home * how does it go garnett dear is it very terrible yes god only knows how terrible but i could not bear not to be among the others there has never been a war in our country without a * in it fighting for his flag the fight was never for a flag but for an idea said colonel * the old idea still lives * under our new flag a sectional party * a sectional president who declared war without the authority of congress and * the sovereign states whose only * was that they asserted their right and power to fight for their own union under the constitution which their * had made if you and my cousin will excuse me ill go and change my habit while you * * but remember there is but one flag for me the stars and bars and but one idea freedom * waved her hand to them and passed out into the hall and up the * the gaze of the young man following her till she disappeared god bless the women * the old colonel they will save the south in spite of the devil if you only had a * now * true and * southern girl like your cousin garnett looked over the head of * and across a * slope * by a dark * of woods he did not see the trees nor the slope nor the sun he saw only a radiant face with a * of deep eyes the same eyes that had smiled back at him as * went up the * here is a * for each of you said kate returning with a * * at the throat of her white dress and two * in her hand * what is in store for you cousin i am going to take you to * * ball tonight could you get an invitation for me at this late hour invitation they would * my hair out if i did not bring you how delightful to dance with the dear soldiers who come in their * and look oh so handsome just as you do * * the * may be somewhat * from hard wear to be sure but nothing can keep a confederate soldier from being beautiful and well there never were such * * else in the whole world i * know any but our crowd were within a days march yes one of the regiments is * down in the * for the night on the way to join picketts division the ball is given for them all we are afraid of is that the yankees will find it out but i dont think they will * sent too many men north to take any * usually we have dry bread * but * * found a * today and brought home a great * of * and we are to have a * tonight how delightful and you are to wear a white dress and a red rose of course they are my colors they are my colors too that evening he was at the foot of the * when kate came down looking like a white cloud * against a * * of space at the * of her soft white dress was * a * of * of battle roses what * * you * * wear this * belonged to one of my * away back in the * she wore it at a ball in the court of * the * and * with prince * but the roses * today and belong to the sunshine the roses * in the sunshine of your presence and belong to you as for the * i venture the court lady did not look half so pretty in it as her * does * could tell you better than that * but just you wait till you see * * she has a really and truly new dress * through the lines it is a dream and so is she and you shall fall in love with her that is impossible i have fallen in love oh but old love affairs do not count the carriage rolled through the southern * along a * * and kate * * with the * of youth that * * on whether * * or * of peace * softly soon they were at * gate and in a moment were * away in the light and glow and laughter and music it seems to me that we are * on the * of a * said garnett as he walked with * * between * yes some people have been calling us * and saying * things about our * * because of the * anxiety since general * has been repulsed at jackson and * is in danger but general joe johnston is there and everything must come out right where he is my old mammy * her head when she * me and says * had * an * better be * * * * * stopped suddenly what was that listen * you hear something yes it * like the tramp of horses and the * of * * back to the * they ran upon * whose eyes * in an * of terror as he * cried out lieutenant * signal to camp for the boys at once ladies to the upper rooms * out * by the * commanding tone the girls fled upstairs * * under the table over the * hall darkness fell and * * stood with * bow as if * in * your * hands all round look there is a flag of * said * they are coming to * us to surrender we will die first asserted * * thats easy enough to talk about replied * * colonel * calls upon the confederate officers within to surrender and thereby save the house from destruction called out the * of the flag of * my * to colonel * and tell him that we are much obliged but that we can protect the house without his assistance the * withdrew and soon a * of shot was heard * * were fired from the windows and one of the * fell and was carried away poor fellow said kate always ready to * with misfortune i hope he is not hurt much we have the advantage you see we are in the dark and they in full moonlight oh me they are * and some are going to the back door whispered * and listen the rest of the boys are coming the men from camp came * around the * and the girls waved their * from the window a * of * greeted the * party and the detachment at the rear door joined their comrades in front after a skirmish they retreated to the woods pursued by the lieutenant and his men from the camp and followed by the cheers of the * forces in which the girls joined * * girls cried kate we have won a battle were you frightened asked colonel * coming up the * followed by garnett frightened replied kate it was glorious but that poor fellow who was shot where is he i dont think there was much blood shed at any * no wounded left on the field upon their return to * lawn kate and garnett stopped for a moment upon the * and looked out into the moonlight where the pines were black against the * wall why do beautiful things seem sad asked kate as a south wind swept up from the river and * a * of the * * it across her cheek i suppose it is because we cannot take all their beauty into eyes and heart at once there is a reason though why all this * his arms out toward river and wide white space is especially sad to me tonight because i must say goodbye perhaps for an even longer separation than before oh i hope not surely not i go tonight to join * brigade oh i am so sorry no i dont mean that i am sorry either * glad it is just what i would have you do and then you will see jasper jasper jasper she looked up * yes * you know he was silent for an instant * out into the * of the pines then he said gently * * you cousin mine i knew you would now i want you to do something for me anything to the extent of my power kate jasper is so brave so daring so almost reckless i want you to make friends with him and guard him from the * that he will not see take care of him for me her * face * with love and * but in his eyes was the light of * * he took her hand and lifted it to his lips if my life can * his it will be freely given for your sake thank you both lives will come back to make me happy if god * he said * she watched him ride down the * looking after him until he was hidden in the forest the * empty road lying black across the moonlight as kate finished the letter she looked up * at her father and said oh father if i had only been a boy thank the lord that you are not a boy my daughter do you love me better as i am papa dear if you were my son instead of my daughter even loved as you are now i should give you up though it were to death the army of northern virginia was on the road to * the march was * slow for not even the commander * had any information * the federal movements colonel * had sent for garnett and they were side by side there is something i intended to tell you garnett said about that * fellow who * to keep himself * up with us in the most * way i did not tell you of the first time it was when i had been mistaken for you and put into a prison house to wait for him to pass upon my * the next time was that day in the skirmish as we crossed the line he tried to * a sword into you i thank god i was a * too quick for him and he disappeared just as you * that yankee captain he is the * kind of a * and * said jasper thanks to your friendly * he gives you more trouble than he does me for which i am sorry but i am very grateful to you for * his * hand they passed by fields in which the * * promised a * * of gold garnett thought of the desolate * through which he had marched in virginia the fields were there ready to yield their * to the * touch but the * were gone and there was no hand stretched out to help those * * to * forth and * their * mission the * in which the * * almost touched the ground with the weight of their * * garnett of an * where in * he gathered * red and golden on the road to maryland he had seen it again it was an old battlefield now and the * trees stretched their * gray arms to the sky as if asking the * of heaven on the * of man in this fair and * land * * * away in the * of beautiful trees and looked * out from their * * in virginia the army had passed by * of ashes where in the * days stately homes had given garnett loving welcome by lonely deserted houses that had once been * and bright as they were passing one of these * an old negro * out to * garnett the tears sprang to * eyes only an old servant with his * left to * him now along the road * with * they came to * where there was none to give them welcome or even a passing word they marched quietly through the town their band silent for the order was that no music should be played lest it might * the citizens through an almost deserted street between * of closed houses they went till they were near the limits of the town here several girls who had been drawn by curiosity to the * of a cottage asked for some music and were greeted with the girl i left behind me home sweet home and * * * but these * * were not their idea of southern music and they called for * they were answered by the gentle notes of her bright smile * me still and the division marched on to camp the men carried away pleasant memories of the little town among the hills for the * * did not long resist the courtesy and kindness of the confederate leader and when marching orders came many a word of * followed the southern soldiers to gettysburg hands of the dead * hands of the living dream hands that * but in imagination all seemed stretched forth to garnett and jasper as the old division marched through the woods in which they had halted to * the morning * to the field faces looked out at them from behind the trees faces * in their hearts by memory faces * * on the far * of their fancy was there ever so * a wood as this that lay between their nights * and the fighting line at gettysburg only the * of feet upon the grass broke the * yet was the silence full of sound * of voices and the * of * guns * on the air when they passed through the line of woods * seminary ridge morning yet waited behind the hills the men lay in the long grass and the trees kept guard around them the weary soldiers held the * into which they had thrown themselves as if they might have been stone figures cast aside by an * * some fell asleep others waited * for the dawn the * dawn that ever * into their lives garnett resting on his * looked toward the east where a ridge slightly * the ground on which he lay what was between his fancy could not show how the day had gone he did not know no * had come from the battle except the * * of the guns that had * the air on the road from * the * of * pistol broke the * and sent * * among the hills day was * in with the * * which * its awful * some of the men aroused from their half * looked in the direction from which the sound came a * as of a suddenly * force ready for combat * through * * the man who had been at * lay quiet he was still asleep a * silence fell over the ridge a * that stretched out in * gloom to the sky and reached down to earth after what seemed to garnett a * * the silence was broken by the * of horses coming down the line in the * of dawn he could see the faces of the * and the color of their horses as they rode along every man in the army knew the powerful gray that carried the commander he and his * were one so closely were they * with all the * of the army of the south garnett never saw that stately figure mounted on * without a glow of pride beside him was a * * man he who bore * the title of old war horse affectionately * upon him by the commanding general j * glance swept over these two figures and * on the third of the group * as he had many times * lay the power of that man * than the two with whom he rode slight * formed he was in strong * to his companions he sat his horse with the grace of one who * to win a * from the hand of beauty rather than to meet the foe in deadly conflict his face was almost * fair and his soft dark hair swept * in the morning wind like the hair garnett remembered in a picture at * lawn of a * who sang of the past in the ancient * of his * were ever grace and * so opposed to the rude idea of war as in his person and life history yet men went down into the * * of battle and were * in * of fire for love of him and the glory of following where he led having been * * to silence the men dared not cheer they arose and stood * with * heads as the * rode down the line in silent review the last death review and every eye of the long line was on the slender man who rode the black * and held his cap lifted above his head thus they watched their leader till the shadows * him from view in the grass in front of the forest line they lay through hours of * sun there were no * now each man was * to the heat that poured upon him as from a burning * occasionally one moved * now and then there was a * to a comrade the baby the * soldier in the regiment crept close to garnett and held his hand his yellow * were * * over his head in his eyes were * of * * i want you to do something for me for * i feel that i shall not live out this day * boy * you will live to be * and some day you will hold your * on your knee and tell them of how we won a glorious victory and saved our * the boy shook his head sadly men in our way of life sometimes know there is something in their hearts that tells them * up my boy * up we all have a feeling of that kind in the presence of a great danger we come up out of the conflict with hearts stronger because of the trial and lives better for the victory i dont know what it is but i feel that my heart will be * in this battle and when you march back to the capital of our new nation wont you find my mother and tell her about me and give her this letter oh tell her how * i love her and that the * thing in her boys life is in trying to be worthy of her and in giving the life she gave him to his country ill take the letter of course boy but suppose i should still keep you company at the end of the day there was a long silence and then the man who had been at * turned over and * by george fellows i say this makes me think of what tom august said to * * * that asked the man next him you know the * * on as many * as if * * a * and it was breaking out on him he met tom and said in his * way well sir i suppose your voice is still for war and tom said yes * * still the * place where man can die is where he * for man a * * the awful silence while it * from the hills another shot * out and a cloud of smoke hung over the plain then came a * of artillery and between the two * was a * sea over which a heavy * of smoke waved and * * like a * of * in a * wind the hills trembled with the roar of battle it was as if * * had rushed together in one * conflict through a * ocean of smoke and dust * * * across the field them * things * * to be * straight at a * eyes * one of * men * as a burning shell swept past him a man who was lying near leaped suddenly forward and fell his blood * on * * the * of a shell * by and a little distance from him he saw the earth torn up and heard the dying * of comrades even in the mighty * looking upon the fire and smoke of the most * * the world ever knew garnett * those who had fallen at the * of the battle who could never go down into that sea of * flame and * smoke and charge the * heights on a hill * the valley was the stately form of the commander on his powerful gray horse he turned to pickett mounted by his side and pointed to a * of trees * by a glittering * of artillery and infantry on the ridge opposite general can you take that height i can sir if it can be taken while the roar of the cannon filled the valley and fiery * were still * through the * general pickett came down the line the men sprang to their feet and * as he * to the * hill explained what they were to do cheer after cheer followed him * head was * and a light wind * his hair back as garnett looked at him leading his regiment and across the distance heard a sweet voice say take care of him for me take care of him in camp and on field i promise he had said with all the * with which he would have made a * to his * his * to the woman he loved came back to him with the touch of the south wind and he renewed the promise in his heart to guard with his own life the man who was dear to her what after all was his life in comparison with the happiness of her loving heart a * shell from the opposite ridge struck down a soldier at * side the baby moved quietly in and the line was * the boy looked up and smiled as a child might have looked at his * garnett took his hand and pressed it affectionately it seemed a mournful * that death should have placed them side by side as they were about to march down the fatal slope the soldier in front of him turned to a comrade and said we are to charge that height * * his gaze * he said then this will be a sad day for virginia and * out his arms he called out * goodbye virginia he thought of the little cottage * away in the blue ridge in that beloved old state which * the dreams of his youth and the memories of his * goodbye * through the heart of garnett and a * of dark eyes and a * of a * young form * in white with a crimson * at the throat was the vision that passed before his eyes as he shut them to the * valley and the fiery height the gaze of jasper was directed * to the forest of guns on the hill in front garnett could see only the set * of the head with its stern * lines * that was why all things came to jasper was the same farewell * * in his heart or was he * only upon * that deadly wall beyond garnett watched the graceful form on the black * as their leader took his place at their head his long dark hair * back in the wind forward picketts men started on their * they moved out from the forest * and steadily as if drawn up for a grand review two great armies watched them in * * over on seminary hill the man on the gray horse looked on at the * sacrifice the south was making for its cause on cemetery height the men in blue were silent watching the * scene the * motion of the thousands of * feet had so taken possession of * imagination that he seemed to have been for * walking in that solemn * the * tramp tramp tramp filled all the world * gaze was fixed on the commander far away in front leading his men into the flames of battle with an air of * * and grace such as he might have worn had he led them in * * to * a * he * over the daring that could enable a man to maintain a * like that at the open door of death he thought of what he had heard a commanding officer say give george pickett an order and he will storm the * of * by the silent batteries the old war horse stood with general alexander of the artillery looking with grave face at the long lines moving toward the * valley as they * by he * with a * the * of the officers at the crest a deadly roar and * * from the guns across the valley met them all around men were falling but garnett kept his eyes fixed upon the gallant figure in front and followed the * places were filled and the line passed on down the slope into open ground through the storm of * and shells * from cemetery height as the smoke lifted the sad and silent man standing by the batteries saw the * ranks moving steadily on in * * their guns * in the sun * says it is not so hard to go there said the artillery commander he was nearly there with his brigade yesterday the difficulty is to stay there general longstreet looked across at the dark lines of men and guns on the opposite ridge yes yes that is the difficulty he said but the guns garnett had looked at them with pride and confidence as he passed when their * voices * across the valley they might serve as the * to a * of triumph the guns that was the anxious thought of the corps commander as his gaze followed the men on their * into the valley of death he knew why the guns by which he stood were silent as they * looked down upon a movement which they could not support stop pickett and * the ammunition he said to the artillery commander we cant do that sir was the mournful reply it would take an hour to * it and meanwhile the enemy would * the time longstreet turned from the silent guns to * the * of a tall officer who was leading his brigade down the fatal slope with a start of surprise he recognized general garnett who for days had been following the army in an * he had made his * * him to the saddle and * him there that he might lead his men to the glorious death that * before his vision general * heart leaped at the sight of the friend whom he had not seen for months and following its * he went down the line and joined general garnett and rode side by side with him to the * of the slope there he paused and held out his hand goodbye and good * to you old man he said a soldiers * returned general garnett with * * gaze as if even then he felt the * * of * which would on that day * away the fiery letters in which * had been * upon his * heart the line reached open ground under a storm of * from cemetery ridge the * the guns had made in the ranks filled up and the * living wall went forward as if the dead that covered the ground like the fallen leaves of autumn had added the * of their own lives to the strength of their comrades a long blue line sprang suddenly up from the grass which had hidden it from view fired and ran on * and turning to * again the * in front of garnett fell before it reached the ground he took it from the hand of the baby who looked a last farewell and * whispered remember again the ranks closed up and went on * as garnett caught the flag one of his comrades sprang forward with the same design he looked around and saw the * face of the man who had bade farewell to virginia garnett passed the flag to him and they went on together left * * and steadily they * while a * roar filled the valley and a rain of * swept down from the cannon in front of them again were the wide * filled as were never such * of horror filled in the long story of * front forward straight down upon the * now on * glory of the battle * around them * them in a * of flame * them forward with * feet and hearts on fire forward quick march where the * fell * and the fire seemed to * in a * heart of flame garnett saw the * on whom his eyes were fixed pause and look over the field like a * he sat while a * * * around him with his comrades garnett rushed by over the * that crossed the field they leaped the line breaking at the moment of * but instantly at command * under a fiery storm from the batteries on the heights amid the * of shells that filled the air while the * of the wounded and dying * their hearts * men * they heard above the roar of the guns and the tramp of the feet then the voice fell on silence general garnett was dead come on boys * another voice and a sword flashed high in the sun a hat borne upon its point the tall * man who carried it * pointed to the * hill and urged the men forward his own daring * a * that was * the leader on the black * stopped on the * that crossed the field and sat like a figure of stone the battle hot around him a staff officer came back from carrying an order you are losing your * captain bright instead of * them said the general captain bright followed the glance of his leader and saw that his * had been shot through and was hanging from his * the general * * the scene his keen eye taking in every movement the men rushed by and garnett * with * as he saw the * erect figure under the falling shot and * shells on the other side of the line a man in blue lifted his * and took careful * at the form standing out so * against the light then he * his gun and turned back three of his comrades were putting down their guns we cant kill a man as brave as that they said over on the right a * of * and * of * * into the faces of the little band it * and fell back then * and pressed on and the two * forces were * their * crossing in fierce combat jasper dismounted was in front of garnett * the * of a tall dark man the * thought garnett he thrust his sword into the heart of * * who fell and was * under many feet * toward the height the man who bore the flag fell and garnett would have stopped to aid him dont mind me said the wounded man carry the flag to the front a horse came * by and the fallen man caught his * like * i can be a * post he said garnett bore the flag * over the stone wall and up the hill they followed the sword that flashed a silver path for them till they stood upon the * crest the first line of * fell back and garnett waved his * over the gun beside which stood the man whose * had * the way in a * heart of fire he saw the leader fall forced back by the * of the men on the height the little * of * * down the hill jasper and garnett together a storm of * following them as they went * down the slope jasper fell back and garnett caught him in his arms jasper are you hurt old fellow jasper made no answer and garnett carried him on a * * * him suddenly but he * it not for above the roar of the guns the * of the wounded the tramp of men and horses he heard a soft voice saying take care of him for me take care of him for me he laid his comrade upon the ground and poured down his throat a drink from his * he is not dead he will not die cannot for he has love to live for and it will take him safely back to her as he sank upon the ground he heard the sound of * feet and the face of * heart was thrust into his own * old fellow did you come to tell me goodbye i know you carried your * * into the battle till he fell from your back he could not have gone on without you for he was too ill to ride any other oh i am proud of you * and i am glad i * you to the brave general garnett i wonder if he knows that his * soldier follows him so soon the * brown eyes of * looked * into his with * appeal then garnett saw that one of his feet was shot off and led by * he had * to his master * i love you and will do what you ask of me goodbye old fellow he drew the pistol from his * and took sure * a long slow * a * sigh and * was at rest garnett moved nearer to jasper and put his arm over him he was too weak to * himself to see how it was with his friend but he felt that all was right a * floated over the field faint as if the gentle * feared to enter upon the terrible scene * as if the * of a * * it down thank god that is old * he will find him for her said garnett as he sank into * that is old * * the * in the greatest * the world has ever known thought the leader of the little * falling back from the * height and as * saw the general he * struck the * note with which he had always greeted him see the * hero comes but memory brought a * * into which was * the tragedy of a glorious and * effort listening he who had led his men through the storm saw * as in a cloud the * of battle the * of the charge his heart leaped with the * of victory sank with the knowledge of defeat then the * tones passed on and * above the * of men * back from a glorious defeat that held no less of * than would have shone in the crown of victory it caught the * of * and death the love and * of passing souls the agony of * souls that must remain on earth and remember the * and horror of that field of destruction and carried it * mingled with the * of loves farewell and the * of the morning heights of eternal life to beat against the * of that city where peace * forever it came softly to garnett as he lay touching the * with one hand while the other reached * * back toward loved ones whom he was leaving there was a familiar tone in the * as if it were * to him on the winds of * * it did not come to him with the * of battle the darkness of death he was * from the * * to him it bore the * of * that grew along the * he had * in * it was * with the * that * a * where he used to play he saw again the long grass waving in the wind a song came * down the years from the parted red lips of a * girl with a forest of * in her throat over toward the sunset the little band had swept down the hill beyond his * and hearing i have kept my faith * i send him back to you and to love sighed garnett as old * notes * for his master brought him back to consciousness he lay still for a time his * * down upon his cheek and then as his soul took its flight her voice came to him on the golden * of an old song a smile * up his face he opened his eyes and whispered i knew you would come * i feel the touch of your hand and your sweet eyes are * the way for me goodbye goodbye kate like a bit of * * up from a * sea jasper lay by the * through the darkness that * him he heard a last fond goodbye spoken by a loved voice but he could make no answer the sound of a * called him and he tried to struggle back to light but sank again into shadows old * anxious ever for the fate of the young master whom * had * to him found him after much * and praying and a * search he turned to garnett whose arm was over * shoulder so saying * after listening again at * heart lifted him tenderly and carried him away * him down gently and taking a mournful leave of him with tears * down his cheeks the faithful servant returned to jasper no * look of consciousness came to the still face in * to the * notes that had so often aroused the young soldier to the duties of the day whether the * of his * * song had the power * to it or not the young colonel opened his eyes before it was finished is it time to get up * where is lieutenant * i thought i heard him call your miss * name was i * or was it his spirit he is not dead * is he * laughed to carry out the * but turned his head away * was soon back with his * carefully as they lifted jasper he sank again into * * and knew not when he was taken across the * valley when they reached the hill on the other side of the field consciousness came back to jasper and with it a * of pain which brought a * from the lips that were set with grim * in the effort to * all sign of suffering easy boys easy said a low deep voice in a tone so gentle that the sound of it * away a part of the misery of the * wound * in the burning heat of the path that * the battlefield carry him gently for his pain and for the memory of the brave fellows we leave behind us jasper lifted his heavy * slowly and looked up to see what * face might belong with this voice that was like a * of * music * around him in a dream which was otherwise only darkness and fear there was a familiar note in the voice as if it might have fallen upon his ear often in the past when life was full in his * and meant so much more than it could ever mean again the * face was so filled with tenderness that it brought tears to his eyes only to look at it tears that took away half his suffering in their * but filled his heart with a * * * sense of loss that seemed * the face into which jasper looked was the same he had seen when the morning light made a dim * under the * of the trees brilliant with the * of summer the face at sight of which the men who dared not * their voices in the * cheers that * up in their hearts had raised their * and bowed their heads in * and * same face yet not the same for the battle * had died out and left it pale with the sorrow of a great loss perhaps the greatest loss that had ever come to a man since the first battle for * was fought in a * * world for over each dead form that lay on that * field his heart * as a * * over the grave of a son the * that had * with the fire of the coming conflict were * in a gray tender light * than tears courage my * we shall soon be among friends whose hearts and hands will bring you comfort the leader of the few who had in so short a time * the road to * and returned to earthly living looked back along the way far better for us he said * out his arms toward the long * left by the * death had we stayed with them but if j can cross that valley and live cannot you thus the brave * general pickett after the battle stood beside one of his boys as the sun sank behind the hills to rise again in golden glory when the night should pass the sun that had * the flag of the southern cross had set to rise no more forever * stood in the * * and looked from the open window across to the servants quarters in the * of the wide space in front a * group had gathered the night was * and the scene was * by * * held in the hands of some * * whose faces * to the * light seemed to catch a * glow that * and changed with the * * as the company moved about in the red light one might have * that a group from * * had met for * * kate was thinking only how good and faithful they had been these black people of * lawn * they had been free for half a year * they had been free much longer than that for had they wished to leave the old plantation there had been nothing to prevent it was their home and they loved it what more could the wilderness of freedom offer them many of the * servants had chosen the * of that great unknown country rather than the safety of the tried and known she did not think it strange that they had done so though the offered * bear nothing of freedom but its name it yet * out to the imagination such brilliant * that only a great love can * it in glory such a love these faithful hearts held for the old home and its * there was a * * in the scene that carried * fancy into the * shadows of * * the negroes had formed a * around the * space and the light * over their faces gave them an * expression of * * an old man who formed the * of the * began to sing slowly in a deep melancholy tone a song * of the * * and * fate of one poor uncle * who had lived a long time ago and had gone to a rest well * by a * life of good deeds and * he had apparently been forced to * most of the * which earthly existence * to the * human being all joined in the * which * up in a heavy * of * as the first note of the * * out in a volume of sad * a girl * into the * of the circle and began a slow * * dance * * and forward and from side to side keeping time with her * movements to the rise and fall of the * to them the life and death of the good old black man of whom they sang who had died long ago long ago and who had no * on de top * his * in de place * de * ought * grow were as real and as new as were the scenes of their * life when the funeral * was ended the same deep rich voices rang out in a merry song with a * of laughter after each * a * boy ran into the circle and began a * to the gay notes of the * and the * of the * followed by another and yet another all * in * with the laughing * to which their * feet kept time what children they are thought kate as she joined in the laugh they * over * * and laugh over * * without a thought of the * of life ah here comes uncle * why are you not having fun down at the * with the others dear me what has happened to please you so what is it uncle * do tell me are you sure uncle * she cried her cheeks * and her eyes * victory for one instant * heart stood still as if it would never beat again the world was dark before her and she heard strange sounds far off on an unknown shore something seemed to grasp at her throat and she could not * intense joy had brought a helpless pain like that which comes with intense grief then light came back tears filled her eyes the tears that lie alike at the heart of a great happiness and a great sorrow her cheeks which had gone suddenly pale with the * of joy * out * than the roses that * in * garden the triumph in her heart * into her eyes and * away the tears her first thought was of jasper the war was ended and he would soon come home come home to her the long terror of battle was over and sweet peace had come at last for what could there be more to do than to go to washington and offer to withdraw the army from northern soil on condition that the south should own herself and live her own life what a magnificent glorious life it would be with their wide * lands their beautiful homes the power to make their own laws * to their own needs but what were laws and national interests to kate jasper was coming home what * meaning than that had peace for her and garnett yes he would come too in the first rush of joy she had not thought of him she would be glad to see him though he was a dear fellow and had been good to jasper that either would not come had never * upon her thought * and cousins and fathers and brothers had been left on the field and * and cousins and sisters and daughters had walked * in the sun and the darkness of their sorrow had * the light of day for her that she should suffer like loss had never come within the range of her * the * of youth * no cloud on the * of the future even when the eyes of youth are forced to recognize a present darkness in the * of his feeling uncle * * a * with a * not to be * by the * youth in the quarters * uncle * * but why are you * a victory for the south the north is fighting your battle the northern president has set you free no but if general lees army goes to washington it might * that you would lose your opportunity to go i suppose the * is heavy in * to the * of the possibility of * it off kate looked over to where the * * was keeping vigorous time to the * of * * * hands and * voices have you told them about the great news the old man lifted his clasped hands and looked * with an expression of * happiness * his face at that moment kate saw a * youth * the * and run toward the quarters * some message the words of which she could not * each * paused instantly in the * in which he * to be the * * stood on one foot the other held in air as if * the next step kate observed how graceful his * figure was in that * old * bow was lifted in preparation for beginning a * and * * the * held by thomas jefferson * remained crossed at the * * * george washington * hand was arrested on its * flight toward the last note of * * en * dat en * * de * * * kate thought of the city that fell * when the sleeping beauty sank into her long * the * came every figure * into * the music rang out with a wild note of triumph that filled the night the * * out their * message as if the * news had brought life again to them and * them with * flesh and given them a heart to * with triumph the * of hands * * a * of voices rolled out in a * and the wave of * * out over a sea that had no shore through the wild * of the plantation * the solemn proud * yet almost melancholy * of the * the south is free the south is free thus the news came home * nations learned the * decision of that great conflict before * * of it could * through the stone wall which war had built around the south * was * and the hope of a great victory * under her cheerful * for a little moment the south felt the * of triumph then darkness fell jasper * lay half asleep on an army * in the old covered wagon in which his faithful servant was taking his wounded master home the negro waving a * gently to and fro over the white face glanced at * cap under the * seat it had served as a * until a * woman at the last * place had given them the * the gray * was * and * the gold *

the voice though weary had an * * of * and remember * if we meet any one on the road not one word and dont you even dare show your black face we are just a * passing through the country thats all you

the household of * lawn would be gathering * on that * of road miles away from any other * his old heart gave a * and with difficulty he * a cry it was a chance a * chance but the only one and he would take it he ceased * and closely watched the * who did not * as the wagon * the children * crept * forward and picked up the gray cap then he took the large white * with which he had been * away the * that occasionally broke out on the young mans face threw it over his head and leaned across the seat the children stood up * * to watch the wagon go by they did not move even when a mans cap * by a long arm from the front of the * fell at the feet of the * boy a few moments later * whose face was still * watching them from the rear of the * saw them * up the cap examine it with great excitement and * little * and then set off with it at full speed up the * to * lawn there remained still a weary three hours drive colonel * slept * and as they * * * insisted on sitting up we are

wing that remained contained but three rooms the long low * of * memories and two small * above this part had been saved by the brave efforts of the loyal servants who had * their lives to * the flames when the * had gone some of the old * servants came out with faces keen with curiosity which suddenly changed to alarm when they saw their master lying helpless on the * then to delight when he called their names in a cheerful voice and assured them that he was not much hurt colonel * was carried slowly into the * and the * put down gently near the west window where there was a faint * * here the * the tragedy seemed more awful still apparently the * sword had been * swept to right and left in an attempt to destroy what could not be carried away the old * had hurried off to get fresh milk and * for her * * in the thought of having one of her * * again to serve jasper lay and looked about him an * * * his lips troops of * memories had followed him through the * and were gathering around his * memories of * * when the old house stood stately and fair and gave him sweet welcome that * his heart he remembered the last time he had come home when mother and sister had met him with loving * and the one girl in all the world had taken a wild night ride to * him of danger old * * about making a great deal of * over getting things comfortable for it would never do to let the young master see that he too could have laid himself down and * in * of spirit presently after he had been given some hot milk he called out * i thought i heard horses * i wish i could see the road from here oh it would be so good to catch a * of some of the home people * it suddenly for a second there appeared in the * a * figure in a riding habit finger on lip the other hand * the girl * into the shadows * * and then went to * side the young man lay looking out of the window he went out and drew the door to behind him kate and her father stood on the * the girl * * into folds the soft felt hat
