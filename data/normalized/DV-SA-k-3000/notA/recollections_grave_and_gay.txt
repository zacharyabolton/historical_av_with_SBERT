the * where a negro girl carried her food and drink and we * thought no more of her in the greater excitement of the coming battle in the evening my mother having gone on to culpeper court house to * as a nurse in the new military hospital my aunt who was busy elsewhere suggested that i go up to see what had become of the * little woman in the * when i * at the door it was no * voice that bade me enter but one sweet and * coming from a girl * on a chair near the window who sprang up to meet me with a cry of joy news news from the front that was all she wanted not supper or anything the servant girl had told her the troops were moving it was a mercy to speak to any one she had cried all day and now thought she would go mad little by little it came out that she was the * daughter of a * * family engaged to a lieutenant of artillery with whom she had * and broken just as he went off to virginia with the * in which her brother was also an officer * she tried to * him her * and finally on the * of a moment had left the plantation where her family were went into her mothers town house possessed herself of the * trunk and * and set off for virginia her intention only to see him and then

possible help she * up at this and to my surprise ended by * me then promised to eat her * supper and try to sleep during the battle next day she again passed out of my mind and when at * a * little * figure stole up upon the * and begged me to go with her for an instant to her room i * when there she burst into a storm of tears and * the day had nearly killed her she had spoken to nobody her heart was breaking with anxiety she had heard there was a list of wounded in the * store would i mind seeing whether his name or her brothers was upon it and then she told the names which i was to come to know well and respect in after days i * her * again and while all the rest of us * into the little country store where behind the * by the light of a * * a man was * out a * arrived * of the * of the day she stood outside in the darkness afraid to show herself * for a glance at the paper i ran my eye hastily over it and the third or fourth name was that of her * * wounded and strange * of my first

girls had * until i declared myself * of his name it was at the * house where mr harrison came to call upon my cousins that our acquaintance began we were all interested in what * harrison had to say of the * every one knew the * of mrs jefferson davis as handed down from her career as a * wife in washington in the * of * and * she was declared to be a woman of warm heart and * * * and * with a * nature * all a devoted wife and mother and most * mistress of a * miss * * the exceedingly clever sister of mrs davis afterward * de * of england was the young lady of the richmond white house and it is safe to say that no * talk was ever * over the * in any land than passed daily between the several bright spirits thus assembled at the presidents table mrs davis had been somewhat * on the day of the * by an * for her progress to capitol square made by her negro * when they set out at a * * she observed walking * and with faces of * gloom on either side of her carriage four negroes in black

said she was almost * to have to order the * away so proud were they of their * position concerning the affairs big or little of the chief mr harrison was wont to preserve * * silence he would say only that the president had the * relations with his family by whom he was * * * that to accompany the chief on horseback always his duty together with some of the * was to sit in the saddle * in good or bad weather alike never knowing when they were to bring up at home again and keeping mrs davis in * * as to her * to say nothing of her husbands fate a familiar and * figure was president davis in the streets of richmond from that day forth from richmond scenes in # published in battles and leaders of the civil war i * my * of him which since it was * by my husband i feel may be regarded as of some worth he might be seen daily walking through the capitol square from his residence to the executive office in the morning not to return until late in the afternoon or riding just before * to visit one or another of the * near the city he was tall erect slender and of a * and * bearing with * and * features and of a * of stately courtesy to all he was * always in confederate gray * and wore a soft felt hat with wide * * his step was * and firm in the saddle he rode * and with a * * his early life had been spent in the military * at west point and upon the then * * in the black * war and he afterward greatly distinguished himself at * and * * in mexico at the time when we knew him everything in his appearance and manner was * of military * he was reported to feel quite out of place in the office of president with executive and * duties in the midst of such a war general lee always spoke of him as the best of military * his own * was to be with the army and at the first * of the sound of a gun * within reach of richmond he was in the saddle and off for the spot to the * of his * who never knew at what hour of the night or of the next day they should get back to bed or to a * the stories * harrison told us of his * on such * were many and sometimes * for instance when general lee crossed the chickahominy president davis with several * and his secretary * the column and with the secretary of war and a few other * * the river just as the battle of * began general lee surrounded by members of his own staff and other officers was found a few hundred yards north of the bridge in the middle of the broad road mounted and * engaged in * the attack then about to be made by a brigade * in line over the fields to the east of the road and toward * mill where in a few minutes a hot engagement commenced shot from the enemys guns out of sight went * * in quick * striking every moment nearer the group of * in the road as the * * their range general lee observed the presidents approach and was evidently * at what he considered a * expedition of * * of the head of the government whose duties were elsewhere he turned his back for a moment until colonel * had been * at a gallop with the last direction to the commander of the * brigade then * the * and looking like the god of war * he exchanged with the president a * with the most * reserve of anything like welcome or * then without * of opportunity for a word from the president the general looking not at him but at the * at large asked in a tone of * who are all this army of people and what are they doing here no one moved or spoke but all eyes were upon the president everybody perfectly understood that this was an order for him to retire to a place of safety while the roar of the guns the * fire of * and the * of a battle in progress with troops * * across the bridge to go into action went on the president * in his saddle quite taken * at such a * the general * him now with * of growing * after a painful pause the president said * it is not my army general it certainly is not my army mr president was the prompt reply and this is no place for it in an * of command such a * was a * to mr davis who however soon * his * and answered well general if i withdraw perhaps they will follow and raising his hat in another cold * he turned his horses head to ride slowly toward the bridge seeing as he turned a man killed immediately before him by a shot from a gun which at that moment got the range of the road the presidents own * followed him as did various others but he presently drew * in a stream where the high bank and the * concealed him from general lees * observation and there remained while the battle * the secretary of war had also made a show of * but * the opportunity * by rather a deep * on the * to * himself and his horse for a time from general lee who at that moment was more to be * than the enemys guns in the union * on columbia s c in the spring of 1865 mr * *

high * in the town were also crowded with * and the enemys * were plainly visible * over the field after dark that night the firing still went on and numbers of people saw the magnificent sight of * * in air and the * of thousands of * accompanied by the * roar of artillery to go home from such a spectacle was to seek a bed but not to sleep and dawn next day brought a * of the terrible experience while the streets were again and again filled with * trains the result of the day before and now a great * of gratitude went up to general lee * as the * of richmond from destruction the supreme

* with new lines in her sweet face and eyes full of * tears she came to her children nothing seemed hopeless after that when it was certain that our boys were marching across the * into maryland and that save for my brother on sick leave every * creature belonging to our numerous connection was in the advance what wonder that we * at the * of patience till it burst no longer able to endure peace in * back we all went to hot * * richmond there we found all thoughts fixed on maryland all hearts * * with * * of victory to our arms letters * to us telling of the * of the march of * on a * of *

appeared at the commanding generals headquarters * carrying in his hand the ragged * of a pair of shoes i only wanted to ask sir if i might draw a new pair as i cant march in these have the men of your company received permission to draw shoes yet asked the general no sir i believe not yet then go back to your battery my boy and wait until they have after * these * i received a visit at * house virginia from captain robert e lee * * his * father with his wife and little girl * carter lee he says the * artillery stories are in the main true he * remember about the shoes but it might well have

during the whole period of the war and in the trying times * his * * intelligence and high courtesy enabled him to preserve cordial relations with all those * in his life friends and * alike and this i think there will be no one to * to return to my * of richmond * now was * the * * of which as one of the original * i can speak with authority it was agreed between a number of young women that a

decided that we should permit no one to * the rule of * all * save the * * water from the * james we began by having piano music for the * but the * members of the * made up between them a * * a small

my dear child my boys need to be * up when they get their * go on look your * and be just as nice to them as ever you can be we even had * to which everybody * * the * were the * * we had constant * to admit new members and all * and general officers who visited richmond were presented to our * as a means of * the best society of the south in * spirits from the * deep to record upon these pages i had occasion to address a question or two in writing to a friend of * a * who has * himself with the best * * in his state since the sword he bore through all the battles delivered by the army of northern virginia was laid aside to * the * of peaceful years if it be a crime to * a passage from the letter he sent me in return i cry * * that i will never * his name no one else living perhaps could have written it and its * here is my best excuse lord lord what a * * * little society it was night after night i * into town to attend * * what not and did not get back to my camp until two three what matter the hour but was always up fresh as * when the * * * and when a little later on my first * reported to me as * with their battery reports to you and to me looking back it was such a * of a real heroic age and a real golden age as could come but once in a * years everybody knew everybody in the highest sense of that * and there was youth and beauty and devotion and splendid daring a * honor and an * patriotism an utter * * and utter * of fate a * * and beautiful surrender of the * maid when her love was going to certain death god what a splendid high society that little * was oh i never talk of it now people would only say why there * one of them worth # i wish i could tell you something because as * * * old * they * they * but i * remember anything of that brilliant winter except that i went everywhere that the queen was most * to me and that john s and c de l and i were said to be the best round * as they were called then in the world think of that also that i was very much in love with miss i was afraid to be in love with the queen because my dearest dearest l r had said to me at the * of virginia that * offer up to instant death any * who ever dared look at her and then with miss and * with miss its all very * but i have an * * that i was engaged to all of them and that when the * * in the early spring i went to the front with a * but a * heart wonderful were the * * that * winter * party * that had done duty at * * * the white * springs and in washington and new orleans * were already worn to * one of them would be made to supply the * of the other until both passed into thin air the * stories of * * taken down to * into court trains over * of window * lace and of * * made up over pink or blue * * now took * certain it is that girls never looked * or * with more perfect grace than those * war * trying to obey the great generals * and look their * for the gallant * of his * if one were to trust the melancholy old * * * and * of the * any statement as to the beauty of the women might be taken with * * but * doubt before writing my memories i have looked over * of these * of a long gone * and in hardly one do i see more than a faint suggestion of the beauty of the original to read * * over with * * and then turn to the portrait of the subject * in most cases a * of enthusiasm it is always with a sigh of regret that i turn away from the * of the * of the confederacy * in the agreeable and * * of * published of late years of the women who were most in evidence in the confederate capital i have already spoken of mrs davis and her sister and * daughter * * the ladies of general lees family lived in a pleasant house in lower franklin street then and afterward held as a * in the eyes of * * mrs robert e lee not strong in health and always a reserved woman in society rarely showed herself in general * miss mary custis lee who has for years been known to the * * of foreign * having spent most of her latter life abroad took the post of receiving and * the friends and * who * around their doors the death of a beloved daughter during the war followed by that of mrs fitzhugh lee and her children while her husband was in prison in the north placed the family in mourning * them for conspicuous appearance in society also it was understood that mrs lee felt a sense of * in the suggestion that the wife and daughters of the commanding general of * armies himself sleeping always in a tent and living on * * should take the lead in any * of a social sort so the old * * of arlington house which had opened its doors to so many in the past was allowed to pass away to be renewed however at their future home in lexington mrs joseph e johnston coming of the distinguished * family of baltimore had a little court of her own in later days rather * to the * power of the confederate white house it was said two daughters of judge john * campbell late of the supreme court of washington mrs lay and miss mary * campbell who married * pendleton * of * alexandria were an important * in the social side of richmond life to no one memory of those days do i turn now with * feeling than to that of handsome and original mary *

of * in the awful * of brave * suffering on every hand i followed my mother in her * * and * her ere long i found certain * who in due course were * entirely to my care with a ward * in * my whole heart passed into the work i could hardly sleep for * to be back in those miserable * * where dim eyes would * * at sight of me and trembling lips gave me last * to * to those they would never see again once going into one of my mothers * i found my way * by an arm lying on the floor and the * who had just * it still at work on * one of our favorite * a big gentle * always * and * the blood was * * from the * they were * together and for a moment i paused * can you stand it asked one of the * kindly if so * a little help needed as were * this morning i stayed and in a moment i saw clear and all seemed * when they hurried off leaving * to me he came out of * looking me full in the eyes as i stood * his forehead so its gone at last the poor old arm we worked so hard to save i said trying to speak * yes miss but its not * you should be * about he answered an you * by * your dress with the blood o me * i am glad to say got well and left the hospital * eternal * to his nurse one night following a day when the cannon had not ceased till sunset we were * by an * coming to tell my mother that a lot of new wounded had been brought in from the field and were still coming they were putting them in a new ward just built at the far end of the camp but had actually no food or * to give them did mrs cary think she could possibly spare a little from her * since many of these poor fellows had been in the * since the day before some without a * passing their lips we sprang up hurried into our clothes and were outside in a few minutes my mother * her stores with a * heart found she had but one * of milk a small * of * a piece of cold * * and a * of cold * with our arms full we * in the darkness over the rough ground following the * and his * if we had * that precious milk our hearts would have broken then and there the southern night had spent its early heat and a * * * with wood * came up from the river and * our * * at the door of the new ward a long pine shed * were * their * contents some of the wounded * * prayers to be left to die in peace some * in * while other * were lifted out already * in their last sleep those for whom the * ride from the battlefield had not finished the work of the enemys * were carried in and laid on the * and by the * * of * * and * * the * began their * before they were half finished a * of * came into the sky seen through the open windows and in the * trees on the * of the camp birds had begun to * and * we placed our supplies on a table near the door and my mother telling me the * needed her assistance bade me find out the * number to be * and make it go around ah that division of * * never since have i been able to endure with * seeing the * of food in peace times when * by the ward * i began to * it some were past * and their more vigorous * looked with * eyes upon the poor * * to * by carrying off these * to take * away from * lips before they were satisfied was a keen sorrow at length when i had nearly finished the task and almost exhausted my resources i came upon a * where lay upon his face a mere boy apparently dying there was no time to call a doctor i * milk and * and after * his body over poured it by * down his throat keeping on till i had the joy of seeing the * * * back little by little he reached the point of opening his eyes and telling me he * exactly know what was the matter with him but that he felt so tired as soon as i could capture my favorite doctor i brought him to my patient a wound was found but a slight one the * was simply dying from * the * of hours in the * and want of food he may thank his stars you kept on trying said my doctor or * have been a dead one before now think of children like this put into the ranks to fill the places of the * men * killed for us this patient also recovered on our hands and in due time went back to his old woman in north carolina whose poor * letters to her son i had to read and answer for him while at camp * he was * by me to an extent that caused some * and * comment from his * in the ward for him were reserved all the * i could lay hands upon but fortunately he went home before he was too * * if we had visitors there was * to receive them so the few i allowed to come appeared during my off time in the afternoon and took me out to walk with the private secretary of the president who never came save with some welcome book in hand i * * out of the grim * of camp * into the woods above the * and river bank where we would sit under the * * and watch the silent * * by below reading talking and trying to forget the * of war here the air knew no * wild flowers * * there was no sound save that of the * river sometimes on the * * past the negro * would sing in * * or play an * upon some wind * dying in the distance like * of * walking back in the evening we carried * and * of * arranged while we sat some for my own quarters most of them for * lying alone in the * where they put * * these last had my * sympathy so * they were in their terror of being shut out of the * and left day and night alone save for the rare visits possible where there were so many * attention we generally * ourselves to reach

to give here the leading * without * or comment after an * slow journey by interrupted trains mr harrison succeeded in * mrs davis and her party at * where on * the #* of april he received a telegram from president davis at * merely * that he was there this was their first news of the * of richmond on april # directly after mr harrison joined his chief at * the president received the * of the

after * of * * on the death of the * of * that mr * could ride as well as another was afterwards proved on this expedition when he * left the party and set out alone for the * making his way to

and bar of the united * during all this march wrote mr harrison mr davis was * * and cheerful he seemed to have had a great * taken from his mind to feel relieved of * and his conversation was very bright and agreeable he talked of men and of books particularly of * scott and * of horses and * and * of the woods and the fields of roads and how to make them of the * of birds and of a * of other * his * with and correct taste in the english * of the last * his * * in life his * of close observation and his extraordinary memory made him a charming companion when disposed to talk indeed like mark * we were all in good spirits under * circumstances and i particularly remember the * conversation of mr * the secretary of the navy which does not * with the * i recently found in an old letter of major * to mr harrison in which this secretary is * mr * at * it was found that mrs davis and her party had left the day before to go further south as the * party entered a house with difficulty obtained for them all the * * a * made by * * to burn every house giving * to jefferson davis the president received by * from general * the news of president * * * * * by the staff and following * remark wrote mr harrison was that in lincoln the southern states had lost their only * in their then * there was no expression other than that of surprise and regret as yet we knew none of the * of the crime during the speech made at this * by mr davis to a column of general * * cavalry mr harrison stood close to the * and heard distinctly every word uttered by him there was no reference whatever to the * and no other speech was made mr * remark to colonel william preston johnston in mr * house later on was that mr lincoln would have been much more useful to the southern states than * johnson his * was * to be i myself said mr harrison heard mr davis express the same opinion at that period so much for the * charge against mr davis that he had on this occasion spoken * of the horrible crime committed by * in the name of the * south my husband often told me that of such a spirit much less an expression mr davis could never have been * no man ever * he went on to say in a great war of revolution with less of * of the * sense of perfect * in conduct or opinion his every * act and sentiment was with the * regard for all the * throughout that troubled time when the * of many people made them reckless or * of the opinions of * his * continued in * and i remember his there saying to me i cannot feel like a * man at * mr * anxiety about his wife and family led him to despatch his secretary to * south carolina in search of them * his own judgment as to what to do after he met them the president himself * to go as rapidly as possible to the * mississippi department to join the army under * smith at * mr harrison found mrs davis and her party * * as the guests of colonel * mrs davis insisted upon at once * the * with a view to * for europe had she remained where

and * for the safety of his family * out at night again rode after them to the * of the party * mrs davis in camp near the little * of * in georgia here after * his friends that he would leave mrs *

sleep from which he was * at * by jones mrs * * running to him saying the enemy was upon them i sprang to my feet and in an instant a * fire of * began on the north side of the creek almost at the same moment colonel * and his regiment charged up the road from the south upon us we were taken by surprise and not one of us exchanged a shot with the enemy colonel johnston tells me he was the first prisoner taken in a moment colonel * rode directly to me and * across the creek said what does that mean have you any men with you * the firing was done by our * i said of course we have dont you hear the firing he seemed to be * at the reply gave the order charge and * led the way across the creek nearly every man in his command following our camp was thus left deserted for a few minutes except by one mounted soldier near mrs * tent afterward said to have been stationed there by colonel * in passing and by the few * who stopped to * our wagons i had been sleeping on the same side of the road with the tent occupied by mrs davis and was then standing very near it i saw her come out and say something to the soldier mentioned * she wanted him to move off i approached and actually * the fellow to ride away as the soldier moved into the road and i walked beside his horse the president * for the first time from the tent at the side farther from us and walked away into the woods to the * at right * from the road presently looking around and * somebody had come out of the tent the soldier turned his horses head and reaching the spot he had first occupied was again approached by mrs davis who engaged him in conversation this * was joined by perhaps two of his comrades they remained on horseback and soon became violent in their language with mrs davis the order to * was called out by one of them to the president it was not * and was quickly repeated in a loud voice several times at least one of the men then threatened to fire and pointed a * at the president mrs davis * with terror cried out in * and the president who had now walked sixty or * * away into the * woods turned around and came rapidly back to his wife near the tent as the president * the soldier who was * rough language to his wife one of the others * him called out mr davis surrender i recognize you sir while these things were * miss * and the children remained within the other tent i have not found that there was any one * mrs davis the single * by her tent and myself who saw all that occurred and heard all that was said at the time any one else who gives an account of it has had to * upon * or

him and the friends he had left in richmond a black veil of silence and * * as to his * fate had fallen he had been confined at first in a room of the old capitol prison a few days later he was taken by a * from this place and conducted to a room in the same building under * of being introduced to a confederate lady he might like to know feeling * that * threatened he had no difficulty in keeping himself in check when in the presence of an old * woman with a * eye afterward * as a spy for both sides who with every assurance of * for the south sought to lead him into conversation about mr davis and confederate matters in general she did not name the young girl suffering from a bad * who deadly pale with a white * around her brow struck him as * some face on a * * in * tones the spy woman sought to * both of them to join in her * against the government and * of sympathy for the * in a * he * the poor girl had been brought there for the same purpose as himself it was * that they should

* for the union telegraph company my husband went to conduct some business for them at * pennsylvania he found the official he had to * * was none other than his former * when mr harrison came * in the morning at the * hotel and saw * waiting for him in the hall he threw up his hands * my god general you are not after me again they shook hands and the general answered i tell you harrison you * a better friend than i am in the world come to breakfast and after * finished business well spend the day together before * this grim chapter one of the horrible * of the civil war i will say that after hearing these stories told again in washington in # i desired to drive with my husband to the scene of his old * where the present war college * were then going up on the * of the old prison of the * sitting in a * he directed the * as well as he could where to go but became soon * about * in the * * of the place we * up and i addressed the * of a * of * asking if he could tell me where we were why * dont you know he answered this is the place where the * stood on which mrs * and the other * were * my husband made no comment nor did i and silently we drove * it was thought best for us * of both * to keep quietly out of public observation while still the wave of feeling * increased by the * of lincoln dashed high over our * with northern friends our cousin the * * * * of the * church at * new * who had lost a noble son in the union service at * was good enough to ask that i should be sent to remain under his protection and that of his wife one of the * family of philadelphia * in sympathy with the * cause they were more than kind to their poor little storm * rebel visitor carrying in her young heart a world of painful experience together with certain * and sad * of which she could speak to nobody it was as if an iron door had closed between her and the one who had gone out of her life so * that day of march on the * of the * not a word had come from him and she only knew he was treated as a dangerous prisoner the first thing mrs * * * to be a * * for * spirits was for me to * my confederate * and spend the check my mother had given me for new clothes i went into philadelphia * by my cousin * who took me to all the necessary * and stood by * till my * was * i cannot now imagine anything much * than the * * * stretched over wide * the short * * and * little round * * forward upon our * but when they came home and were * with the * * * of my richmond supply i felt * than a queen these * did not last long and many a night i * for * and for friends who felt with me the great city of philadelphia as i saw it on our visits seemed so * by the war * people were so * so * except to say bitter * things against the southern cause if i had been * i should have realized that the north too was * with painful * and * of the war my next visit was one of some length to my fathers sister at old * she had * a son to the union army and with her girls was in mourning for president lincoln when i arrived my uncle an original member of the republican party having been like my father an old line * of * enthusiasm was * opposed to the southern idea of secession and for the confederacy and its leaders had no * or consideration while a man of large * and kind * he was violent in * against the rebels and all their works at table and elsewhere it was the constant effort of the family who had received me with open arms and * a friendship * all our lives to * him from * * of triumph over the * south that * my heart to * unable as i was to * or give expression to my * one day at * when he * the * about hanging jeff davis to a * * tree i for a while saw red and came very near leaving the house on foot and taking * i knew not where afterward on * from his wife how he had * me he was as sorry as i could have wished i could not understand why some of their country * calling at * looked at me * as at a * * from the burning this dear house was to become a second home to me i to * the position of * daughter to my aunt who had been my fathers favorite sister and in the course of time i was to go out from under its * * as a bride the ease and * of my * in * * to the life so recently led in richmond would have been better * had i known what was * my prisoner at fort * my girl cousins full of sympathy in the case had already become warm * of the * private secretary of the late confederate president there was a * * of satisfaction in the family when at last one day in august i received from him a long full letter the way in which it came to me was never revealed until by a letter written in # by that * * colonel henry * * of * maryland after reading a * paper i had published in * * this letter tells better than i can the conditions under which my prisoner was passing his days in august 1865 i was a prisoner in fort * sent there by the sentence of a military commission my * was not a * one and what with the courtesy of the commanding officer and free * to a * library and the liberty of the island my time passed easily if not rapidly but up in a keep among the * * guarded and confined with no * and no * of men and books in solitary * colonel harrison passed a longer * * and * he was suffering * for the * * of his chief morning and evening he took his * exercise along the * we were * to speak to or recognize each other and yet there was no prison rule which could prevent the * * of the raised hat although with * faces even the * and * of that fort used as they had become to many * * during the war were * with the * and hard * of colonel harrison and the men on duty freely expressed their opinion of it the day before i was * a * * * soldier came into my room after telling me that he * for and waited on colonel harrison he began to * the * of his * especially the order that * him to write to or receive letters from his family and friends and most especially with hot * and an oath did he think it was a shame the prisoner * even write to the young lady he was in love with how he obtained this information i do not know he then said that one way or another colonel harrison had got hold of pen and * and paper and had written a number of letters he wanted to send out to his family would i take charge of them a * of * on my part was * by a look into his honest face the next day he * again into my quarters and after * his satisfaction at my * and his regret that colonel harrison was not * * about the room a bit then said * and walked out upon taking down my coat which hung against the wall i found * a * * of letters that day general * took me to * in his boat that evening the letters were delivered to mrs cary in baltimore i think the * letter there was addressed to whom she must have received and evidently * it does she remember it other letters followed a * * became the * of * and carried more than one out of the fort in * * and * we in return * to get letters back addressed to a certain * * care of a certain somebody else at a certain * which shall be forever * we knew now that things had otherwise * for the prisoner that books from the post library * his table and a friendship had * up between himself and the brave * of the fort * in * on the island and visits to the generals home these things * in me hope that a pleasure even greater might be given to the * with my mother i returned in the autumn to * new * where with the aid of my young cousin dr * * we three made an attack in person upon the fort our ways of getting there were * and * from a village on the opposite shore of the * river we * in a * * boat across a * * * arrived at the * * on the bank we sent in our * by a soldier to the * to our delight no question was made about receiving us and crossing a bridge to enter gloomy * we were soon in the presence of the * chief had i * that the generals kind heart was already * for the prisoner not only through his own pleasure in his society but because of his * warm * and * had i supposed that in after years these dear people were to name a son * harrison and to * their other sons try to * themselves upon one whom they * to be a perfect gentleman then i should not have been so * the general * a severe official * looked us over and * of mrs cary whether we were * the mother and sister of colonel harrison no said my mother only friends i understand said the general * and * greatly a moment more and he had taken the * my mother handed to him a * of myself painted by mrs * in new york to * the one * up in the soldiers * in the georgia wilderness and the open letter sent with it and * them by an * to the prisoner and then a sudden even * * * him he asked my mother if she could trust him to show me the * of the * he led i followed to a door opening on the * court where * to look up toward the * i saw my prisoner standing indeed between * in a * but alive and well waving his hat like a * and * a great * * of joy these are the things that remain green in memory when the * of life is elsewhere dry and * but for the courage and devotion of my dear mother and my cousin in * me on what seemed a * hope we should never have won the day the next winter we had a house in washington * for the purpose of * the prisoners * through the * efforts with president johnson of our dear old friend * * preston * this was finally accomplished on the #* of january # * harrison was * from fort * coming at once to visit us in washington on his way to * his mother and sister in the south having spent the latter months of his * in

music of which lord * was the bright particular star among the guests with sir * and lady * and some other * english * in the party mrs * * of lexington avenue who entertained much and well had asked us to be of this gathering * two * and to * at a large table served for her lord * with his delightful * * * a * out for fun i had been * with him and was sitting afterward * his * * when the movement

while kind mr * who i felt mortally sure had never meant to ask me but had been looking forward to * the * handsome lady * stepped promptly up and led me off he had lady * on his other hand however while i had no more of * lord * until we were breaking up when he came back again with a * fire of * i have rarely met so agreeable a companion and the story of the closing in of his * life amid * and distress of mind brought upon him by those whom he had trusted in business * was a * of real regret to the * of music we * for public * and * till late at night on those occasions quiet * * place would * with the roll of * * and the * call by the * of * names or their * numbers and oh the * * for our * in that dear old temple of music there * * * * * * * cary * * * * * * * * * * and a host of others sang our hearts out of our bodies many a time once when * had caught sight of the great * sitting in a box near the stage while he was taking the part of * * in * he rose to the occasion in quite an extraordinary way acting and singing * after he was disposed of by the * * and came back to life before the * in the usual way we all saw that he was * with real emotion the house sprang upon its feet * waved roar after roar of * went up but * eyes sought those of * only the * leaning forward * his hands until he could do no more it was an event in * * years later i was invited to a spring meeting of an * * in a * new york house where * then in his * of power and * was engaged to * with the * * he sang several times * but with a * voice and there was but * * after the * * * by their friends upon the * i saw him standing back alone waiting his next turn and unable to resist the * of sympathy with this * * in bonds i went over and said a few words * * the occasion above described when he * and sang a whole * for * instantly * face flushed his eyes * and he broke into warm excited * of the great * of his native country the impression left upon me by these two scenes in an * life was * i was connected with a * movement in new york society * by a number of gentlemen of which mr george * strong was the president it was called the church * association the * dr * an * thoroughly * in such * we had one hundred volunteers including many people in society and fifty paid * in the * with an * of one hundred * many of them from the * * of which mr strong was also or had been president our * * hard work no * or * * were held in some rooms belonging to * chapel dr * a cold rather * man thoroughly knew his business and brought us on rapidly particularly did we progress in * and the hours of * those grand * were a keen pleasure our * and * were held at stated * in * hall before large and * * i sat among the * beside mrs george strong and there was great excitement when dr * found it necessary to * our * above the * we all declared we felt like * in a * scene but that was soon forgotten in * with the * mass of * followed by the first act of * * with fine * * we soon realized the additional * of sound gained by our * position all of us felt it an honor to sing in * hall every * and * of which was * in memories of the music that had been heard there it was the very home and * of the glorious art there i heard * on the piano * * * * * * * * * * * * * and * * to the * * of * * * * * * * * and * bull on the * there i listened to the * in * of * * * rose * * * * * * and a host of other sweet singing birds of * fame there too sang * * * and * big * and graceful joseph * who as a * in * i never saw * and there * the * that sent * the waves of all this * * we had thomas * * * * * and other great leaders of their day the last number of our first public * was a * in the * * rise crowned with light * * rise glorious words * to the air of the * national * and the great volume of it most * i have often felt since the church * association * what a good use it was to which to put * in society as well as a delightful * in that noble form of music for two years we * and sang over a wide field of ancient and modern church music none of us * in * or interest i had begun * with dear old * with his pretty * daughter to play the * and in the spring sang in a * at his * given at the * * corner of #* street and madison avenue the next season i sang with * the * from * * at a charity * in the hall of the new young * christian association building * it will be remembered had been one of the greatest * * of his day and as an * it was said of him by a writer in the saturday review * was simply an * master of all the * and all the resources of his art by * by * by natural genius and patient study a * master and one who neither on the * or any other stage has left any * to * his memory among those who can recall his * in * * in the due * in * de * and the * * and in the * * as * terrible and * as * * and * as the great * * as * he touched all * and played on all * with a hand that never forgot its * and knew how to shake his * with pity terror laughter at his will never was an * more * * with such * power of holding an audience in his grasp of making them feel his presence on the stage * voice * all this was rather * and * although * to expect it i was hardly prepared for his introduction of * spoken words and * for his * about the narrow stage and * * of laughter from the audience by * faces and * i was too much * to see during the progress of our * i really think the old fellow * forgot the existence of his * who on her part was only * she had been able to get to the final note without a break when we had finished and my * gave me his hand for a final bow to the public i * a glance at his * * old face and no longer wondered at the * of our * the rest of the * i do not recall save that the committee had been * enough to secure as star * madame anna * the great * * an incident of that evening was a loud * * as if of * and * * during the * mr * * one of the * was in a moment upon the stage * the excited audience * that the sound meant nothing but the * and * of new wood in the building one of those ready and graceful little * of his that in this case * a * as he * with a good story everybody laughed and settled down into peace and * for the remainder of the * in the spring i * to give a * to about thirty or forty guests and find * my * as to how all these grand * are to be * in my birds * for my * were no less than * miss * * the famous * mrs * mr * * mr * * * and mr * * to the king of * all the rest might be * in but i dread the big * from the court of * everything went well and my * were soon * the affair gave pleasure to a very critical if small audience and the dear people who had performed for me for love remained afterward for a high tea with * * at which we waited on ourselves and had royal fun i find a full description of this * venture * both * and * * to which was added this * * the baby fortunately was invited out for the afternoon we had a * * meeting at the home in madison square of mr and mrs s l m * where we did earnest work miss elsie * was of course the leading spirit of the affair miss * * was a member and others whose names i fail to recall the atmosphere of that wide beautiful house with

will repeat friend of the family visiting mrs * in her * at the * * during a * of the flying * what is that strange noise in the * back of the box mrs * oh dont mind its only the girls playing * with

has been so little seen of them * speaking in the life of our * * london where the * of character and position is cordially * everywhere but new york has shown little of the * and independence of london concerning the * of all * to society it has been suggested that old new york was too * modern new york is too * of itself in * the * of the stage whom one has heard of or met at the private * of * high society in america the chief among them in * years seem to be mrs * * butler and mrs anna * * * mrs butler had been the * guest of half the * of england before she married a * gentleman and came to the states to * her days between * philadelphia what she considered the * of a * plantation full of slaves and the more * atmosphere of * where she * a house * when i first went there was full of stories of this brilliant * lady who wrote of herself you know my dear * is the * of my nature both in her own * and as a * of * hotel described by her as having a sort of * season with sweet handsome young faces shining about it in every direction a condition of things * to the present day mrs anna * * of a good old family of new york married mr * of richmond where i when a * visited her in a * little cottage sort of house set in a green garden and she excited my imagination by * * * and telling me delightful stories of her life upon the stage she made quite a favorite of me and i thought her * but i had even then an idea that she was not happy settled down as a wife and * and that one could not serve the two * art and * * * was the * of the hour in my first days in new york i saw her first in * * and in her other * later and her extraordinary * on the stage joined to her * * and love of her family rather * my * expressed above she was about fifty when she came to america and looked very much * as the * * * * she was invited a great deal to the best houses at one of the * * madame * * * sat in the * and * whenever taken out * * i never met * when she played * * in * at

her voice of gold in * * * * one * nothing but simply bowed down before her genius * * had been in her youth in the south and elsewhere in america a darling of the social world when she returned here after her separation from her first husband the * de * the * * and * leader of the * and was known to have formed a new * with * the * * whose wife still lived new york which rarely * an * of this * failed to * or receive in private the * * * * as i have said was when a young woman * sought by * she was the centre of a group of girls and youthful * who * her rooms at her hotel and could not make enough of the exquisite * and * of the * of music * miss * * * a most lovely * was also much * in new york * * large stately and * attended by her * husband * * the * * commanded always a place in the

to * the * * * of the literary and * world there also i first heard * * * * * * music from piano * i find in my correspondence notes from * and count * concerning letters of introduction we had offered to give them in new orleans where she * those who encountered her in private life to the full as much as when they sat * before her lovely * i first met * * at the house of mr * * * of william * * at an evening party miss * was simply radiant in face and voice and manner an * being on the stage and off of it mrs * had just * for * and herself the * * of kentucky belle miss * * to her the * of a gentle rain of tears one * of a certain miss * * a friend of dr * to whom her friends would say cry pretty * cry when she immediately * by an * of * in which she looked * than before miss * must have been the only other living person to whom tears were becoming we were sitting apart a little group of women of whom one cried out oh i am ashamed of myself i have such a bad habit that of sitting on my foot have you cried miss * * * always done so and often on the stage it * one such height and dignity dont you think so and as to not being able to * it * just see here and she rose and * herself with the perfect ease and * of a * returning to its * amid laughing * from us one more * of miss * of a later date in # when mrs * * * had in * a play of mine the * mrs * at mr * * * i was startled by her bringing miss * into the box where i sat alone in the gloom of the big empty * to look on with me at the progress of affairs i felt sure that the famous * would be * * and was * by many * but the clever band of ladies and gentlemen whom i was fortunate enough to have as * of my * of every day must have had some idea of the presence of their distinguished * and did their best to carry off the * of a * which miss * followed with a patience courtesy and * intelligence of * * to me in one scene where a number of young girls * around the * of a bride to be she * her hands * thats pretty pretty * like a * of * mrs * part she of course * as it * for * * and * * * with the great * true skill and knowledge miss * said that day she had just refused sir henry * request for her to play * in his * of * i told him to think of our * * in an attempt to render this * of the * of * youth her laughter rang out so * her appearance and manner were so * * it was hard to accept her * of the reason for her decision mrs * in her dignity of character high devotion to her art and * * could always have claimed and held any place she desired in the better society of new york but there was never a moment save during her * of country rest when her life was not given over to study of her parts and discussion of the various * in her husbands * and elsewhere my * with her during the * of the play mentioned which she gave at the * during the winter season of # and carried afterward on * was * agreeable and * i shall never forget those * in my own library or in her * at the * a * place * of its * * nature utterly foreign to my * ideas going over the play step by step she reading i * with * to stop just there please well leave out half that speech etc etc once when we had * * a scene mrs * looked at me with a merry smile saying the lord * a cheerful * she introduced me to the * of * * which with tea were brought in from a * * * us for * after hours of * work her notes to me during this time were charming with a * literary * touching upon * and * in many * and * other than those of our common interests i have always wished that mrs * had given us in her * more pure * for which i am sure she * as high a * as for the * * and * * of womans nature she has made * miss georgia * of the * * was a charming frank young woman whose * as an * delighted many * once when * an * * for

in a * will be remembered and * the little play in which miss * * was a * * written by * for the * * private * at * in which her * took the leading womans part after * my * several times for charity i sent some * * of the * to the author with * receiving in return the following note of course i sent my * but equally of course i was sure the gallant author never read it my strong * toward the stage and all belonging to it although kept in check by * could not resist * with * * * and * from french * * and * given by both * and * all over the country in * of my work in this direction i may venture

in the dense cloud of * that * around us soon realized the need of this * as the time drew near for the * of my first piece by * my whole thoughts were naturally absorbed by it the season being * i resolved to * myself by * * at * services during which i would try to put the madison square * and all its works * out of my mind alas when for this purpose i took possession of our * in * church i heard * beloved * in a familiar voice and there in the * was the * dr * with whom in his brothers office at the * the day before i had been * long and earnestly about the play dr * was also the editor of the * and a very able * in * of * affairs i found my relations with mrs * very pleasant although confined altogether to our * at * i * and * her as an * of real ability miss * more of a woman of

of enthusiasm and energy in * * the * of * thousand one hundred and fifty dollars and what i think more * to be written down was that our * held * together putting honest hard work and in some cases * * into their * * on the whole * that would have been * to the stage in the * * style of light and graceful * the newspapers took us quite seriously giving capital * as a rule it is however due to mr * * to say that the * portion of our success was * to his * and extraordinary skill in * pictures and * from material that * itself * to lovely * and * color one of the * occasions when this order was * and the stage * society was the meeting of the * evening * at mrs c * where the * * * * were the * there was a great gathering of eager people the streets * with * in line for some distance from the

* genius of pure * burst its bonds and * away over the heads of the * * crowd of not all * people i sat near enough not to lose a * shadow or a * light upon the * * and to catch every * of his speech on that * stage in the * * he was like a * * alone upon a little hill a day or two later i met the great * at an afternoon party in miss * * * where amid red roses * everywhere into blue * a * of * people gathered at the * of the clever * young * there it was on another day that i met for the only time the man who has put the very soul of * into * english * * * the * * husband and * wife came in and mr john drew of * * mrs * * of new orleans sang the best of her * songs then * * * her * mrs * on the * question * * between me and another woman on a little sofa * me to give him a brief * of the
