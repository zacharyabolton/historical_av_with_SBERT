the object of this work has been from * * to show that the southern states had * the power to withdraw from a union into which they had as sovereign * * entered that the * of that right was a * of the letter and spirit of the compact between the states and that the war * by the federal government against the * states was in * of the * of the constitution and * of the principles of the declaration of independence the author from his official position may claim to have known much of the * and acts of his * immediately before and during the war of # and he has sought to furnish material far the future * who when the * and * of the day shall have given place to reason and * thought may better than a * * the causes conduct and results of the war the * to * the work now offered to the public was the desire to correct * * by * * * as to the acts and purposes of the people and the general government of the confederate states by the * of such * terms as * and * and the * that the south was * war against the united states those ignorant of the nature of the union and of the reserved powers of the states have been led to believe that the confederate states were in the condition of * * and that the united states were forced to * to arms for the * of their existence to those who knew that the union was formed for * * purposes and that the states had never surrendered their sovereignty it was a * * to * to them or to their citizens when * their * the terms * and * and further it is shown in the following pages that the confederate states so far from making war or * to destroy the united states as soon as they had an official * * earnestly by peaceful * to * * all questions growing out of the separation from their late * another great * of truth has been the * of the men who * in the * of the confederacy and who bore arms in its defense as the * of a * leading to * sectional * appear * in the * of the convention which * the federal constitution and its many * were * to secure an * between the * and to preserve the interests as well as the * of the several states * * at that time was not confined to a section but was * greater in the south than in the north with a * to its * in the former and * in the latter it therefore thus early * itself as a * * and the provisions of the constitution which were known to be necessary for its adoption bound all the states to recognize and protect that * of property when at a subsequent period there arose in the northern states an * * it was a * and scarcely noticed movement until political * seized upon it as a means to * power had it been left to * and * most * where least informed it never could have * the * of the union and have * one section to carry fire and sword into the other that the * was political in its character and was clearly * as early as # it is believed has been established in these pages to preserve a sectional * and to maintain the * of the states was the effort on one side to * * was the * purpose on the other this struggle began before the men of the confederacy were born how it arose and how it * it has been attempted * to show its last stage was on the question of * * and if in this work it has not been * that the position of the south was * by the constitution and the equal rights of the people of all the states it must be because the author has failed to present the subject with a sufficient degree of force and * in * the events of the war space has not permitted and the loss of both books and papers has prevented the notice of very many * to consideration as well for the humanity as the * of our men in the * * they fought these numerous * it is * to know the official reports made at the time and the subsequent * which have been and are being published by the * will supply more fully and * than could have been done in this work * of the federal government have been presented not in a spirit of * but as a warning to the people against the * by which their * are * when the war ceased the * on which it had been * could no longer be * the * * of mr lincoln which when it was issued he * admitted to be a * had * * by the action of the highest authority known

future to the * * and * of the union * on the opinions and character of the men who are to * this * that they * * to that blessed work one whose public course is ended * them to draw their * from the * of our political history rather than from the lower stream * as it has been by * * and by sectional * a duty to my * to the memory of those who died in defense of a cause * by * as well as * by * and to those who perhaps less fortunate * all and lost all save life and honor in its behalf has * me to attempt the * of their cause and conduct for this purpose i have decided to present an * * of the events which * and attended the struggle of the southern states to maintain their existence and their rights as sovereign * * not the * of the general government the social * of * the just * between constitution government and people has been found so difficult that human history is a record of * efforts to * it a government to afford the * protection and exercise proper care for the * of a people must have * in its * it is this necessity which has divided the human race into separate nations and finally has defeated the * efforts which * have made to give * extent to their * when our fathers * their connection with great * by * themselves free and independent states they * thirteen separate * and were careful to * and preserve each for itself its sovereignty and * at a time when the minds of men are * far from the * our fathers taught it seems proper and well to * to the original principles on which the system of government they * was * the eternal * which they announced the rights which they declared * are the * on which * the * of the confederate cause he must have been a * reader of our political history who has not observed that whether under the style of united colonies or united states which was adopted after the declaration of independence whether under the articles of confederation or the compact of union there everywhere appears the * assertion of state sovereignty and * the * suggestion of any purpose on the part of the states to * themselves into one body will any * * man * that at any time between # and # a proposition to surrender the sovereignty of the states and * them in a * government would have had the least possible chance of adoption can any * fact be more * than that the states did both in the confederation and in the union * their sovereignty and independence as * * * * to * but never becoming the * parts of a nation that such opinions should find * in our day may be * to the natural law of * surely not to a * regard for the terms of the compact for union by the states in all free * the constitution or * law is supreme over the government and in our federal union this was most distinctly marked by * and * against all which was beyond the expressed grants of power to the general government in the * therefore i take the position that those who * * of the compact were the true friends and those who * the * of * powers were the real enemies of the constitutional union * as questions growing out of the institution of negro * or connected with it will occupy a conspicuous place in what is to follow it is important that the reader should have in the very * a right * of the true nature and character of those questions no subject has been more generally * or more * * the institution itself has ceased to * in the united states the * * all who took part in the * to which it gave rise or for which it * a * is passing away and the * which have * in our own country and still more among * * from the field of * are * to be * in the mind of * unless * before they become * by * * it is well known that at the time of the adoption of the federal constitution * * existed in all the states that were parties to that compact unless with the single * of massachusetts in which it had perhaps very recently ceased to * the slaves however were numerous in the southern and very few in the northern states this * was * by * of * soil and * * in any degree by moral * which at that period were not recognized as an * in the question it was simply because negro labor was more * in the south than in the north that the * of negro slaves had been and continued to be * directed to the southern * for the same reason slavery was * by the states of the northern section though it existed in several of them for more than fifty years after the adoption of the constitution while the * of slaves into the south continued to be carried on by northern * and northern * without * in the * from any quarter until it was * by the * action of the southern states themselves the constitution * * any * by congress with the * to use its own language with the * or * of such persons as any of the states should think proper to * to the year # during the * period of more than twenty years the matter was * under the control of the * states nevertheless every southern state without * either had already * or proceeded to * laws

no authority to * in the * of slaves or in the * of them within any of the states and with regard to the other that no authority existed to * the * or * of such persons as the states might think proper to admit * to the year # so * and final was this statement of the * of the authority of congress considered to be that when a similar * was presented two or three years afterward the * of the house was * to return it to the * in # congress * itself of the very * moment at which the constitutional * ceased to be * passed an act * the * of slaves into any part of the united states from and after the first day of january # this act was passed with great * in the house of representatives there were one hundred and thirteen # * to five # * and it is a * fact as showing the absence of any sectional division of sentiment at that period that the five * were divided as equally as possible between the two * two of them were from northern and three from southern states the * had thus been finally * some months before the * of the author of these pages and has never since had * existence in any of the united states the question of the * or * of the system of negro * already existing in

for the war that resulted no moral nor * * were really * in either the earlier or later * which so long * and finally * the union they were simply * between different * with * * and interests it is

and * with reference to the principles and purposes of * parties or * * has had immense influence in * the opinions and * of the world the idea of freedom is * that of slavery * to the moral sense of * in general it is easy therefore to understand the effect of * the one set of terms to one party the other to another in a contest which had no just application whatever to the * * of freedom or

the difficulties in the way of * * the * here * between the * or * of slaves and the * of * things altogether different although so generally * early and clearly drawn under circumstances and in a

* have since been formed in #* the adoption of the federal * celebrated * for the government of this * territory was adopted by the congress with the full consent and indeed at the express instance of

territory accompanied by a letter from william henry harrison the governor afterward president of the united states had been under consideration nearly two years earlier the prayer of these * was for a * of the sixth article of the * so as to permit the introduction of slaves into the territory the whole subject was referred to a select committee of seven members * of representatives from virginia * pennsylvania south carolina kentucky and new york and the * from the * territory on the #* of the * february # this committee made a report favorable to the prayer of the * and * a * of the * article for ten years in their report the committee after * their opinion that a * * of the article in question would be * to the people of the * territory proceeded to say these were the * * of representatives of every part of the * * with the * of the constitution speaking before any sectional division had * in connection with the subject it is remarkable that the very same opinions which they express and * which they * had fifty years afterward come to be * and * by one half of the union as * and sectional when * by the other half no final action seems to have been taken on the subject before the * of congress but it was brought forward at the next * in a more * form on the #* of january # the * laid before the house of representatives a letter from governor harrison * certain resolutions * and * adopted by the * council and house of representatives of the * territory in favor of the * of the sixth article of the * and the introduction of slaves into the territory which they say would meet the * of at least nine * of the good citizens of the same among the resolutions were the following these resolutions were submitted to a committee drawn like the former from different * of the country which again reported * * in * the reasons given by the former committee their report was * by the house and a resolution to * the * article was adopted the proposition failed however in the senate and there the matter seems to have been dropped the * * a * and * * in the political history of the country the * which has been made to the * of # * it proper to notice very * the * put forward during the discussion of the missouri question and often repeated since that the * * a * in support of the claim of a power in congress to * the question of the * of slaves into the * and in * of the * * applied in # to a portion of the louisiana territory the difference between the congress of the confederation and that of the federal constitution is so broad that the action of the former can in no just sense be taken as a * for the latter the congress of the confederation represented the states in their sovereignty each * having one vote so that all the states were of equal weight in the decision of any question it had * executive and in some degree * powers thus * all * of government in itself during its * a committee known as the committee of the states * the powers of the congress which was in spirit if not in fact an * of the states on the other hand the congress of the constitution is only the * department of the general government with powers * * and * limited to those delegated by the states it is further held in check by an executive and a * and * of two * each having peculiar and * * if then it be * is at least very * the congress of the confederation had * the power to * slave property from the territory * of the * river that power must have been * from its character as an * of the sovereign states not from the articles of confederation in which no * of the grant of authority to exercise such a * can be found the congress of the constitution is * * from the * of any power not distinctly and * delegated to it as the * * of an organized government what was * in the former case therefore * clearly * in the latter but there is yet another material * to be observed the states * of what was called the * territory were * members of the congress which adopted the * for its government and gave * their full and free consent the * may therefore be regarded as * a * between the states which * and those which received that * * in the other case missouri and the whole region * by the missouri compromise were parts of the territory * from france under the name of louisiana and as it * two parties to make or * a * france and the government of the united states should have * in any * of the * by which louisiana had been * and which * to the * of the * territory all the rights * and * of citizens of the united states and the free * of their liberty property and the * they * papers * * foreign relations p # for all the reasons thus stated it seems to me * that the action of the congress of the confederation in # could not * a * to * the action of the congress of the united states in # and that the * * of the missouri compromise was without constitutional authority in * of the rights of a part of the * * of the territory and in * of the * of the * with france the * of sectional * was the question of the * of political power in its earlier * this was * the * of the louisiana territory from france in # and the subsequent * of a portion of that territory into the union as a state * one of the * occasions for the * of sectional * and gave rise to the first * or * which proceeded from new england of a * of the union yet although negro slavery existed in louisiana no * was made of that as an * to the * the ground of opposition is * stated in a letter of that period from one massachusetts * to * the influence of our part of the union must be * by the * of more weight at the other * some years afterward in # occurred the * contest with regard to the * into the union of missouri the second state * out of the louisiana territory the * arose out of a proposition to * to the * of the new state a * * slavery or * * * the * discussion that ensued was continued into the first * of a different congress from that in which it * and * the whole country during the * between the two it was the first question that ever seriously threatened the * of the union and the first in which the sentiment of opposition to slavery in the * was introduced as an * of sectional * it was clearly shown in * that such * were altogether * that the number of existing slaves would not be * by their * from the older states to missouri and * that the proposed * would be contrary to the spirit if not to the letter of the constitution notwithstanding all this the * was adopted by a vote almost * sectional in the house of representatives it failed in the senate through the firm resistance of the southern * by a few * and * northern members of that body the * of the new state without any * was finally accomplished by the addition to the bill of a section for ever * slavery in all that portion of the louisiana territory lying north of * * and thirty minutes north * except * * leaving the portion south of that line open to * either with or without slaves this provision as an * to the * of the new state without * * the celebrated missouri compromise it was * accepted by a small majority of the southern members nearly half of them * against it under the * that it was * by the constitution and that missouri was * to * the question for herself as a matter of right not of * or * among those who thus thought and * were some of the * * and * * of that period this brief * may have * to show that the question of the right or wrong of the institution of slavery was in no wise * in the earlier sectional * nor was it otherwise in those of a later period in which it was the lot of the author of these * to bear a part they were * * for sectional * or * the * or the destruction of that * of power or * between north and south which was early recognized as a * principle in our federal system it does not follow that both parties to this contest were * right or * wrong in their * the determination of the question of right or wrong must be left to the * * after examination of the evidence the object of these * * has been to clear the subject of the * produced by * * and the * of * * the first * of the * congress # was a * one the * * from mexico of new mexico and * required * by congress in the senate the * reported by the committee on * were referred to a select committee of which mr clay the distinguished senator from kentucky was * from this committee * the * which taken together are known as the compromise measures of # with some others i * the division of the * * territory by an * to the * ocean of the missouri compromise line of * * and thirty minutes north * this was not because of any * * or * in that line but because it had been accepted by the country as a * of the sectional question which thirty years before had threatened a * of the union and it had * in the public mind a * respect which it seemed * to * a majority however decided otherwise and the line of political * was then * as far as it lay in the power of congress to do so an * of the vote will show that this result was effected almost * by the representatives of the north and that the south was not * for an action which proved to be the opening of * box however * it may have been in # to * that political line as * a * * of different sectional interests and however it may be * as the * by congress of a * not delegated to it it is to be remembered that the act had received such * and * by the people of the states as to give it a value which it did not * possess * had been the * borne by the tree and it should not have been * * down and cast into the fire the * assertion then made was that all * was * and that the popular will should be left * in the * of new states this theory was good enough in itself and as an * proposition could not be * but its * * has but * * the * of its * as will be seen when we come to consider the events that occurred a few years later in * and elsewhere * * under the * light of time and with the calm consideration we can usually give to the * past the compromise * of # * the * of that sectional spirit so * at * with the general purposes of the union and so * of the * and * benefit which the constitution was intended to secure the * to * the territory * from mexico by an * of the line of the missouri compromise to the * was a consequence of the purpose to admit * as a state of the union before it had * the * * and while it was * under the control of a military organization sent from new york during the war with mexico and * in * upon the * of peace the * of the * against the * of the line was exhibited in the division of the territory of texas by that * and * to the state of money to secure her consent to the * of her * in the case of texas the north had everything to gain and nothing to lose by the application of the practice of * compromise on an * line in the case of * the conditions were * the south might have been the * and the north the * by a * of the same rule the * which it was * that the south received was a more * law for the * of * from service or labor but it is to be remarked that this law provided for the execution by the general government of * which had been * by the federal compact upon the several states of the union the benefit to be * from a * of that law would be small in comparison with the evil to result from the * * that the states had thus been relieved from a duty which they had assumed in the adoption of the compact of union whatever * to lead the people of any of the states to feel that they could be relieved from their constitutional * by * them to the general government or that they might thus or otherwise * or resist them could not fail to be like the * which the enemy * amid the * the union of states formed to secure the * * of * and to * * among the * states could not without * its character * such * as rendered its parts * to the * * and happiness of one another it was * * that as the * of * of the states had * what were * personal liberty laws which * the * of state * in the * of * from service and labor it became necessary that the general government should provide the * * for the execution of the law the result proved what might have been * those * which had * their constitutional * which had * a previous law of congress for the execution of a provision of the constitution and had * men who came * to recover their property would * or * so as to render * * any law that could be * for that purpose in the * cases in which it might be * the event would be attended with such conflict between the state and federal authorities as to * * * greater than those it was intended to correct it was during the progress of these * * that the south lost its most trusted leader and the senate its greatest and * * he was taken from us when his * power his * * his love of peace and his devotion to the constitution might have * * or * in that he might have been to the south the * to * the * in safety over the * sea truly did mr * personal friend although his greatest political * of him in his * address there was nothing * or low or * * that came near the head or the heart of mr * his * * speak from the grave with the wisdom of * would that they could have been * by his * while he yet lived i had been * by the legislature of mississippi as my own * and entered upon a new term of service in the senate on march # # on my return to mississippi in # the subject * * the public mind was that of the compromise measures of the previous year * upon these was a proposition for a convention of * from the people of the southern states * to consider what steps ought to be taken for their future peace and safety and the * of their constitutional rights there was * of opinion with regard to the * of the measures referred to but the * no longer followed the usual lines of party division they who saw in those measures the * of disaster to the south had no settled policy beyond a convention the object of which should be to * new and more * * against the * of * they were * charged with a desire to destroy the * feeling entertained by few very few if by any in mississippi and * by none there were many however who held that the principles of the declaration of independence and the purposes for which the union was formed were of higher value than the mere union itself independence existed before the compact of union between the states and if that compact should be broken in part and therefore destroyed in whole it was hoped that the * of the people in the states might still be * those who were most devoted to the union of the constitution might consequently be expected to resist most * any * of * power the effect of which would be to * the federal government from its proper character and by * the * to destroy the union of the states my * * to the united states senate had * upon me for six years longer the office which i preferred to all others i could not therefore be * of * a * for any other office from the * convention the meeting of which was then drawing near having as a senator of the state freely * in * on the measures which were now * so much interest in the public mind it was very proper that i should visit the people in different parts of the state and render an account of my * my devotion to the union of our fathers had been so often and so * declared i had on the floor of the senate so * * any question of my * to it my services civil and military had now extended through so long a period and were so generally * i felt quite assured that no * of * or ill will could lead the people of mississippi to believe that i had * their trust by * the power they had * on me to destroy the government to which i was * then as afterward i regarded the separation of the states as a great though not the greatest evil i returned from my * among the people at the time appointed for the meeting of the * convention of the * or * party during the previous year the governor general john a * had been compelled to * his office to answer an * against him for * with the * * against * the charges were not * many of the * party of mississippi myself * recognized a * * to * him for the office of which he had been * when however the * met in party convention the committee appointed to select * on comparison of opinions * that in view of the effort to * upon the party the * of a purpose of * some of the * of general * might * success a proposition was therefore made in the committee on * that i should be invited to become a * and that if general * would withdraw my * of the * and the resignation of my place in the united states senate which it was known would result was to be followed by the appointment by the governor of general * to the * place in the senate i offered no * to this * but left it to general * to decide he claimed the * for the * or nothing and was so * to * the success of the * * i engaged * in the * and continued in the field until * down by * this occurred just before the election of * to a state convention for which provision had been made by the legislature and the * for which conducted in the main upon party lines was in progress * with that for the ordinary state officers the * majority in the state when the * began was * at eight thousand at this election in september for * to the state convention we were * by about seven thousand five hundred * seeing in this result the * of almost * defeat general * withdrew from the * as a * and the executive committee of the party * to fill * called on me to take his place my health did not permit me to leave home at that time and only about six weeks remained before the election was to take place but being assured that i was not expected to take any active part and that the party asked only the use of my name i * to be announced and immediately resigned from the united states senate nevertheless i soon afterward took the field in person and worked earnestly until the day of election i was defeated but the majority of more than seven thousand * that had been cast a short time before against the party with which i was * was reduced to less than one thousand in this * both before and after i became a * no * or appeal of mine was directed against the * of the union * however that the * of the time * danger to the south from the * by the general government of * powers i * that mississippi should enter into the proposed meeting of the people of the southern states to consider what could and should be done to * our future safety * * my * that unless such action were taken then sectional * would * greater * in the future and that if the * was * the last opportunity for a peaceful * would be lost then the issue would have to be settled by blood happy in the peaceful * of a * * engaged in * for servants in the * of my land in building in * * and the like * the time passed * away until my * was interrupted by an invitation to take a place in the cabinet of mr * who had been * to the * of the united states in november # although * attached to mr * * and * the highest estimate of his character and political principles private and personal reasons led me to * the offer this was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his * which took place on the #* of march # while in washington on this visit i was induced by public * to * my determination and accept the office of secretary of war the public records of that period will best show how the duties of that office were performed while in the senate i had * the * of a * to * the valley of the mississippi with the * coast and when an * was made to * the most * route for that purpose the secretary of war was charged with its application we had then but little of that minute and * knowledge of the * of the * which was * for a determination of the * several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various * supposed to be * within the northern and southern limits of the united states the * which i had used as a senator were the military necessity for such means of * and the need of safe and rapid communication with the * slope to secure its * as a part of the union in the organization and * of these parties and in the * of their officers care was taken to provide for * full and * information upon every point * in the determination of the route the only * made was in the more prompt and * * of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the * in like manner my * while in the senate of an * of the capitol by the * of a new * and hall of representatives may have caused the * for that object to be put under my charge as secretary of war during my administration of the war department material * were made in the * of arms iron * were introduced and * were made which led to the * of heavy guns * instead of * them after * * were made with regard to * which subsequently led to the use of a * * for artillery during the same period the army was increased by the addition of two regiments of infantry and two of cavalry the officers of these regiments were chosen * by * from those already in service in the regular army and * by appointment from civil life

the will of the people * should * their * when they should form a constitution and as a state be admitted into the union and that no * by congress should be permitted to * with the free exercise of

* that because the congress of the confederation by the * of # * * * in all the * territory the * of the constitution must have recognized such power to * in the congress of the united states * the * that the * * of what is known as the missouri compromise was * by the * of the * of # to make the action of the congress of the confederation a * for the congress of the united states is to * the great * between the two the congress of the confederation represented the states in their sovereignty and as such representatives had * executive and in some degree * power * to it * it was an * of the states in certain cases a majority of nine states were required to decide a question but there is no express * or * such as is to be found in the ninth and * * to the constitution of the united

* to powers * delegated by the states if then it be admitted which is certainly * that the congress of the confederation had power to * slave property * of the * river that power must have been * from its character as * the states in their sovereignty for no * of such a power is to be found in the articles of confederation if it be assumed that the absence of a * was * to the * of the power in the

not * against the possession of power by the united states congress to * slavery into or * it from * belonging to the united states this subject which had for more than a quarter of a century been one of * discussion and sectional * was * and found occasion for renewed discussion in the organization of * * for * and * the * on * of the two houses agreed to report a bill in * with that recognized

on which according to the order of business established by the * of the house of representatives the bill could be introduced by the committee of that house on sunday morning the #* of january # gentlemen of each committee called at my house and mr * * of the senate committee fully explained the proposed bill and stated their purpose to be through my aid to obtain an interview on that day with the president to * whether the bill would meet his * the president was known to be * opposed to the reception of visits on sunday for the discussion of any political subject but in this case it

was added that the true * and meaning of the act was not to * slavery into any territory or state nor to * it * but to leave the people * perfectly free to form and * their domestic * in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states from the terms of this bill as well as from the * that were used in its behalf it is evident that its purpose was to leave the * equally open to

the * * known as * sovereignty its assertion led to the * which * resulted in a * of the * party sectional * the deadly foe of the domestic * and the general * which the compact of union was formed to

and they were probably correct in the belief that i was behind the general opinion of the people of the state as to the * of prompt secession on arrival at washington i found as had been anticipated

* however with * of the same class which have since been addressed to the congress of the united states the reader of * * must regret that it was not accepted by mr * * as a * and that his views of

only * it has * served in the hands of its * * * and * attention from the * * * as a mere * fact we have seen that * * among * the * and most * of all * to which the name slavery has ever been * in

that the sectional * which exhibited itself in # on the application of missouri for * into the union which again broke out on the proposition for the * of texas in # and which * after the mexican war never again to be * until its fell results had been fully accomplished was not the consequence of any difference on the * question of slavery it was the * of sectional * and political ambition it

with the * of a * proposition or a bill in * the truth remains * and * that the existence of * * was in no wise the cause of the conflict but only an incident in the later * that arose however its

of the fourth article which * as follows the president and * of the united states every senator and * in congress the members of every state legislature and all executive and * officers both of the united states and of the several states were required to take an oath or * to support the constitution containing these provisions it is easy to understand how those who considered them in conflict

* from service or labor in # a more * law was * as part of the celebrated compromise of that year but the very fact that the federal government had taken the matter into its own hands and provided for

to the provisions of the constitution itself but to the domestic * of the people of other states long before the * of the constitution one of the charges preferred in the declaration of independence against the government of great * as * the separation of the colonies from that country was that of having excited domestic * among us now the * were * with * * secret * had been sent and in one case

* and instructions above * we may * certain * so * that they need only to be stated # in the first place it is clear that the * to the convention of # represented not the people of the united states in mass as has been most * * by some political * but the people of the several states as * as in the congress of that * with her sixty thousand * having entire * with pennsylvania which had more than four hundred thousand or virginia with her seven hundred and fifty thousand # the object for which they were appointed was not to * a new government but * and * to * the federal constitution already existing in other words to * the articles of confederation and to * such * or additional provisions as should be * necessary to render them * to the * of the union # it is evident that the term federal constitution or its * constitution of the federal government was as freely and * applied to the system of government established by the articles of * a * or compact between states * * their

unless and until it should be afterward * by the several states it is evident also that what was * was the * provided in the articles of confederation for their own * a * by the congress and afterward ratification by the * of every state before the * should be * upon any the departure from this condition which actually occurred will presently be noticed when the convention met in philadelphia in may # it soon became evident that the work before it would take a * range and * more * * in the federal constitution than had at first been * under the articles of confederation the general government was obliged to * upon the * of the several states for the execution of its * except its own officers and * and in time of war the federal army and navy it could exercise no control upon individual citizens with regard to the states no * or * measures could be employed to * its authority in case of opposition or * to its exercise this last was a * of the confederation which it was not * nor possible to change and no * was made to it but it was generally admitted that some * should be * to enable the general government to exercise its * * by means of a * authority * directly upon the individual citizens within the limits of its constitutional powers the necessity for such provision was * beyond the common ground of a * of this necessity there was a wide * of opinion among the members of the convention * * a * from maryland in an account of its * afterward given to the legislature of that state * these * as * three parties in the convention which he * as follows in his account of the second party above described mr * * to those representatives of the larger states who wished to * a * * of * in the congress instead of the equal * of the states whether large or small which existed under the articles of confederation there was naturally much * on the part of the greater * pennsylvania north carolina and * * at that period * that of all the others * but which in the congress * less than one third of the * strength on the other hand the * states were * of their * in the union of the very * one as we have seen had sent no representatives to the convention and the other had * her * * to * upon the * of * * in the congress this difference gave more trouble than any other question that came before the convention and for some time threatened to prove * and to * any final * it was * settled by a compromise provision was made for the * of the people of the states in one * of the federal legislature the house of representatives in * to their numbers in the other * the senate for the equal * of the states as such the * of this * was * * by a * that no state should ever be * of its equal * in the senate without its own consent this compromise required no sacrifice of principle on either side and no provision of the constitution has in practice proved more entirely * it is not necessary and would be beyond the * of this work to * to give a history of the * of the convention of # that may be obtained from other * all that is * for the present purpose is to notice a few * of special * or * to the subject of * early in the * of the convention a * of resolutions was introduced by mr * randolph of virginia * a proposed plan of government which were considered in committee of the whole house and formed the * of a * discussion the first of these resolutions as * before a vote was taken was in these words this was followed by other * in all as adopted and reported by the * which the word national occurred * times the day after the report of the committee was made mr * of * moved to strike out the words national government in the resolution above * and to * the words government of the united states which he said was the proper title he wished also the plan to go forth as an * of the articles of confederation that is to say he wished to avoid even the appearance of * to form a new government instead of * the old one which was the proper object of the convention this motion was agreed to without opposition and as a consequence the word national was * out wherever it occurred and * makes its appearance in the constitution finally adopted the prompt * after introduction of this word national is * much more * of the * and purpose of the * of the constitution than its mere absence from the constitution would have been it is a clear * that they did not mean to give any countenance to the idea which * not killed has again * its * crest in these latter * the government which they organized was a * * instead of a confederacy of sovereign members * their great work of * and * the convention proceeded to * the * of a government for the confederacy * confined to certain * and limited powers but complete in all its parts * executive and * and provided with the means for * all its * without * with the sovereignty freedom and independence of the * states all this might have been done without going beyond the limits of their commission to * the articles of confederation and to consider and report such * and provisions as might seem necessary to render the federal constitution * to the * of government and the * of the union a serious difficulty however was * the * and last of the * articles had this provision which has already been referred to the articles of this confederation shall be * observed by every state and the union shall be * nor shall any * at any time * be made in any of them unless such * be agreed to in a congress of the united states and be afterward * by the * of every state it is * from an examination of the records as has already been shown that the original idea in calling a convention was that their * should take the course * by this * a report to the congress and then if * by that body a * to the various * for final action there was no reason to * the * of congress in which a mere majority would * the question but the consent of the * of every state was * in order to final ratification and there was serious reason to fear that this consent could not be obtained * island as we have seen had declined to send any representatives to the convention of the three * from new york two had withdrawn and other * of * had appeared in case of the failure of a single legislature to * the * of the convention would go for * under a * * to the letter of the article above * the danger of a * * of their efforts was * in this * the convention took the responsibility of * the limits of their instructions and * a * which was in direct * of the letter of the articles of confederation this was the introduction of a provision into the new constitution that the ratification of nine states should be sufficient for its * among themselves in order to * this provision it was necessary to * it to authority higher than that of congress and the state * is to the people of the states assembled by their representatives in convention * it was provided by the * and last article of the new constitution that the ratification of the * of nine states should * for its * between the states so * the same there was another reason of a more general and perhaps more * character for this reference to * for ratification even if entire * of the state * could have been expected under the american theory of republican government * of the people * * and * as such are * with the * power * in the people of an organized and independent community assembled in mass in other words they * and exercise what is * the sovereignty of the people state * with * powers do not possess or * sovereignty still less does the congress of a union or confederacy of states which is by two * removed from the seat of sovereignty we sometimes read or hear of delegated sovereignty divided sovereignty with other * * of the same sort but no such thing as a division or * of sovereignty is possible in order therefore to * the * article above * and to give the highest * to the compact for the * of important powers and * of government to a common agent an authority above that of the state * was necessary mr madison in the * says it has been * noted among the * of the confederation that in many of the states it had received no higher * than a mere * ratification this * would of course have applied with greater force to the proposed constitution which provided for additional grants of power from the states and the * of larger and more * powers upon a general government which was to act upon * instead of states if the question of its * had been submitted merely to the several state * * the * * of * it to the * people of the states in their sovereign capacity as provided in the final article of the constitution in this article provision was * made for the secession if necessary of a part of the states from a union which when formed had been declared * and its terms and articles to be * observed by every state opposition was made to the provision on this very * it was * a * of the union and that it would furnish a * for future * mr * a distinguished member from * * of the united * if nine out of thirteen states can * the compact six out of nine will be just as able to * the future one * mr madison who was one of the leading members of the convention * afterward in the * the adoption of the new constitution * the question on what principle the confederation which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the states can be * without the * consent of the parties to it he * this question by * to the * necessity of the case to the great principle of * to the * law of nature and of * god which * that the safety and happiness of society are the * at which all political * * and to which all such * must be * he * however to give other grounds of * mr * idea of the * of * any statement of the right of secession until the occasion * for its exercise whether right or wrong in itself is * * as * of the * exhibited by other * of that period as well as himself with regard to that delicate truth the only possible * to the view here taken of the * article of the constitution as a provision for the secession of any nine states which might think proper to * themselves of it from union with such as should refuse to do so and the * of an * or more perfect union with one another is to regard it as a provision for the * of the old union or confederation under * conditions by the majority which should * to them with a * of the right of the * * to withdraw * or stand * the idea of * any state or states to enter into or to continue in union with the others by * is as absolutely * under the one * as under the * reference to one state or a * of states as well as with regard to a majority the article * that the ratification of the * of nine states shall be sufficient for the * of this * between all * the states so * the same it is submitted whether a * * of this right of the nine states to form a new government is not found in the fact of the sovereignty in each of them making them a law * themselves and therefore the final judge of what the * of each community demand * perhaps in advance of its proper place in the * attention of the reader may be directed to the * * by this article of the constitution of that * * which has been put forward by some distinguished * of later date that the constitution was established by the people of the united states in the * if such had been the case the will of a majority * * and expressed would have been * upon the * no such idea existed in its * it was not even established by the states in the * nor was it proposed that it should be it was submitted for the * of each * the time and place at their own * so that the * of ratification did * from december # # to may # # the long period required for these * makes * the * of the assertion that it was a decision by the * of one people or one community in which a majority of the * cast determined the result we have seen that the * to the convention of # were chosen by the several states as * is hardly necessary to add that they * in the convention as in the federal congress by * state * one vote we have seen also that they were sent for the sole and express purpose of * the articles of confederation and * means for * the federal constitution * to the * of government and the * of the union that the terms union united states federal constitution and constitution of the federal government were applied to the old confederation in * the same sense in which they are used under the new that the proposition to * a national government was distinctly * by the convention that the right of any state or states to withdraw from union with the others was * * and that the idea of * of a state or * measures was distinctly * under any * that can be put upon the action of the convention to the original copy of the constitution as set forth by its * for the consideration and final action of the people of the states was attached the following words followed by the * of george washington president and * from virginia and the other * who * it this * to the * mere * of its * and of the fact that it had the * consent of all the states then present by their * of all the * for some of them refused to sign * been * * by some * as if it were a part of the constitution and * that it was done in the sense of * of the work but the work was not done when the convention closed its * and * it was scarcely begun there was no * or * force whatever in what had been already done it was still to be submitted to the states for * or * even if a majority of eight out of thirteen states had * it the * of the ninth would have rendered it * and * mr madison who was one of the most distinguished of its * and * writing after it was * and * but before it was * said it is time now to * that the powers of the convention were merely * and * that they were so meant by the states and so understood by the convention and that the latter have accordingly * and proposed a constitution which is to be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is written unless it be * with the * of those to whom it is * no * the * and terms in which this * was expressed will be considered in the next chapter the * system of union or confederation the terms are employed * and * by the * of that period * by the convention of # and * as we have seen in the constitution which they * and have set forth was now to be considered and * on by the people of the several states this they did in the highest and

people of the state of new * in convention on the #* of june in the name and behalf of the people of the state of new * declared their * and adoption of the constitution in this state also the

however like massachusetts new * and south carolina virginia demanded certain * as a more * * against * and accompanied the demand with the following declaration whether in speaking of a possible * of powers by the people of the united states the convention had in mind the action of such a people in the * community which did not * and of which they could hardly have entertained even an * * of the people of virginia for whom they were speaking and of the other united states then taking similar * a question which scarcely * of * but which will be more fully considered in the proper place new

features of the constitution and an * * to * from our sister states could have * upon a sufficient number to * it without * for previous * the ratification was expressed in the usual terms as made by the * of the people of the state of new york in the name and in behalf of the people of the said state * it was a declaration of the principles in which the * of new york was * one * of which * as

* independence the convention of north carolina on august # # had * the proposed constitution or more * speaking had * her ratification until action could be taken upon the * of the following resolution adopted by her convention more than a year afterward when the * organized government had been in * for nearly nine months and * no convention of the states had been called to * the * carolina had good reason to feel assured that the most important provisions of her proposed * and declaration of rights would be adopted she * to the * compact on november # # her convention agreed in

majority * is on may # # when the * government had been in * for nearly fifteen months and when it had become * certain that the * thought necessary would be * convention of the people of * island * to the new union and * the constitution though even then by a majority of only two * in *# to # the ratification was expressed in * the same language as that which has now been so * * it is particularly to be noted that during the * between the organization of the federal government under the new constitution and the ratification of that constitution by north carolina and * island * those states were absolutely independent and * with any other political community unless they be considered as still * the united states of america which by the articles of confederation had been

claim of any right to control their action as if they had been mere * or political divisions of one great * community or nation their * to the union was desired but their freedom of choice in the

the united states and * island it may not be * to * to a letter sent by the government of the latter to the president and congress and * by the president to the senate with the following note some * from the communication referred to are * the * * of the last three * and the * from the records of a * now * have been presented as necessary to a right * of the nature and principles of the compact of # on which * the questions at issue in the secession of 1861 and the contest that ensued between the states we have seen that the united colonies when they declared their independence formed a * or * with one another as united states this title * the adoption of the articles of confederation it was assumed immediately after the declaration of independence and was continued under the articles of confederation the first of which declared that the style of this confederacy shall be the united states of america and this style was * * the * of the present constitution the name was not adopted as * to or * from confederate as some seem to have * if it has any * now it must have had the same under the articles of confederation or even before they were adopted it has been fully shown that the states which thus became and continued to be united whatever form their union assumed * and continued to act as * and sovereign political * the * * that they * as one people in their * capacity has not an * of fact to serve as a * to go back to the very beginning the british colonies never * one people judge story in his * on the constitution seems to * the contrary though he * from a direct assertion of it and clouds the subject by a confusion of terms he says now it is * that none of the colonies before the revolution were in the most large and general sense independent or sovereign * they were all * settled under and * to the british crown and then he * to show that they were in their * condition not * proposition which nobody * as colonies they had no claim and made no * to sovereignty they were subject to the british crown unless like the * * a law * themselves but they were independent of each * only point which has any bearing upon their subsequent relations there was

years between that period and the year # when the first * congress met in philadelphia several other * and * * of colonies had been formed and the people had been taught the * of union for a common

brought this idea to the * of america and it found expression in many * among the * colonies mr * * in his * address delivered in new york in 1861 following the lead of judge story and with even less * * * that before their independence of england was asserted they the colonies * a * people to * this * contrary to all history as it * is unable to * any * american authority but * almost * upon * * employed in * in the british * about the period of the american * as that people that loyal and * people this * and * people etc etc the * who made use of this * * concerning the * of a distant * in the freedom of * * were not * their ideas with the * of a * * and could little have * the extraordinary use to be made of their * nearly a century afterward in * a theory * to history as well as to common sense it is as if the familiar * often employed in our own time such as the people of * or the people of south america should be * by some * * of a future * as evidence that the subjects of the * and those of the king of * were but one people or that the * and the * belonged to the same political community mr * it is true * two * of the * congress to * his remarkable proposition that the colonies were a people one of these is found in a letter addressed by the congress to general * in october # * against the * of * in boston in which they say we * your * to consider what a * this conduct must have to * and force a free people * well disposed to * measures into * from this expression mr * * that the congress considered themselves the representatives of a people but by reference to the * of the congress he might * have * that the letter to general * was written in behalf of the town of boston and * of massachusetts bay the people of which were considered by all america as suffering in the common cause for their noble and * opposition to * acts of * the * object was to * his * from the assurance we have of the * * of the * of the town of boston and of the * of massachusetts bay to * his * these were the people referred to by the congress and the children of the * who occupied at that period the town of boston and * of massachusetts bay would have been not a little * to be * as one people in any other respect than that of the common cause with the * * of maryland the * of virginia the * of pennsylvania or the * of * island the other * of mr * is from the first sentence of the declaration of independence when in the course of human events it * necessary for one people to * the political * which have connected them with another etc etc this he says * the good people of the colonies as one people plainly it does no such thing the * is so * as scarcely to admit of serious answer the declaration of independence * with a general proposition one people is * to saying any people the use of the * one and another was the simple and natural way of * this general proposition one people * and was * intended to * to all cases of the same * that of new * or * or south carolina or of any other people existing or to * and whether acting * or in * it * to any case and all cases of * of political * as well as to the case of the british colonies it does not either directly or by * * their * and has no bearing whatever upon the question when the colonies united in sending representatives to a congress in philadelphia there was no * suggestion of a * * their separate * in one * mass no such idea existed or with their known opinions could have existed they did not * to become a united * or * but * themselves united * united for purposes of * * and defense as the new england colonies had been united more than a hundred years before it was as united * as a state or united * these * * and * independent of each * and * their independence of the * as united states they adopted the articles of confederation in which the separate sovereignty freedom and independence of each was distinctly asserted they were united states when great * * the * freedom and independence of each distinctly and * recognized by name france and * were parties to the same * and the french and * * still express and * more exactly than the english the true idea intended to be * in the * * * or * * * states united it was without any change of * as united * any sacrifice of * any compromise of * the same parties entered into a new and * compact with one another under the present constitution larger and more * powers were * upon the common government for the purpose of * a more perfect * for that of * or * the * of the * members the point which now * * the * is the * fact that in all these * of circumstances and of government there has never been one single instance of action by the people of the united states in the * or as one body before the * of independence whatever was done by the people of the colonies was done by the people of each * * and * of each other although in union by their * for certain * purposes since the assertion of their independence the people of the united states have never * otherwise than as the people of each state * and * the articles of confederation were established and * by the several states either through * of their people or through the state * the constitution which * those articles was * as we have seen by * chosen and * by the several states and was * by * of the people of the same * acting in entire independence of one another this ratification alone gave it force and * without the * and ratification of the people of the states it would have been as mr madison expressed it of no more consequence than the paper on which it was written it was never submitted to the people of the united states in the * or as a people indeed no such political community as the people of the united states in the * * at this day or ever did * * in congress * * the states as equal * the house of representatives is not a body of representatives of the people of the united states as often * asserted but the constitution in the second section of its first article * * that it shall be composed of members chosen by the people of the several states nor is it true that the president and * are * as it is sometimes * stated by vote of the whole people of the union their election is even more * what such a vote would be than that of the representatives who in numbers at least * the strength of their * states in the election of president and * the constitution article * * that each state shall * in such manner as the legislature * may direct a number of * for the purpose of * a president and * the number of these * is * * upon the equal sovereignty * upon the * * of the * states it is then absolutely true that there has never been any such thing as a vote of the people of the united states in the * no such people is recognized by the constitution and no such political community has ever existed it is equally true that no officer or department of the general government formed by the constitution * authority from a majority of the whole people of the united states or has ever been chosen by such majority as little as any other is the united states government a government of a majority of the mass the * to the constitution proposed by the convention of # is in these words the * of this * has been generally regarded as the * of the * of * it has been * as meaning that we the people of the united states as a * body or as a nation in our * capacity had * and established the constitution over the states this * * in the beginning the most serious difficulty in the way of the ratification of the constitution it was probably this to which that * * * * of massachusetts * when he wrote to * henry lee i * at the * * henry in the virginia convention on the third day of the * and in the very opening of the * attacked it * he said speaking of the system of government set forth in the proposed constitution again on the next day with reference to the same subject he said when i asked that question i thought the meaning of my * was * the fate of this question and of america may * on this have they said we the states have they made a * of a compact between states if they had this would be a confederation it is otherwise most clearly a * government the question * sir on that poor little * expression we the people instead of the states of america the same difficulty arose in other minds and in other * the * of mr * were removed by the * of others and by the assurance of the adoption of the * thought * of that * * afterward * in the * * be referred to * mr * * was thus answered by mr madison it must be remembered that this was spoken by one of the leading members of the convention which formed the constitution within a few months after that * was drawn up mr * * could * appreciate his clear answer to the * made the people intended were those of the * * only organized * of people * sovereign powers of government and the idea intended was the ratification and * of the constitution by direct act of the people in their * instead of by act of their * as in the adoption of the articles of confederation the explanation seems to have been as * as it was simple and * mr henry although he fought to the last against the ratification of the constitution did not again bring forward this * for the reason no doubt that it had been fully answered indeed we hear no more of the * which suggested it from that period for nearly half a century when it was * and has since been employed to * that theory of a great * national government which mr madison so distinctly * but we have * to * of information not then * which make the * and meaning of the constitution still * when mr henry made his * and mr madison answered it the journal of the philadelphia convention had not been published that body had sat with closed doors and among its * had been the following we can understand by reference to these * how mr madison should have felt * from making * to anything that had occurred during the * of the convention but the * then * those * has long since been removed the * journal which was * to the keeping of general washington president of the convention was * by him nine years afterward among the * of the state department it has since been published and we can * for ourselves the * and * the * * of that expression we the people on which * henry thought the fate of america might * and which has been so * * in later years from its true * the original language of the * reported to the convention by a committee of five appointed to prepare the constitution as we find it in the * of august # # was as follows there can be no question here what was meant it was the people of the states * by name that were to * * and * the compact of union for themselves and their * there is no * nor * in the language nor was there any difference in the convention as to the use of it the * as * was submitted to vote on the next day and as the journal * us it passed * in the * there was no subsequent change of opinion on the subject the reason for the * afterward made in the language is * it was found that * ratification of all the states could not be expected and it was determined as we have already seen that the consent of nine states should * for the * of the new compact between the states so * the same any nine would be sufficient to put the proposed government in * as to them thus leaving the remainder of the thirteen to * such course as might be to each * when this conclusion was reached it became * * to * * the * states by name * in the final * the * * of the thirteen states was * and the * * people of the united states * in its * meaning the people of such states as should * to unite on the terms proposed the * * of political * which has been * on the * of this simple * * before the light of * record could the * of the constitution have * the * to be made of their * meaning it might have been prevented by an easy * as we the people of the states * united or something to the same effect the word people in # as in # was as it is a * * employed * either as a * in such * as this people a free people etc or in a * sense as applied to the citizens or * of one state or country or a number of states or * when the convention of the * of virginia in # * their * to the congress that was to meet in philadelphia to obtain a * of those * without which the people of america can neither be safe free nor happy it was certainly not intended to * the idea that the people of the american * or even of the british colonies in america * one political community nor did * * have any such meaning when he said in his celebrated speech in * in # the people of the colonies are * of * we need go no further than to the familiar language of king * * of the bible for * * of this * use of the term both in its * and * * for example king * * at the * of the temple here we have both the singular and * * of the same * people * and all the people of the * two * * in the people of the earth the word people is used * as it is in the expression the people of the united states in the * to the constitution and has exactly the same force and effect if in the latter case it * that the people of massachusetts and those of virginia were mere * parts of one political community it must in the former * a like * among the * the * the * * and * and all other people of the earth except the * * of * of the same sort might be * if it were necessary in the declaration of independence we find * * * of the * of the singular form for both singular and * * people a free people in the former and the good people of these colonies in the latter judge story in the * of his * in behalf of a theory of * * upon this last expression the conclusion that the assertion of independence was the act of the whole people of the united colonies as a * * or * the fact that in the very same sentence the colonies * themselves free and independent * a free and independent * the words independent states three times if however the declaration of independence * one whole people of the colonies then that * section of it formerly known as the * of maryland was in a state of * or * against the others as well as against great * from # to # during which period maryland refused to * or be bound by the articles of confederation which according to this theory was * upon her as a majority of the whole people had adopted it a * north carolina and * island were in a state of * in # while they declined to * and recognize the constitution adopted by the other eleven * of this united people yet no * of any such * any claim of authority over them by the * any assertion of the * of the * to be found in any of the records of that period it might have been * to * so much time and attention in * the * of the * from a theory so false but for the fact that it has been * enough to secure the countenance of men of such * as * story and * and that it has been made the * to * a bloody war against that principle of state sovereignty and independence which was regarded by the fathers of the union as the * of the * and the * of the hope for its * in the * * of the government of the united states in power * * and consideration abroad men have been led to * the place of the government above that of the states which * it those who would understand the true principles of the constitution can not afford to lose sight of the * * of idea * * in the term united states wherever it is used in that * no such * as the united states is ever mentioned * we read that no title of * shall be granted by the united states and no person holding any office of * or trust under them shall without the consent of congress accept etc the president shall not receive within that period any other * from the united states or any of them the laws of the united states and * made or which shall be made under their authority etc * against the united states shall * only in * war against them or in * to their enemies the federal character of the union is expressed by this very * which * the * * of its members not as * parts of one great * but as * * of an association so clear was this to * that it needed only to be pointed out to * their * we have seen how * was the answer of mr madison to the * raised by * henry mr * * of pennsylvania one of the * political * of his * in * a similar * said if the federal convention had meant to * the idea of * is of several and separate * * in a * would have said we the people of america for union * * the idea of * states which complete * * more than forty years afterward when the * * to the power * and influence of the * government had grown to such extent as to begin to * from view the purposes for which it was * those very * which in the beginning had been answered abandoned and thrown aside were brought to light again and presented to the country as * of the true meaning of the constitution mr * one of the first to * some of those early * so long ago * as to be almost forgotten and to * into them such renewed * as his commanding genius could * in the course of his * * in the senate with mr hayne in # said judge story about the same time began to advance the same theory but more * and with less * of statement it was not until thirty years after that it * its full * in the * of * rather than * two such may * as * mr * * in his address delivered on the #* of july 1861 and already referred to says of the constitution that * does not * to be a compact but a constitution of government it appears in its first sentence not to have been entered into by the states but to have been * and established by the people of the united states for themselves and their * the states are not named in it nearly all the * powers of sovereignty are * granted to the general government and * * to the states mr * afterward * the assertion that the states are not named in it but a yet more extraordinary statement of the one people theory is found in a letter addressed to the london times in the same year 1861 on the causes of the civil war by mr john * * afterward minister to the court of st james in this letter mr * says of the constitution of the united states it would be very hard to * a more * amount of * and reckless * in the same space in all mr * * of bold * there is not one single * it be perhaps that the constitution was not drawn up by the states yet it was drawn up by their * and it is of such material as this * from * whose reputation gives a * of * to their * that history is * and * one of the most * perhaps the least * these * is that which is also twice repeated by mr * the name of no state is mentioned in the whole * or as he * it the states are not named in it very little careful examination would have * to find in the second section of the very first article of the constitution the names of every one of the thirteen then * states distinctly mentioned with the number of representatives to which each would be * in case of * to the constitution until a * of their * could be taken the mention there made of the states by name is of no special * it has no bearing upon any question of principle and the * of it is a * * * of the * of those from whom it * and the low estimate put on the intelligence of those addressed it * however to show how much * is to be given to their authority as * and * the reason why the names of the * states were not mentioned has already been given it was simply because it was not known which states would * but as * mention of the several states each state any state particular states and the like the constitution is full of it i am informed by one who has taken the * to examine carefully that * with reference to this very point * including any mention of the united states or of foreign states and * also the * constitution in its original * makes mention of the states as states no less than * times and of these * times only three times in the way of * of the exercise of a power in fact it is full of * leave out all mention of the * make no mere * point or * but mean the states in their separate several * * what would remain would be of less account than the play of the prince of * with the part of * * but leaving out of consideration for the moment all * questions the * and * point of * now is by what authority the constitution was * and established mr * says it was done by the people of the united states in the * mr * * * the same thing and mr * taking a step further says that it was * and established by a power superior to the * the people of the whole land in their * capacity the * of this * * * the existence of an * * power of a whole people or people of the whole land * through the * of the philadelphia convention to * its * upon the states they forget in the first place that this convention was composed of * not of any one people but of * states and in the second place that their action had no force or * * the words of mr madison that it was of no more consequence than the paper on which it was * * and * by a sufficient number of states the meaning of the * we the people of the united states do * and * this constitution is * fixed and * by the final article the ratification of the * of nine states shall be sufficient for the * of this constitution between the states so * the same if it was already established what need was there of further * it was not * or established at all until * by the * number of states the * in the * of course had reference to that expected ratification without which the * would have been as * as the body of the * the assertion that it was not * by the states is so plainly and * contrary to * * * with the language of the constitution * it is hard to imagine what was intended by it unless it was to take advantage of the * * of the subject among the readers of an english journal to * upon them a * * it was state ratification * ratification of the people of each state * of all other * gave force * and * to the constitution judge story * to the fact that the * assembled in the several states * where else they could have * * question on our theory but the idea he evidently intended to * was that the * of the people by states was a mere matter of * necessity or * * just as the people of a state vote by * the people of a county by * * or * and the people of a city by * it is hardly necessary to say that in all organized republican * * * when we speak of the will of the people of a community we mean the will of a majority which when * expressed is * on any * of the same community if then we can * and admit for a moment the possibility that when the constitution was under consideration the people of the united states were * one * * * * are clearly * in the first place each * division of this great community would have been * to vote according to its * * and in the second the expressed will of the * majority would have been * upon the whole a * of the first proposition would be a * of common justice and equal rights a * of the second would be to destroy all government and * mere * now neither of these principles was * or proposed or even * in the case of the action of the people of the united states if they were one political community upon the proposed constitution on the contrary * thousand people in the state of * had * the same * * its ratification as seven hundred thousand and more in virginia or four hundred thousand in pennsylvania would not this have been an * * and * no * have been uttered against * these had been * parts of one community of people again while the will of the * majority within any state was * on the * * in the same no majority or * of states or people had any control whatever upon the people of another state the constitution was established not over the states as asserted by * but between the states and only between the states so * the same little * island with her * thousand * was not a mere * part of the people of the whole land during the period for which she held * but was as free independent and * as any other sovereign power notwithstanding the majority of more than three * of the whole people on the other side of the question before the ratification of the * there was some excuse for an * * or * of the terms * madison thus answered in advance the * made on the ground of this * and * its * he wrote it is a * task to have to * the * both of fact and of principle which have occupied so much attention but it is rendered necessary by the extent to which they have been * upon the * of the public through reckless assertion and * and * * but the convention as we have seen said no such thing no such community as the people of the united states in the * is known to it or ever * on it it was * established and * by the people of the several states and no * or * of a later * can change or * this fixed fact as it stands revealed in the light of * records i have * spoken of the federal constitution as a compact and of the parties to it as sovereign states these terms should not and in earlier times would not have required explanation or * but they have been called in question by the modern school of * these gentlemen admit that the government under the articles of confederation was a compact mr * in his * to mr hayne on the #* of january # said again in his discussion with mr * three years afterward he * * the same * of the constitution he says does it call itself a compact certainly not it * the word compact but once and that when it * that the states shall enter into no compact does it call itself a * a confederacy a * * between the states certainly not there is not a * of such language in all its pages the * who wrote under his picture the * this is a horse made * provision against any such * as that preferred by mr * and his * that the constitution is not a compact because it is not so * in the * as well as i can * there is no passage in the * or the * in which either of those great works calls itself or is called by its author an * * yet this would scarcely be accepted as evidence that they are not * * in an examination of mr * * i do not find that he * them to be either a speech or an * yet their claim to both these * will hardly be * the * * on the constitution just * the * attempted to be drawn between the language proper to a confederation and that belonging to a constitution as * two different ideas will not bear the * of examination and application to the case of the united states it has been fully shown in previous * that the terms union federal union federal constitution constitution of the federal government and the like were * merely in * * speech but in public * and official * reference to the articles of confederation as freely as they have since been employed under the present constitution the former union * mr * * * nobody * compact between states yet it * calls itself a compact the word does not * in it even the one time that it * in the present constitution although the * states are in both * from * into any * confederation or * with one another or with any foreign power without the consent of congress and the * or * parties are * united states in the one just as in the other mr * is particularly unfortunate in his * upon what he terms the new * in which the constitution is * a compact and the states which * it are spoken of as having * to it in the same speech last * he says * and * in many * what is * the same idea and * the use of the terms which he * to an * purpose mr * says in these and similar * mr * * * that if the constitution were a compact if the union were a confederacy if the states had as states * * to * which * he * the sovereignty of the states and their right to * from the union would be * now it * that these very * confederacy * and the * the terms in familiar use by the * of the constitution and their * with reference to that * and its ratification other * who have * the subject since the late war gave it an interest which it had never commanded before have collected such an * of evidence in this behalf that it is necessary only to * a few * the following language of mr * of massachusetts in the convention of # has already been referred to if nine out of thirteen states can * the compact six out of nine will be just as able to * the new one * mr * * one of the most pronounced * of a strong * government in the convention said he came here to form a compact for the good of * he was ready to do so with all the states he hoped and believed they all would enter into such a compact if they would not he would be ready to join with any states that would but as the compact was to be * it is in vain for the eastern states to * on what the southern states will never * to mr madison while * to a strong government said in the case of a union of people under one constitution the nature of the * has always been understood etc mr * in the * * * of the new government as a confederate * and a confederacy and calls the constitution a compact see especially * * and * general * was not only the first president under the new constitution but who had * over the convention that drew it * letters written soon after the * of that body to friends in various states referred to the constitution as a compact or * and * * the terms * and * and once the term secession he * what the * of the constitution in virginia would do if nine other states should * to the constitution * * of maryland * us that in a committee of the general convention of # * against the proposed * of the principles of the * union already formed under the articles of confederation he made use of such language as this it is * to * the * that * in the * of the fathers to show that mr * new * was the very language they * used let two more * * from authority higher than that of any individual * or writer however * authority second only if at all * to that of the * of the constitution * is from the acts or * of ratification by the states they certainly ought to have been * and should not have been unknown to mr * for they are the language of massachusetts the state which he represented in the senate and of new * the state of his * the ratification of massachusetts is expressed in the following terms the ratification of new * is expressed in * the same words save only the difference of date of the resolution of the legislature or general court referred to and also the use of the word state instead of * both distinctly accept it as a compact of the states with each * mr * a son of new * and a senator from massachusetts declared it was not and not only so but he * the very * from which the words * the * were taken it would not need however this * wealth of * * does not require the * of any particular words in the * prove that it was drawn up as a compact between sovereign states * into a confederacy with each other and that they * and * to it * * and * the very * of the whole * and the facts * its preparation and ratification would * the language of the final article would have been quite enough the ratification of the * of nine states shall be sufficient for the * of this constitution between the states so * the same this is not the language of a superior * a * upon * the consent of the *

story is used in different * which often * to a confusion of ideas and sometimes to very * and * * without any * for judge story or any * of his great * and ability it may safely be added that he and his * have * not a little to the * of this confusion of ideas and the spread of these * and * * there is no good reason whatever why it should be used in different * or why there should be any confusion of ideas as to its meaning of all the terms employed in political * it is one of the most * and * the * of it given by that * and * * * is simple and * sovereignty is a right of commanding

* the exercise of such of its * as may be necessary subject always to their own control and to * whenever such government * to * the purposes for which it was * i think it has already been * that in

evidence that there was not such a political community as the people of the united states in the * that the states were * sovereign and independent when they were united under the articles of

those * and * * of which judge story * * the sovereign authority of the people with the delegated powers * by them upon their * we hear of a government of the united states sovereign within its * and of state * sovereign in their * of the surrender by the states of part of their sovereignty to the united states and the like now if there be any one great principle * the federal constitution the state * the * of the fathers the whole american system as clearly as the * * the * system it is that no government is * all * * their powers from the people and exercise them in * to the will of the * a will expressed in any * * * manner but the will of the organized political community expressed through authorized and * * the * of the american * never * nor intended to * sovereignty upon either their state or federal * if then the people of the states in forming a federal union * to use * term * if they meant to surrender or * of their sovereignty to whom was the * made not to the people of the united states in the * for there was no such people in existence and they did not * or * such a people by * of themselves not to the federal government for they * as a * principle the sovereignty of any government there was no such surrender no such * in whole or in part expressed or * they * and intended to * their sovereignty in its * and * but indeed says mr * the words sovereign and sovereignty are * * to the american system in the declaration of independence the * * themselves free and independent states but the men of those days knew that the word sovereign was a term of * * when their connection with a * * * was * * the word sovereign had no meaning for us if this be true the men of those days had a very extraordinary way of * their * that the word had no meaning for us we have seen that in the very front of their articles of confederation they set forth the conspicuous declaration that each state * its sovereignty freedom and independence * state i believe of mr * * and * her original constitution drawn up by men of those days made this declaration new * in her constitution as * in # had * the same declaration except as * the name of the state and the word state instead of * mr madison one of the most distinguished of the men of that day and of the * of the constitution in a speech already once referred to in the virginia convention of # explained that we the people who were to * the constitution were the people of thirteen * in the * he * * the * for example when he says do they the * principles of the confederation require that in the * of the constitution the states should be regarded as * and independent * they are so regarded by the constitution proposed alexander * * authority no less * in the * in the same * he * these terms sovereign and sovereignty * with reference to the states * and * * franklin * * of * in the senate as a means of * the * of the individual states james * of pennsylvania said sovereignty is in the people before they make a constitution and remains in them and described the people as being thirteen independent * * * who was as well as * one of the * * in the convention of a strong * government spoke of the constitution as a compact and of the parties to it as each * sovereign power * sherman of * declared that the government was * by a number of sovereign states * * of the same state spoke of the states as sovereign bodies these were all * members of the convention which formed the constitution there was scarcely a * of that period who did not leave on record * of the same sort but why * * it is very evident that the men of those days entertained very different views of sovereignty from those set forth by the new * of our day far from * it a term of * * * * to the american system they seem to have regarded it as a very * principle in that system and of necessity belonging to the several * i do not find a single instance in which they applied it to any political organization except the states their ideas were in entire * with those of * who in his chapter of nations or sovereign states writes every nation that * itself under what form * without any * on foreign power is a sovereign state in another part of the same chapter he gives a * statement of the nature of a confederate * such as ours was * to be he says what this celebrated author means here by a person is explained by a subsequent passage the law of nations is the law of * states free and independent are moral persons if any * doubt could have existed as to the * of their entire sovereignty by the people of the * states when they organized the federal union it would have been removed by the adoption of the * * to the constitution which was not only one of the * proposed by various states when * that * but the particular one in which they * agreed and upon which they most * insisted indeed it is quite certain that the constitution would never have received the * and ratification of massachusetts new * new york north carolina and perhaps other states but for a * assurance that the * of this * would be adopted as soon as the * * could be * with that * is in these words the full meaning of this article may not be as clear to us as it was to the men of that period on account of the confusion of ideas by which the term * enough to * since been * and also the * * upon the use of the little * or which has been said to be the most * word in our language and for that reason has been * from * in the english * the true * and meaning of the provision however may be * from an examination and comparison of the terms in which it was expressed by the various states which proposed it and whose ideas it was intended to * massachusetts and new * in their * of ratification * the opinion that certain * and * in the said constitution would remove the * and quiet the * of many of the good people of this * state new * and more * guard against an * administration of the federal government each * several such * putting this at the head in the following form of course those * republican * meant the people of the * their * as something * from their people new york expressed herself as follows south carolina expressed the idea thus north carolina proposed it in these terms * island gave in her * * to the constitution in full confidence that certain proposed * would be adopted the first of which was expressed in these words this was in may # when nearly three years had been given to discussion and explanation of the new government by its * and others when it had been in * * for more than a year and when there was every advantage for a clear * of its nature and principles under such circumstances and in the full confidence that this language expressed its meaning and * the people of * island * their * to the confederate * of the states already united no * was made from any quarter to the principle asserted in these various * or to the * in which it was finally expressed although many thought it * as being merely * of what would have been sufficiently * without * the * of the government of the united states were * limited to the exercise of such powers as were * delegated and that the people of the several states * all others is it * with reason to suppose that people so * of the * of * powers or * could have meant to surrender or * the very * and * of all * * * this not by express grant but by * mr * following whether * or not in the line of mr * * * to the term compact takes * to the sovereignty of the states on the ground that the word sovereignty does not * in the constitution he * that the states were sovereign under the articles of confederation how could they * or be * of their sovereignty without even a mention of * the * * * us with the declaration that nothing was surrendered by * everything was reserved unless * delegated to the united states or * to the states here is an * which they certainly * nobody * or can deny that they did * of which mr * says no mention is made in the constitution in what * way then was it lost or * much has been said of the * of the exercise by the states of certain * of sovereignty such as making * * war * money etc this is only a part of the general compact by which the * parties * one with another to * from the separate exercise of certain powers which they * to * to the * and control of the union or general * of the parties * it is not a * * upon them from without or from above by any * or superior power but is * by their free consent the case is * * to that of * forming a * or * * who * * to * as * from * in other * or * from * their individual credit or from the exercise of any other right of a citizen which they may think proper to subject to the consent or * to the * of the firm the * * of the constitution referred to are not at all a * of the full sovereignty of the states but are merely an * among them to exercise certain powers of sovereignty in * and not * and apart there is one other provision of the constitution which is generally * by the friends of * as * to state sovereignty this is found in the second * of the sixth article as follows this * of a principle which even if it had not been * declared would have been a necessary * from the * of the constitution itself has been * and * into a meaning and purpose entirely foreign to that which plain * is sufficient to * mr * thus * on the subject the mistake which mr * other * of the same * is one which is disposed of by a very simple * the states which * and established the constitution accepted nothing besides what they themselves * they * no superior the * was both in degree and extent only that which was delegated by the states to their common agent there are some other * which may * to a * * of this * of the constitution and the laws made in * * # in the first place it must be remembered that when the federal constitution was formed each then existing state already had its own constitution and * of * laws it was no doubt * with reference to these that the provision was * and not in the * of future * or * it is in this light alone that mr madison * it in * and * it in the * # again it is to be observed that the * * to the general laws of the united states is * limited to those * in * with the constitution or to use the * language made in * * mr * in another chapter of the * calls particular attention to this saying and the * are all his own that the laws of the confederacy as to the * and * * of its * will become the supreme law of the land and that the state * will * in their * and * with the general government as far as its just and constitutional authority * # in the third place it is not the government of the united states that is declared to be supreme but the constitution and the laws and * made in * with it the proposition was made in the convention to * a government * of supreme * executive and * powers but it was not adopted its * * is much more * and * than if it had never been proposed * of so * an * as that of * the government with the constitution ought to be * but so * and * are the ideas which have been * on the subject that no * seems to be too * to be possible thus it has not been * of late years to hear even in the highest places the oath to support the constitution which is taken by both state and federal officers spoken of as an oath to support the * * never * upon any one in this country and which the men who made the constitution with their * * of the revolution the battles of which they had fought with * around their * would have been the last to * could any assertion be less * than that they proceeded to * another supreme government which it would be * to resist this confusion of ideas * the * of the whole subject of sovereignty mr * has said and very * so far as these united states are * the sovereignty of government is an idea belonging to the other side of the * no such thing is known in north america our * are all limited in europe sovereignty is of * * and * no more than the state of the sovereign it * his rights duties * * and powers but with us all power is with the people they alone are sovereign and they erect what * they please and * on them such powers as they please none of these * are sovereign in the * sense of the word all being * by written * but the same * which can so clearly * and so * * the general proposition seems to be covered by a cloud of thick darkness when it comes to * it to the particular case in issue thus a little afterward we have the following it is * that such * ideas should proceed from a * so * its author * into the very * which he had just before so distinctly pointed out in * the people of the states with their * in the * of his * to state sovereignty he * all of his * * even to * that it means the sovereignty not of state * but of people who make them with minds * by the * idea of one great people of a * nation these gentlemen are * to the plain and * truth that the only way in which the people * the constitution was as the people of states when mr * says that in the constitution it is the people who speak and not the states he says what is * the states are the people the people do not speak never have spoken and never can speak in their sovereign capacity without a * of our whole system otherwise than as the people of states there are but two * of * their sovereign will known to the people of this country one is by direct * * adopted by * island in # when she * the constitution the other is the * more generally pursued of acting by means of * of * * * as representatives of the sovereignty of the people now it is not a matter of opinion or theory or * but a plain * * fact that there never has been any act or expression of sovereignty in either of these * by that * community the people of the united states in the * * of power by the government of the united states there may have been and may be again but there has never been either a sovereign convention or a direct vote of the whole people of the united states to * its existence as a * * every exercise of sovereignty by any of the people of this country that has actually taken place has been by the people of states as states in the face of this fact is it not the * * to admit the sovereignty of the people and deny it to the states in which alone they have community existence this subject is one of such * importance to a right * of the events which this work is * to record and explain that it can not be * without an effort in the way of * and conclusion to make it clear beyond the possibility of * according to the american theory every individual is * with certain * rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he is * to all the freedom in these and in other * that is * with the safety and the rights of others and the * of the community but political sovereignty which is the * and * of all the powers of * executive and * to and * in the people of an organized political community it is an * of the whole people of such a community it * the power and * the duty of * the rights and * the * of * of * * * * * * for the * of property and the * of * making * with foreign powers * * etc the * of * might be extended but these will * as * these powers are of course * through the * of * but the * are only * of the * to it and subject to its control this * people in the * of each political * to the government the exercise of such powers or * as it thinks proper but in an american * never * or * sovereignty that remains * and * it is by * of this sovereignty alone that the government its authorized agent commands the * of the individual citizen to the extent of its * * and delegated authority the allegiance of the citizen is due to the sovereign alone thus far i think all will * no american * or * would venture to * it notwithstanding the * or * * thrown out by some persons about the * of the american people from the beginning no * authority has ever had the * to deny that before the adoption of the federal constitution the only sovereign political community was the people of the * people of each state the ordinary exercise of what are generally * the powers of sovereignty was by and through their * * and when they formed a confederation a portion of those powers was * to the general government or * under the confederation the congress of the united states represented the * power of the states but the people of each state alone possessed sovereignty and consequently were * to the allegiance of the citizen when the articles of confederation were * when the new constitution was * in their place and the general government * its * was changed additional powers were * upon it and thereby * from the powers * * by the state * but the seat of * * of all those delegated and * * not * there was a new government or an * * is entirely * in which of these * we consider * no new people was * or * the people in whom alone sovereignty * remained just as they had been before the only change was in the form * and relations of their * * no doubt the * people of the * they had been so disposed might have * themselves into one great * state * their * * merely as matters of * but such a * must have been distinctly and * stated not left to * or * men do not * even an estate without * and express terms and * but in this case not only was there no express * * * the * sovereignty but it was * provided that nothing should be understood as even * everything was reserved unless granted in express terms the * * of the * of a new people * with the whole or a great part of the sovereignty which had previously belonged to the people of each state has not a * to * it in the constitution but is built up entirely upon the * * of a single expression in the * in * that there is any such * * as the people of the united states in the * of course i am not to be understood as * that there is such a political organization as the united states or that there * with large and * powers a government of the united states but it is claimed that the union as its name * is * of states as a british author * to the old * system has expressed the same idea the states are the * the united states the * which results from them the government of the united states * its existence from the same * and * its * by the will of the same sovereignty that * and * authority upon the state * the people of each state are in either case the * the only difference is that in the * of the state * each sovereign * alone in that of the federal government they * in * with the others neither the whole nor any part of their sovereignty has been surrendered to either government to whom in fine could the states have surrendered their sovereignty not to the mass of the people * the territory possessed by all the states for there was no such community in existence and they took no measures for the organization of such a community if they had intended to do so the very style united states would have been a * * nor would * have been * as * war against them could it have been * to the government of the union clearly not in * with the ideas and principles of those who made the declaration of independence adopted the articles of confederation and established the constitution of the united states for in each and all of these the * is the * and * sovereignty of the people to have * sovereignty from the people to a government would have been to have fought the battles of the revolution in * for the freedom and independence of the states but for a mere change of * such a thought or purpose could not have been in the heads or hearts of those who * the union and could have found * only when the * * of patriotism and * had swept away the * which they * who sought by the compact of union to secure and * the * then possessed the men who had won at great cost the independence of their * states were deeply impressed with the value of union but they could never have * like the base * to * away the * * of state sovereignty for any possible * looking back for a moment at the ground over which we have gone i think it may be * asserted that the following * have been clearly and fully established # that the states of which the american union was formed from the moment when they * from their * or * condition became * sovereign free and independent * one state or nation # that the union formed under the articles of confederation was a compact between the states in which these * of sovereignty freedom and independence were * asserted and * # that in forming the more perfect union of the constitution afterward adopted the same * powers formed an * compact without any surrender of these * of sovereignty freedom and independence either expressed or * on the contrary that by the * * to the constitution * the power of the government to its express grants they distinctly guarded against the * of a surrender of anything by * # that political sovereignty * neither in individual citizens nor in * * nor in * * of a community but in the people of an organized political body # that no republican form of government in the sense in which that expression is used in the constitution and was generally understood by the * of the * it be the government of a state or of a confederation of * possessed of any sovereignty whatever but merely * certain powers delegated by the sovereign authority of the people and subject to recall and * by the same authority that * them # that the people who organized the first confederation the people who * it the people who * and established the constitution which succeeded it the only people in fine known or referred to in the * of that * the term was used * or * the people of the * states each acting * and with * independence of the others # that in forming and * the constitution the states or the people of the * which when used with reference to acts performed in a sovereign capacity are * * to each * a new government but no new people and that consequently no new sovereignty was * sovereignty in an american * can belong only to a people never to a * that the federal government is * to exercise only the powers delegated to it by the people of the * states # that the term people in the * to the constitution and in the * * is used * that the only people of the united states known to the constitution are the people of each state in the union that no such political community or * * as one people of the united states then existed has ever been organized or yet * and that no political action by the people of the united states in the * has ever taken place or ever can take place under the constitution the * idea of one people of the united states * in the last * has been so impressed upon the popular mind by false * by * and * * and by the * spectacle of a great government with its army and navy its * and * its * of * and the splendid * which it * to political ambition that the * away of these * and * of the original * which they have * and hidden from view have no doubt been * * and even * to some of my readers the * * which makes the * * is even employed as an * to prove its * the * of the powers delegated to the agent * to * the * of the sovereign power of the * by whom they are * as by the * eye the * * and conspicuous * of the * are mistaken for * of * the * or * use of the term union and its * * to * the confusion so much the more need for * upon the * * which have been * by these * * the reader really * of * truth is therefore again * against * two ideas so * * as that of government which is * * and * with that of the people as an organized political community which is sovereign without any other than * * and such as proceed from the general principles of the personal rights of man it has been said in a * chapter that the * of the constitution could scarcely have anticipated the idea of such a community as the people of the united states in one mass perhaps this expression needs some little * for there is rarely a * however * that is * original a careful examination of the records of the convention of # * one or perhaps two * of such a * by the same * the result in each case is * * the original proposition made concerning the office of president of the united states * his election by the congress or as it was * by the * the national legislature on the #* of july this proposition being under consideration mr * * moved that the words national legislature be * out and citizens of the united states * the proposition was supported by mr james * of these gentlemen being * from pennsylvania and both among the most earnest * of * in the convention now it is not at all certain that mr * had in view an election by the citizens of the united states in the * * as one people the language of his proposition is entirely * with the idea of as election by the citizens of each state * * and * though it is * and may admit of the other * but this is * the proposition was submitted to a vote and received the * of only one * of which mr * and mr * were both representatives nine states * against it six days afterward july #* in a discussion of the proposed ratification of the constitution by * of the people of each state mr * * we learn from mr * that the reference of the plan * of the proposed constitution be made to one general convention chosen and authorized by the people to consider * and * the same here the issue seems to have been more distinctly made between the two ideas of people of the states and one people in the * the fate of the latter is * * in the two words not * mr * was a man of distinguished ability great personal influence and * patriotism but out of all that * as it did such admitted friends of * as * king * randolph * and * was not one to * him in the proposition to * into the constitution that theory which now * the theory on which was * the late bloody war which was called a war for the union it failed for want of a second and does not even appear in the official journal of the convention the very fact that such a suggestion was made would be unknown to us but for the record kept by mr madison the * which have been given in * of special * of the subject from the * and * of the * of the constitution and other * of that period afford * proof of their entire and almost * * with the principles which have been established on the authority of the constitution itself the acts of ratification by the several states and other * of the highest authority and * i am well aware that * * may be found in the reports of * on the general and state * and other public bodies * the existence of individual opinions * * with these principles that * and * ideas were sometimes expressed with regard to sovereignty the relations between * and people and * subjects and that while the plan of the constitution was under discussion and before it was * reduced to its present * there were earnest * in the convention of a more * system with a stronger * government but these * of individual opinion only prove the existence of a small * of * from the principles generally entertained and which finally * in the * of the constitution none of these ever * such * of * as are * in this * no * of that day would have * to risk his reputation by * an * to support the constitution as an * to * to the federal * * which would have * the * away of any plan of union * it by a * of popular * from every quarter of the country none of them suggested such an idea as that of the * of the people of the states into one * * it was suggested by mr * * in the proposition above referred to in which he stood alone among the * of twelve sovereign states assembled in convention as to the features of * or * which they did * all the ability of this little * of really * men failed to secure the * of any one of them into the constitution or to obtain their * by any of the * states on the contrary the very men who had been the leading * of such * on * to secure their adoption * accepted the result and became the * and most * * of the principles which had * thus mr * who had * the plan of a president and senate both * to hold office for life or during good * with a * power in congress on the action of the state * became through the * in * with his * mr madison and mr * the most distinguished * and * of the constitution as then proposed and afterward * with all its federal and * features in the ninth number of that remarkable * of political * he * * and * to the then proposed constitution * description of a confederate * a term which he * * * in the * number of the same * * to * expressed by some that a state might be brought before the federal * to answer as * in * * against her he * the idea in these plain and * terms the * are my own this * is very * clearly showing that mr * assumed as * * in the first place that the state was the sovereign * that this sovereignty could not be * unless by express surrender * that no such surrender had been made and * that the idea of * * to a state even to * the * of a duty would be * to * war against a * was altogether forced and * in a subsequent number mr * * to the * that the constitution * no bill or declaration of rights * that it was entirely * because in * the * is of course the people * of the several states who were the only people known to the constitution or to the * surrendered nothing of their * sovereignty but * it * he says here in * the people surrender nothing and as they * everything they have no need of particular * and again i go further and * that * of rights in the sense and to the extent they are * for are not only * in the proposed constitution but would be absolutely dangerous they would * various * to powers not granted and on this very account would afford a * * to claim more than were granted for why * that things shall not be done which there is no power to do could language be more clear or more complete in * of the principles laid down in this work mr * * in effect that the grants to the federal government in the constitution are not * but * of power by the people of the states that sovereignty remains * where it was before and that the * of power were * limited to those * * this merely * the * * afterward adopted finally in the * article of the * he * * * to the same principles in the remark that every constitution for the united states must * * of a great * of * in which thirteen independent states are to be * in their interests or opinions of interest * the necessity of * and * all the * which are to * the whole in such a manner as to * all the parties to the compact there is no * here or * else of the existence of any such idea as that of the * people of one great * state it is an * * of the same truth soon afterward asserted by madison in the virginia * the people who * and established the constitution were not the people as * one great body but the people as * thirteen * mr madison in the philadelphia convention had at first held views of the sort of government which it was * to * similar to those of mr * though more * in extent he too however cordially * to the * in them made by his * and was no less * and * in * and * the constitution as finally adopted his * of its * principles is so fully shown in the * which have already been given from his * to the * and * in the virginia convention that it would be * to make any additional * from them the evidence of * and * of the most * of the * of the constitution and the two * * * of its * the most valuable that could be offered for its * that of all the other * of the period only * to * the same * the * washington

between the states which formed the union was in the nature of a * between * without * of time and the recognized law of such * is thus stated by an * * of massachusetts in a work intended for popular use we have seen that a number of sovereign free and independent states during the war of the revolution entered into a * with one another which was not only * in * but * declared to be a * union yet when that union failed to accomplish the purposes for which it was formed the parties withdrew * and * one after another without any question made of their right to do so and formed a new association one of the declared * of this new * was to form a more perfect union this certainly did not mean more perfect in respect of * for the former union had been declared * and * * of no addition it did not mean that it was to be more * for the * of the states in * the former compact of union had expressed themselves in terms that could scarcely be made more * they then said the * of a more perfect union was accomplished by the organization of a government more complete in its various * * executive and * and by the * to this government of certain additional powers or * which had previously been * by the * of the * * in * the means of * directly upon * for the * of its * delegated authority there was no * nor * of the * principle of a compact between * which applied to the one case as fully as to

would still remain * and * to the * from which they were * of the sovereign people of each state it was an * union not a * it is a remarkable fact that the very powers of the federal government and * to the states which are most * upon by the * of * as * with state sovereignty were in force under the old confederation when the sovereignty of the states was * recognized the general government had then as now the * right and power of * on peace and war making * and * * an army and navy * letters of * and * * * * and * the * * nearly all the * * powers of sovereignty * by the federal government under the existing constitution except the * of * and of * and * its * directly instead of through the * of the state authorities the exercise of these * powers was * to the states under the old

* to show that the great principles of the constitution are * the same as those of the articles of confederation he says the truth is he * that the great principles of the constitution proposed by the

the * powers delegated to the federal government showing that the spirit of the original instructions to the convention had been followed in * the federal constitution and * it * to the * of government and the * of the union the present union * its very existence to the * by separate secession of its members of the former union which as we have thus seen as to its * principles rested upon * the same * the right to withdraw from the association results in either case from the same * which i think have been established on an * * of history reason law and * it is not * that this right should be * to for * cause or as the writer already * on the law of * says * and * to the other * without responsibility of the * party for any * thus done no association can be * without a * of the * of * questions concerning common property and * * sometimes of a * and * sort if a wrong be * in such case it is a matter for determination by the means usually employed among independent and

no great principle in the affairs either of * or of nations that is not * to such difficulties in its * application but we are told there is no mention made of secession in the constitution mr * says the states are not named in it the word sovereignty does not * in it the right of secession is as much * in it as the * of the * we have seen how very * is the assertion that the states are not named

thing to * into the constitution any express provision for the secession of the states and * of the union its * * desired and hoped that it would be * against the proposition for power to * a state the * was that it would be a means not of * but of * the union it was not for them to make arrangements for its * * which there was no occasion to provide for in advance sufficient for their day was the evil * it is not usual either in * between men or in * between * to make provision for a * of the * or a * of the * unless there be some special reason for a * of time indeed in * the usual * * a declaration of their * but in either case the power of the * parties or of any of them to * the compact on terms not * to the rights of the other parties is not the less clearly understood it was not necessary in the constitution to * the right of secession because it was an * of sovereignty and the states had reserved all which they had not delegated the right of the people of the several states to * the powers delegated by them to the common * was not left without * and * assertion even at a period when it had never been denied the ratification of the constitution by virginia has already

who has carefully considered the evidence already brought to bear on the subject can need further * to * his mind of that political * the people of the united states from whom the powers of the federal government were * could have been no other than the people who * and * the constitution and this it has been shown beyond the power of * was done by the people of each state * and * no other people were known to the * of the * above * mr madison was a leading member of the virginia convention which made that declaration as well as of the general convention that drew up the constitution we have seen what his idea of the people of the united states * the people as * one great body but the people as * thirteen * mr lee of * * * in the same convention * mr * * to the expression we the people said it the constitution is now submitted to the people of virginia if we do not * it it will be always * and * as to us suppose it was found proper for our adoption and becoming the government of the people of virginia by what style should it be done ought we not to make use of the name of the people no other style would be proper it would certainly be * after all that has been presented * to add any further evidence of the meaning that was attached to these * by their * the people of the united states were in their minds the people of virginia the people of massachusetts and the people of every other state that should * to unite they could have meant only that the people of their * states who had delegated certain powers to the federal government in * the constitution and * to the union reserved to themselves the right in event of the failure of their purposes to * or * those powers by * from the same union finally the * of the * attempted to be put upon these * will be evident from a very brief * if the assertion of the right of * of their powers was meant for the protection of the whole * people in * people in the * a * * whom or what was it to protect them by whom were the powers granted to be * to the * or * of the whole people by themselves or by some of the states all of whom according to this * had been * into one as no danger could have been * from either of

* to * to their grave and solemn * a meaning so * and * to those who * that the grants of the constitution are fatal to the * of sovereignty by the states the constitution * a * answer in the * which was * with the adoption of the * and which * that all powers not delegated to the government of the union were reserved to the states or to the people as sovereignty was not delegated by the states it was * reserved it would be * to answer * against * powers of the states none are claimed by * because all not delegated by the states remained with them and it was only in an * of * that they expressed the right to * such parts of their * power as was delegated for the purposes * as there be those who see danger to the * of the union in the possession of such power by the states and * that our fathers did not intend to * the states together by a compact no better than a * of * it may be well to examine their position from what have * to the union * have they sprang from too great * on the exercise of the granted powers or from the * by the general government of power claimed by * the whole record of our union * from the latter only was this * to * caused by the * of * authority in the general government or by the assertion of the right of a state to * the powers it had delegated * and * it can not be assigned to the latter let it be supposed that the whole people had recognized the right of a state of the union * and * to * the powers which * and * she had delegated to the federal government would not this have been * to * the general government from * its * to the * and * of such state to deny that effect would be to suppose that a * majority would be willing to drive a state from the union would the * of the right of a state to * the grants it had made have led to the exercise of that right for light and * causes surely the evidence furnished by the nations both ancient and modern * the * in the language of the declaration of independence all experience * shown that * are more disposed to suffer while * are * than to right themselves by * the * to which they are accustomed would not real * be rendered more * by the consciousness of power to remove them and

states were as little disposed to surrender the sovereignty of the states as they were anxious to * a general government with * powers to * the * of the confederation the union they formed was not to

well settled principle of public law for every wrong there must be a * which in this case must be the application of force to the state * to withdraw from the union early in the * of the convention which formed the constitution it was proposed to * upon congress the power to call forth the force of the union against any member of the union * to * its duty under the articles * when this proposition came to be considered mr madison observed that a union of the states containing such an * seemed to provide for its own destruction the use of force against a state would look more like a declaration of war than an * of * and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a * of all previous * by which it might be bound he hoped that such a system would be * as might render this * * and moved that the * be * this motion was adopted * * and the proposition was never again * again on a subsequent occasion speaking of an appeal to force mr madison said was such a * * was it * any government for the united states formed on the supposed * of * force against the * * of the states would prove as * and * as the government of congress every proposition looking in any way to the same or a similar object was promptly * by the convention george * of virginia said of such a proposition will not the citizens of the * state assist one another until they rise as one man and shake off the union altogether * * in the * convention of * said this constitution does not attempt to * sovereign bodies states in their political capacity no * is * to such bodies but that of an armed force if we should attempt to * the laws of the union by sending an armed force against a * state it would * the good and bad the innocent and * in the same * mr * in the convention of new york said to * the states is one of the * * that was ever * what picture does this idea present to our view a * state at war with a * state congress marching the troops of one state into the bosom of another here is a nation at war with itself can any * man be well disposed toward a government which makes war and * the only means of * * government that can * only by the sword but can we believe that one state will ever suffer itself to be used as an * of * the thing is a * is impossible * our * has seen that in the * of the principles and feelings which * the hearts of all * in that day this thing like many others then regarded as impossible dreams has been only too * and that states have permitted themselves to be used as * not merely for the * but for the destruction of the freedom and independence of their sister states * randolph governor of virginia although the * of the original proposition to * the * of the forces of the union against a * member which had been so * defeated in the federal convention afterward in the virginia convention made an * * against the idea of the * of force against a state what * of military * said he could the general government * for the * of * to

enemies set the father against the son and make the brother * the brother is this the happy * that is to preserve liberty will it not destroy it if an army be once introduced to force us if once marched into virginia figure to * what the dreadful consequence will be the most * civil war must * we have seen already how * the idea of even * * was * by * * and others the suggestion of military * was * treated as in the above * with still more * no principle was more fully and firmly settled on the highest authority than that under our system there could be no * of a state mr * in his * speech of february # # * throughout against the sovereignty of the states and in the course of his * sadly * the ideas of the federal constitution and the federal government as he * the sovereign people of the states with the state * says the states can not * to * * and * it is not a matter resting in state * or state pleasure no member of a state legislature can refuse to proceed at the proper time to * * to congress or to provide for the choice of * of president and * any more than the members can refuse when the appointed day * to meet the members of the other house to count the * for those officers and * who are chosen this was before the * in # of an * commission to relieve congress of its constitutional duty to count the vote mr * on the contrary fresh from the work of forming the constitution and familiar with its principles and purposes said it is certainly true that the state * by * the appointment of * may destroy the national government it is * to * the particular question on which these two great authorities are thus directly at issue i do not * that the state * of their own will have a right to * the * of any federal duty * upon them by the constitution but there is a power beyond and above that of either the federal or state * power of the people of the state who * and established the constitution as far as it * to themselves * as i think has been * the right to * the grants of power * made when they * it necessary for their safety or * to do so at the * of this power it certainly * not only the right but the duty of their state legislature to * from any action * * to the union or * from which the sovereign has withdrawn it would be only * to a * of * to * further from the * of the constitution in support of the principle * in that * that the people who * is to say of course the people of the several * * their grants it will require but few words to * of some * * that have been made to the application of this * in a special case it is sometimes said that whatever weight may * to principles * on the sovereignty and independence of the original thirteen states they can not * to the states of more * * now a majority of the members of the * these are but the * or * of the union and must of course be * and * this * would scarcely * to any * mind though it may possess a certain degree of * * for the * it is enough to answer that the entire * of the states in every particular is a * condition of their union every new member that has been admitted into the * of states came in as is * declared in the acts for their * on a * of perfect * in every respect with the original members this * is as complete as the * before the laws of the son with the father immediately on the * by the former of his * majority without regard to the * condition of * and * the relations of the original states to one another and to the union can not be * by any subsequent * of new members as the constitution * those relations * and * the * * which is * to all the boston * to congress referred to in a * chapter as prepared by a committee with mr * at its head says that the new states are * considered as admitted into the union upon the same * as the original states and as * in respect to the union the same rights of sovereignty freedom and independence as the other states but with regard to states formed of territory * by * from france * and mexico it is claimed that as they were bought by the united states they belong to the same and have no right to withdraw at will from an association the property which had been * by the other parties happy would it have been if the equal rights of the people of all the states to the * of territory * by the common * could have been recognized at the proper time there would then have been no secession and no war as for the * claim of * of states on account of the money spent for the land which they * can understand the ground of a claim to some interest in the soil so long as it * to be public property but have yet to learn in what way the united states ever became * of the * or of their political rights any question in regard to property has always been admitted to be matter for fair and * * in case of the * of a state the * by which the louisiana territory was * to the united states * provided that the * * should be admitted as soon as possible according to the principles of the federal constitution to the * of all the rights * and * of citizens of the united states in all other * of territory the same * is either expressed or * indeed the * of the right would be * with the character of american political * another * made to the right of secession is * upon * * and * ideas with regard to allegiance it * various * and is therefore somewhat difficult to meet but as most frequently presented may be stated thus that the citizen * a double allegiance or a divided * to his state * to the united states that it is not possible for either of these powers to * him from the allegiance due to the other that the state can no more * him from his * to the union than the united states can * him from his duties to his state this is the most * way in which the * is put the extreme * go further and claim that allegiance to the union or as they generally express it to the * thereby the federal * * and the * to the state only * indeed it * at all this latter view if the more * is at least the more * of the two for it does not * the difficulty of a divided allegiance nor the * position in which the other places the citizen in case of a conflict between his state and the other members of the union of being * a rebel against the general government or a * to the state of which he is a citizen as to true allegiance in the light of the principles which have been established there can be no doubt with regard to it the * * allegiance of the citizen is due to the sovereign only that sovereign under our system is the * people of the state to which he * people who * the state government which he * and which * him in the * of his personal * people who alone as far as he is * * and established the federal constitution and federal * people who have reserved to themselves sovereignty which * the power to * all * * by them the * to support the state or federal constitution and the * due to either state or federal government are alike * from and * on the allegiance due to this sovereign if the sovereign * the state government and * and * a new one the * of allegiance * him to * his * accordingly if the sovereign * from association with its confederates in the union the allegiance of the citizen * him to follow the sovereign any other course is * or * which in the cant of the day have been so * * and * as to be made worse than * his * to the union arose from the * of the state of which he was a citizen and ceased whenever his state withdrew from it he can not * * less * an association from which his sovereign has separated and thereby withdrawn him every officer of both federal and state * is required to take an oath to support the constitution a compact the * force of which is * upon the sovereignty of the * sovereignty * carrying with it the principles just stated with regard to allegiance every such officer is therefore * * to maintain and support the sovereignty of all the states military and * officers take in addition an oath to obey the * orders of their * such an oath has never been understood to be eternal in its * it is * by the death * or resignation of the officer who takes it and such resignation is not a mere * right but * an * duty when * in the service comes to be in conflict with the * allegiance due to the sovereignty of the state to which he * a little consideration of these plain and * * would show how utterly * and false are the * * which * * to those who in the late secession of the southern states were loyal to the only sovereign * to their allegiance and which still more * * of the * of * to support the government an oath which nobody ever could have been * required to take and which must have been * * with the * oath to support the constitution * and secession are often * treated as if they were one and the same thing it is true that both ideas spring from the sovereign right of a state to * for the protection of its own people but they are altogether * as to both their extent and the character of the means to be employed the first was a * * intended to * action until the question at issue could be submitted to a convention of the states it was a * which its * sought to * within the union a means to avoid the last * if the application for a convention should fail or if the state making it should suffer an * decision the * of that * have not revealed what they proposed as the next * the * of the compact to have been of that character which according to mr * * it secession on the other hand was the assertion of the * right of a people to change their government whenever it ceased to * the purposes for which it was * and established under our form of government and the * principles upon which it was * it should have been a peaceful * the * of a state from a * has no * or * * the government of the state remains * as to all * affairs it is only its * or confederate relations that are * to term this action of a sovereign a * is a * * of language so is the * * which * of it as an appeal to the * of the sword in the late contest in particular there was no appeal by the * states to the * of arms there was on their part no invitation nor * to war they stood in an * of * and were attacked for merely * a right * by the original terms of the compact they neither * nor accepted any * to the * of battle the man who * his house against attack can not with any * be said to have

of our * that a danger to the * of the union would * from the * interests of different * and every effort was made to secure each of these * of interests against * by the other as a proof of this may be * the following * from mr * report of a speech made by himself in the philadelphia convention on the 30th of june # mr * king a distinguished member of the convention from massachusetts a few days afterward said to the same effect he was fully * that the question concerning a difference of interests did not lie where it had * been * between the great and small states but between the southern and eastern for this reason he had been ready to yield something in the * of representatives for the * of the southern he was not * to giving them a still greater * but did not see how it could be

* to * a majority * by either or both of these * they * therefore to prevent the * * from the * of a sectional or party majority by so * the powers of government that each interest might hold a check

or our respect for the means which they * to carry them into effect that they were mistaken both as to the * of the * of sectional power and as to the * and * with which the congress was expected to * to the letter and spirit of its delegated authority is perhaps to be * less to * of * * than to that * confidence which is the * of honest minds and which was naturally * by the * and * feelings * from the great struggle through which they had then but recently passed they saw in the * of the authority delegated to the federal government and in the * of the sovereignty * by the states a system the * * of which was so * * to * * of the confederacy as to * every * of * and * * of pursuit carried out in the spirit in which it was * there was in this system no * of * but every * for an * of the

and purposes was the * of the right of the states to * if occasion should require it the powers which they had delegated on the contrary the * of this right was the * * of the * of the union and the * of it * the first serious note of its * the * * of state * for * of the * principles of the union against * or * is one of the most conspicuous features in the * of the various state * by which the constitution was * perhaps their ideas of the particular form in which this * was to be made may have been somewhat * and left to be reduced to * by the circumstances when they should * but the principle itself was assumed and asserted as * but for a firm * upon it as a sure * in case of need it may safely be said that the union would never have been formed it would be * to the wisdom and * of the * of the constitution to suppose that they entirely * on paper * for the protection of the rights of * fresh from the defense of * * and * * on * rights it might a * be assumed that they would require something more * than mere * to protect them from human * and human ambition that they did so is to be found in the * both of the general and the state * where state * was often declared to be the * against * at an early period in the history of the federal government the states of kentucky and virginia found reason to * this right of state * in the first of the famous resolutions drawn by mr jefferson in # and with some * adopted by the legislature of kentucky in november of that year it is declared that * the general government * * powers its acts are * * and of no force that to this compact each state * as a state and is an * party that this government * by this compact was not made the * or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself since that would have made its * and not the constitution the measure of its powers but that as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common judge each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of * as of the * and measure of * in the virginia resolutions drawn by mr madison adopted on the #* of december # and * in # the general * of that state * that it views the powers of the federal government as * from the compact to which the states are parties as limited by the plain sense and intention of the * * that compact as no further * than they are authorized by the grants * in that compact and that in case of a * * and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact the states who are parties * have the right and are in duty bound to * for * the progress of the evil and for * within their * limits the authorities rights and * * to them another of the same * of resolutions * the * of a design to * the states by * into one sovereignty these it is true were only the * of two states and they were * from by several other state * so much on the ground of opposition to the general principles asserted as on that of their being * in their application to the * and * laws

a right to judge of the extent of its own authority of those then * in public affairs it was apparently useless to ask that the question should be submitted for decision to the parties to the compact

confederacy or union must be determined by each member for itself once determined in favor of * all that remains for consideration is the * to see that no * * is done to former * and to make such fair * of common interests as the * of the case may require in july # the congress of the thirteen united colonies declared that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states the * of this asserted right and the attempted * made it * that a * of union was necessary for the common defense in november of the next year * # articles of confederation and * union were entered into by the thirteen states under the style of the united states of america the government * was to be * by a congress of * from the several states and each state to have an equal voice in * the government so formed was to act through and by the states and having no power to * its * upon the states * was early realized in its efforts to provide for the * of war after the * of peace and * of the independence of the states the difficulty of raising * and * * was so great as to lead to repeated efforts to obtain from the states additional grants of power under the articles of confederation no * of them could be made except by the * consent of the states and this it had not been found possible to obtain for the powers * to the * * of the * * to the congress * arose the * for a convention to * the articles of confederation the result was the * of a new plan of government * the constitution of the united states of america this was submitted to the congress in order that if * by them it might be referred to the states for adoption or * by the several * * and if adopted by nine of the states it was to be the compact of union between the states so * the same the new form of government * in many * * from the old one the * * on the purpose to give greater * to the government of the union proposed greatly to * its powers so much so that it was not * safe to * them to a single body and they were consequently * between three independent * of government which might be a check upon one another the constitution did not like the articles of confederation * that the states had agreed to a * union but distinctly indicated the hope of its * by the expression in the * of the purpose to secure the * of liberty to ourselves and our * the circumstances under which the union of the constitution was formed * the hope of its * but the brief existence of the confederation may have been a warning against the * of the assertion that the compact should be * a * for the * which had been realized under the articles of confederation in * * to correct any * in grants of power so as to render them * for the purpose for which they were given was provided by its fifth article it is here to be * noted that new grants of power as asked for by the convention were under the articles of confederation only to be obtained from the * * of the states therefore it followed that two of the states which did not * the constitution were so long as they * that * free from its * thus it is seen that the same principle in regard to * grants of additional power for the federal government formed the rule for the union as it had done for the confederation that is that the consent of each and every state was a * the * which * existed that several of the states might * the constitution and under the rule of * defeat it led to the * article of the constitution which provided that the ratification by the * of nine states should be sufficient for the * of the constitution between the states * it which of course * leaving the others more or less in number separate and * from the nine states forming a new government thus was the union to be a * compact and all the powers of its government to be * from the * of each of its members these powers as proposed by the constitution were so * as to * alarm and opposition by some of the most * men in many of the states it is known that the * of the * * * was only * by an assurance that such an * as the * would be adopted like opposition was by like assurance elsewhere * that article is in these words the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor * by it to the states are reserved to the states * or to the people * however of the delegated powers was made more easy than it had been under the confederation ratification by three * of the states was sufficient under the constitution for the adoption of an * to it as this power of * * to be the * * which will * up the rest i * to give it special examination what is the constitution of the united states the whole body of the * the history of its * and adoption as well as the * * added in an * of * clearly show it to be an * * the powers delegated by the states to the federal government their common agent it is * declared that all which was not so delegated was reserved on this mass of reserved powers those which the states declined to grant the federal government was * * to * of what value would this * have been if three * of the states could without the * of a particular state * the * which that state had reserved for its own * use and control it has * i hope been * * that the states were * before they formed the union and that they have never surrendered their sovereignty but have only * by their common agent certain * of sovereignty to be used for their common * among the powers delegated was one to * the constitution which it is submitted was merely the power to * the delegated grants and these were obtained by the separate and independent action of each state * to the union when we consider how carefully each * was * in the general convention and how closely each was * in the * of the several states the conclusion can not be * that all was * which it was intended to * and not a few of the * in that day held that too much power had been * aware of the * of everything * by man it was * that in the exercise of the * * to the general government experience might * the necessity of * * power was therefore given to * in a certain manner the delegated * so as to make them * for the purposes * or to prevent their * or * to the * or * of any of the people in support of this view i * to the * fact that the first ten * of the constitution nearly * with it all * either to the powers delegated or are directed to the greater * of the rights which were guarded by express * the * in the mind of the * of the constitution between * and * of power seems to me clearly drawn by the fact that the constitution itself which was a proposition to the states to grant * powers was only to have effect between the * states but the fifth article provided that * to the constitution might be adopted by three * of the states and thereby be * as part of the constitution it thus appears that a * power was required for an * than for a grant and the natural if not necessary conclusion is that it was because an * must belong to and grow out of a grant previously made if a * * could have been the means of * a new power is it to be supposed that those * * of community independence for which the war of the revolution had been fought would have been * to the adoption of the constitution by the declaration that the powers not delegated are reserved to the states unless the power of * be confined to the grants of the constitution there can be no * to the reserved rights of a * less than a fourth of the states i * that the word * * * an * upon something which is possessed and can have no proper application to that which did not previously * the * that was felt of this power of * by the * of the constitution is shown by the * placed upon the exercise of several of the delegated powers for example power was given to admit new states but no new state should be * within the * of any other state nor be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts of states without the consent of the * of those states and the power to * * was limited by the * of an * * for a certain time the * or * of persons whom any of the existing states should think proper to admit and by the very important provision for the protection of the * states and the * of their * in the union that the compact in regard to the * of the two houses of congress should not be so * that any state without its consent shall be * of its equal * in the senate these * and * on the power of * all * to * of the constitution to things which existed as part of the general government they were not needed and therefore not to be found in * to the reserved powers of the states on which the general government was * to * by the ninth article of the * in view of the small territory of the new england states * to that of the middle and southern states and the * of the * of new states in the large territory of some of these latter it might well have been anticipated that in the course of time the new england states would become less than one fourth of the members of the union nothing is less * than that the * * of that region would have * to a form of government which should give to a majority of three * of the states the power to * them of their dearest rights and * yet to this * the * theory of the power of * would go against this * assault this * horse which it is threatened to * into the * of our * i have sought to * the * of our free * and earnestly do * the resistance of all true * with the failure of the senate committee of thirteen to come to any * the last * hope of a * * of difficulties within the union was * in the minds of those most * to * the effort the year 1861 opened as we have seen upon the spectacle of a general belief among the people of the * states in the necessity of an early secession as the only possible * left them it has already been shown that the * and * with which the measures * for * were adopted and * afford the best * of the charge that they were the result of haste * or * still more contrary to truth is the assertion so often * made and * that the people of the south were led into secession against their will and their better judgment by a few * and * * the truth is that the southern people were in advance of their representatives throughout and that these latter were not * or leaders in the popular movement they were in * with its great principles but their influence with very few * was * to * rather than to * their application and to * rather than to * excitement as * on the * wall the people had a right to look to them for warning of approaching danger but as we have seen in that last * of the last congress that * the * southern * of the class generally considered * served on a committee of * and * earnestly to * its * * in this they still * themselves to prevent the commission of any act that might result in * * has * itself to the * of its resources in the * of * * * and * among the * and representatives of the south on

upon for * to be used in the * of what has been * accepted as * history nothing would seem to be too * for such * thus it has been * stated that a * of southern * held in the early part of january resolved to * to themselves the political power of the south that they took entire control of all political and military operations that they issued instructions for the passage of * of secession and for the * of forts * and * with much more of the like * * a foreign prince who served for a time in the federal army and has since * to write a history of the civil war in * history the * * of which are * from * of * * only by the * * of the * of the southern representatives as having kept their * in congress in order to be able to * its action forming at the same time a * whence they issued * to their friends in the south to complete the * of the * and again with reference to the secession of several states he says that the word of command issued by the committee at washington was promptly * * such as these are a * upon history that the representatives of the south held conference with one another and took * together as men having common interests and threatened by common * is true and is the full extent of the truth that they * to friends at home information of what was passing is to be * and would have been most * if it had not been that the published * rendered such communication * but that any such man or committee of men should have * to direct the mighty movement then * throughout the south or to control through the telegraph and the * the will and the judgment of * of the people assembled under the full consciousness of the dignity of that sovereignty which they represented would have been an extraordinary degree of * and * the * of the statement is further evident from a consideration of the fact that the movements which * in the secession of the several states began before the meeting of congress they were not * * or * by the * and representatives in congress but by the * * and finally by the * of the people in * of the * states i believe i may * claim to have possessed a full share of the confidence of the people of the state which i in part represented and proof has already been furnished to show how little effect my own influence could have upon their action even in the * capacity of a * upon the * by means of which it was hurried on to * as for the * of holding our * as a * in * for the * of the * connection with which the count of paris does me the honor to single out my name for special * is a charge so * if true to its * * if false to its * to be outside of the proper * of discussion it is a charge which no * ever made in my presence though i had in public * more than once * its assertion and * its * it is enough to say that i always held and * * the principle that a senator in congress occupied the position of an * from the state which he represented to the government of the united states as well as in some sense a member of the government and that in either capacity it would be * to use his powers and * for the destruction or for the * of the government to which he was * acting on this principle as long as i held a seat in the senate my best efforts were directed to the * of the constitution the union * from it and to make the general government an * agent of the states for its * purpose as soon as the * allegiance due to mississippi * a * of these efforts i withdrew from the position to say that during this period i did nothing * in conflict with what was done or * * would be merely to * my own * which would be * to those who may doubt it and * to those who believe in it what has been said on the subject for myself i believe to be also true of my southern * in congress with regard to the forts * etc something more remains to be said the authorities of the southern states immediately after and in some cases a few days before their * secession took possession in every instance without resistance or * of forts * * and other public property within their * limits i do not * at this time to consider the question of their right to do so that may be more * done * but it may not be out of place * to * to the statement often made that the absence of troops from the military * in the south which enabled the states so quietly to take such possession was the result of * and * between the southern leaders and the federal secretary of war john b * of virginia it is a sufficient answer to this * to state the fact that the absence of troops from these * instead of being * was and still is their ordinary condition in time of peace at the very moment when these * are being written in # although the army of the united states is twice as large as in # although four years of * war and a yet longer period of subsequent military * of the south have * the public to the presence of troops in their midst to an extent that would formerly have been * if not * although * of continued * on the part of the southern people have been * * for party * it is believed that the forts and * in the states of the * are in as * a condition and as * to quiet * if any such purpose existed as in the beginning of the year 1861 certainly those within the range of my personal information are occupied as they were at that time only by * or * there were however some * to this general * in the defensive works of the harbor of charleston the forts at key west and the dry * and those * the entrance of * bay the events which occurred in charleston harbor will be more * noticed * the island forts near the extreme southern point of * were too * and too * from * to be * at that time but the situation long * at the mouth of * bay * a signal * of the * and * spirit that * southern * for a long time fort * on the island of * * at the entrance to the harbor was occupied only by a small body of federal soldiers and * than one hundred all told immediately opposite and in possession of the other two forts and the * * was a strong force of * troops of * and alabama which might on short notice have been * increased ready and anxious to attack and take possession of fort * that they could have done so is * and if

to * these efforts were * through written and * * to the * of alabama and * the commander of the southern troops and other * persons near the scene of operations the records of the * if * will no

in connection with them our advice would have been different certain resolutions said to have been adopted in a meeting of * held on the evening of the #* of january have been * by the * of * * on the events of the period into something * * the * of these resolutions was the * that we could not longer * delay and even that was * under the circumstances for three of the states * had taken final

the * of a confederacy among the * states as early as possible after their * the * of which could hardly be * either by friend or foe as to the instructions asked for with regard to the * of * to hold

for myself i can only say that no advice could have * on me to hold a seat in the senate after receiving notice that mississippi had withdrawn from the union the best evidence that my * thought * is the fact that although no instructions were given them they promptly withdrew on the * of official information of the * of the states which they represented it will not be * here * to state what were my position and feelings at the period now under consideration as they have been the subject of * and * * it is not only * but * to * to me * of personal ambition to be * by a * of the union much of my life had been spent in the military and civil service of the united states whatever reputation i had * was * with their history and if future * had been the object it would have led me to * to the

conclusion has been made by others to whom it was well known before the confederacy was formed that i had no desire to be its president when the suggestion was made to me i expressed a decided * and gave reasons of a public and * character against being placed in that position * i then held the office of united states senator from * which i preferred to all others the kindness of the people had three times * it upon me and i had no reason to fear that it would not be given again as often as desired so far from * to change this position for any other i had * requested my friends some of whom had thought of putting me in * for the * of the united states in # not to permit my name to be used before the convention for any * whatever i had been so near the office for four years while in the cabinet of mr * that i saw it from behind the scenes and it was to me an office in no wise * the * were great the labor the * the * were greater those who have * known the official and personal life of our presidents can not fail to remember how few have left the office as happy men as when they entered it how * the shadows gathered around the * sun and how eagerly the * would turn to gaze upon another * just rising to take its place in the political * worn by * * broken in fortune * by public opinion * or * from future * the * and best who have filled that office have retired to private

assurance of receiving on his * the * * by the people to that great man that he had lived enough for life and for glory or even of feeling that the sacrifice of * had been * by the service rendered to his country the following facts were presented in a letter written several years ago by the * c c clay of alabama who was one of my most * * in the senate with reference to certain * to which his

thus the state of massachusetts has declared that in the acts of * of the * states the terms and conditions on which the grant is made are expressed in various * and with * * of * the act of new york * the use of a * for the * * may serve as a * it * this express condition south carolina in # by * * * to the united states in charleston harbor and on * river various forts and * and * for the * of

after # when the * arose and the * assertion was made that those forts and * had been * with the money and were therefore the property of the united states the terms of the * sufficiently * that they

entrance of the harbor two were * but the third fort * was held by a garrison of but little more than one hundred * whom only * were said to be * command of major robert anderson of the first artillery about twelve days before the secession of south carolina the representatives in congress from that state had called on the president to assure him in * of the secession of the state that no purpose was entertained by south carolina to attack or in any way * the forts held by the united states in the harbor of * least until opportunity could be had for an * * of all questions that might * with regard to these forts and other public * that no * should be sent and the military * should be permitted to remain * the south * understood mr * as * of this suggestion although * to make any * * it appears nevertheless from subsequent * that both before and after the secession of south carolina preparations were * made for * major anderson in case it should be * necessary by the government at

to defend himself to the last * to direct him to do so as long as any * hope remained of * the fort immediately after the secession of the state the convention of south carolina * three distinguished

limits of south carolina and also for an * of the public * and for a division of all other property held by the government of the united states as agent of the * states of which south carolina was recently a member and generally to * as to all other measures and arrangements proper to be made and adopted in the existing * of the parties and for the * of peace and * between this * and the government at washington the commissioners in the * of the duty * to them arrived in washington on the #* of december before they could * with the president * on the morning after their * were startled and the whole country * by the news that during the previous night major anderson had * * fort * * his guns burned his * and removed his command to fort sumter which occupied a more commanding position in the harbor this movement changed the whole * of affairs it was considered by the government and people of south carolina as a * of the * * of a * of the * * the remaining forts and other public property were at once taken possession of by the state and the condition of public feeling became greatly * an interview between the president and the commissioners was followed by a sharp correspondence which was * on the 1st of january 1861 by the return to the commissioners of their final communication with an * * that it was of such a character that the president declined to receive it the * were thus * broken off this correspondence may be found in the * in the mean time mr * secretary of state had resigned his position early in december on the ground of the * of the president to send * to charleston on the * of fort sumter by major anderson mr * secretary of war taking the ground that it was * a * of a * given or * by the government had asked that the garrison should be entirely withdrawn from the harbor of charleston and on the * of the president to consent to this had * his resignation which was promptly accepted this is believed to be a correct * of the earlier facts with regard to the charleston forts and in giving it i have done so as far as possible without * or any expression of opinion upon the * of the * the kind relations both personal and political which had long existed between mr * and myself had led him occasionally during his * to send for me to * with him on subjects that caused him anxiety and * me in sometimes calling upon him to offer my opinion on matters of special interest or importance thus it was that i had * with him freely in regard to the threatening * of events in the earlier part of the winter of # when he told me of the work that had been done or was doing at fort * is the * of its * by * it with * of * pointed out to him the * as well as * of the measure it seemed to me * to make * preparations for defense when no attack was threatened and the means adopted were * because any ordinary * would * the * off the * and thus to render them only * to the * he * whether the * had not been successful at fort brown on the * * in the beginning of the mexican war and was answered that the attack on fort brown had been made with * or at great distance after the * of the garrison to the stronger and * position of fort sumter i called upon him again to * from my knowledge of the people and the circumstances of the case how * the movement would be of * and how * to lead to * one of the * questions of the day was by what authority the * of the port should be appointed and the * was that instructions had been given to the commanding officer at fort sumter not to allow * to pass unless under * from the united states * it was easy to understand that if a vessel were fired upon under such circumstances it would be accepted as the beginning of * result which both he and i desired to * as the greatest * that could be * or * my opinion was that the * and best course would be to withdraw the garrison altogether from the harbor of charleston the presidents * to this was that it was his * duty to preserve and protect the property of the united states to this i replied with all the * the occasion demanded that i would * my life that if an * were taken of all the stores and * in the fort and an * with a few men left in charge of them they would not be * as a further * i offered to obtain from the governor of south carolina full assurance that in case any * or * * of persons should attempt to seize or * the property he would send from the * of charleston an * guard to protect it and to secure its * against * the president promised me to * upon this proposition and to * with his cabinet upon the * of * it all cabinet * are secret which is * to saying that i never knew what occurred in that meeting to which my proposition was submitted the result was not * to me but the events which followed proved that the suggestion was not accepted major anderson who commanded the garrison had many * and * that bound him to the south he performed his part like the true soldier and man of the * sense of honor that he was but that it was most painful to him to be charged with the duty of holding the fort as a * to the people of charleston is a fact known to many others as well as to myself we had been * together he was my first acquaintance in that corps and the friendship then formed was never interrupted we had served together in the summer and autumn of # in a commission of * into the * course of * and general condition of the united states military * at the close of our * the commission had * to meet again in washington about the end of the * november to examine the report and * it for * to congress major andersons duties in charleston harbor * him from * this * meeting of the commission and he wrote to me its * to explain the cause of his absence that letter was lost when my library and private papers were captured from my home in mississippi if any one has * it as a * of war its * would show how bright was the honor how broad the patriotism of major anderson and how fully he * with me as to the * which then * over the country in * the past and the present among the mighty * which * and sectional * have * one is * and * impressed by the extent to which public opinion has * from the * set up by the * and * who formed the constitutional union and observed by those who * its government down to the time when war between the states was * mr * the last president of the old school would as soon have thought of * in the * of a * among us as of * the * of * the states into * to the will of a majority in mass of the people of the united states when * the question of * the troops from the port of charleston he yielded a ready * to the proposition that the * of a * for a fort for purposes of public defense * whenever that fort should be employed by the * against the state by which the * was made on the familiar principle that any grant for a * purpose * when it * to be used for that purpose whether on this or any other ground if the garrison of fort sumter had been withdrawn in * with the spirit of the constitution of the united states from which the power to * * to a state was * and * * and if this had been distinctly assigned as a reason for its * the honor of the united states government would have been * * and nothing could have * more * to quiet the * and * the * of the people of south carolina the influence which such a measure would have * upon the states which had not yet * but were then * the adoption of that extreme * would probably have induced further delay and the * effect of time with a * of the * to be * might have * * * indeed anything could have * the * then * among the people of the northern states in their * for power and * of the duties of * it would have been easy to * this point the little garrison of fort sumter served only as a * for it was utterly * of holding the fort if attacked and the poor attempt soon afterward made to * and provision it by such a vessel as the star of the west might by the * be * * as a scheme to * * yet from my knowledge of mr * i do not * to say that he had no such wish or purpose his * hope was to * a * or at least to * it to a period beyond the close of his official term the * of the whole affair was what * * as something worse than a * * whatever * the case demanded should have been prompt to wait was * the * attempt * to throw * and provisions into fort sumter by means of the steamer star of the west resulted in the * of that vessel at the mouth of the harbor by the authorities of south carolina on the morning of the 9th of january on her * to * she was fired upon and put back to sea with her * and supplies a * account of this event was handed me a few hours afterward when * into my carriage to go to the * although i had then for some time ceased to visit the president yet under the * of this renewed note of danger to the country i drove immediately to the executive mansion and for the last time * to him to take such prompt measures as were evidently necessary to * the * * the result was even more * than that of former efforts had been on the same day the special message of the president on the state of the union * the day previous #* of january was submitted to congress this message was accompanied by the first letter of the south carolina commissioners to the president with his answer but of course not by their * which he had declined to receive mr * in his * * that immediately after the reading of his message this * which he terms an * letter was presented by me to the senate and by that body received and entered upon its journal the simple truth is that * it as * to a complete * of the * and its * as a mere act of justice to the commissioners i presented and had it read in the senate but its appearance upon the journal as part of

to which each state convention acting as the direct * of the sovereignty of the people * appointed * * intelligence of the secession of mississippi had reached washington some considerable time before

which washington * as a * for the * of the original confederation the greatest of which was the * of the action of the general agent by the opposition or * of the states sad as have been the * of the

that it might not be an * * of * the question of the right of a state to withdraw from the union no attempt however was made to arrest any of the * members and after a delay of a few days in necessary

exhibited by the people of these states and much anxiety was indicated as to the future many years of * had made them familiar with the idea of separation nearly two * had * to * since it had begun to be * as a possible * few very few of the southern people had ever regarded it as a * event or otherwise than as a last * for escape from * more * it was a * which however threatened they had still

* of war between the states the course which events were * to take was * in the greatest * in the minds of many there was the not * hope which had been expressed by the * sent from mississippi to

in the south at that time agreed with me and my * to * on the subject were therefore as unexpected as they were * on my arrival at jackson the capital of mississippi i found that the convention of the

notice was received of my election to the * of the confederate states with an * request to proceed immediately to * for * as this had been suggested as a probable event and what appeared to me * * had

the answer was that it was not my opinion that war should be * by the exercise of that right but that it would be judge * and i had not belonged to the same political party he being a * but we fully

to me and was therefore selected for the war department his was the only name presented from alabama the executive * having been organized my attention was first directed to preparation for military

facts no written answer to the note of the commissioners was delivered to them for * days after it was written the paper of mr seward in reply without * or address * march 15th was * as he states on that day in the department of state but a copy of it was not handed to the commissioners until the #* of april but an * answer had been made to the note of the commissioners at a much earlier date for the * of which it will be necessary to bear in mind the condition of affairs at charleston and * fort sumter was still occupied by the garrison under command of major anderson with no material change in the circumstances since the failure of the attempt made in january to * it by means of the star of the west this standing * at the * of the chief harbor of south carolina had been * by the government and people of that state and afterward by the confederate authorities in the * hope that it would be removed without * a * of forces fort * on one side of the entrance to the harbor of * was also occupied by a garrison of united states troops while the two forts * and * on the other side were in possession of the confederates communication by sea was not entirely * however in the case of fort * the garrison had been * and a * of federal * was lying outside of the harbor the condition of affairs at these * at fort * a subject of anxiety with the friends of peace and the hope of * by * the questions * in their * had been one of the most * * for the prompt * of the commissioners to washington the letter of the commissioners to mr seward was written as we have seen on the 12th of march the * message above mentioned was obtained and * to the commissioners through the * of two * of the supreme court of the united * * of new york and campbell of alabama on the 15th of march according to the statement of judge campbell mr justice * visited the * of state and of the treasury and the * * seward * and * to * them from * to put in execution any policy of * during the term of the supreme court he had very carefully * the laws of the united states to enable him to * his * and from time to time he had * the chief justice * upon the questions which his examination had suggested his conclusion was that without very serious * of constitution and * * could not be successfully effected by the executive department i had made * judge campbell a similar examination and i * in his * and opinions as he was returning from his visit to the state department we * met and he informed me of what he had done he said he had spoken to these officers at large that he was received with respect and listened to with attention by all with * by the * and with great * by the secretary of state that the secretary had expressed * to find so many * to the * of peace and only wished there had been more he stated that the secretary told him there was a present cause of * that the southern commissioners had demanded * and a * would lead to * and excitement in the southern states and would cause a * and excitement in the northern states * to a peaceful * justice * suggested that i might be of service the result of the interview between these two distinguished gentlemen we are informed was another visit by both of them to the state department for the purpose of * mr seward to reply to the commissioners and assure them of the desire of the united states government for a friendly * mr seward seems to have * to an immediate * of the commissioners on the ground that the state of public sentiment in the north would not * it in connection with the * of the troops from fort sumter which had been determined on the * of sumter he said is as much as the administration can bear judge campbell * i * in the conclusion that the * of sumter * responsibility and stated that there could not be too much * in the adoption of measures so as not to * or to * the public sentiment and that the * of sumter was sufficient for the present in that direction i stated that i would see the commissioners and i would write to mr davis to that effect i asked him what i should say as to sumter and as to * he authorized me to say that before that letter could reach him mr davis he would learn by telegraph that the order for the * of sumter had been made he said the condition of * was * and there would be no change made there the * in this * are my own the letter in which this promise was * to me has been lost but it was given in * the terms above stated as authorized by mr * the order for the * of the fort would be issued before the letter could reach me the same assurance was given on the same day to the commissioners judge campbell tells us that mr * was slow to consent to * from pressing the demand for * it was only after some discussion and the expression of some * that he * to do so this consent was clearly one part of a * of which the other part was the * that the fort would be * in the course of a few days mr * required the * of mr seward to be reduced to writing with judge * personal assurance of its * and * this written statement was exhibited to judge * before its * and * by him the fact that the * had been given in his name and behalf was * to mr seward the same evening by letter he was * of * to and in great part the author of the whole * it will be observed that not only the commissioners in washington but the confederate government at * also were thus assured on the highest * of the secretary of state of the united states the official * of communication of the views and purposes of his * the intention of that government to order the * of fort sumter within a few days from the 15th of march and not to * the existing * at fort * * this was not the mere statement of a fact but a * given as the consideration of an appeal to the confederate government and its commissioners to * from * the federal administration by * any further * at the same time as such a * it was accepted and while its * was quietly awaited the commissioners * to make any further demand for reply to their note of the 12th of march five days having * in this condition of affairs the commissioners in washington * brigadiergeneral beauregard commander of the confederate forces at charleston * whether the fort had been * or any action taken by major anderson * the * of an * answer was made to this * that the fort had not been * that there were no * of such a purpose but that major anderson was still working on its * this * was taken to mr seward by judge campbell two * occurred in * to it at both of which judge * was also present of the result of these * judge campbell states the last was full and * the secretary was * and * he spoke of his ability to carry through his policy with confidence he * for the delay as * and not * the * of his assurance that the * would take place and that i should know whenever any change was made in the resolution in reference to sumter or to * i repeated this assurance in writing to judge * and informed governor seward in writing what i had said it would be * but for the * * which have since been brought to light that during all this period of * * of a purpose to withdraw the garrison from fort sumter and of * for delay on account of the difficulties which * it the government of the united states was * engaged in * means for * supplies and * to the garrison with the view of * possession of the fort mr g * * afterward * secretary of the united states navy had proposed a plan for * and * supplies to the garrison of fort sumter in february during the administration of mr * in a letter published in the newspapers since the war he gives an account of the manner in which the proposition was renewed to the new administration and its reception by them as follows thus we see that at the very moment when mr secretary seward was * to the confederate government through judge campbell his * assurance that the * would take place this * was on his way to charleston to obtain information and * measures by means of which this promise might be broken on his arrival in charleston mr * tells us that he sought an interview with captain * of the confederate navy and through this officer obtained from governor * permission to visit fort sumter he * in his narrative to state what we learn from governor * himself that this permission was obtained * upon the * of * purposes notwithstanding this * he employed the opportunity * by his visit to * the details of his plan for * supplies and * to the garrison he did not he says * his plan or purposes to major anderson the commanding officer of the garrison having * enough perhaps to * that the * of that brave and honest soldier would have * at and * the * and * of the whole * the result of his visit was however reported at washington his plan was * by president lincoln and he was sent to new york to make arrangements for putting it in execution this it will be remembered occurred while mr * was making active though secret preparations for his relief expedition colonel or major * as he is * * in the correspondence did not return to charleston as promised about the 30th of march which was saturday a telegram from governor * was received by the commissioners in washington making * with regard to colonel * and the meaning of the * delay to * the promise of * this was fifteen days after the original assurance of mr seward that the garrison would be withdrawn immediately and ten days after his explanation that the delay was * the * of governor * was taken by judge campbell to mr seward who appointed the * monday 1st of april for an interview and answer at that interview mr seward informed judge campbell that the president was * about the contents of the * was a point of honor * that * had no * from him nor title to speak this late suggestion of the point of honor would seem under the circumstances to have been made in a spirit of * * like sir john * celebrated * on the same subject the only * result of the conversation however was the written assurance of mr seward to be * to the commissioners that the government will not * to supply fort sumter without giving notice to governor * this it will be observed was a very material * from the * * previously given and * to the commissioners to governor * and to myself directly that the fort was to be * * judge campbell in his account of the interview says i asked him mr seward whether i was to understand that there had been a change in his former * his answer was none about the close of the same week the first in april the patience of the commissioners having now been * exhausted and the * preparations of the government of the united states notwithstanding the * with which they were conducted having become matter of general * a letter was addressed to mr seward upon the subject by judge campbell in behalf of the commissioners again asking whether the * so often given were well or ill * to this the secretary returned answer in writing faith as to sumter fully kept wait and see this was on the #* of april the very next day the #* the following official * without date or * was read to governor * of south carolina and general beauregard in charleston by mr * an official of the state department mr * in washington who * did a captain or lieutenant * who accompanied * it was from the president of the united states and delivered by him to mr * on the #* day before mr * assurance of faith fully kept thus disappeared the last * of the * faith and * * of the federal government in order fully to appreciate the * of this communication and of the time and circumstances of its * it must be borne in mind that the * expedition which had been * in preparation for some time at new york under direction of captain * was now ready to * and might * be expected to be at charleston almost immediately after the * was delivered to governor * and before preparation could be made to receive it * to * or * in the washington cabinet however and then to the delay caused by a severe storm at sea this * was disappointed and the confederate commander at charleston had opportunity to * with * and receive instructions for his * before the arrival of the * which had been intended to be a surprise in * made since the war by members of mr * cabinet it has been represented that during the period of the * * above * there were * and divisions in the * members of it * measures of prompt and decided * the secretary of state * a * or at least a * policy and the president * for a time between the two but * * the views of the * in these * it is represented that the * and * given by mr seward to the confederate government and its commissioners were given on his own authority and without the consent or * of the president of the united states the * of any such attempt to * the action of the president from that of his secretary and to relieve the former of responsibility for the conduct of the latter is too evident to require * or comment it is impossible to believe that during this whole period of nearly a month mr lincoln was ignorant of the * that were passing between the confederate commissioners and mr seward through the distinguished member of the supreme * holding his seat as * was acting as * on one occasion judge campbell * us that the secretary in the midst of an important interview * himself for the purpose of * with the president before giving a final answer and left his visitor for some time awaiting his return from that conference when the answer was given * and directly * from the president if however it were possible to suppose that mr seward was acting on his own responsibility and * a * upon his own chief as well as upon the confederate authorities in the * which he made to the latter it is nevertheless certain that the * facts were brought to light within a few days after the close of the efforts at * yet the secretary of state was not * and brought to trial for the grave * of * to conduct the most * and * * that had been or could be brought before the government of the united states without the knowledge and in opposition to the will of the president and for having * the government in * if not in disaster he was not even * from office but continued to be the chief officer of the cabinet and * * of the president as he was afterward of the * administration * that station during two * terms no * of his action no * nor explanation was ever made * and * the president is * * in all cases for the action of any member of his cabinet and in this case it is as * to attempt to * from him the moral as it would be impossible to relieve him of the * responsibility that * upon the government of the united states for the * * of * * by its authority on the other hand mr seward throughout the whole * was fully informed of the views of his * in the cabinet and of the president whatever his real hopes or purposes may have been in the beginning it is * certain that long before the end and while still * his * that the garrison would be withdrawn he knew that it had been determined and that active preparations were in progress to * it mr * * who was secretary of the navy in mr * cabinet gives the following account of one of the * of the period this account is * by a letter of mr * * the date of the * of the presidents final purpose is fixed by mr * in the * * to that above * as the #* of march this was four days before mr * assurance given judge * conference with the * there would be no departure from the * previously given which were that the fort would be * and ten days before his written * of the * as to sumter fully kept wait and see this assurance too was given at the very moment when a * from his own department was on the way to charleston to * the governor of south carolina that faith would not be kept in the matter it is scarcely necessary to say that the commissioners had with good reason ceased to place any confidence in the * of the united states government before they ceased to be made on the #* of april they sent the following * to general beauregard on the same day the * made to governor * through mr * was made known the commissioners immediately applied for a * answer to their note of march 12th which had been permitted to remain in * the paper of the secretary of state * march 15th was * delivered to them this paper with the final * of the commissioners and judge * letters to the secretary of april 13th and april #* * will be found in the * * was now at an end and the

events above * with all of comment that it was then or is now considered necessary to add the course pursued by the government of the united states with regard to the forts had not passed without earnest * from the most * and * of its own friends during the period of the events which * the subject of the * chapter in the senate of the united states which continued in executive * for several weeks after the * of mr lincoln it was the subject of discussion mr * of * was certainly not * of sympathy with secession or * of devotion to the * the 15th of march offered a resolution * the * of the * from all forts within the limits of the states which had * except those at key west and the dry * in support of this resolution he said mr * in * the * of peace as a * for the * of the forts was no doubt aware of the full force of his words he knew that their continued * was * a declaration of war the * of the united states army also it is well known * advised the * of the forts but the most striking * against the * measures finally adopted was that of major anderson himself the letter in which his views were expressed has been carefully * in the * * of that period and * lost sight of although it does the highest honor to his patriotism and * it was written on the same day on which the * was made to governor * of the purpose of the united states government to send supplies to the fort and is worthy of * here this frank and * letter although written with the reserve * belonging to a communication from an officer to his military * * * with orders fully * major anderson from all * of * or sympathy with the bad faith of the government which he was * it * entirely with the * expressed in his private letter to me already mentioned as lost or * and * him in the * of faithful * of a duty * with his domestic * and * to his patriotism the relief * as with * * it was * was already under way for charleston * according to their own statement of eight * carrying * guns and about * hundred men including the troops sent for * of the garrison these facts became known to the confederate government and it was * that no time was to be lost in preparing for and if possible * the *

a * attention to that of major anderson bearing in mind certain important facts not referred to in the correspondence major anderson had been requested to state the time at which he would * the fort if * * in the mean time not to use his guns against the city and the troops * it unless fort sumter should be first attacked by them on these conditions general beauregard offered to * from opening

himself not to open fire upon the confederates unless in the mean time compelled to do so by some * act against the fort or the flag of his government * as it was known to the confederate commander that the * instructions were already issued and that the additional supplies were * expected * also as any attempt to * the supplies would * the opening of fire upon the * bearing them under the flag of the united * * major anderson from his * is evident that his conditions could not be accepted it would have been merely after the * of a * determination by the government of the united states to * an * conflict with the guns of fort sumter and the * forces of the united states in * with no possible hope of * it unless in the * event of a delay of the expected * for nearly four days longer in point of fact it arrived off the harbor on the same day but was * by a * of wind from * it there was * no other course to be pursued than that announced in the answer given by general beauregard it should not be forgotten that during the early * of fort sumter by a garrison the * of which was at least * no * had been put upon their privilege of * in charleston fresh provisions or any * or * not directly * to the supply of the means * to hold the fort for an * time here in the brief hour immediately before the * of the * storm although it can hardly be necessary for the reader who has carefully considered what has already been written we may pause for a moment to * the * of the parties to the contest and the grounds on which they * stand i do not now * to the original causes of * the * * of * and union or to the question of the right or the wrong of * to the * and immediate causes of conflict the fact that south carolina was a * her relations may have been to the other * not and can not be denied it is equally * that the ground on which fort sumter was built was * by south carolina to the united states in trust for the defense of her own soil and her own chief harbor this has been shown by * evidence to have been the principle * all * by the states of * for military purposes but it * with special force to the case of charleston the * * into that harbor from * to mouth lie entirely within the limits of the state of south carolina no other state or * of states could have any * interest or * in the * of a * at that point unless as a means of * against south carolina herself the * view of the case was * stated by mr * when he said i take it for granted that * * * charleston and south carolina is * to the possession of fort sumter * * * * and * is * to the possession of fort * * * the states in whose limits those forts are placed is * to the forts themselves unless there is something peculiar in the * of some particular fort that makes it important for us to hold it for the general defense of the whole country its * and interests instead of being useful only for the defense of a particular city or * no such necessity could be * with regard to fort sumter the claim to hold it as public property of the united states was utterly * and * apart from a claim of * control over the state if south carolina was a mere * in a state of open * the government of the united states had a right to * its hold of any * place within her limits which happened to be in its possession and it would have had an equal right to * possession of any other it would have had the same right to send an army to columbia to * down the walls of the state capitol the subject may at once be * of the * which would make a * between the two cases the one was as really an act of war as the other would have been the right or the wrong of either * entirely upon the question of the * power of the federal government to * a state into * power which as we have seen was * * in the * of the federal constitution and which was still * by many perhaps by a majority even of those who denied the right of a state to * if there existed any hope or desire for a peaceful * of the questions at issue between the states either party had a right to demand that * such * there should be no * grasp upon its throat this * had been held on the throat of south carolina for almost four months from the period of her secession and no * resistance to it had yet been made * and patient * and * * at * for its * had been made with two * * of the government of the united * first by the state of south carolina and by the government of the confederate states after its * these efforts had been met not by an open * of * purposes but by * * and * the * of one administration to maintain the * * at the time when the question arose was * in december by the * of the garrison from its original position to the * of a stronger another attempt was made to * it in january by the introduction of troops concealed below the * of the steamer star of the west but this was * by the * of the state service the * course of * and * * by mr * administration in the months of march and april has been fully exhibited it was evident that no confidence whatever could be * in any * or promise of the federal government as then * yet notwithstanding all this no resistance other than that of * * and * for an * * was made until after the * of a purpose of * and when it was known that a * * was on the way to support and * it at the very moment when the confederate commander gave the

of the star of the west and the * * upon the confederate commissioners in washington he says we were * * that nothing more would on that occasion be * words in * themselves * a very * though * and * *

united states capital to report the result of their mission to the confederate government the notice received that an armed expedition had * for operations against the state of south carolina in the harbor of charleston induced the confederate government to meet as best it might this assault in the * of its * to defend each state of the confederacy to this end the * of the formidable work fort sumter was commenced in * of the * which was then moving to unite with its garrison for * against south carolina the * * and surrender of fort sumter occurred on april # 1861 the garrison was * permitted to retire with the * of war the * of that fort commanding the entrance to the harbor of charleston which if in * hands was * of its * had been claimed as the right of south carolina the * * of the garrison by the united states government had been considered and those best * to judge believed it had been promised yet when instead of the * of just * instead of the * of the garrison a * expedition was organized and sent forward the * of the case required its * before it should be * had there been delay the more serious conflict between larger forces land and * would scarcely have been * as the * fortunately was the event however was seized upon to * the mind of the northern people and the * which had been worn in the * with the confederate commissioners was now thrown off and it was * attempted to show that the south which had been * for peace and still stood on the defensive had by this * * a war against the united states but it should be stated that the * * in the * that the union could not * part slave and part free and that the union should be * and the * of the right of a state * to withdraw were * a declaration of war and the sending of an army and navy to attack was the result to have been anticipated as the consequence of such declaration of war on the 15th day of the same month president lincoln * his * of * too powerful to be * by the ordinary course of * * called forth the military of the several states to the number of * thousand and commanded the persons * the * to * etc it can but surprise any one in the least degree * with the history of the union to find states referred to as persons * * and that the sovereign * of the federal government the states of the union should be commanded by their agent to * the * of so large an army could only mean war but the power to * war did not * in the * was delegated to the congress only if however it had been a * * or an * it must have been according to the constitution against the state and the power of the president to call forth the * to * it was * upon an application from the state for that purpose it could not * such application and still less could it be * * against the will of a state the authorities on this subject have been * * and need not be referred to again * it to say that by section # article * of the constitution the united states are bound to protect each state against invasion and against domestic * whenever application shall have been made by the legislature or by the executive when the legislature can not be * and that to fail to give protection against any invasion * would be a * of duty to add that there could be no * for the invasion of a state by an army of the united states is but to repeat what has been said on the absence of any authority in the general government to * a state in any possible view of the case therefore the conclusion must be that the calling on some of the states for * thousand * to * other states which were asserted to be still in the union was a * * of the constitution and the * of * power or in other words of power reserved to the states or to the people it might therefore have been anticipated that * of whose sons wrote the declaration of independence another of whose sons led the armies of the united states in the revolution which * their independence and another of whose sons * * to the adoption of the constitution of the * not have been slow in the face of such events to * the grants she had made to the general government and to withdraw from the union to the * of which she had so * * two days had * between the surrender of fort sumter and the * of president lincoln calling for * thousand * as before stated two other days * and virginia passed her * of secession and two days * the citizens of baltimore * the passage of troops through that city on their way to make war upon the southern states thus rapidly did the * of events bear us * from peace to the * war which was soon to * the * effort of the * * citizens of baltimore to resist the progress of armies for the invasion of her southern sisters was worthy of the fair fame of maryland becoming the * of the men who so * fought for the freedom independence and sovereignty of the states the bold stand then and * taken * a promise from the executive authorities that no more troops should be sent through the city of baltimore which promise however was only observed until by * power had been gained to * it virginia as has been * stated passed her * of secession on the #* of april it was however subject to ratification by the people at an election to be held on the fourth * of may she was in the mean time like her southern sisters the object of northern * and having a common cause with them * anticipated the election of may by forming an * with the confederate states which was * by the convention on the #* of april the convention for that * set forth that virginia looking to a * union with the confederate states and for the purpose of meeting pressing * agreed that the whole military force and military operations * and defensive of said * in the * conflict with the united states shall be under the chief control and direction of the president of the said confederate states the whole was made subject to the * and ratification of the proper authorities of both * * to those who * south carolina as having * * in * from the union it may be answered that * * show that her delay could not have changed the result and further that her prompt action had enabled her better to prepare for the * which it was found impossible to * thus she was prepared in the first * of virginia to send to her troops organized and * before the convention for * with the confederate states had been adopted by virginia that * soldier general * of south carolina went with his brigade to richmond and throughout the southern states there was a * desire to rush to virginia where it was * that the first great battles of the war were to be fought so that as early as the #* of april i * to governor * that in addition to the forces * ordered * had been made for thirteen regiments eight to * at lynchburg four at richmond and one at harpers ferry * to an application that had been made to him from baltimore i wrote * baltimore if * we will * you the * feeling was that of a common cause and common * there was no * desire to * around home no narrow purpose to separate * interests from the common * the object was to * a * broad principle of constitutional liberty the right of * the early * of the enemy showed that virginia was * to invasion from the north from the east and from the west though the larger preparation indicated that the most serious danger to be * was from the line of the potomac the first * occurred in the east the narrow * between the james and york * had * features well * to defense it was held by general john b magruder who * * its natural strength by * means and there on the ground * as the field of the last battle of the revolution in which general washington compelled lord * to surrender magruder with a small force held for a long time the superior forces of the enemy in check the question of * arms and * of war was the first considered because it was the want for which it was the most difficult to provide of men willing to * in the defense of their country there were many more than we could arm though the * sentiment of the southern people was a cordial * to the union as it was formed by their fathers their love was for the spirit of the compact for the * it was * to secure for the * and state sovereignty which had been won by separation from the * and * to them by their * * as a * for their * for ever the number of those who desired to * the union even though the constitution should be faithfully * who in the language of the day were called * per * so small as not to be felt in any popular decision but the number of those who held that the states had surrendered their sovereignty and had no right to * from the union was so * small if indeed any such existed that i can not recall the fact of a single southern * of that opinion the assertion of the right is not to be * with a * to exercise it many who had no doubt as to the right looked upon its exercise with * * to sorrow and claimed that it should be the last * only to be adopted as the * to a surrender of the * in the union of states free sovereign and independent of that class forming a large majority of the people of mississippi i may speak with the confidence of one who belonged to it thus after the legislature of mississippi had * a law for a convention which * the sovereignty of the state should consider the * of passing an * to * the grants made to the general government and withdraw from the union i as a united states senator of mississippi * my position in the senate and sought by every * * to obtain such measures as would * the excitement and afford to the south such * as would prevent the final step the * of secession from the union when the last hope of * the union of the constitution was * and the * of secession was * by the convention of mississippi which was the highest authority known under our form of government the question of the * of * that * was no longer open to * by one who * his allegiance as due to the state of which he was a citizen to * the * * from the * of his sovereign the people would be * to resist it would be * the * and * of the citizens of mississippi led them with great * to the duty of * and * their state without * to ask what would be the * of * * to its * a like feeling * all of the * states and it was not only for the military service but for every service which would * and * the confederacy that an enthusiasm * all * * and * was * though our * * had been * for * * that in the * states the necessary * were to a considerable extent * from the west and it would require that the * of the * should be changed from the * of * for * to the * of supplies * for home * and the support of armies in the field yet even under the * of war this was expected and for a long time the result * the * extraordinary as it must appear when * by comparison with other people who have been * to a like * much of our success was due to the * institution of * * for it enabled the white men to go into the army and leave the * of their fields and the care of their * as well as of their * and children to those who in the language of the constitution were held to service or labor a passing remark may here be * as to the answer thus * to the * about the horrors of slavery had these * been a * * people * * to be * from their bonds would their * have dared to leave them as was done and would they have remained as they did * their usual duties or could the * of * have been put on the * of a military necessity if the fact had been that the negroes were forced to serve and desired only an opportunity to rise against their * it will be remembered that when the * was issued it was * by president lincoln to be a * beyond the * within which it could be * by the federal troops to direct the * * * and * of food for the army required a man of rare capacity and character at the head of the * department it was our good fortune to have such an one in colonel l b * who was appointed * at the organization of the * of the executive department of the confederate government he had been an officer of the united states army had served in various parts of the south had been for some time on duty in the * and to the special and general knowledge thus * added strong * sense and * * of him and the operations of the * department i shall have more to say * when * of the * of the confederacy assured of an army as large as the * of the confederate states could furnish and a sufficient supply of * for such an army at least until the * of war should * with * and * the immediate object of attention was the organization * and * of the army as * stated there was a * belief that there would be no war or if any that it would be of very short * therefore the first bill which passed the * congress provided for receiving troops for short * my memory * for sixty days the * of the committee on military affairs the heroic colonel * who * his devotion to the cause with his * blood on the field of manassas in * to my earnest * against such a policy returned with the bill to the house the congress then consisted of but one house and * a * by which the term of service was extended to twelve months unless sooner * i had urged upon him in our conference the adoption of a much longer period but he assured me that one year was as much as the congress would * to on this as on other occasions that congress showed a generous desire to yield their * opinions to my * as far as they * could and there being but one house it was * to change the terms of a bill after conference with the executive than when under the * organization * had to be * * in a message to that * of congress in which the bill * and when the whole * was of record this first act to provide for the public defense became a law on the #* of february 1861 and its fifth section so clearly * the opinions and * * when the confederation was formed that it is * here the * of the states is the * idea the president was authorized to receive from the several states the arms and * which they might desire to * to the government of the confederate states and he was also authorized to receive the forces which the states might tender or any which should * by the consent of their state for any time not less than twelve months unless sooner * and such forces were to be received with their officers by * * or regiments and the president by and with the advice and consent of congress was to * such general officer or officers for said forces as might be necessary for the service it will be seen that the arms and * within the limits of the several states were regarded as entirely belonging to them that the forces which were to * the * army could only be drawn from the several states by their consent and that these were to be organized under state authority and to be received with their officers so appointed that the * organization was to be that of a company and the highest that of a regiment and that the appointment of general officers to command these forces was * to the government of the confederate states should the * of large bodies of troops require organization above that of a regiment and it will also be observed that provision was made for the * of the forces so provided for before the term of service fixed by the law no one will fail to * how little was anticipated a war of the vast * and great * which ensued and how * the sovereignty and * of the states were * to at a later period march # 1861 the congress adopted resolutions * to the * states to * the forts * * * and other public * within their * limits to the confederate states etc the hope which was early entertained of a peaceful * of the * * between the confederate states and the united states rapidly * so that we find on the #* of march that the congress in its * to an act to provide for the public defense * with the declaration that in order to provide speedily forces to * invasion etc authorized the president to * the * and to ask for and accept the services of any number of volunteers not * one hundred thousand and to * * into * * into regiments and regiments into brigades and divisions as in the first law the president was authorized to * the commanding officer of such brigades and divisions the * only to endure while the brigades were in service on the same day march # 1861 was * the law for the * and organization of the army of the confederate states of america this being in * to the * army which was to be composed of troops * by the states as in the first act and volunteers received as in the second act to * a * army that the wish and policy of the government was peace is again * in this act which in * for the military * of the confederacy fixed the number of * men of all arms at nine thousand four hundred and twenty due care was taken to prevent the appointment of * or * persons to be officers of the army and the right to * up to and including the * of colonel was carefully guarded and beyond this the * character of the army was recognized as follows * to the rank of brigadiergeneral after the army is organized shall be made by * from the army there being no right of * above the * of colonel in the army of the united states * for appointment to the rank of general had no other * than the necessity for * by the senate the provision just * * the further * of * the person * by * to have previously been an officer of the army of the confederate states * the army of the united states as belonging neither to a section of the union nor to the general government but to the states * while they remained united it follows as a * of the proposition that when * occurred the * * * the army would be left free to choose their future place of service therefore provision was made for * to officers who should leave the army of the united states and join that of the confederate states the same * rank in the latter which they held in the former the provisions * are in the view entertained that the army was of the states not of the government and was to secure to officers * to the confederate states the same * rank which they had before those states had withdrawn from the union it was clearly the * of the law to * in this provision only those officers who had resigned or who should * from the united states army to enter the service of the confederacy or who in other words should thus be * from one service to the other it is also to be noted that in the * section of the act to which this was * the right of * up to the * of colonel in established regiments and corps was absolutely secured but that * to the higher * should be by * at first without * but after the army had been organized the * was confined to the army thus * the * of arms and * officers from the * beyond the * of their * right to * of being * by * through * or political influence how well the government of the confederacy observed both the letter and the spirit of the law will be seen by reference to its action in the matter of * it is a * fact that the three highest officers in rank and whose fame stands * either for * or * were all so * to any question of personal interest that they had received their appointment before they were aware it was to be * each brought from the army of the united states an * reputation such as would have secured to him had he chosen to remain in it after the war commenced any position his ambition could have * therefore against * of * and * by devotion to principle they * the * * and personal which had bound them from their youth up to the time when the southern states * the * truth that all * rest on the consent of the * decided to withdraw from the union they had * entered and the northern states resolved to * them to remain in it against their

most * and * as * of the united states army when i was secretary of war the value of his services in the organization of a new army was considered so great that i invited him to take the position of * of the confederate army which he accepted without a question either as to * rank or anything else the highest * then authorized by law was that of brigadiergeneral and that commission was * upon him when general * * johnston reached richmond he called upon me and for several days at various * we * with the freedom and confidence belonging to the close friendship which had existed between us for

after the seat of government was removed from * to richmond the course of events on the southern * coast induced me to direct general lee to * * before leaving he said that while he was * in virginia he had never thought it * to * about his rank but now when about to go into other states and to meet officers with whom he had not been previously connected he would like to be informed upon that

of the confederate states army with the rank of colonel i have * * to the difficult task thus * on him and the success with which he performed it and would be pleased here to enter into a * * but have not the * information in regard to his administration of that department surgeon l p * an officer of recognized * in the united states * department from which he had resigned to join the confederacy was appointed the * of the confederate states army as in the case of other * there was in this a want of the stores * as well for the field as the hospital to supply * which were declared by the enemy to be * of war our * department had to seek in the forest for * and to add * * and * to the small * on hand as best they could it would be quite beyond my power to do justice to the skill and

for the * of large * being in advance of the * sent from the northern government for the same purpose for further and more * information reference is made to the * of the chief of * my letter of

from which they had been * in the navy to serve where they held their allegiance to be due the theory that they * allegiance to their * states was * on the fact that the federal government was of the states the * was that the navy belonged to the states not to their agent the federal government and when the states ceased to be united the * * and * should have been divided among the * while we honor the sentiment which caused them to surrender their * * and the * to which they were * on which they * for * to go with nothing save their * and faithful hearts to fight to * and to die if need

to wish that their * to the * of a * belief should have yielded to any * of interest the course they pursued * how impossible it was that they should have done so for what did they not sacrifice to their sense of right we were * * by losing our share of the navy we had * to * and by having it all employed to * us the application of the * for the navy of the united states had been such that the * of * had been at the north though much of the * used and other material employed was * from the south to northern * therefore we were without the * * for the rapid supply of * * while * whatever was *

may not be * to remark here that if the * of our people were not realized it was not from any * of the * and ability of the secretary of the navy mr * as was * stated his * for and * in * affairs had led him to know much of * their * and * and as * of the committee on united states * affairs he had * to this a very large acquaintance with officers of the united states navy which gave him the *

realized how * * the southern states were in all which was necessary to the active operations of an army however gallant the men might be and however able were the generals who directed and led them from these causes * * resulted * * at the north and * confidence at the south the * of our people in * and * their * in fields from the * of * * caused them to be generally * with the arms used for

* operations and the * of a country which * * food for its * when peaceful * were * would serve but a short time to furnish the * of a large army it was of course easy to * that if war was * against the * states by all of those which remained in the union the large supply of provisions which had been * sent from the * to the south could not under the * circumstances be * on that our people did not more immediately turn their attention to the * of * may be * to the * * that secession would not be followed by war to the able officer then at the head of the * department colonel l b * much credit is due for his * efforts to provide both for immediate and * wants it gives me the greater pleasure to say this because those less informed of all he did and * tried to do have been * of * and * indeed of the * * his due * * for * might have relieved the * want of supplies especially in virginia where the * bodies of troops were assembled but unfortunately the * department was scarcely less provided than that of the * not only were the * * in number but they were * furnished with * * and had been * * upon northern * and * for their * and * even the * * of the * were generally northern men and their * followed fast upon every disaster which attended the confederate arms in addition to other causes which have been mentioned the idea that cotton was king and would * foreign * as well as a desire of the northern people for the return of peace and the * of trade * a * influence in * our * from * at an early period their capital and labor to the * of * rather than that of our * for * as one after another the * * and the material * of a great war were recognized by our people never did * devotion * * * of the sacrifice of * and the * of fixed * and opinions or more * and * effort to meet the * task which was set before them being one of the few who regarded secession and war as * connected my early attention was given to the organization of military forces and the * and preparation of the * of war if our people had not gone to war without * the cost they were nevertheless * in it without means of * for its * it has been * stated that we had no * it would be * to say that the * government had no * of * but it may be well to add that beyond the small supply required for * purposes our * * had no * on hand having no * * which required * very little of that was * in our * the same would have been the case in regard to * but for the fact that it had been recently employed in the * of * * and thus a considerable amount of it was found in new orleans prompt measures

without * or a navy to secure its * from abroad was soon relieved by the extraordinary efforts of the * department and the * skill of general * to whom it is but a just * to say that beginning without

qualities which cause its * under long * to a * atmosphere the * purpose and declared * of the federal government was to occupy and possess the property belonging to the united states yet one of the first acts was to set fire to the * at harpers ferry virginia the only * of the kind in the southern states and the only southern * of the * which the general government had then on hand what conclusion is to be drawn from such action to avoid * a * of solemn * it must be supposed that virginia was considered as out of the union and a public enemy in whose * it was proper to destroy whatever might be useful to her of the common property of the states * united as soon as the united states troops had * the place the citizens and * went to work to save the * as far as possible from destruction and to secure valuable material * in it the master * * ball so bravely and * directed these efforts that a large part of the * and * was saved from the flames the * of the fire was a dangerous and difficult task and great credit is due to those who under the orders of master * ball attempted and * it when the fire was * the work was continued and * in until all the valuable * and material had been collected * and * to richmond about the end of the summer of 1861 the * thus secured was divided between the * at richmond virginia and * north carolina and when * and put in working condition * to some extent the want which existed in the south of means for the * and * of old or * arms and finally * to * the very * supply of arms with which our country was furnished when the war

the storm goes down in the calm the master * soon after he took his quiet post at * was found dead in his bed the difficulties which on every side met the several * of the executive * of the

the civil service as well as for the armies in the field already has the report of general st john * of * of the operations of that department just before the close of the war exposed the * of many * pictures intended to * * * or utter * on the executive the * and expected * of other * of * will silence like * on each so far as they are made by those who are not * blind or * * on the * of * if any further evidence had been required to show that it was the determination of the northern people not only to make no * to the * of the southern states but to * them to the last * it was furnished by the * of president lincoln issued on april # 1861 this * which has already been mentioned * a further examination as it was the official declaration on the part of the government of the united states of the war which ensued in it the president called for * thousand men to * * opposed to the laws and * their execution in seven sovereign states which had retired from the union * thousand men organized and * are a powerful army and when raised to * against these states nothing else than war could be intended the words in which he * this force were these * the laws of the united states have been for some time past and now are opposed and the execution * * in the states of south carolina georgia alabama * mississippi louisiana and texas by * too powerful to be * by the ordinary course of * * or by the powers * in the * by law now therefore i * lincoln by * of the power in me * by the constitution and laws etc the power granted in the constitution is thus expressed the congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the * to * the laws of the union * * and * * it was to the congress not the executive to whom the power was delegated and thus early was commenced a long * of * of powers * with the purposes for which the union was formed and * of the * it was * to * on november # # the legislature of south carolina assembled and gave the vote of the state for * of a president of the united states on the next day an act was passed calling a state convention to * on december #* to * the question of the * of the state from the united states * for * were immediately * all were in favor of secession the convention assembled on december #* and on the #* passed an * to * the union between the state of south carolina and other states united with her under the compact * the constitution of the united states of america the * began with these words we the people of the state of south carolina in convention assembled do * and * etc the state authorities immediately * to this action of the convention and the laws and authority of the united states ceased to be * within the limits of the state about four months afterward when the state in union with others which had joined her had possessed herself of the forts within her limits which the united states government had refused to * president lincoln issued the * * the state of south carolina is * in the * as a * too powerful to be * by the ordinary course of * * or by the powers * in the * by law this * does not recognize the state or * any consciousness of its existence * south carolina was one of the colonies that had declared her independence and after a long and bloody war she had been recognized as a sovereign state by great * the only power to which she had ever * allegiance the fact that she had been one of the colonies in the original congress had been a member of the confederation and subsequently of the union * but surely can not * her claim to be a state though president lincoln * her as a * it did not make her a * though he refused to recognize her as a state it did not make her any less a state by assertion he attempted to * seven states and the war which followed was to * the * * and to * the * of the general government on the * of the * independence of the states by * the state as a * and * that under such a name it might be in a condition of * he assumed to have authority to * a great military force and attack the state yet even if the fact had been as assumed if an * had existed the president could not * have * the power he * from such condition of affairs the provision of the constitution is as follows the united states shall * to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature can not be * against domestic * so the * * not at all to * the act which it was presented to * fact being that a state and not an * * as asserted was the object of assault and the case one of making war for a state or union of states to attack with military force another state is to make war by the constitution the power to make war is given * to congress congress shall have power to * war says the constitution and again to * and support armies thus under a * use of language the executive at washington did that which he * had no power to do under a faithful * of the constitution to * himself to congress and the people or rather before the face of * for this * of the constitution of his country president lincoln in his message to congress of july # 1861 * to the * of saying it meaning the * of the confederate states * to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional * or * government of the people by the same * or can not maintain its * * against its own domestic * the answer to this question is very plain in the nature of things no union can be formed except by separate independent and * parties any other * is not a union and upon the destruction of any of these * in the parties the union * * * if the government is the result of a union of states then these states must be separate sovereign and * to be able to form a union which is entirely an act of their own * such a government as ours had no power to maintain its existence any longer than the * parties pleased to * because it was * on the great principle of * * and organized to * justice and * domestic * any departure from this principle by the general government not only * and * its nature but * a just cause to the * state to withdraw from the union a new union might subsequently be formed but the original one could never by * be restored any effort on the part of the others to force the * state to consent to come back is an attempt at * it is a wrong which no * of time or * of circumstances can ever make right a forced union is a political * no less * is president * effort to * the sovereignty of the people from that of the state as if there could be a state without a people or a sovereign people without a state but the question which mr lincoln * to the whole family of man * a further notice the answer which he seems to * would be given by the whole family of man is that such a government as he * can maintain its * * against its own domestic * and therefore he * that he was right in the judgment of the whole family of man in * * against us he says so * the issue no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government that is the power to make war against foreign nations for the government has no other war power * himself on this position he commenced the * and * which followed to effect our * nothing could be more * than such views the supposed case which he * is entirely * the real case the government of the united states is like no other government it is neither a constitutional * or * nor has it ever been thus called neither is it a government of the people by the same people but it is known and * as the government of the united states it is an * among * its authority * * of certain powers delegated to it as a common agent by an association of sovereign and independent states these powers are to be * only for certain * * and the purposes declared in the beginning of the * or * of * were to form a more perfect union * justice * domestic * provide for the common defense * the general * and secure the * of liberty to ourselves and our * the beginning and the end of all the powers of the government of the united states are to be found in that * of * all its powers are there expressed * and limited it was only to that * mr lincoln as president should have gone to learn his duties that was the * which he had just * * himself to the country faithfully to follow he soon * * from * * * was his course the administration of the affairs of a great people at a most * period is decided by the answer which it is assumed the whole family of man would give to a supposed condition of human affairs which did not * and which could not * this is the ground upon which the * of his cause was placed he says no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its * here he says no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government for what purpose must he call out this war power he * by saying and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its * but this which he * is not a fact there was no force employed for its destruction let the reader turn to the record of the facts in part * of this work and * the * efforts for peace which were made by us and which mr lincoln did not * to notice the assertion is not only * in * that force was employed by us but also in * that it was for the destruction of the government of the united states on the contrary we wished to leave it alone our separation did not * its destruction to such * was mr lincoln compelled to * to give even * justice to his cause he now goes to the constitution for the exercise of his war power and here we have another * on april #* four days later president lincoln issued another * * a * of the * of seven * states which was afterward extended to north carolina and virginia it further declared that all persons who should under their authority * any vessel of the united states or the persons or * on board should be treated as * in their efforts to * us the destruction of our * was regarded by the authorities at washington as a most * measure it was early seen that although acts of congress established * of * where * existed they might be * and the * * closed or declared to be closed yet such a declaration would be of no * unless * by a * force as these * were * in territory not subject to the united states an act was subsequently passed * the president of the united states in his * to close our * but it was never * the scheme of * was * to and a * was asserted on which to base it mr seward writes to mr * you will say to lord john russell that by our own laws and the laws of nature and the laws of nations this government has a clear right to * * an * of * from national * which have been seized by * in the * form of * is a proper means to that end this is the same * of * * by the authorities at washington to serve as the * of a bloody revolution under the laws of nations separate * when at war * each others * this is decided to be * but the government of the united states could not consent to * its * of our * on this ground as it would be an * that the confederate states were a separate and * sovereignty and that the war was * only for * it therefore assumed that the * of the southern states from the union was an * was it an * when certain sovereign and independent states form a union with limited powers for some general purposes and any one or more of them in the progress of time suffer * and * * for which there is no * but in a * from the association is such * an * if so then of what advantage is a compact of union to states within the union are * and * and the attempt to go out * war and * the * and * states obtain possession of the * authority which having grown strong in the * of time * its entire sovereignty over the states * of them * it and * to retire is declared to be * of * its citizens are * as rebels as if they had * against a master and a war of * is begun if this action is once * where will it end where is the value of constitutional liberty what strength is there in * of * * of power what new hope for * is to be found in written * what * which did not * under * or * if the * thus announced by the government of the united states are * then look through either end of the political * and one * only an * and the once famous declaration of independence * in the dust as a glittering * and the compact of union * as a * lie those who * to such * without resistance are not worthy of the * and the rights to which they were born and * to be made slaves such must be the * of * men do not fight to make a * union neither do nations these military preparations of the government of the united states * nothing less than the * of the southern states so that by one * blow the north might grasp for ever that * it had so long * to be prepared for * i called congress together at * on april 29th and in the message of that date thus spoke of the * of the president of the united states apparently * as are the terms of this singular * one point is * evident the president of the united states calls for an army of * thousand men whose first service is to be the capture of our forts it is a plain declaration of war which i am not at liberty to * because of my knowledge that under the constitution of the united states the president is * a power granted * to congress i then proceeded to say that i did not feel at liberty to * the fact that many of the states seemed quite * to * to the exercise of the powers assumed by the president of the united states and were * engaged in * troops for the purpose indicated in the * * being * of the aid of congress i had been under the necessity of * my action to a call on the states for volunteers for the common defense in * with authority previously * on me i stated that there were then in the field at charleston * forts * jackson st * and * * thousand men and * thousand more were on their way to virginia that it was proposed to * and hold in * for instant action in view of the existing * of the country an army of one hundred thousand men and that if a further force should be needed congress would be * to for authority to call it into the field finally that the * of the president of the united states already * to * our soil capture our forts * our * and * war against us rendered it necessary to * means to a much larger amount than had been done to * the * of * independence and * invasion a brief * of the * affairs of the government followed and notwithstanding * * of the peaceful * of the * states had been made in the most solemn manner it was * not to be out of place to repeat them once more and therefore the message closed with these words we * * in the face of * that we desire peace at any sacrifice save that of honor in independence we seek no * no * no * of any kind from the states with which we have * been * all we ask is to be let * those who never held power over us shall not now attempt our * by arms this we will we must resist to the * * the moment that this * is abandoned the sword will drop from our grasp and we shall be ready to enter into * of * and * that can not but be * * so long as this * is * with a firm * on that * power which * with its protection the just cause we must continue to struggle for our * right to freedom independence and * at this * congress passed acts * the president to use the whole land and * force to meet the * of the war thus commenced to issue to private armed * letters of * in addition to the * force authorized to be raised to accept the services of volunteers to serve during the war to receive into the service various * of the different arms to make a * of fifty * of dollars in bonds and notes and to hold an election for officers of the * government under the new constitution an act was also passed to provide * from * another * to prisoners of war and such others as were necessary to complete the * organization of the government and * the administration of public affairs in every portion of the country there was exhibited the most * devotion to the common cause * * freely * the use of their lines for troops and supplies * for troops were met with such * that the number offering their services in every instance greatly * the demand and the ability to arm them men of the highest official and social position served as volunteers in the ranks the * of age and the * of youth * each other in the desire to be * in the public defense the appearance of the * of the president of the united states calling out * thousand men was followed by the immediate * of the states of virginia north carolina tennessee and * and their union with the confederate states the former state thus placed on the * and exposed to invasion began to prepare for a * defense volunteers were ordered to be * and held in * in every part of the state colonel robert e lee having resigned his commission in the united states cavalry was on april #* * and * by the state convention of virginia as commanderinchief of the military and * forces of the * already the northern officer in charge had * harpers ferry after having attempted to destroy the public * there his report says i gave the order to * the * in three minutes or less both of the * * containing nearly fifteen thousand stand of arms together with the * * which was at the upper end of a long and connected * of * of the * proper were in a * there is every reason for * the destruction was complete mr * * the secretary of war on april #* replied to this report in these words i am directed by the president of the united states to * to you and through you to the officers and men under your command at harpers ferry * the * of the government of your and their * conduct there and to tender you and them the thanks of the government for the same at the same time the * at norfolk was abandoned after an attempt to destroy it about midnight of april #* a fire was started in the yard which continued to * and before daylight the work of destruction extended to two immense * one of which contained the entire frame of a * ship and to the long * of stores and * on each side of the entrance the great ship pennsylvania was burned and the * * and * and the * * * and * were * a vast amount of * valuable * * and * was broken up and rendered entirely useless the value of the property destroyed was * at several * of dollars this property thus destroyed had been * and * with * care and * * during a course of years to * one of the * of the constitution which was expressed in these words to provide for the common defense see * of the constitution it had belonged to all the states in common and to each one equally with the others if the confederate states were still members of the union as the president of the united states asserted where can he find a * of these acts in explanation of his policy to the commissioners sent to him by the virginia state convention he said * to his * address as i then and * said i now repeat the power * in me will be used to hold occupy and possess property and places belonging to the government yet he * the thanks of the government to those who applied the * to destroy this property belonging as he regarded it to the government how * how blind with rage must have been that administration of affairs which so quickly brought the government to the necessity of * its own means of defense in order as it * declared to maintain its life it would seem as if the * that rule the * had taken possession of the authorities at the united states capital in the * of vast * the * destruction of public property and still more in the issue of * de * by the secretary of state who * of the power of his little bell over the personal * of the citizen the people saw or might have seen the rapid * toward * made under the * of * the union yet these and similar measures were * because the sectional hate * in the northern states over the higher * of constitutional and moral * the * state of maryland was the * of the south on the * first to be approached by northern invasion the first * against state sovereignty was to be made there and in her fate were the other * states of the * to have warning of what they were to expect she had chosen to be for the time at least * in the * war and had denied to the united states troops the right of way across her * in their march to * the southern states the governor * * a desire not only that the state should avoid war but that she should be a means for * those more disposed to * in combat judge * a distinguished citizen of mississippi who was born in maryland had in december # been sent as a * from the state of his adoption to that of his * and presented his views and the object of his mission to governor * who in his * december # # declared his purpose to act in full * with the other * states * i do not doubt the people of maryland are ready to go with the people of those states for * or * subsequently in answer to * for and against a * * the legislature in order to have a call for a state convention governor * issued an address in which * that there was no necessity to * the position of maryland he wrote if the action of the legislature would be simply to * that maryland was with the south in sympathy and feeling that she * from the north the * of * * * and * to it for new * that she will wait a * time for the north to * her * to do justice to her southern * and if her * are vain will make common cause with her sister * states in resistance to * if need be it would only be saying what the whole country well knows etc on the #* of april 1861 governor * issued a * * them to preserve the peace and said i assure the people that no troops will be sent from maryland unless it may be for the defense of the national capital on the same day * brown of the city of baltimore issued a * in which * to that of the governor above * he said i can not * my expression of satisfaction at his resolution that no troops shall be sent from maryland to the soil of any other state it will be remembered that the capital was on a * which * belonged to maryland and was * by her for a special use so that troops to defend the capital might be considered as not having been sent out of maryland it will be remembered that these * were three days after the * made by the secretary of war on the states which had not * for their * of troops to serve in the war about to be * against the south and that * existed at the time in baltimore that troops from the * were about to be sent through that city toward the south on the next day * the #* of april 1861 a body of troops arrived at the railroad * the citizens assembled in large numbers and though without arms * the passage through the city they attacked the troops with the * * found in the street which was * * and with such determination and * that some of the soldiers were wounded and they fired upon the * * a few and * many the * of baltimore were very active in their efforts to prevent conflict and preserve the peace they * the * and * of the troops which had been seized by the * and the rear portion of the troops was by direction of governor * sent back to the * of the state the troops who had got through the city took the railroad at the southern * and passed on the * of the city was called out and by evening quiet was restored during the night on a report that more northern troops were approaching the city by the * the bridges * to the city were destroyed as it was understood by orders from the authorities of baltimore on the #* of april president lincoln wrote in reply to governor * and * brown saying for the future troops must be brought here but i make no point of bringing them through baltimore on the next day the #* * brown and other * citizens by request of the president visited him the interview took place in presence of the cabinet and general scott and was reported to the public by the * after his return to baltimore from that report i make the following * * to the president the * * the following language the legislature of the state of maryland appointed commissioners to the confederate government to * to it the * of * * until the meeting of congress at washington in july commissioners with like instructions were also sent to washington in my reply to the commissioners * #* of may 1861 i referred to the uniform expression of desire for peace on the part of the confederate government and added on the #* of may the * house at the junction of the washington and baltimore and * * was occupied by united states troops under general butler and on the 13th of the same month he moved a portion of the troops to baltimore and took position on federal * was * the military * of baltimore on the next day * were received and on the same day the commanding general issued a * to the citizens in which he announced to them his purpose and authority to * between citizens those who agreed with him being * well disposed and the others described with many * * the * step of the policy subsequently * was found in one sentence therefore all * of arms and * of war are * requested to report to me * so that the * of their * may be known and understood and all * of their * * there soon followed a demand for the surrender of the arms * by the city authorities in a * the * refused to surrender them without the orders of the * commissioners the * commissioners upon * that the demand of general butler was by order of the president decided to surrender the arms under * and they were accordingly removed to fort * baltimore was now * the army of the united states had control of the city there was no longer necessity to regard the * of baltimore against sending troops through the city and that more * route was henceforth to be employed george p * * of the * of baltimore who had rendered most * service for the * of peace as well in the city of baltimore as at * point where troops were * to be * to washington was arrested at home by a military force and sent to fort * and a * was appointed by general banks who had succeeded to the command the excuse given for the arrest of * * was that he was believed to be * of * of men waiting for an opportunity to unite with those in * against the united states government whether the * were well or ill * it * a poor excuse for * a citizen of his liberty without * * and without proof but this was only the beginning of * * and a * of terror the * and * commissioners charles * william h * and john w davis held a meeting and after preparing a * against the * of their * in the appointment of a * resolved that while they would do nothing to * the execution of such measures as majorgeneral banks may * proper to take on his own responsibility for the * of the peace of the city and of public order they can not * with their views of official duty and of the * of their * of office recognize the right of any of the officers and men of the * force as such to receive orders or * from any other authority than from this board and that in the opinion of the board the * * of their * * at the same time the active operations of the * law the * with the * powers * upon him commenced a system of search and * in private houses of arms and * of every description on the 1st of july general banks announced that in * of orders issued from the headquarters at washington for the * of the public peace in this department i have arrested and do * in * of the united states the late members of the board of * charles * william h * charles d * and john w davis if the object had been to preserve order by any proper and * * the * means would * have been to * upon men whose influence was known to be great and whose * was certainly * the * of the commissioners i knew well he was of an old maryland family * for their public services and himself * by every social * old * * gentle loving he was beloved by the people among whom his long life had been passed could such a man be the just object of * if when laws had been * * could * arrest and * those who knew him will accept as a just description * * of the most * became the rule in a land where freedom of speech was held to be an * right freedom of thought ceased to * and men were * for opinions sake in the maryland legislature the * s * * from a committee to whom was referred the * of the * commissioners arrested in baltimore made a report upon the * of the act and * in the most earnest manner to the whole people of the country of all parties * and opinions to take * by the * mentioned and come to the * of the free * of the country for no better reason so far as the public was informed than a vote in favor of certain resolutions general banks sent his * to * where the legislature was in * a * of * was placed around the town to prevent any one from leaving it without a written permission from a member of general * staff * * from baltimore then went into the town and arrested some twelve or thirteen members and

constitutional rights of citizens was among those arrested henry may a member of congress who had introduced a resolution which he hoped would be * of peace was another of those arrested and thrown into prison senator * of the same state presented a report of the legislature to the united states senate * the * * upon maryland in the persons of her * officers and citizens and after some opposition merely obtained an order to have it * governor * whose * had been so cheering in the beginning of the year sent his final message to the legislature on december # 1861 in that * to the action of the maryland legislature at its several * before that when the arrest of its members prevented an organization he wrote this continued until the general government had * reason to believe it was about to go through the * of * an * of secession when the * was * stopped by the * of the * after * to the * of the 13th of june and the #* of november he says the people have declared in the most

the conclusion is * that he kept himself in * and fell at last as men without * usually do upon the stronger side henceforth the story of maryland is sad to the last degree only relieved by the gallant men who left their homes to fight the battle of state rights when maryland no longer furnished them a field on which they could maintain the rights their fathers left them this was a fate * sad to the sons of the heroic men who under the * of the maryland line did so much in our * struggle to secure the independence of the states of the men who at a later day fought the battle of north point of the people of a land which had furnished so many * and * and gave the great * * to the supreme court of the united states though maryland did not become one of the confederate states she was * to the people * by many most * * last in order but first in * were the tender * of her noble daughters to the sick and wounded prisoners who were carried through the streets of baltimore and it is with shame we remember that * * on several occasions * * upon * who approached these suffering prisoners to offer them the relief of which they so evidently stood in need the * of northern forces at and near washington city made it evident that the great effort of the invasion would be from that point while * of more or less * might be expected upon all important places which the enemy by his * for * could reach the * of confederate troops in virginia was begun and they were sent forward as rapidly as * to the points threatened with attack it was soon * that besides the army at washington which threatened virginia there was a second one at * pennsylvania under majorgeneral * * to move through * and martinsburg and another forming in * under the command of majorgeneral mcclellan destined to * the western * of virginia this latter force having * at * on may #* advanced as far as * on the 29th at this time colonel * with the small force of seven hundred men sent forward by governor * of virginia was at * on the night of june 2d he was attacked by general mcclellan with a strong force and withdrew to * hill * under general garnett were sent forward and occupied the hill while colonel * the second in command held rich mountain on july #* the latter was attacked by two columns of the enemy and after a vigorous defense fell back on the 12th losing many of his men who were made prisoners general garnett hearing of this * attempted to fall back but was pursued by mcclellan and while * to * his rear guard was killed five hundred of his men were taken prisoners this success left the northern forces in possession of that region the difficult character of the country in which the battle was fought as well from mountain * as dense wood rendered a minute knowledge of the roads of vast importance there is reason to believe that * * led the enemy by roads unknown to our army to the flank and rear of its position and thus caused the sacrifice of those who had * come to * the invasion of the very people who furnished the * to the enemy it was * * the * of the brave thus occurred the disaster of rich mountain and * hill general robert garnett was a native of virginia and a * of the united states military * he served in mexico on the staff of general * taylor and was conspicuous for * and good conduct especially in the battles of * and * * * his allegiance as due to the state of virginia from which he was appointed a * and thence won his various * in the army he resigned his commission when the state withdrew from the union and earnestly and * served as * to general r e lee the commanderinchief of the army of virginia until she * to the confederacy when western virginia was * he offered his services to go to her defense and * * on the sentiment so strong in his own heart of devotion to the state by all * he believed it was only * for him to have a * around which the people could * to resist the invasion of their country how sadly he was disappointed and how bravely he * against * fortune and how * he died in the * of his duty are memories which though sad bear with them to his friends the * that the manner of his death was worthy of the way in which he lived and that even his life was an offering he was not * to make for the * and honor of virginia he fell while commanding the rear guard to save his retreating army thus * the highest * of man * for others and such devotion and * as made * the * figure in * retreat from * the * congress in * at * alabama on the #* of may 1861 resolved that this congress will * on * next to meet again on the #* day of july at richmond virginia the resolution further authorized the president to have the several executive * with their * removed at such * time as he might * and added a * that if any public * should render it * to meet in richmond he should call the congress together at some other place to be selected by him the * * of the united states government against virginia caused the president at an early day after the * of congress to proceed to richmond and to direct the executive * with their * to be removed to that place as soon as could be * done in the message delivered to the congress at its meeting in richmond according to * i gave the following explanation of my conduct under the resolution above * immediately after your * the * movement of the enemy required prompt * action the * of his forces on the potomac sufficiently * that his efforts were to be directed against virginia and from no point could necessary measures for her defense and protection be so * decided as from her own capital on my arrival in richmond general r e lee as commander of the army of virginia was found there where he had established his headquarters he possessed my * confidence both as a soldier and a * and the command he had * over the army of virginia before her * to the confederacy gave him that special knowledge which at the time was most * as has been already * stated troops had previously been sent from other states of the confederacy to the aid of virginia the forces there assembled were divided into three armies at positions the most important

under generals * and magruder at norfolk and on the * between the james and york * * the approach to richmond from the * the first and second of these armies though separated by the blue ridge had

he had for that purpose fired the * before his * of the post the * of general * commanding the federal army in that region caused general johnston earnestly to * on being allowed to retire to a

small force was engaged for five and a half hours with four and a half regiments of the enemy at * church nine miles from hampton the enemy made three * and * charges but were repulsed with heavy loss our cavalry pursued them for six miles when their retreat became a * * on the other side * * colonel of third regiment of the enemys forces after * with much * the orders and line of march * how about five or six miles from hampton a heavy and * fire of * and * was opened upon the regiment and how it was afterward discovered to be a portion of their own column which had fired upon them after due

subsequently the description * a company of my regiment had been separated from the regiment by a * * and marched in the * field in line with the main body not being aware of the separation of that

advance without knowing anything of the subsequent career of the colonel from whose report these * have been made or of the officers who opened fire upon him while he was marching to the execution of the orders under which they were all acting it is fair to suppose that after a few months experience such scenes as are described could not have occurred and these * have been made to show the value of military * in further * of the difference between the troops of the confederate states and those of the united states before either had been * in war i will * an affair which occurred on the upper potomac colonel a p hill commanding a brigade at * in western virginia having learned that the enemy had a command at the * bridge on the baltimore and * railroad decided to attack it and to destroy the bridge so as to * the use of that important line of the enemys communication for this purpose he ordered colonel john c * of the third tennessee volunteers to proceed with a detachment of two * of his regiment and two * of the * virginia volunteers to the position where the enemy were reported to be posted colonel * reports that on june # 1861 at # p m he moved with his command as ordered marched eighteen miles and at # a m the next morning found the enemy on the north bank of the potomac in some strength of infantry and with two pieces of artillery he had no * after * the order to charge was given it was necessary in the execution of the order to ford the river * which colonel * reports was * * in good order but with great enthusiasm as we appeared in sight at a distance of four hundred yards the enemy broke and fled in all * firing as they ran only a few * * the enemy did not wait to fire their artillery which we captured both guns * they were however * by the enemy before he fled from the best information their number was between two and three hundred colonel * further states that in * of orders he fired the bridge and then retired bringing away the two guns and the enemys flag and other articles of little value which had been captured and arrived at brigade headquarters in the evening with his command in high spirits good condition colonel a p hill the * brigade commander who directed this expedition left the united states army when the state which had given him to the military service of the general government passed her * of secession the * and * he * on this early occasion in the war of the states gave promise of the brilliant career which gained for him the high rank of a lieutenantgeneral and which there was nothing for his friends to regret save the honorable death which he met upon the field of battle colonel * the commander of the detachment was new to war his * had been those of peace and his home in the mountains of east tennessee might * have secured him from any * that it would ever be the * on which armies were to * and that he in the * of human affairs would become a soldier he lived until the close of the war and on larger fields than that on which he first appeared proved that though not * for a soldier he had * which * for that * the * and * of stuart afterward so distinguished as commander of cavalry in the army of

object of his campaign unless it was to * general johnston with his forces in the valley of the * while general mcdowell * by the * should make the real attack upon general * army at manassas however that may be the evidence finally became * that the enemy under general mcdowell was moving to attack the army under general beauregard the * had therefore * for that junction which was necessary to enable us to resist the * superior numbers of our * for though the most * and not * * * had been made to * both the armies of the * and of the potomac they yet remained far * than those of the enemy * them and made a junction of our forces * whenever the real point of attack should be * for this movement we had the advantage of an * line so that if the enemy should discover it after it commenced he could not * it by * the same * the success of this policy it will * be * * upon the time of execution for though from different causes failure would equally result if done too soon or too late the determination as to which army should be * from the other and the * time of the * must have been a difficult * as both the generals appear to have been unable to * it each asking * from the other on the 9th of july general johnston wrote an official letter from which i make the following * as soon as i became satisfied that manassas was the * point of the enemys movement i wrote to general johnston * him to make preparations for a junction with general beauregard and to his * and the difficulties he presented replied at great length * to * him that the troops he described as * a * march might be withdrawn in advance of the more * portion of his command writing with entire confidence i kept no copy of my letters and when subsequent events caused the wish to * to them i requested general johnston to send me * of them he replied that his tent had been * down and his papers had been scattered his letters to me which would show the general * of mine to him have shared the fate which during or soon after the close of the war * most of the correspondence i had * and his * * if still in his possession do not appear to have been * of sufficient importance to be * in his published narrative on the #* of july 1861 the following telegram was sent by the * the confidence * in general johnston sufficiently * by the important command * to him was more than equal to the * that he would do all that was * to * the order for a junction as well as to secure his sick and * for the execution of the one great purpose that he would allow no * question to * with that which was of * importance and for which he was informed all his * force would be needed the order referred to was the telegram * above in which the sending the sick to * courthouse might have been after or before the * force had moved to the execution of the main and only * part of the order all the arrangements were left to the * of the general it seems strange that any one has * this expression as meaning that the movement for a junction was left to the * of that officer and that the forming of a * * * have been * in the order all the * instead of * that word to its proper connection the route and * of * the general had no * on which to * a comparison as to the importance of his remaining in the valley according to his previous * or going where he was ordered by * authority it gives me pleasure to state that from all the * received at the time the plans of general johnston for * his * to form a junction with general beauregard were conducted with marked skill and though all of his troops did not * as soon as expected and needed he has * shown that the failure was not due to any * in his arrangements for their * the great question of * the two armies had been decided at richmond the time and place * on the enemy and when it was seen that the real attack was to be against the position at manassas the order was sent to general johnston to move to that point his letters of the 12th and 15th instant expressed his * about his power to retire from before the superior force of general * therefore the word * was in this connection the * of possible that it was at the time so understood by general johnston is shown by his reply to the telegram after general johnston commenced his march to manassas he sent to me a telegram the * of which as my memory * and the reply * was an * as to the * position he would occupy toward general beauregard i returned the following answer general johnston by his * to the * of general as well as his superior rank as a * over brigadiergeneral beauregard gave him * so there was no need to ask which of the two would command the whole when their troops should join and do duty together therefore his * as it was * in my mind * an anxiety not felt before lest there should be some unfortunate * or * between these officers when their forces should be united * the combat of the #* of july as the * of a battle i decided at the * moment to go in person to the army as has been * stated congress was to * on the #* of july to hold its first * at the new capital richmond virginia my presence on that occasion and the * of a message were required by * and law after the * of the message to congress on saturday the #* of july i intended to leave in the afternoon for manassas but was * until the next morning when i left by * accompanied by my * colonel j r davis to * with the generals on the field as we approached manassas railroad junction a cloud of dust was visible a short distance to the west of the railroad it * one raised by a body of marching troops and recalled to my * the design of general beauregard to make the rappahannock his second line of defense it was however subsequently learned that the dust was raised by a number of wagons which had been sent to the rear for greater * against the * of the battle the sound of the firing had now become very * so much so as to leave no doubt that a general engagement had commenced though that event had been anticipated as being near at hand after the action of the #* it was both hoped and desired that it would not * quite so soon the more so as it was not known whether the troops from the valley had yet arrived on reaching the railroad junction i found a large number of men bearing the usual evidence of those who leave the field of battle under a * they crowded around the train with fearful stories of a defeat of our army the railroad * announced his decision that the railroad train should proceed no farther looking among those who were about us for one whose * gave reason to expect from him a collected answer i selected one whose gray * and calm face gave best assurance he however could furnish no * our line he said was broken all was confusion the army * and the battle lost i asked for generals johnston and beauregard he said they were on the field when he left it i returned to the * and told him that i must go on that the railroad was the only means by which i could proceed and that until i reached the headquarters i could not get a horse to ride to the field where the battle was * he finally * to * the * from the train and for my * to run it as far as the army headquarters in this manner colonel davis * and myself proceeded at the headquarters we found the * general w l * and the * * of general * staff who * agreed to furnish us horses and also to show us the route while the horses were being prepared colonel * took occasion to * my * colonel davis of the * of going to the field and the * of such * on my part the horses were after a time reported ready and we started to the field the * soon became numerous and * as to the fate which awaited us if we advanced were not only * but evidently * there were however many who turned back and the wounded generally * upon meeting us i well remember one a mere * who supported on the shoulders of a man who was bearing him to the rear took off his cap and waved it with a cheer that showed within that slender form beat the heart of a * a spirit that would dare the * of * as we advanced the storm of the battle was * * and its fury became more faint when i met general johnston who was upon a hill which commanded a general view of the field of the * operations and * of him as to the state of affairs he replied that we had won the battle i left him there and rode still farther to the west several of the volunteers on general * staff joined me and a command of cavalry the gallant leader of which captain john f lay insisted that i was too near the enemy to be without an escort we however only saw one column near to us that * a doubt as to which side it belonged and as we were riding toward it it was suggested that we should * until it could be * with a * colonel chesnut dismounted so as the better to use his glass and at that moment the column formed into line by which the wind struck the flag so as to * it and it was plainly revealed to be that of the united states our cavalry though there was present but the * previously mentioned and from a statement of the commander of which i will make some * dashed * forward to charge the * was followed by the immediate retreat of what was i believe the last * of the enemys forces * their organization and showing a * to * the possession of the field of battle in riding over the ground it seemed quite possible to mark the line of a * flight here was a * there a * there a * or * a * etc as if the * had * himself as he went of all * to speed as we approached toward the left of our line the * of an utter * of the enemy were * and * the conclusion that the * of on to richmond had been changed to off for washington on the extreme left of our field of operations i found the troops whose * arrival had * * disaster and had so * * to our victory some of them had after * at the manassas railroad junction hastened to our left their brigadiergeneral e * smith was wounded soon after getting into action and the command of the brigade * upon * by whom it was * and * led to the close of the battle others under the command of general then colonel early made a rapid march under the pressing necessity from the extreme right of our line to and beyond our left so as to attack the enemy in flank thus * on him the * his * movement was * to * on us all these troops and the others near to them had hastened into action without supplies or * weary hungry and without * night closed around them where they stood the * * on a * field it was reported to me that some of the troops had been so long without food as to be suffering severe * and that no supplies could be got where they were i made several * to them all to the effect that their position was that best * to a pursuit of the enemy and that they should therefore remain there * that i would go to the headquarters and direct that supplies should be sent to them promptly general then colonel early commanding a brigade informed me of some wounded who required attention one colonel * was he said at a house not far from where we were i rode to see him found him in severe pain and from the * visible and * seemed to be threatened with * a man sat beside him whose uniform was that of the enemy but he was gentle and appeared to be * * he said that he had no * and did not know where to get any i found in a short time a surgeon who went with me to colonel * having the articles necessary in the case before leaving colonel * he told me that the man who was * to him might without * have retreated with his comrades but had kindly remained with him and he therefore asked my protection for the man i took the name and the state of the supposed good * and at army headquarters directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner the * will be told * it was then late and we rode back in the night say seven miles to the army headquarters i had not seen general beauregard on the field and did not find him at his quarters when we returned the promise made to the troops was therefore * to a * who said he would have the supplies sent out at a later hour when i met general beauregard and informed him of what had occurred he stated that because of a false alarm which had reached him he had ordered the troops referred to from the left to the right of our line so as to be in position to * the reported movement of the enemy against that flank that such an alarm should have been * and a night march ordered on account of it * how little the * of the victory was realized at a late hour of the night i had a conference with generals johnston and beauregard the * of the latter colonel * was present and sat opposite to me at the table when after some * conversation i asked whether any troops had been sent in pursuit of the enemy i was answered in the * upon further * as to what troops were in the best position for pursuit and had been least * during the day general * brigade was named i then suggested that he should be ordered in pursuit a pause ensued until colonel * asked me if i would * the order i at once * an order for immediate pursuit some conversation followed the result of which was a * of the order by myself so that instead of immediate pursuit it should be commenced at early dawn colonel * spoke across the table to me saying if you will send the order as you first * it the enemy wont stop till he * into the potomac i believe i remember the words very nearly and am quite sure that i do remember them * on the #* of march # i wrote to general beauregard as follows to this letter general beauregard * replied that his * was in new york in the hands of a friend to whom he would write for a copy of the order desired if it should be in said book and that he would also write to his * general * for his * of the order if it had not been * in the * on the #* of april general beauregard * to me the answer to his * in my behalf as follows general beauregard in his letter * the above wrote the account given * by general * of what occurred there * further pursuit that night * with my own * it was a matter of importance as i regarded it to follow closely on the retreating enemy but it was of no consequence then or now as to who issued the order for pursuit and unless requested i should not have * one * that the generals to whom the operations were * should issue all orders to the troops i supposed the order as * by myself had been sent i have found however since the close of the war that it was not but that an order to the same effect was sent on the night of the #* of july for a copy of which i am * to the kindness of that * gentleman soldier and * general * it is as follows impressed with the belief that the enemy was very superior to us both in numbers and * i had felt * that unless pressed he would recover from the * under which he fled from the field * on his * and * the contest therefore it was that i immediately felt the necessity for a pursuit of the * and insisted that the troops on the extreme left should * their position during the night of the #* as has been * stated in conference with the generals that night this subject was considered and i * an order for a movement on the rear of the enemy at early dawn which on account of the late hour at which it was given * very little from one for an immediate movement a * extraordinary for its * and * occurred on the morning of the * day so that over places where during the battle one could scarcely get a drink of water rolled * which in the afternoon of the #* it was difficult to cross from these and other causes the troops were scattered to such an extent that but few commands could have been assembled for immediate service it was well for us that the enemy instead of * in order so as to be * and again brought to the attack left hope behind and fled in * to seek for safety beyond the potomac each hour of the day following the battle added to the evidence of a * * of the enemy abandoned wagons stores guns * * and ammunition proved his complete * as far as our cavalry went no * force was met and all the * * the conclusion that the purpose of invasion had for the time been abandoned the victory though decisive and important both in its moral and physical effect had been * bought by the sacrifice of the lives of many of our * and best who at the first call of their country had rushed to its defense when riding to the front i met an * bearing general * * from the field where he had been mortally wounded after his patriotism had been * by conspicuous * of skill daring and * soon after i learned that my friend colonel * had * * with his * his faith in the * of our cause he had been the * of the committee on military affairs in the * congress and after the laws were * to provide for the public defense he went to the field to maintain them it is to such * and devoted citizens that a country is * for its * and honor as well in peace as in war reference has been made to the * of our troops after the battle and in this connection the following facts are mentioned in the afternoon of the #* with a guide supposed to be * of the positions at which the different commands would be found i went to visit the wounded and among them a youth of my family who it was reported to me was rapidly * after driving many miles and * very painful scenes but * finding the troops in the position where my guide supposed them to be and always disappointed in not * him i particularly sought i was at the approach of night about to * the search when * meeting an officer of the command to which the youth belonged i was directed to the * hospital to which the wounded of that command had been removed it was too late the soul of the young soldier had just left his body the * lay before me around him were many gentle boys suffering in different * from the * they had received one bright * youth from south carolina severely if not * wounded * to my expression of sympathy by the heroic declaration that it was sweet to die for such a cause many * spirits * to the father from that field of their glory the roll need not be * here it has a more * * than the pen can * * of a grateful people the victory at manassas was certainly extraordinary not only on account of the * of numbers and the * of our arms but also because of many other * under which we * we had no * troops and though our citizens were generally * in the use of * which with their high pride and courage might * for the want of * while in position these * * military * when * had to be performed under fire and could not make the * * equal to the * * * with which the enemy was * the * in artillery was still greater both in the number and kind of guns but thanks to the skill and cool courage of the * captain w * pendleton his battery of light * guns * * by the * whose * he had been proved more * in battle than the * * of the enemy the character of the ground brought the forces into close * and the * of the round * carried * into the columns of the enemy while the * of their * if they * their object * * into the ground the field was very * broken and * the * general had so recently arrived that he had no opportunity * to learn the ground and the troops he brought were both * with the field and with those with whom they had to * to all this must be added the * fact that the plan of battle as * * was entirely changed by the movement of the enemy on our extreme left instead of right and * as anticipated the operations therefore had to be conducted against the plan of the enemy instead of on that which our generals had prepared and explained to their * commanders the * with which the troops moved and the * with which our generals * their * plans to meet the * as they were * * them to the * so * * at the time by their * at large general johnston had been previously * to the highest * in our army and i * it but a * * for the services rendered by general beauregard that he should be * to the same * therefore i addressed to him the following letter the #* the day after the battle was spent in following up the line of the retreating foe and * the large supplies of arms of ammunition and other military stores the supplies of the army were on a * of such * * as to * the surprise of those accustomed only to our rigid * the * of an easy victory had caused many to come to the battle as to a * * and the * left behind them of the extent to which they had been disappointed in the * * the * of many * stories which were not without their value because of the * they contained as to the * of war and the * that usually follows vain * among the articles abandoned by the enemy in his flight were some which excited a just * and which indicated the * * of all the * of honorable * they were * the fit * of a * but not of a soldier who came to meet his * * to * these were reported to have been found in large numbers some of them were sent to richmond on the night of the #* i held a second conference with generals johnston and beauregard all the * of the day were of the most * character as to the * of our victory the large amount gained of fine artillery * and ammunition all of which were much needed by us was not the least * consequence of our success the generals like myself were well * with what had been done i * to them the * as to what more it was * to do they * as to their * to cross the potomac and to the further * as to an advance to the south side of the potomac general beauregard promptly stated that there were strong * there occupied by * which had not been in the battle and were therefore not * by the * which had seized the defeated army he described those * as having wide deep * with * which would prevent the * of the works turning to general johnston he said they have spared no * it was further stated in explanation that we had no * and * nor even the * * to make regular * if we had possessed both the time required for such operations would have more than * for general * army and other forces to have been brought to that * in such numbers as must have rendered the attempt with our present means * this view of the matter * on the * that the * and * described did actually * of which there seemed then to be no doubt if the reports which have since reached us be true that there were at that time neither * nor troops stationed on the south bank of the potomac that all the enemys forces fled to the north side of the river and even beyond that the * of the * army * the whole * of washington city and that no preparation was made or even * for the destruction of the bridge across the * it may have been as many have asserted that our army following close upon the flying enemy could have entered and taken possession of the united states capital these reports however present a condition of affairs altogether at * with the information on which we had to act thus it was and so far as i knew for the reasons above stated that an advance to the south bank of the potomac was not * as the immediate * of the victory at manassas what * would have been made and what results would have ensued from the * of our guns upon the south bank of the river to open fire upon the capital are * questions upon which it would be useless to enter after the conference of the #* and because of it i decided to return to richmond and * all the power of my office to * the strength of the army so as the better to enable it to meet the public need whether in * or * defensive operations as opportunity should offer for the one or the * of invasion require the other a short time subsequent to my return a message was brought to me from the prison to the effect that a * officer captured at manassas claimed to have a promise of protection from me the name was given * of * i had forgotten the name he gave when i saw him but * that i would recognize the person who had attended to colonel * and to whom only such a promise had been given the officer in charge was directed to send him to me when he came i had no doubt of his * and explained to him that i had directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner but that in the * of those wearing the same uniform as his some * or mistake had * for which i was very sorry and that he should be immediately * and sent down the river to the neighborhood of * * where he would be among his own people he then told me that he had a sister * a few miles in the country whom he would be very glad to visit permission was given him to do so and a time fixed at which he was to report for * and so he left with * of * for the kindness with which he had been treated in due time a * was received containing an account of his escape and how he had * about the * of richmond and made * of the * * the * was as great as if his * had been valuable which they could not have been as we had only then commenced the * works which were * as a system of * for richmond when the smoke of battle had lifted from the field of manassas and the * over the victory had spread over the land and spent its * some who like * * * the battle from * but in whom the * there ceased * asked why the * of the victory had not been gathered by the capture of washington city then some * friends of the generals commanding in that battle instead of the * task of * * the * one of * for the * failure their * * * perhaps with * against me induced the * that the president had prevented the generals from making an immediate and vigorous pursuit of the * enemy this as other stories had been was left to the * which time it was hoped would bring the sooner because it was expected to be * by the reports of the commanding generals with whom i had * on that subject immediately after the battle after considerable time had * it was reported to me that a member of congress who had served on that occasion as a * * to general beauregard had stated in the house of representatives that i had prevented the pursuit of the enemy after his defeat at manassas this gave to the * such official character and dignity as seemed to me to * it to notice not * given * i addressed to general johnston the following * which though * in its terms to the * was of such * as left it to his * to state all the facts connected with the * if he should choose to do me that justice or should see the public interest * in the * which as stated in my letter to him was that which gave it in my * its claim to consideration and had caused me to address him on the subject this answer to my * was * as to the charge which had been * * that i had prevented the immediate pursuit of the enemy and had * active operations after the battle of manassas and thus had caused the failure to * the proper * of the victory no * * was made by me as to the part i took in the * of the #* and #* of july but a general reference was made to them the entire silence of general johnston in regard to those * is * from the fact that while his answer was * * by the terms of my * as to pursuit he added a statement about a conference at fairfax courthouse which occurred in the autumn say october and could have had no * to the question of pursuit of the enemy after the victory of manassas or other active operations * connected the reasons stated in my letter for making an * naturally pointed to the * of the #* and #* of july but surely not to a conference held months subsequent to the battle and on a question quite different from that of hot pursuit in regard to the matter of this subsequent conference i shall have more to say * i left the field of manassas proud of the * of our troops in battle and of the conduct of the officers who led them anxious to recognize the claim of the army on the gratitude of the country it was my * duty to bear * to their * in every * form those who left the field and did not return to share its glory it was wished should only be remembered as * * a rule with all the information possessed at the time by the commanding generals the * of * our position while * * more easily * than the capture of the united states capital seemed to me so * as to require no other * than the * to which i have referred in connection with the conference of the #* of july it would have seemed to me then as it does now to be less than was due to the energy and * of our troops to * a want of * and supplies for a march of about twenty miles through a country which had not then been * by the * of war under these * and with such feelings i wrote to general beauregard as follows i had declared myself * and * with the conduct of the troops and the officers and supposed the generals in * of my efforts to aid them by * their force and * as well as by my * from all * with them upon the field would have neither cause nor * to * upon me in their reports and it was with equal surprise and regret that in this i found myself mistaken general johnston in his report represented the order to him to make a junction with general beauregard as a movement left to his * with the condition that if made he should first send his sick and * to * courthouse i felt * to put upon his report when it was received the following * upon the * of general * report of the battle of manassas i found that it contained matter which seemed to me out of place and therefore addressed to him the following letter as general beauregard did not think proper to * that portion of his report to which * was made it * when the entire report was * to congress the * of an * upon it * that part of the report which i considered * the congress in its * ordered the * of the report except that part to which the * referred thereby * * both the * and the portion of the report to which it * in this case and every other official report ever submitted to me i made neither * nor * that portion of the report which was * by the congress has since the war found its way into the press but the * which belonged to it has not been published as part of the history of the time i will here present both in their proper connection it has not been my purpose to describe the battles of the war to the reports of the

the * and object of my work i shall * or * from time to time the evidence of * * in those affairs as well to * * as to correct * from the official reports it appears that the strength of the two armies was confederate # men of all arms with # guns federal # men with a body of cavalry of which only one company is reported and a large artillery force not shown in the * statement of these troops some on both sides were not engaged in the battle this it is believed was the case to a much larger extent on our side than on that of the enemy he selected the point of attack and could * his troops for that purpose but we were * a line of some seven miles front and therefore * * for the purpose above stated * are * * from a narrative in the operations on the line of bull run in june and july

after that war * he returned to the practice of his * which he was * * when the * between the * caused the call of a convention to decide whether virginia should * from the union he was sent by the

which were sent to a friend and handed to me for my use the paper * date february # # after some * matter and * that his force consisted of three cavalry * the narrative * the * of general * command w l * states in a letter written at * texas on the #* of august # in regard to the field * of general * forces before the battle of manassas that as nearly as he could remember it was as follows * one * wagon to each company one for field and staff * one for ammunition one for hospital purposes two wagons for each battery of artillery twentyfive wagons in a train for * purposes one * for each regiment * belonging to general * army did not * until the day or probably two days after the battle if general johnston as stated had nine thousand infantry the field * reported above could surely have been * so as to supply this additional force and have rendered as general early states the * * * that the advance in july 1861 was prevented by want of * the deep anxiety which had existed and was * by the circumstances had * * among all * and in all * of our country on the day after the victory the congress then sitting in richmond upon receiving the * of the president from the field of manassas adopted resolutions * of their thanks to the most high god and * the people of the confederate states to offer up their united * and praise for the mighty * the resolutions also * the

be * the names of the gallant dead as the * of free and constitutional liberty if * * at our success * an * confidence it also * increased desire to enter the military service and but for our want of arms and * we could have * an army little short of the number of * men in the confederate states i have given so much space to the battle of manassas because it was the first great action of the war * intense feeling and * important moral results among the people of the confederacy and further because it was made the * of * and * reflection upon the chief executive which certainly had no * * in the

the resolutions of # have been referred to as the final judge of * of their compact and of the * which should be applied kentucky made no decision * to this right of a state but she declared in the * conflict between the states * from and those * to the federal government that she would hold the position of * if the question was to be settled by a war of words that was * but if the conflict was to

the * the following correspondence took place in august between governor * of kentucky and president * between the governor and myself as president of the confederate * to the * of the state movements by the federal forces in * kentucky revealed such * as made it absolutely necessary that general * commanding the confederate forces in that section should immediately occupy the town of * kentucky a position of much * importance on the shore of the mississippi river that position was * important because it commanded the opposite shore in missouri and was the * on the * of tennessee two states of the confederacy were therefore threatened by the anticipated movement of the enemy to get possession of * majorgeneral * therefore crossed the state line took possession of * on september #* and on

first entered * they found the * had been in alarm from * of the united states forces but that they felt no dread of the confederate troops as far as the truth could be * a decided majority of the

why did such men as these * themselves and surrender all the * which they had won by a life of honorable effort in the land of their * to such * the answer must be the * of the general government * to them the * of constitutional liberty the * which * them may best be learned from the * * from the statement made in the address of mr * to the people of kentucky whom he had represented in both houses

states secretary of state i have thus presented the case of kentucky not because it was the only state where false * * the people into * * until by * * * had bound them hand and foot and where * power crushed all the * of civil liberty which the union was formed to secure but because of the attempt which has been noticed to * the confederacy for invasion of the state in * of her sovereignty the * of * by the confederate forces was only just soon enough to * the * purpose of the federal government all of which was plainly set forth in the letter of general * to the governor of kentucky and his subsequent letter to the kentucky commissioners missouri like kentucky had wished to preserve peaceful relations in the contest which it was * would soon * between the northern and the southern states when the federal government denied to her the privilege of * her own position which * no * to the general government and she was driven to the necessity of * whether or not her citizens should be used for the * of the southern states her people and their * the state government * the * * of authority by military force to control her government and her people among other acts of invasion the federal troops had occupied * a village in missouri opposite to * and with artillery threatened that town * terror in its peaceful * after the * of * under these circumstances of full * a small confederate force colonel * * regiment and * battery were thrown across the mississippi to occupy and hold the village in the state of missouri then an * and soon to become a member of the confederacy on the #* of november general grant left his headquarters at * with a land and * force and * on the kentucky shore this act and a * made by * from his force at * were probably intended to * the belief that he * an attack on * thus * his real purpose to surprise the small garrison at * general * on the morning of the #* discovered the landing of the federal forces on the missouri shore some seven miles above

was * * and with * fortune for several hours the enemys front so far * the length of our line as to enable him to attack on both * and our troops were finally driven back to the bank of the river with

the * force one would naturally suppose that the question about which there would be the greatest * would be the number of troops engaged in a battle yet there is nothing in regard to which we have such * * it is * * from the * reports that the enemy attacked us on both * and that in the beginning of the action we were * but the * with which the conflict was * and the * * and * which occurred in

subsequent battles of the war six hours of * combat with repeated * must place this in the rank of the most * * and the * must * to the * the * of having fought like * one of the results of the battle which is at least * is the fact that general grant who had * refused to recognize general * as one with whom he could exchange prisoners did after the battle send a flag of * to get such * as are

and most of his life had been spent in the army he had not * such study of political affairs as * * to the citizen of a * and * the issue made between states * the right to * the powers they had delegated to a general agent and the * set up by that agent to * states his * and for whom he held a trust he was a native of kentucky but his first military appointment was from louisiana and he was a * in the war for independence by texas and for a time * in that state much of his military service had been in the west and he felt most * with it on the #* of september 1861 he was assigned to command our department of the west which * the states of tennessee missouri * the * country and the western part of mississippi general johnston on his arrival at * found that he * not only men but the * of war and the means of * them men were ready to be * but the arms and * had nearly all been required to fit out the first * immediately on his * of the situation he determined to occupy * green in kentucky and ordered brigadiergeneral s b * with five thousand men to take possession of the position this invasion of kentucky was an act of * rendered necessary by the action of the government of kentucky and by the * of intended movements of the forces of the united states it was not possible to withdraw the troops from * in the west nor from * ford in the east to which general felix * * had advanced with four thousand men a * with the * of kentucky would have opened the * of tennessee and the mississippi river to the enemy besides it was * to the defense of tennessee east of * fort henry fort * and * were * with small bodies of troops and the territory between * and * green was occupied by moving * which caused the * that a large military force was present and * an advance a * camp was established at * gap as the right of general * line and an important point for the protection of east tennessee against invasion thus general johnston * his line of defense from * on the west to the * mountains on the east with his * at * green which was occupied and * it was a good base for military operations was a proper * for supplies and if * could be held against * superior numbers on october #* general johnston took command at * green he states his force to have been twelve thousand men and that the enemys force at that time was * to be double his own or * thousand he says the enemys force increased more rapidly than our own so that by the last of november it * fifty thousand and continued to * until it ran up to between * and one hundred thousand my force was kept down by * so that it * about * thousand the chief anxiety of the commander of the department was to * arms and men on the next day after his arrival at * he wrote to the governor of alabama i shall beg to * on your * to furnish us as rapidly as possible at this point with every arm it may be in your power to * mean * for infantry and cavalry the governor replied it is out of the power of alabama to afford you any assistance in the way of arms the governor of georgia replied to the same request on september #* it is utterly impossible for me to * with your request general bragg in command at * writes in reply on september #* the mission of colonel * will not be successful i fear as our extreme southern country has been * of both arms and men we started early in this matter and have * exhausted our resources on september #* general johnston * to me thirty thousand stand of arms are a necessity to my command i beg you to order them or as many as can be got to be instantly * and sent with * the secretary of war replied the whole number received by us by that steamer was eighteen hundred and we * of the * * hundred and * making in all * hundred * * of which we have been compelled to allow the governor of georgia to have one thousand for * troops to * an attack now * threatened at * of the remaining twentyfive hundred i have ordered one thousand sent to you leaving us but fifteen hundred for * several regiments now * here and who have been awaiting their arms for several months we have not an * to send you the whole * corps * only six * together with three * of whom one is on * duty you will be compelled to * the best material within your reach by * officers from other corps and by * civil * these details are given to serve as an * of the * existing in every department of the military service in the first years of the war in this respect much relief came from the * efforts of governor * and the legislature of tennessee a * * and * were established the * at * turned out about * * a day twelve or * batteries were * out at * laws were passed to * and pay for the private arms scattered throughout the state and the * efforts were made to * and * them to military * the * make it evident that during most of the autumn of 1861 fully one half of general * troops were * armed and whole brigades remained without * for months no less * were the measures taken to * and * his forces general * command was moved from * * and sent to * green which added four thousand men to the troops there the regiment of * * was brought from louisiana and * with horses and sent to the front five hundred * joined general * on his advance and five regiments were gradually formed and filled up a cavalry company under john h * was also added at this time september 1861 general johnston under the authority granted to him by the government made a * for thirty thousand men from tennessee ten thousand from mississippi and ten thousand from * the * troops were directed to be sent to general * for the defense of their own * the governor of mississippi sent four regiments when this * of supply was closed up to the middle of november only three regiments were * in under this call from tennessee but by the close of december the number of men who joined was from twelve to fifteen thousand two regiments fifteen hundred strong had joined general * in * five * and a * had been organized and were ready to join general * a * advance of the enemy was now indicated and an * of force was so necessary that further delay was impossible general johnston therefore determined upon a * en * in his department he made a * on the * of tennessee alabama and mississippi to call out every * member of the * into whose hands arms could be placed or to provide a * force large enough to use all the arms that could be * in his letters to these * he plainly * his view of the * of affairs on december #* points out * * and * that to his * the * had not been such as the * demanded he says on june #* general johnston was * by the brigades of * and * from western virginia he also sent a * to richmond to ask that a few regiments might be * from the several armies in the field and sent to him to be * by new * he said i do not ask that my force shall be made equal to that of the enemy but if possible it should be raised to fifty thousand men * such an appearance of * had been * as led the enemy to believe that our force was large and that he might be attacked at any time * and rapid * through the * settled country gave rise to * which kept alive this * to preserve the union in the spirit and for the purposes for which it was established an * between the states as * in * was * when the territory of missouri * applied for * as a state into the union the struggle between state rights and that sectional * which was * to destroy the existing * gave rise to the contest which shook the union to its * and * the * of * divisions which have borne the most * * that have * our political * again in 1861 missouri * to the constitution for the * of her rights and again did * and the blind rage of a sectional party * the appeal and * powers not only * but in direct * of the fourth section of the fourth article of the constitution which every federal officer had * to maintain and which secured to every state a republican government and protection against invasion if it be * that the invasion referred to must have been by other than the troops of the united states and that their troops were therefore not * from * a state against its wishes and for purposes * to its policy the section of the constitution referred to * the fact * noticed of the * of the convention when forming the constitution to * to the federal government power to * a state by its last * it was provided that not even to * domestic * could the general government on its own motion send troops of the united states into the territory of one of the states that section * thus surely if federal troops could not be sent into a state without its application even to protect it against domestic * still less could it be done to * the will of its people that instead of an * upon the citizens of other states to * to a call by the president for troops to * a particular state it was in april 1861 * a high crime to so use them reference is here made to the published * of the * of states which had not * to the * made upon them for troops to be employed against the states which had * governor * of virginia replied to the * of the united states secretary of war as follows governor * of kentucky replied governor * of tennessee replied governor jackson of missouri answered governor * of * replied governor * of north carolina * to the * for troops from that state as follows governor * who had lived long enough to leave behind him an * reputation was a fair * of the * * and * in * of the state over which he * he died too soon for his * good and the confederacy seriously felt the loss of his valuable services the prompt and * answer he gave to the call upon north carolina to furnish troops for the * of the southern states was the * * of his earlier action in immediately * to the federal government forts johnson and * which had been seized without proper authority in * his action to president * he wrote the * so constantly made by the * administration as an excuse for its

to property and what was of greater worth the lives the * and the republican * of the country there was great * in the condition of missouri to that of kentucky they were both * states and by their * and the * of a large portion of their citizens were * with the south both sought to occupy a * position in the * war and offered * of peace and order throughout their territory if left free to control

of * and * military * by the troops of the united states government at the * of this * * an effort was made by the governor of missouri to preserve the rights of the state without * its relations to the united states government if it had been the policy of the government to allow to missouri the control of her domestic affairs and an * from being a party to the * of the constitution in making war against certain of the states the * effort of the governor might and probably would have been successful the form and purpose of that effort appear in the compact entered into between majorgeneral price commanding the * or missouri state guard and general * of the united states army commanding the department of the west a * division which * the state of missouri during a * absence of general *

who had been assembled there by the governor for the defense of the capital against an anticipated attack by the troops of the united states those who desired to preserve peace in missouri had just

many believed because of his successful efforts to * excitement and avoid war * had been in * that the * were driving the union men from their homes and many letters * to be written in different parts of the state represented the * of union men it was * that many of them were written in st * or * by the * an incident * in * of the justice of this * is that general * received a letter from st joseph * that * * and a number of the most * men in st joseph had been driven from their homes and that unless soldiers were soon sent the union men would all have to leave he called upon the * f p * an * citizen of st * and asked him if he knew the writer of the letter the reply was oh yes he is perfectly * you can believe anything he says general * said he would write immediately to general price * was then * at such delay but two or three days later a letter from * * was published in the st joseph news in which was a marked * of the copy sent to general * neither i nor any other union man has been driven out of st joe an attempt has been made to * the conclusion that general * was relieved from command because of his * policy the * is that the order was * the #* of may and his * with general price was on the #* of the same month an * more * than fair as it appears from the letter of president lincoln of may # 1861 to * f p * that the order sent from the war department to him was to be delivered or * at his * and that it was not delivered until the 30th of the month and until after general * had not only entered into his * with general price but had declined to act upon *

of the rights of their * not satisfied with * the public arms from the limits of missouri the next step was that in * * of the constitutional right of the citizens to bear arms for their own defense

refused to * in war against her sister states of the south therefore she was first to be * and then to be made the victim of an invasion * by such * * as shame the * of the age the * she suffered the

fifty thousand volunteers and majorgeneral price took the field in command in this * governor jackson said in his * to maintain the peace of the state and to * if possible from its * a civil war he caused the * * to be made with the commander of the northern forces in the state by which its peace might be * that officer was promptly removed by his government the governor then upon the * of * * proposed at an interview with the new officer commanding the forces of the united states government to * the state guard and break up its organization to * all * that had been armed by the state to * himself not to * the * under the military bill that no arms or * of war should be brought into the state that he would protect the citizens equally in all their rights * of their political opinions that he would * all * movements within the state would * all * to * it from whatever quarter and by * made and would maintain a * * and preserve the peace of the state and further if necessary he would * the assistance of the united states troops to carry out the * the only conditions to this proposition made by the governor were that the united states government should * to * the home guard which it had * organized and armed throughout the state and * itself not to occupy with its troops any * in the state not occupied by them at that time the words of a governor of a state who offered such truly generous terms * to be * nothing but the most earnest desire to * the horrors of civil war from our beloved state could have * me to * these * terms they were * by the federal officers these demanded not only the * and * of the state * and the * of the military bill but they refused to * their own home guard and insisted that the government of the united states should enjoy an * right to move and station its troops throughout the state whenever and wherever it might in the opinion of its officers be necessary either for the protection of its loyal subjects or for the * of invasion and they plainly announced that it was the intention of the administration to take military * of the whole state and to * it as * by general * to the * condition of maryland we have already stated that the * measures which the united states government had * to * * the * of every state either by * * or * however much a state might desire peace and * its own will could not * the scheme demanded the * sovereignty of the government of the united states or in other words the * of the independence and sovereignty of the state human * are not only the * of the * * but they are also the evidence of the existence of that * thus when we see the governor of the state of missouri offering such generous terms to the government of the united states in order to preserve peace and * and the latter * them * its intention to do its will with the authorities the property and the citizens of the state and proceed with military force to do it its * are both the evidence and the * of its theory these measures were * in the extreme they * the entire * of those principles on which the american union was * and of the compact or constitution of that union the government of the united states in the hands of those who * its authority was made the bloody * to * these * on the * of the crushed hopes of * for * freedom under constitutional government for the * and * of these * i appeal to the * and * judgment of * the volunteers who were assembled under this * of governor jackson of june 13th had few arms except their * and * and could scarcely be said to have any military * the * who were appointed were assigned to * divisions and with such men as they could * reported in * to their orders at * and lexington on the #* of june 1861 general * and colonel f p * with an * force of seven thousand * troops having eight pieces of artillery * the missouri river and * about five miles below * to * them the * had there about eight hundred men * armed without a piece of artillery and but little ammunition with courage which must be * at the * of their * they resolved to * the enemy and after a combat of an hour and a half or more retired having * heavy loss upon the enemy and suffering but little themselves this first skirmish between the federal troops and the missouri * * confidence in their * and * the * terms in which the * had been spoken of by the enemy governor jackson with some two hundred and fifty to three hundred of the * engaged in the action at * started toward the * portion of the state he marched in the direction of a place called * camp and when within twelve or fifteen miles of it learned that a force of seven hundred to one thousand of the enemy had been sent to that point by general * and colonel * with the view of * his retreat the design however was * by an expedition * of about three hundred and fifty men commanded by colonel * who had assembled them in a very few hours in the neighborhood south of the enemys camp there were no * out except in the neighborhood of jacksons forces and colonel * surprised the enemy where they were asleep in two large * the attack was made at * the enemy * after suffering the heavy loss of two hundred and six killed and more wounded and more than a hundred prisoners three hundred and * * with * were captured the * lost four killed and fifteen or twenty wounded general price with a view to draw his army from the * of the enemy the missouri river ordered his troops to the * portion of the state the column from lexington marched without * without * or * and * for * on the country through which it passed being in the mean time closely pursued by the enemy the movement was successfully made and a junction effected in * county with the forces present with governor jackson the * when assembled was about * hundred men governor jackson continued his march toward * missouri he had received * intelligence that he was pursued by general * from the * and by * and * from the * their supposed object being to form a junction in his rear and he subsequently learned that a column * three thousand had been sent out from st * to * his retreat and had arrived at the town of * immediately in his front these * * armed * were therefore in a position which would have * less heroic * large * force in their rear and another nearly equal in numbers to their own * their passage in front they however * moved forward attacked the enemy in position and after a severe engagement * him pursued him to a second position from which he was again driven falling back to * where he made his last stand and upon being driven from which as was subsequently * continued his retreat all night the killed and wounded of the enemy left along the route of his retreat over a space of ten miles were * at from one hundred and fifty to two hundred killed and from three to four hundred wounded several hundred * were captured and the * were better prepared for future * our loss was between forty and fifty killed and from one hundred and twentyfive to one hundred and fifty wounded if any shall ask why i have entered into such details of * where the forces were * so small and the results so little * the final issue of the war the reply is that such * and * as these * partially armed * men * against superior numbers possessed of all the * of war claim special notice as bearing evidence not only of the * of the men but the * of the cause which could so * them * save by the consciousness of a just cause without other sympathy than that which the confederate states fully gave * the * of * and * the * of a

* the seat of government after authority was given by the * congress has been * stated but * to the main army of the enemy and the * * by which the new capital was threatened did not * the anxiety which had been felt before * from * in regard to affairs in missouri the far west of the confederacy the state which forty years before had been admitted to the union against sectional resistance to the right * by the constitution and * * in the * for the * of louisiana now because her governor refused to furnish troops for the * purpose of * states became the subject of special * and the object of extraordinary efforts for her * the little which it would have been possible for the confederacy to do to * her military * was * by the * condition in which the state troops remained until some

people it is due to that gallant soldier and true * that it should here be stated that he was not a party to any such * knew they were * and realized that his wishes for the defense of missouri were fully * by the executive of the confederacy all of which was * in the correspondence between us before missouri had * any troops to the confederate states it was his statement of the difficulties and * which surrounded him that caused me to write to the governor of missouri on the #* of december 1861 * to him my anxiety to have the troops of missouri * and organized into brigades and divisions so that they might be rendered more * and we be better able to provide for them by the appointment of general officers and otherwise for a full * of the nature and degree of the * and * referred to i here * my reply to letters sent to me by the * john b * * of missouri as is usually the case when citizens are called from their ordinary * for the purposes of war the people of missouri did not then

and that it * but little what position he occupied he said he was ready to surrender not only the command but his life as a sacrifice to the cause he surrendered the command and took a * position

forward with his mounted men arrived about * at * where he learned that the enemy had hastily fled about midnight he then decided to move with his whole force against lexington he found the enemy in

the enemy hung out a white flag upon which general price ordered a * of firing and sent to * the object of the signal the federal forces surrendered as prisoners of war to the number of * hundred also seven pieces of artillery over three thousand stand of * a considerable number of * a valuable supply of ammunition a number of horses a large amount of * stores and other property here were also recovered the great * of the state and the public records and about nine hundred thousand dollars of which the bank of lexington had been * general price caused the money to be at once returned to the

river advancing to * the garrison at lexington at the same time and from the same direction colonel * with about twentyfive hundred * was coming to the aid of general price general d r * who had long been a united states senator from missouri and at the time of his resignation was president * * of the senate was sent by general price to meet the command of colonel * and * them forward he joined them on the north bank of the river and after all but about five hundred had been * over general * still remaining with these they were * attacked by the force from * the ground was * * and partially covered with water the * led and * by one they had so long and * * met the assault with such determination and fighting with the skill of * and * that they put the enemy to * * him for a distance of

* of * the * in missouri which have been noticed and which so far * what might have been expected from the small forces by which they were * had caused an * of the enemys troops to an * number of * thousand against these the army of general price could not hope successfully to * he therefore retired toward the * part of the state the want of supplies and * compelled him to * a portion of his troops with the rest he continued his retreat to * by * of governor jackson the legislature had assembled at this place and had passed the * of secession if other evidence were * the fact that without * aid without a military * without * of war the campaign which has been described had so far been carried on by the * service of the citizens and the * * of the people must be * that the * of secession was the expression of the popular will of missouri the forces of missouri again formed a junction with the confederate troops under general * and together they moved to * in * county in june 1861 brigadiergeneral henry a wise who was well and * known to the people of the * valley in his enthusiasm for their defence and confidence in his ability to * them to resist the threatened invasion of that region offered his services for that purpose with a small command which was to serve as a * to the force he hoped to * he was sent * his success was as great as could have been * expected and after the small but brilliant affair on * creek he prepared to give battle to the enemy then advancing up the * valley under general * but the defeat of our forces at * hill which has been already noticed * his right flank and * his rear which was open to approach by several roads he therefore fell back to * brigadiergeneral john b * had in the mean time raised a brigade in * virginia and advanced to the support of general wise unfortunately there was a want of * between these two officers which prevented their entire * general * engaged the enemy in several brilliant * when he found that his right was threatened by a force which was approaching on that flank with the * purpose of crossing the * river at the * ferry so as to strike his line of communication with * he crossed the river with his brigade and a part of * cavalry leaving that general to check any advance which * might make general * movement was as successful as it was daring he met the enemys forces defeated and * them but the want of * between generals wise and * prevented a movement against general * * * himself on the * in a position of great natural strength but the small force under his command and the fact that he was separated from that of general wise probably induced general * commanding the enemys forces in the * mountain to advance and * the position though his numbers were * superior the attack was a failure after a heavy loss on the part of the enemy he fell back after * during the night * crossed the river and withdrew to the camp of general wise to form a junction of the two forces and together they fell back toward * mountain the unfortunate * between these officers which had prevented * in the past grew more bitter and each * of the other in terms that left little hope of future * and this want of * led to confusion and threatened further * general * had succeeded general garnett and was in command of the * of the force defeated at * hill his headquarters were at valley mountain general r e lee on duty at richmond * the president in the general direction of military affairs was now ordered to proceed to western virginia it was hoped that by his military skill and * influence over men he would be able to * the disaster we had suffered at * hill and by * all our forces in western virginia on one plan of operations give protection to that portion of our country such * as could be furnished had been sent to valley mountain the headquarters of general * * general lee promptly proceeded the duty to which he was assigned was certainly not * by the glory to be gained or the ease to be enjoyed but lee made no question as to personal * and whatever were his wishes they were * to what was believed to be the public interest the season had been one of extraordinary * * the * * difficult almost * with * purpose and energy he crossed the * mountains and * that the main * of the enemy was in the valley of * river and * run randolph county he directed his march toward that position the troops under the immediate command of brigadiergeneral h r jackson together with those under brigadiergeneral * were about * hundred men the force of the enemy as far as it could be * was very much greater in the * work at * mountain pass we learned by a * found upon the person of a captured * that there were three thousand men being but a * less than our whole force after a careful * and a full conference with general * lee decided to attack the main * of the enemy by a movement of his troops * upon the valley from three * the colonel of one of his regiments who had * the position of the works at * mountain pass reported that it was * to turn it and carry it by assault and he was assigned to that duty general lee ordered other * of his force to take position on the * * the enemys main * while he led three regiments to the height below and * to the position of the enemy the instructions were that the officer sent to turn the position at * mountain pass should approach it at early dawn and immediately open fire which was to be the signal for the * attack by the rest of the force it * heavily during the day and after a * * the force led by general lee * weary hungry and cold gained their position close to and * the enemys * in their march they had surprised and captured the * without a gun being fired so that no notice had been given of their approach the officer who had been sent to attack the work at * mountain pass found on closer examination that he had been mistaken as to the * of taking it by assault and that the heavy * which covered it was advanced beyond the range of his * not having understood that his firing was to be the signal for the general attack and should therefore be opened whether it would be * or not he withdrew without firing a * the height occupied by general lee was * in * and as morning had * without the expected signal he * that some * had * the force which was to make it by a * path he went down the side of the mountain low enough to have a * view of the camp he saw the men * of the near presence of an enemy engaged in * their arms * and other morning * then returning to his command he explained to his * officers what he had seen and expressed his belief that though the plan of attack had failed the troops there with him could surprise and capture the camp the officers withdrew * with their men and reported to the general that the troops were not in condition for the * as the * was then * and they would soon be revealed to the enemy below whose numbers were * superior to his own he withdrew his command by the route they had come and without observation returned to his camp beyond some * with * and * parties our troops had not been engaged and in these affairs our reported loss was * small colonel john a washington * of general lee was killed while making a * by a party in * the loss of this valuable and accomplished officer was much * by his general and all others who knew him the report that * and * had united their commands and were advancing upon wise and * caused general lee to move at once to their support he found general * at * * and general wise at * mountain the latter position being very favorable for defense the troops were * there to * the threatened attack by * who advanced and took position in sight of general lees * camp and having remained there for more than a week withdrew in the night without * the expected attack the weak condition of his * and the bad state of the roads made worse by the * army prevented general lee from * to * and the approach of winter always * in that * closed the campaign with a small but brilliant action in which general h r jackson * an attack of a greatly superior force * severe loss on the * and losing but six of his own command with the close of active operations general lee returned to richmond and though * to * * by the * who make * on assumed * he with * * made no defense of himself not even * an official report of his * in the * mountain but * he stated to me the facts which have formed the * of this * my estimate of general lee my confidence in his ability * and * rested on a * not to be * by such * as i have noticed i had no more doubt then than after his fame had been * established that whenever he had the opportunity to prove his worth he would secure public * therefore as affairs on the coast of south carolina and georgia were in an * condition he was directed to go there and take such measures for the defense particularly of savannah and charleston as he should find * lest the * attack should have * * and * * in regard to him i thought it * to write to governor * and tell him what manner of man he was who had been sent to south carolina after the * of the confederate army from fairfax courthouse and the positions which had been occupied in front of that place a movement was made by the enemy to cross the potomac near * where we had under the command of * general * s * of south carolina four regiments of infantry * the * * and * mississippi and the * virginia commanded * by * * * * and * a small detachment of cavalry under * * and some pieces of artillery on the #* of october the enemy commenced crossing the river at * ferry a brigade was thrown over and met by the * mississippi which held them in check at the point of crossing in the mean time another brigade was thrown over at * * and as troops continued to cross at that point where the * virginia had engaged them general * ordered up the * and * mississippi and the three regiments made such an * attack as to drive back the enemy to the * and their leader colonel * having fallen a * seemed to seize the command so that they rushed * down the * and crowded into the * which were their means of * in such numbers that they were * and many of the foe were * in their attempt to * the river the loss of the enemy prisoners * * the number of our troops in the action the confederate loss was reported to be * killed one hundred and * wounded and two captured * one hundred and * among the killed was the gallant colonel * a * citizen of mississippi where he had held high civil station and where his

at and about * * in comparison with the small means * for the defense of the capital on the north the most formidable army of the enemy was assembled to * it we had the * small army of the potomac this being regarded as the line on which the greatest danger was * our efforts were * directed toward giving it the * strength troops as rapidly as they could be raised and armed were sent forward for that purpose from the beginning to the close of the war we * * for the defense of the capital on its * citizens boys too young for service and the civil * of the executive * on several occasions these

this even led to the application for a detachment from it to * our army of the potomac which caused me to write to general j e johnston at manassas virginia on september # 1861 as follows then there and everywhere our difficulty was the want of arms and * of war * * came to us from the west for the supplies which would enable * citizens to defend their homes the * upon which the people had so * * the private arms in the hands of citizens proved a sad * and elsewhere it has been shown how * we were in ammunition or the means of * it the simple fact was the country had gone to war without * the cost * * over our victory at manassas was followed by * at what was * the failure to * the * of victory and * for which there could be no better excuse than * * were * that the * of the hour were prevented from * the * of the victory by the * of the president naturally there followed another * that the * of the * army to which * continued to be sent was due to the policy of the president and he also was held * and with more * justice for the failure to * the troops of the several states as the law * into brigades and divisions composed of the soldiers of each though these * * * the power

be * from me to others it will be the incident not the design as it would be most * to me only to notice for praise each and all who wore the gray the * of my having prevented the pursuit of the enemy after the victory of manassas was * after it had * an * and * form in the manner and for the reasons * set forth it only remains therefore to notice the other points indicated above first the organization of the army * and * are known to be the * of armies lying * in camps especially as in our case when the troops were composed of citizens called from their homes under the idea of a pressing necessity and with the hope of soon returning to them our citizen soldiers were a powerful political * and their correspondence finding its way to the people through the press and to the * of congress by direct communication with the members was felt by its influence both upon public opinion and general * members of congress and * the * * that men should be allowed to go home and attend to their private affairs while there were no active operations and that there was no doubt but that they would return whenever there was to be a battle the experience of war soon taught our people the * of such ideas and before its close probably none would have uttered them there were very many men out of the army who were anxious to enter it but for whom we had not arms this gave rise to the remark more * than profound that we stood around the camps with * to keep one set in and an other set out had this been true it was certainly * to refuse to exchange a * man for a * all who have seen service know that one old soldier is in campaign equal to several who have everything of military life to learn a marked * of the southern people was * and time was * to teach them that the terrible * a * army must be made of men who had surrendered their freedom of will the most distinguished of our citizens were not the * to learn the * and perhaps no army ever more thoroughly knew it than did that which lee led into pennsylvania and none ever had a leader who in his own conduct better * the * our * army in 1861 was that of the potomac it had been formed by the junction of the forces under general j e johnston with those under general p g t beauregard with such * as could be * sent forward to meet the enemy on the field of manassas they were * into brigades and divisions as pressing * required by the act of february # 1861 the president was authorized to receive * * and regiments to form a part of the * army of the confederate states and with the advice and consent of congress to * general officers for them and by the act of march #* the president was to * the staff and general officers among the * states from which the volunteers were received it will thus be seen that the states * surrendered their right to preserve for those volunteers the character of state troops and to * general officers when * a sufficient number of regiments to require such * for their command but in giving their volunteers to form the * army of the confederacy it was distinctly suggested that the general officers should be so appointed as to make a just * among the states * the troops during the * which followed the battle of manassas it was * proper that the regiments of the different states should be assembled in brigades together and as far as * with the public service that the spirit of the law should be * with by the * of * of the same state from which the troops were drawn instructions to that end were therefore given and again and again repeated but were for a long time only partially * with until the delay formed the * of the * that those who had by association become thoroughly * would more * be left united in the mean time * * came to me from the army of * * the law being * in regard to the troops of some states but not of others and of serious * * * the duty to obey the law was * and neither the executive nor the officers of the army had any right to question its * i however considered the policy of that law wise and was not surprised when it was stated to me that the * * to its execution was * the spirit to * in places to which * of such supposed * had been * about the 1st of october at the request of general johnston i went to his headquarters at fairfax courthouse for the purpose of conference at the time of this visit to the army the attention of the general officers who then met me in conference was called to the * * by law to * the troops when the numbers * by any state permitted it into brigades and divisions composed of the regiments * or * of such state and to * general and staff officers in the * of the troops thus received after my return to the capital the importance of the subject * so heavily upon me as to lead to correspondence with the generals which will be best understood by the following * from my letters to * are here * on the #* of may general * attention was again called to the organization of the ten mississippi regiments into two brigades and was * that the proposition had been made to him in the previous autumn with an expression of my confidence that the regiments would be more * in battle if thus * i will now proceed to notice the * that i was * for * by the army of the potomac in the latter part of 1861 and in the early part of 1862 after the * of the * that i had prevented the pursuit of the enemy from manassas in july 1861 my * have sought to cover their * by a change of time and place * their story at fairfax courthouse and * it in the autumn of 1861 when at that time and place i met general johnston for conference he called in the two generals next in rank to himself beauregard and g w smith the question for consideration was what course should be adopted for the future action of the army and the * * by me was as to the number of the troops there assembled to my surprise and disappointment the * strength was stated to be but little greater than when it fought the battle of the #* of the * july the * * which had been sent to that army in * prepared me for such an * to my * as to what force would be required for the * advance into maryland the * estimate made by any of them was about twice the number there present for duty how little i was prepared for such a condition of things will be realized from the fact that previous * by the generals in regard to a purpose to advance into maryland had induced me when i went to that conference to take with me some * made by the * soldier and * colonel * of the * of the potomac to show the * of crossing the river at that point very little knowledge of the condition and military resources of the country must have * to show that i had no power to make such an addition to that army without a * * of the safety of other threatened positions it only remained for me to answer that i had not power to furnish such a number of troops and unless the * bearing their private arms should be * on we could not possibly * such a * until after the * of the * which we had early and constantly * to * from abroad and had for some time expected after i had written the * and all the * * on * subjects a friend in october # furnished me with a copy of a paper * to the conference at fairfax courthouse which seems to require notice at my hands therefore i break the * of events to * here some * in regard to it the paper appears to have been written by general g w smith and to have received the * of generals beauregard and j e johnston and to bear date the #* of january 1862 it does not * in some * with my memory of what occurred and is not * with itself it was not necessary that i should learn in that interview the evil of * my correspondence of * date might have shown that i was fully aware of it and my * in the interview certainly did not look as if it was necessary to * me with the advantage of action in one part of the paper it is stated that the * asked for were to be * soldiers such as were there present and who were said to be in the * fighting condition this if such a proposition had been made would have exposed its * as well as the * it offered for escape by subsequently * that the troops furnished were not up to the proposed * in another part of the paper it is stated that there were hope and * that before the end of the winter arms would be introduced into the country and that then we could successfully * that of the enemy but this supply of arms however * could not furnish * soldiers and the two * are therefore * in one place it is written that it was felt it might be better to run the risk of almost certain destruction fighting upon the other side of the potomac rather than see the * dying out and * of this army during a winter etc but when it was proposed to cross into eastern maryland on a steamer in our possession for a * campaign difficulties arose like the * in the path of the * so that the proposition was * and never * in like manner the other expedition in the valley of virginia was * by an officer not of this council general t j jackson in one place it is written that the president stated at that time no * could be furnished to the army of the character asked for in another place he is made to say he could not take any troops from the points named and without arms from abroad could not * that army here again it is clear from the answer that the proposition had been for such * as additional arms would enable him to give those arms he expected to receive * the * of the sea and of the enemy which * alone prevented the * assurance that they would be received at all it was as stated with deep regret and bitter disappointment that i found notwithstanding our * efforts to * this army before and after the battle of manassas that its strength had but little increased and that the arms of * and * men were represented by only twentyfive hundred on hand i can not suppose that general johnston could have noticed the statement that his request for conference had set forth the object of it to be to * the question of * he would have known that in richmond where all the * were to be found any consideration of * by the * of troops from existing * could best be decided very little experience or a fair amount of * without any experience would serve to prevent one from * his conclusion that troops could be withdrawn from a place or places without knowing how many were there and what was the necessity for their presence i was at the conference by request the confidence felt in those officers is shown by the fact that i met them alone and did not require any minutes to be made of the meeting about four months afterward a paper was prepared to make a record of the conversation the fact was concealed from me * both for * and * it should have been submitted to me even if there had been nothing due to our official relations twenty years after the event i learned of this secret report by one party without notice having been given to the other of a conversation said to have * two hours i have noticed the * and * of the paper and without remark i * to honorable men the * from me in which it was prepared * they may judge of the * for such * as needs must * between the executive and the commanders of armies to * * success the position at fairfax courthouse though it would answer very well as a point from which to advance was quite * for defense and when i so remarked the opinion seemed to be that to which the generals had previously arrived it therefore only remained to consider what change of position should be made in the event of the enemy threatening soon to advance but in the mean time i hoped that something could be done by * from the army to effect * less difficult than an advance against his main force and particularly indicated the lower part of maryland where a small force was said to be * the country and * our friends this i thought might be * by the * of a battery near to * creek where the * of the potomac was said to be so narrow that our guns could prevent the use of the river by the enemys * and by * a * lying there troops enough could be sent over some night to defeat that force and return before any large body could be * against them the effect of the battery and of the expedition it was hoped would be important in * our friends and * * from those who wished to join us previously general * attention had been called to * in the valley of the * and that these and other like things were not done was surely due to other causes than the policy of the administration as will appear by the letters * * from the correspondence which occurred after the conference at fairfax courthouse i select a reply made to general smith who had written to me in * of the views he had then expressed about large * to the army of the potomac for an advance into maryland nothing is more common than that a general * the wants of the army with which he is * and the * that might be * if those wants were * should * the * of others and accept * of large forces which do not * and * the absence of danger elsewhere than in his own front in november 1861 reports became * that the enemy were * troops west of the valley of the * with a view to a * upon it that * * and * soldier general t j jackson whose * under fire at the first battle of manassas had * for him the * of stonewall was then on duty as * commander of the * valley he was a west * and though he had not * the fame which subsequently shed such * upon his name he possessed a * confidence among the people of that region ever * and daring in the * of any duty he was * anxious to guard his beloved mountains of virginia this * his devotion to the general * of the confederacy induced him to desire to march against the enemy who had captured * on the #* of november 1861 he wrote to the war department * an expedition to * in western virginia it was decided to * his proposition * by the commander of the department and further to * success though not * in the * his old brigade then in the army of the potomac was selected as a part of the command with which he was to make the campaign general johnston * against this * and the correspondence is * for a * * of the matter after general jackson commenced his march the cold became * severe and as he * into the * region the * were covered with * which * his progress the more because his horses were * but his * of purpose * and daring too well known to need * * over every * and he * his object drove the enemy from * and its * took possession of the place and prevented the threatened * having accomplished this purpose and being assured that the enemy had abandoned that section of country he returned with his old brigade to the valley of the * leaving the * of his command at * general * the * officer there present and many others of the command so left * to the war department to be withdrawn their * were as well as i remember these that the troops being from the south were * to and * for the * of a mountain winter that they were strangers to the people of that section that the position had no military strength and at the approach of spring would be * to the enemy by roads leading from various quarters after some * action an order was issued from the war office * the troops to retire to the valley as that order has been the subject of no little * both by civil and military * my letter to the general commanding the department in explanation of the act of the secretary of war is * * to * by general johnston that the * of his army was * with by * action of the secretary of war and its * strength * by * granted directly by the war department i replied after making * at the war office by a letter a copy of which is * * a * after this letter i received from general johnston notice that his position was considered * many of his letters to me have been lost and i have thus far not been able to find the one giving the notice referred to but the reply which is * clearly * the * of the letter which was answered at the conference at fairfax courthouse * referred to i was sadly disappointed to find that the strength of that army had been little increased notwithstanding the * sent to it since the #* of july and that to make an advance the generals required an additional force which it was utterly * for me to supply soon * the army withdrew to * a better position for defense but not for attack and thereby * of the * of an intention to advance the subsequent correspondence with general johnston during the winter expressed an * that the enemy would * the * and that the position then held was * * there was a general * at richmond that the northern * of virginia would be abandoned and a * * was exhibited to * the * force to enable our army to take the * on the #* of march i * to general johnston further assurance given to me this day that you shall be promptly and * * so as to enable you to maintain your position and * first policy when the roads will permit the first policy was to carry the war beyond our own * five days * i received notice that our army was in retreat and replied as follows on the same day i sent the following telegram to further * from general johnston as to where he should take position i replied that i would go to his headquarters in the field and found him on the south bank of the river to which he had retired in a position * great natural * an * bank commanded the north side of the river * the bridge and an open field beyond it across which the enemy must pass to reach the bridge which if left standing was an invitation to seek that crossing upon * whether the south bank of the river continued to command the other side down to fredericksburg general johnston answered that he did not know that he had not been at fredericksburg since he passed there in a stage on his way to west point when he was first appointed a * i then proposed that we should go to fredericksburg to * ourselves upon that point on * at fredericksburg a * soon * that the hills on the opposite side commanded the town and * * and therefore fredericksburg could only be * by an army * the opposite hills for which our force was * in returning to the house of mr * where i was a guest i found a number of ladies had assembled there to welcome me and who with anxiety * as to the result of our * upon * that the town was not considered * against an enemy * the heights on the other side and that our force was not sufficient to hold those heights against such an attack as might be anticipated the general answer was with a * patriotism too much * to be forgotten if the good of our cause * the defense of the town to be abandoned let it be done the purposes of the enemy were then unknown to us if general * * of a * advance in great force should be realized our course must * * upon receiving the * we had reason to expect from * previously given and renewed as was announced to general johnston in my telegram of #* of march 1862 in these words no immediate decision could therefore be made and i returned to richmond to wait the further * of the enemys plans and to prepare as best we might to * them the feeling * noticed as * in virginia a determination to resist the * of her northern * and which caused the assurance of * bore * in the addition of about thirty thousand men by a * made by the governor of the state these it is true were not the * * troops which were asked for by the generals in the conference at fairfax courthouse but they were of such men as often during the war won battles for the confederacy the * of the enemys plans for which we had to wait proved that instead of advancing in force against our position at * he had before the retreat of our army commenced decided to move down the potomac for a campaign against richmond from the * as a base the * at * gave notice of its * and an advance was made as far as manassas but as appears by general mcclellans report with no more important design than to attack our rear guard if it should be encountered in the report on the conduct of the war by a committee of the united states congress evidence is found of much * before the conclusion was finally reached of * the idea of a direct advance upon richmond for that of * their army at the mouth of the * whatever doubt or * continued to * about * the city of washington by * their main army from before it was of course * by the retreat of our army and the burning of bridges behind it in this * fact general mcclellan says he found the * reason to believe that there was no immediate danger of our army returning there was an * advantage to the enemy in the new base for his operations which was sufficiently * by the events of the last year of the war had we possessed an army as large as the enemy supposed it would have been possible for us at the same time to check his advance from the east and to march against his capital with fair * of * it before the army he had sent against * could have been brought back for the defense of washington on this as on other occasions he greatly * the force we possessed and on this as on other occasions it required the * of our troops successfully to resist a detachment of his * as a necessity the * of the main portion of our army from northern virginia to meet the invasion from the * it was * that earlier and more * means were not employed for the * of the army a * measure in either * of advance or retreat or at the least that the * was not so * as to secure the * of our * * and * stores which had been collected on the line occupied in 1861 and the early part of 1862 a distinguished officer of our army who has since the war made valuable * to the history of its * valuable as well for their * as for their freedom from personal or * * thus of the retreat from * the same * the value of his opinion will be recognized by all who know him * i give his name general j a * a communication subsequent to that from which i have just * writes in regard to the loss of supplies the enemys plans the * of which as has been already stated was necessary for the determination of our own movements were soon * found to be the invasion of virginia from the * and the * portion of our army was consequently ordered to the * between the york river and the james thus the northern * of virginia which in the first year of the war

efforts of the confederate government to maintain its existence at home may here be * added an incident bearing on its foreign relations in the first year of the war our efforts for the * of the confederate states by the * powers in 1861 served to make us better known abroad to * a kindly feeling in our favor and cause a * regard for the effort we were making to maintain the independence of the states which great * had recognized and her people knew to be our * on the #* of november 1861 an * was * by an armed vessel of the united states in the * * on the * of a british * steamer making

in time of peace the other * * of the country were at * * * thus * that there was no * of * at the same time the * on * had reached about twenty per cent but it had become * that the * of our country

the evil * of this * condition were but too * in addition to the difficulty presented to the necessary operations of the government and the * conduct of the war the most * of all its results was * its * influence on the * of the people the possession of large * of treasury notes led to a desire for * and with a constantly * volume of * there was an equally constant * of price in all * of * this

in december 1863 the * * of the * to the amount required by the business of the country accompanied by a * that under no * of circumstances would the amount be increased i stated that if the * was not greatly and promptly reduced the existing * of * * would not only continue but by the very fact of the large * thus made * in the conduct of the war these * would reach * still more * and the whole

would be made * to the * and the government would be in a condition beyond the reach of any probable * to * the war to a successful issue this * was followed by the passage of the act of february # 1864 above mentioned one of its features is the * * on the * * the government when * a * as the agent of the people its * is their * as the * was held * by ourselves it was * that if each person held

an amount sufficient to * it to its proper limits would afford the best of all * under such circumstances the notes remaining in the hands of each * after the * of his * would be worth quite as much as the whole * previously held for it would have an equal * capacity after this law had been in * for one year it was * that it had the desired effect of * from * the large * of treasury notes which had been issued on july # 1864 the * amount was * at two hundred and thirty * dollars the estimate of the amount * under this act about this time was three hundred * dollars while new notes were authorized to be issued to the extent of two * of the * received under its provisions the chief difficulty * in connection with our * up to the close of the war resulted from the * of our treasury
