secession mr chesnut is probably to be president of the convention i see all of the leaders in the state are in favor of secession but i confess i hope the black * will take the alarm and * some * of peace that will enable us now and forever to * the question and save our * from the * of business and the * of * that must come both to the north and south from a * of the union however i wont * before this * you south carolina may be off on her own * separate * mrs charles * was sitting with us today when mrs * brought in a copy of the secession * i wonder if my face grew as white as hers

working very hard here as i * on the sofa last night could hear the * * of my husbands pen as he wrote at the table until midnight after church today captain * called he left me so * he dared to

they have provided president davis with a house he was * with the * of * the president at the * in a * drawn by four white horses then some one said mrs * was the only lady who sat with the congress

president that a war steamer is lying off the charleston bar * with * for fort sumter and what must we do answer use your own * there is faith for you after all is said and done it is believed there is still some * left in south carolina fit for use everybody who comes here wants an office and the many who of course are disappointed * a cry of * against the few who are successful i thought we had left all that in washington nobody is willing to be out of sight and all will take office constitution * says he is going to washington for * hours i mean to send by him to mary garnett for a * * if they take him up as a * he may cause a civil war war is now our dread mr chesnut told him not to make himself a * of * everybody means to go into the army if sumter is attacked then jeff * * will

davis and * are getting up a very pretty little * the virginia * were * at the peace conference * said * out the judge thought jefferson davis rude to him when the latter was secretary of war mr chesnut * the judge to * his private wrong for the public good and so he * for him but now his old * has come back with an increased * what a pity to bring the * of the old union into this new one it seems to me already men are willing to risk an * to our cause if they may in so doing hurt jeff davis * today with mr hill from georgia and his wife after he left us she told me he was the celebrated individual who for christian * refused to fight a * with * she seemed very proud of him for his conduct in the affair * that i am i had not heard of it i am having all * of * drove today with a lady

in the congress to their own perfect satisfaction to my * the judge took me aside and after * a * upon himself but here later comes in the * he * my husband to the * and said he was the * man of all for a foreign mission * and the farther away they send us from this congress the better i will like it saw * * and * davis social * they are * leaders then george * and george * the * are of opinion that it is * to try to take back fort sumter from anderson and the united states that is before we are ready they saw in charleston the devoted band prepared for the sacrifice i mean ready to run their heads against a stone wall dare * they are they have * and courage enough but * only could take that fort they shook their heads the washington congress has passed peace measures glory be to god as my * * used to * every remark both great and small at last according to his wish i was able to * mr hill of georgia to mr * and also governor * and * the latter the only man without a title of some sort that i know in this * * * i have seen a negro woman sold on the * at * she * the crowd i was walking and felt faint * the creature looked so like my good little * a bright * with a pleasant face she was * * up in * and * she seemed delighted with it all sometimes * the * sometimes looking quiet * and * but her mouth never * from its * * of excitement i dare say the poor thing knew who would

women poor slaves * with his * did he know he only thought he did not feel in * * i read like a true english female she believed in her own * * but never trusted her husband out of sight the new york * says * carriage is not * so he does not drive out two * and a * of * have been sent him as gentle * the * are to break our heads with the english are * unhappy as to our family * * of them for it is their opportunity we stood on the * to see our confederate flag go up * of cannon etc etc miss * * so said captain * of the * of the * it was utterly * she said no cheering or so little and no enthusiasm captain * suggested that gentlemen are * to be quiet and this was a * crowd the true * * with us just now is * corn and yet it is * that the idea has gone abroad that we have no joy no pride in this thing the band was playing * in the cold cold ground miss * daughter of the former president of the united states ran up the flag captain * * out of his pocket some * sent to him by a boston girl they were well * and * to this she held a * ready to * him though she shed tears when she remembered his heroic * of * * the rebel she calls us rebels too so it * upon whom one rebels * to save or not shall be heroic i must read * * oh comes he in peace or comes he in war or to * but one measure as young * * * is to * the * states the people the * i mean are * that i * * in all truth and * that if there were awful things in society in washington i did not see or hear of them one must have been hard to please who did not like the people i knew in washington mr chesnut has gone with a list of names to the * * * * and robert * they are taking a walk i see i hope there will be good places in the army for our list judge campbell of the united states supreme court has resigned lord how he must have * to do it how other men who are * high positions must hate to do it now we may be sure the bridge is broken and yet in the alabama convention they say * * and are busy met a distinguished gentleman that i knew when he was in more * circumstances i was willing enough to speak to him but when he saw me advancing for that purpose to avoid me he suddenly * around a * mrs de * former * i remember him on his box driving a handsome pair of * dressed * in blue * and * * a * * * * * he was very high and mighty night after night we used to meet him as * of all our parties he sat in solemn dignity making faces over his bow and * his foot with an * that shook the floor we gave him five dollars a night that was his price his mistress never refused to let him play for any party he had * in * he was far above any physical fear for his * and * person how * he * his foot as a sign that he was * up and ready to begin now he is a * creature indeed he must have felt his fallen * when he met * who knew him in his * he ran away this stately yellow gentleman from wife and children home and comfort my * asked him why miss * was good to you i know i wonder who * him now he looked * governor * brought in to be presented to me the president of the alabama convention it seems i had known him before he had * with me at a * ball when i was in short * with * * and a * of roses he was one of those clever boys of our neighborhood in whom my father saw promise of better things and so helped him in every way to rise with books * sympathy i was * his conversation * for he was * my father without * when the judge came in * fire and fury congress has * his * we are * one another as * as ever we have * yankees it is * mrs childs was here tonight mary anderson from * with several children she is lovely her hair is * up on the top of her head * * from france still * into texas across mexican * mrs childs is fresh from texas her husband is an artillery officer or was they will

he tells us that washington society is not * to the yankee * mrs lincoln means to * she at once informed the * that they were poor and hoped to save twelve thousand dollars every year from their * of twenty thousand mr * said mr * farewell was far more * than * * the people were so * so full of western stories dr * * * all day he had been * driving about with us and never was man in * spirits tonight in this brilliant company he sat dead still as if in a * once he * * a high public * came in with a present for me a * * a perfect * * he assured me again and again in an * dr * * that fellow has been * why do you think so because he has told you exactly the same thing four times wonderful some of these great * always tell me the same * have been telling me the same thing ever since we came here a man came in and some one said in an * the age of * is not past o * * what do you mean that man was once * by president * for a foreign mission but some senator stood up and read a paper * by this man * of a woman and * by his name in full after that the senate would have none of him his chance was gone forever in full * tonight the drawingroom crowded with * * * generals * they were * john c * * he allowed everybody to stay all night who * to stop at his house an * person on one occasion refused to attend family prayers mr * said to the servant saddle that mans horse and let him go from the * * would take no excuse for the * * i believe in mr * * but not in his family prayers mr * * was of the most * * from all * the * news is * good news that is the last man who left washington tells us that seward is in the * he is thought to be the friend of peace the man did say however that that * seward is in the * just now * * has eleven * one is described as * to win or he would be * to win except that he is too heavily * he has been married before and goes about with children and two mothers there are limits beyond which two * mr * spoke to mrs lincoln in behalf of a * who almost felt he had a * right having been there since jacksons time but met with the same answer she had brought her own girl and must * mr * thought the twenty thousand and little enough it is was given to the president of these united states to enable him to live in proper style and to maintain an * of such dignity as * the head of a great nation it is an * to * with the public money and to put it into ones private * mrs * was walking with me when we were * our * against mrs lincoln and her * * the * says three only of the * washington families attended the * ball the judge has just come in and said last night after dr * left on the cars there came a telegram that his little daughter * had died suddenly in some way he must have known it * he changed so suddenly yesterday and seemed so * and unhappy he * in * * and all that certainly there was some terrible * of this kind on his part * this they say is * fort sumter is to be * and we are to have no war after all far too good to be true mr * told us that at one of the peace * i mean * in the interest of peace lincoln * through baltimore locked up in an express car he wore a * cap we went to the congress governor * who * over that august body put james chesnut in the chair and came down to talk to us he told us why the pay of * was fixed in secret * and why the amount of it was never * prevent the * and hotel people from making their * of a * to cover it all the bill would be sure to * with the pay he said in the hotel parlor we had a scene mrs scott was * lincoln who is of the * yankee * she said * * even * in appearance the kind who are always at the corner stores sitting on * * * and telling stories as * as they are * here i * but * a * said one day to mr chesnut lincoln is the * fellow to * i have ever encountered yet mr scott is from * and said lincoln is an utter american * * rough and strong a * kind creature as * as he is clever and if this country can be * and laughed out of its rights he is the * fellow to do it now if there is a war and it * the yankee pocket instead of * it here a * voice came from the next room which opened upon the one we were in by * doors thrown wide open and said yankees are no more mean and * than you are people at the north are just as good as people at the south the * advanced upon us in great * mrs scott * and made some * * remark though evidently much * but the * face and * * refused to receive any * and replied that comes with a very bad grace after what you were saying and she * us * for several minutes some one in the other room * * but we were quiet as * nobody wanted to hurt her feelings she was one against so many if i were at the north i should expect them to * us and should hold my * we separated north from south because of * of * we are * because we have * each other so if we could only separate a separation * as the french say it and not have a * fight for * the poor * had already been * she said she was playing yankee * on the piano before

men are * the * are * in this * met the lovely lucy * now mrs governor * last night at * * i saw miles now * in * show for three violets she had in her * she is a * * and he well up in the part of * * so it was well done and you who are laughing in your * at the scene where did you get that huge * oh there is no sentiment when there is a * like that of anything oh oh today at the breakfast table there was a tragic * of * on the * * who once more says in * tones who is the * now and so we * on into the black cloud ahead of us and after * * * mr hayne said his wife * over the * of the * * at st andrews hall at a * ball she was * * on one for hours and the walls are * my dear what are your feelings to those of the poor old fellows leaning there with their beautiful young * * as if they could never * and in the arms of every man in the room watch their * weary faces the old boys you know at church i had to move my * the lovely * was too much for my boys they all made eyes at her and * each other and * so for she gave them glance for glance * * and * as they would she * it i say my dear the old husbands have not exactly a bed of roses their * * in the arms of young men they * the wall while we were at supper at the * wigfall was sent for to address a crowd before the * house * like james fitz james when he visits * * again it is to be in the saddle etc so let washington * we were sad that we could not hear the speaking but the supper was a * de * * * * * and * * a ship was fired into yesterday and went back to sea is that the first shot how can one * down to anything ones heart is in ones mouth all the time any moment the cannon may open on us the * come in the * * the air is red hot with * the * is to find out where these utterly * * * in spite of all tom * came for us and we went on the * to take a look at * island and its present * wigfall and the * girls * * and colonel * also john * of the navy * * and william * john * was a * to be proud of he did not speak to us but he stood with a * shawl * about him as handsome and stately a creature as ever queen * loved to look upon there came up such a wind we could not land i was not too sorry though it * so hard i am never * colonel * explained everything about the forts what they * etc in the most interesting way and * * * his report by * all the * and * by land beauregard is a * here to most of the * but there are always * who see and say they give you to understand that * has all the * now in use for our defense he does the work and beauregard * the glory things seem to draw near a * and one must think colonel * is clever enough for anything so we made up our minds today * * and i as * mr * told me that my husband was in a * in the convention so much for cool sense when the atmosphere is * mrs wigfall says we are * she should pair with my cool quiet * colonel and her * * is but a * reflection of me yesterday mrs wigfall and i made a few visits at the first house they wanted mrs wigfall to * a * was she indeed * fancy her face more than ten years * upon her so freely then mrs gibbes asked me if i had ever been in charleston before says * wigfall to pay me for my * when that false fifty was * in her teeth and she thinks this is her native * and her name is * she said it all came upon us for breaking the * for indeed it was sunday * green came up to speak to me at dinner in all his soldiers * it sent a * through me tried to read * * * but could not the air is too full of war news and we are all so restless went to see miss * one of the last of the * * she * particularly about a portrait of her father charles * * which she said had been sent by him to my husbands grandfather i gave a good account of it it * in the place of honor in the drawingroom at * she wanted to see my husband for his grandfather my fathers friend was one of the * men of his day we came home and soon mr robert * and mr miles called governor manning walked in bowed * and seated himself by me again he bowed low in * heroic style and with a grand wave of his hand said madame your country is * when i had breath to speak i asked what does he mean he meant this there are six * outside the bar * and * have come to say that * are to begin governor * and beauregard are holding a council of war mr chesnut then came in and * the story wigfall next entered in * spirits and said there was a sound of * by night in any * or confusion my heart is * to beat so * now the agony was so * i could hardly see or hear the men went off almost immediately and i crept silently to my room where i sat down to a good cry mrs wigfall came in and we had it out on the subject of civil war we * ourselves with * on all its known horrors and then we added what we had a right to expect with yankees in front and negroes in the rear the * must expect a * * of course said mrs wigfall to make sure that we were unhappy enough suddenly loud * was heard we ran out cannon after cannon * we met mrs * green in the * with * cheeks and * eyes governor means rushed out of his room in his * and begged us to be calm governor * said he has ordered in the * of his wisdom seven cannon to be fired as a signal to the * regiment anderson will hear as well as the * regiment now you go back and be quiet fighting in the streets has not begun yet so we retired dr gibbes calls mrs * green * * there was no * today with cannon * and * on the island no sleep for * last night the streets were alive with soldiers men * marching singing wigfall the * * is in his glory the only thoroughly happy person i see today things seem to have settled down a little one can but hope still lincoln or seward has made such * * and then far * * back there may be a chance for peace after all things are * so fast my husband has been made an * to general beauregard three hours ago we were quickly * to go home the convention has * now he tells me the attack on fort sumter may begin tonight * upon anderson and the * outside the * says that this show of war outside of the bar is intended for texas john manning came in with his sword and red * pleased as a boy to be on * staff while the * goes on he has gone with wigfall to captain * with instructions mr chesnut is * a report he had to make to the convention mrs hayne called she had she said but one feeling pity for those who are not here * preston * * the * as they are called with john green the big brave have gone down to the * as * seven hundred men were sent over ammunition wagons were * along the streets all night anderson is burning blue * * and * for the * outside i suppose today at dinner there was no * to things as they stand in charleston harbor there was an * of intense excitement there could not have been a more brilliant circle in addition to our usual * judge * * * and * our two * * with us means and manning these men all talked so * for once in my life i listened that over business began in earnest governor means had * a sword and red * from somewhere and brought it for colonel chesnut who had gone to demand the surrender of fort sumter and now * must wait why did that green * anderson go into fort sumter then everything began to go wrong now they have * a letter from him * them to let him surrender he * the horrors * to * if they will not he ought to have thought of all that before he put his head in the * anderson will not * * was the * * dinner we have had yet men were * wise and * we had an * * that it was to be our last pleasant meeting mr miles * with us today mrs henry king rushed in saying the news i come for the * news all the men of the king family are on the island of which fact she seemed proud while she was here our peace * or * came * is mr chesnut returned his interview with colonel anderson had been deeply interesting but mr chesnut was not * to be * he wanted his dinner he felt for anderson and had * to president davis for * answer to give anderson etc he has now gone back to fort sumter with additional instructions when they were about to leave the * a h * sprang into the boat in great excitement he thought himself * with a * of fighting and he to be left behind i do not * to go to sleep how can i if anderson does not accept terms at four the orders are he shall be fired upon i count four st * * * out and i begin to hope at * four the heavy * of a cannon i sprang out of bed and on my knees * i prayed as i never prayed before there was a sound of * all over the house * of feet in the * all seemed * one way i put on my * and a shawl and went too it was to the * the shells were * in the dark i heard a man say * of ammunition i knew my husband was * about in a boat somewhere in that dark bay and that the shells were * it over * toward the fort if anderson was obstinate colonel chesnut was to order the fort on one side to open fire certainly fire had begun the regular roar of the cannon there it was and who could tell what each * accomplished of death and destruction the women were wild there on the * prayers came from the women and * from the men and then a shell would light up the scene tonight they say the forces are to attempt to land we watched up there and everybody wondered that fort sumter did not fire a shot today miles and manning * now * to beauregard * with us the latter hoped i would keep the peace i gave him only good words for he was to be under fire all day and night down in the bay carrying orders etc last night or this morning truly up on the * i was so weak and weary i sat down on something that looked like a black * get up you * woman your dress is on fire cried a man and he put me out i was on a * and the * had caught my clothes * preston and mr * then came up but my fire had been * before it burst out into a regular * do you know after all that noise and our tears and prayers nobody has been hurt sound and fury * * * and a * * * came here now this is a sort of news * * * her handsome young husband has all the credit of a famous battery which is made of railroad iron mr * calls it the * because it * the * back the way they came so * * tells us during her first marriage she had no children * the value of this * * baby to * * from the * of the battery of which she * we asked if the baby could talk yet no not exactly but he * the big gun when he * that he * his hands and * * * her mind is distinctly occupied by three things lieutenant * whom she calls randolph the baby and the big gun and it * to hold more * of virginia spoke from the * of the charleston hotel i asked what he said an * woman replied oh they all say the same thing but he made great play with that long hair of his which he is always * aside somebody came in just now and reported colonel chesnut asleep on the sofa in general * room after two such nights he must be so tired as to be able to sleep * just bade farewell to * * he is forced to go home and leave this interesting place says he * like the man that was not killed at * i think he said that unfortunate had to * himself when he got home for very shame * he fell on his sword which was the * * way of * matters i do not wonder at * * baby we hear nothing can listen to nothing * * goes the cannon all the time the nervous * is awful alone in this * room richmond and washington * say the * with excitement why not to us these last days events seem * great we were all women on that iron * men are only seen at a distance now * means marching under the * at the head of his regiment held his cap in his hand all the time he was in sight mrs means was leaning over and looking with * eyes when an unknown creature asked why did he take his hat off mrs means stood straight up and said he did that in honor of his mother he saw me she is a proud mother and at the same time most unhappy her lovely daughter * is dying in there before her eyes of * at that moment i am sure mrs means had a * of the heart at least she looked as i feel sometimes she took my arm and we came in nobody has been hurt after all how gay we were last night * after the dread of all the * we thought those dreadful cannon were making not even a battery the worse for wear fort sumter has been on fire anderson has not yet * any of our guns so the * still with * and red * by way of uniform tell us but the sound of those guns makes regular * impossible none of us go to table * * the * going everywhere some of the anxious hearts lie on their * and * in solitary misery mrs wigfall and i * ourselves with tea in my room these women have all a * faith god is on our side they say when we are shut in mrs wigfall and i ask why of course he * the yankees we are told * think that well of him not by one word or look can we * any change in the * of these negro servants * * at our door * and * and * * so are they all but they carry it too far you could not tell that they even heard the awful roar going on in the bay though it has been * in their ears night and day people talk before them as if they were * and * they make no sign are they * * or * than we are silent and strong * their time so tea and * came also came colonel manning red * and sword to * that he had been under fire and * mind it he said * it is one of those things a fellow never knows how he will come out until he has been tried now i know i am a worthy * of my old * hero of an * who held the british officer before him as a * in the revolution and * out of danger * we talked of st * * or the maid of * and the drop of the white does blood that sometimes * all the * are still there outside the bar and there are people who thought the charleston bar no good to charleston the bar is the silent * or sleeping * and in this * it is doing us * service i did not know that one could live such days of excitement some one called come out there is a crowd coming a * it was indeed but it was * by * chesnut and manning the crowd was * and showing these two as * of good news they were * to * headquarters fort sumter had surrendered those upon the * * to us the fort is on fire that had been the story once or twice before when we had * down colonel chesnut who had taken it all quietly enough if anything more * than usual in his * told us how the surrender came about wigfall was with them on * island when they saw the fire in the fort he * in a little boat and with his * as a white flag * over wigfall went in through a * when colonel chesnut arrived * after and was received at the regular entrance colonel anderson told him he had need to * his way * for the place was all * as far as i can make out the fort surrendered to wigfall but it is all confusion our flag is flying there * have been sent for to put out the fire everybody tells you half of something and then * off to tell something else or to hear the last news in the afternoon mrs preston mrs joe * and i drove around the battery we were in an open carriage what a changed * very * crowd i think i ever saw everybody talking at once all * were still turned on the grim old fort russell the * of the london times was there they took him everywhere one man got out * to * with him on equal terms poor russell was * * they say he only wanted to

the others * me on the back several * were brought me and i put them in water around my * then general * gave me some violets which i put in my * oh said my * * * if i had known how those * were to be

the subject of this confederacy once on the cars coming from georgia here once at a supper where he sat next to me today he was not cheerful in his views i called him * and * him of looking back man after man came and interrupted the conversation with some * but we held on he was deeply interesting and he gave me some new ideas as to our dangerous situation * for the future and not * at our * * his * * at the presidents and never had a * day he is as * as he is wise he was very agreeable he took me in to dinner the talk was of washington nothing of our present difficulties a general anderson from alexandria d c was in * * he says the north are so much better prepared than we are they are organized or will be by general scott we are in wild confusion their army is the best in the world we are * armed etc etc they have * and arms that were ours and * mrs * * dressed one of those * * persons who * * in the sun tells me she * the * * for mr chesnut and added pass over the * to my powers of * i told her it was an * to the * flag think of a south carolina senator like that men come * in from washington with white lips crying danger danger it is very * to have these people always * on this the enemys troops are the * body of men we ever saw why did you not make friends of them i feel disposed to say we would have war and now we seem to be * our golden opportunity pass we are not preparing for war there is talk talk talk in that * * and * reckless * * proud passionate * * material for soldiers they say we have among us a regiment of * men and women sent here by the * seward why our newspapers tell every word there is to be told by friend or foe a * call from * robert * his theory is all would have been right if we had taken fort sumter six months ago he made this very plain to me he is clever if * i forget why it ought to have been attacked before at another reception mrs davis was in fine spirits captain * was here came over in his own * russell of the london times wondered how we had the heart to enjoy life so thoroughly when all the northern papers said we were to be * in such a short time virginia commissioners here mr * and mr * came to see me they say virginia has no * she comes out on a point of honor could she stand by and see her sovereign sister states * sumter anderson has been offered a kentucky regiment can they * a regiment in kentucky

a western steamer there was a great crowd and no * * or sleeping place of any sort * in the * * i think they called it he had taken a * # but he could not * the people who had already seized it and were asleep in it neither could the captain it would have been a case of * or * * * near the ladies * the * took pity on him this man said he is # and i can find no place for him poor fellow there was a * out of bright eyes i say * have you a man # years old out there let us see him he must be a natural curiosity we are * was the answer and we cant find a place for him to sleep poor old soul bring

side should take me off his hands mr * did not know me nor i him i suppose he * or looked at my * lying on the table as i looked at his at any * we began a conversation which * steadily through the whole thing from * to * mr * though in evening dress presented a rather * appearance his * wanted * down and his hair wanted * he delivered * that day a * on english * which if * i still think would be a valuable addition to that * since then i have always looked forward to a talk with the senator from virginia with * pleasure next came mr miles and mr * of south carolina the latter was president of our secession convention also has written a life of * * that is not so bad so my unexpected reception was of the most charming judge * came a little later they all remained until the return of the crowd from mrs * these men are not * cant say without hope exactly they are agreed in one thing it is worth while to try a while if only to get away from new england captain * was here too he is south carolina to the * of his fingers yet he has it * in the * is part of his * believe the united states navy can * anything in the world all of these little * and * make the times very * one never knows what * any one of them will take at the next word * at mrs * everything nice to eat and i was * for a * i have not even gone to the dinner table yesterday i was forced to * on cold * and * so * in * was the other food they sent me mrs davis was as nice as the * when she is in the * i do not know so pleasant a person she is * clever always we talked of this move from * mr chesnut * it * because this is so * a position for our government he wants our troops sent into maryland in order to make our fight on the * and so to * washington i see that the * * here will at last move the congress our * love their ease and it will be hot here in summer i do hope they will go mrs davis said the yankees will make it hot for us go where we will and truly so if war comes and it has come said i yes i fancy these * * may live to regret losing even the * of the * * never mr chesnut has three * * the maryland scheme is one and he * off to jeff davis who i dare say has fifty men every day come to him with * plans to save the country if only he can keep his * mrs davis says he * all * in softly * * * what a rough * we have here and if nice people come to see you up * an * judge who * the conversation and * the friends of the company generally that is * everybody and * every possible evil to the country provided he * that * your friends does not sufficiently * you everybody has * north too by the papers but of mr * three * maryland is to be made the seat of war old * idea of * up * abroad for our coast * should be adopted and last of all but far from the least we must make much cotton and send it to england as a bank to draw on the very cotton we have now if sent across the water would be a gold mine to us * s c may # #* have come back to south carolina from the * congress * over at * we came with r m t * and mr * mr * has excellent reasons for keeping cotton at home but i forget what they are generally people take what he says also mr * wisdom as * not so mr chesnut who * at both much as he * them we also had tom * and his wife and doctor * surely there never was a more * party the * men had been in the south carolina college while mr * was president their love and respect for him were * and he * received it smiling behind those * met john * at * and told him he was surgeon of the hampton * which delighted him he had had * with only a few moments on the * to * * he said he had remained a little too long in the * college in philadelphia where he was some kind of a professor and they had been within an * of hanging him as a southern spy * was ready he * at * when he * said he was fresh from philadelphia he * escaped * being taken for a northern spy * life i am having among you on both sides he said * away and i * here was john * like to have been killed

richmond ladies had come for them in * * them waved * to them brought them * with their own hands in the faith that every * was a gentleman and every man south of * and * line a hero but these are not exactly * of the * * who fought the * with his * or the * * or something that could * hard and that came * * has gone as a private in * regiment he could not stand it at home any longer mr chesnut was willing for him to go because those * men said this was a rich mans war and the rich men would be the officers and have an easy time and the poor ones would be * so he said let the gentlemen set the example let them go in the ranks so john chesnut is a gentleman private he took his servant with him all the same * * me for saying if i were a man i would not sit here and * and drink and * and forget the fight going on in virginia he said it was my duty not to talk so * and make enemies he had the money in his pocket to * a company last fall but it has slipped through his fingers and now he is a common soldier you * it or spent it * said i i do not know where it has gone said he there was too much * over me too much good * was given to me and everybody gave me different advice dont you ever know your own mind we will do very well in the ranks men and officers all alike we know everybody so i repeated mrs * solemn words when she heard that south carolina had * alone as thy days so shall thy strength be dont know exactly what i meant but thought i must be * as he was going away saw him off at the train forgot to say anything there but cried my eyes out sent mrs wigfall a * * the

meeting of * men with cool heads and they * * to fort sumter the poor music master cant do much * in the * there he may thank his stars that mr chesnut gave him a * hand in the red hot state our

soldiers these fine * * have been in the habit of leaving the coast when it became too hot there and also of fighting a * or two if kept long * under a charleston sun handsome * whose * and * he * so much as they * around the * house would not * hard work in the fields between may and december negroes stand a * or * sun at * better than white men in fighting it is different men will not then mind sun or rain or wind major * when he was ordered west placed his resignation in the hands of his maryland brothers after the baltimore * the brothers sent it in but maryland declined to * mrs * who at least is * of that * being old * * and true to her blood tried to get it back the president refused point * though she went on her knees that i do not believe the franklin race are * and * not much given to * to god or man from all * if major * comes to us wont he have a good time mrs davis * mrs * no wonder i fell in love with her myself i heard of her before i saw her in this wise little banks told me the story she was * at a ball when some bad accident * for the evening news rushed up and informed her that major * had been * by ten indians somewhere out west she * answered him that she had

war is making us all tenderly * no * yet no real mourning nobody hurt so it is all * * and fine * * we are en * * there is no imagination here to * * and only the excitement and wild * from * * life are felt that is when one * away from the two or three * men who are still left in the world when * report of the capture of fort sumter was * * * said how is this tom * and * * names are not here we thought from what they told us that they did most of the fighting colonel magruder has done something splendid on the * * is the name of the battle three hundred of the enemy killed they say our people * i mean continue to drop in from the outside world and what a * those who * a few days sooner feel for those who have just come out a * * called * * said in the street today at heart robert e lee is against us that i know what will not people say in war times also he said that colonel * wanted general beauregard to change the name of the stream near manassas station * run is so * beauregard answered let us try and make it as great a name as your south carolina * mrs chesnut born in philadelphia can not see what right we have to take * * from our northern sisters she thinks that ought to be common to both parties we think they will get their share of this * * do what we may and we will keep * * if we can no comfort in mr * letter from richmond * confusion * and * already in charleston a * has been * * the yankee * outside the bar with * they say he gave the information which led to the capture of the savannah they will * him mr * alone in south carolina has not * when they pray for our president he * up from his knees he might risk a prayer for mr davis i doubt if it would seriously do mr davis any good mr * is too clever to think himself one of the * whose prayers * so * much mr * * mr * followed his example mr * has such a keen sense of the * he must be laughing in his * at the * this * * of independence has raised looking out for a battle at manassas station i am always ill the name of my * is a * to get away from here and to go to richmond in england mr * and mr * rise to say a good word for us heaven * them * down its * * on their devoted heads as the * * say * * * me to meet him at * but i was at cool spring * plantation and all my clothes were at * hill our home in the * hills so i lost that good opportunity of the very * escort to richmond tried to rise above the * of * life read * too * on the brain * letters are filled with * about our * an english prince to * over us he actually * that the * * * marching * at the north * us yes as the making of faces and turning of * by the * * the english mr * has written a letter it is in the * of philadelphia he * lincoln his life and fortune all that he has put at * * to * us * we only want to separate from them and they put such an * value on us they are willing to risk all life and * and all their money to keep us they love us so mr chesnut is * of firing the first shot and his cousin an * * writes in a * fury they * the best shot made on the island the day of the * with the first shot at fort sumter this last is claimed by captain james others say it was one of the * who first fired but it was anderson who fired the train which * up the union he slipped into fort sumter that night when we expected to talk it all over a letter from my husband * headquarters manassas junction june # 1861 mary * and myself are off for richmond * mr * of the * * goes with us we are to be under his care * * * hayne the man who fought a * with * * across the * and yet lives is the * of the brave he * russell in the * the public * saying we wanted an english prince to the * not we indeed every man wants to be at the head of affairs himself if he can not be king himself then a * of course it was hardly necessary to do more than laugh at * * idea there was a great deal of the * kind of talk at the * house russell writes * enough of the british in * we can hardly expect him to * what is to our * last night i was * by loud talking and * * * of feet * dying away in the distance loud calls from point to point in the yard up i started my heart in my mouth some dreadful thing had happened a battle a death a horrible accident some one was * * is from the top of the * * like a * in a storm old colonel chesnut was * at the * negroes looking for fire with lighted * in * and everywhere else i dressed and came upon the scene of action what is it any news no no only * * a * she thinks something is burning somewhere the whole yard was alive * * there are sixty or * people kept here to wait upon this household * of them too old or too young to be of any use but families remain * the old colonel has a magnificent voice i am sure it can be heard for miles * he was * from the * giving orders to the busy crowd who were * the * of fire old mrs chesnut is * so she did not know what a * she was * she is very * to bad * * have to be taken out of the room to be * * are * only in the * or farther * she * violets * can only * a single kind of sweet rose a * she will not have in her room she was * innocent of the storm she had raised and in a * sweet voice was * places to be * i was weak enough to laugh * the * of fort sumter was nothing to this after this alarm enough to * the dead the * was found a family had been * * around the * they had swept up some * * * up the fire to make all safe before going to bed this was * up with the ashes and its faint * * the air at least to mrs * nose two hundred yards or more away yesterday some of the negro men on the plantation were found with * i have never before seen * about any negro to show that they knew we had a war on hand in which they have any interest mrs john de * bade me * and god bless you i was touched * people never show any more feeling or sympathy than red indians except at a funeral it is expected of all to * then and if you dont show feeling * * the * * * june # #* * was perfect in the part of * companion he had his * too the most * and * of * is human and he enjoyed the * of the * persons who turned up on every hand and gave their views freely on all matters of state mr * * joined us en route with him came his wife and baby we dont think alike but mr * is always original and * already he * jeff davis a failure and his cabinet a * * i suggested as he gave his opinion before the administration had * got under way he was fierce in his * as to mr * vote for jeff davis he says mr chesnut * the judge and those two turned the * at least with the south carolina * we * as we always do he says * * common sense might have saved us two quiet * yankee * were on the train i had spoken to them and they had told me all about themselves so i wrote on a * of paper do not * our home and house so before these yankee strangers going north those girls are * returning from whence they came soldiers everywhere they seem to be in the air and certainly to fill all space * * a * georgia man who says we try our soldiers to see if they are hot enough before we * them if when water is thrown on them they do not * they wont do their patriotism is too cool to show they were wide * and * * every woman from every window of every house we passed waved a * if she had one this * of white * from every side never ceased from * to richmond another new * of girls came to every station simply to look at the troops passing they always stood the girls i mean in * * and as the sun was generally in their eyes they made faces mary * never tired of laughing at this * of her sister * at the * in richmond mr * with wigfall and garnett met us we had no cause to * of the * of our reception they had a carriage for us and our rooms were taken at the * but then the people who were in the rooms engaged for us had not * at the time they said they were going they * among the * of richmond and we knew of no law to make them keep their words and go mrs preston had gone for a few days to manassas so we took her room mrs davis is as kind as ever she met us in one of the * * and asked us to join her party and to take our * at her table mr preston came and we moved into a room so small there was only space for a bed * and glass over it my things were hung up out of the way on * behind the door as soon as my husband heard we had arrived he came too after dinner he sat * the solitary chair of the apartment * against the door as he * and my poor * were * i * * war times said he nobody is * now when i go back to manassas tomorrow you will be * sorry you * me about those * things up there so he * the * of peace for i knew that his * were * true as soon as he was once more under the enemys guns i would * in * and ashes captain * came with colonel * the latter said he could only stay five minutes he was obliged to go back at once to his camp that was a little before eight however at twelve he was still talking to us on that sofa we * him with his fine words to the f f * crowd before the * virginia has no * she * her strong arm to catch the blow * at her * sisters he * it well however that we knew his speech by heart this * is a * world the war * is not so much * as that everybody has some personal dignity to take care of and everybody else is * to it i mean the personal dignity of * in this wild confusion everything * and * is told you and then everything is as * * at any * it is * not to talk of the war * was telling us how they laughed at little south carolina in washington people said it was almost as large as long island which is hardly more than a * of new york always there is a child who * and wont play that was our * and we were * as * * and all * though small * * he tells us that lincoln is a * lincoln * the fun of things he thinks if they had left us in a corner or out in the cold a while * with our fingers in our mouth by * or by * he could have got us back but anderson * all in mrs * drawingroom last night the president took a seat by me on the sofa where i sat he talked for nearly an hour he laughed at our faith in our own powers we are like the british we think every * equal to three yankees at least we will have to be * to a dozen now after his experience of the fighting qualities of * in mexico he * that we will do all that can be done by * and * * and * courage * and * patriotism and yet his tone was not * there was a sad * running through it all for one thing either way he thinks it will be a long war that * me at once it has been too long for me already then he said before the end came we would have many a bitter experience he said only * * the courage of the yankees or their * to fight when they saw fit and now that we have * their pride we have * them till they will fight like * mrs * johnson is here a regular * she * the governor of north carolina in some way and has got arms and clothes and ammunition for her husbands regiment there was some * the * * were all wrong but a * * * part before or something * captain * came today with mrs * colonel * is colonel of a georgia regiment now in virginia he was the * of savannah who helped to * the * * the * night under my * head into the small hours in charleston in november last his wife is a charming person * and wise daughter of judge * she had on a white * * with pink * on the * it gave her a gay and * air and yet she must be as old as i am mr * who does not love slavery more than sumner does nor than i do * at the * new england * us we want to separate from them to be * of the yankees forever at any price and they hate us so and would * us or * us as * has it to their * with * of * we are an * bride i think * of * began when it was made plain to us that we got all the * of slavery and they all the money there was in it with their * mr * says the young men are * because there is a fight on hand but those few who look ahead the clear heads they see all the risk the loss of land * and life home wife and children as in the brave days of old they take to it for their * sake they are ready and willing come what may but not so * as the * * mrs preston mrs wigfall mary * and i drove in a fine open carriage to see the * de * it was a grand * out there mr davis rode a beautiful gray horse the * * de * brought him from * his worst enemy will allow that he is a * * graceful and easy in the saddle and mr chesnut who has talked horse with his father ever since he was born * that mr davis knows more about horses than any man he has met yet general lee was there with him also joe davis and wigfall acting as his * poor mr * has been brought from his * or some sort of * every woman in the house is ready to rush into the * * business i think i will wait for a wounded man to make my first effort as sister of charity mr * sent for me as everybody went mr davis * the example so did i * will not die this time will men * and make eyes until their eyes close in death at the * * he was the same old * of the drawingroom it is pleasant at the presidents table my seat is next to joe davis with mr * on the other side and mr * opposite there is great * however as soon as i came i repeated what the north carolina man said on the cars that north carolina had # men ready and they were kept back by mr * etc the president caught something of what i was saying and asked me to repeat it which i did although i was * to death madame when you see that person tell him his statement is false we are too anxious here for troops to refuse a man who * himself not to speak of # men silence * the most profound uncle h gave me three hundred dollars for his daughter * * making four in all that i have of hers he would pay me one hundred which he said he * my husband for a horse i thought it an excuse to * me money i told him i had enough and to spare for all my needs until my colonel came home from the * * * the * son is * to see me does not show much of the * of the * pleasant person however mr * and wigfall came at the same time the former * at * * position here gave him fiery advice mr wigfall was calm and full of common sense a brave man and without a thought of any necessity for * his * he said * at this time before the country is strong and settled in her new career it would be * for us the head men to * in a * among ourselves as i was * * away and * the * * i reported mr * conversation of the night before he is all right said mr * the fight had to come we are men not women the * had * long enough we hate each other so the fight had to come even * * after they had * and * enough fought like brave men long and well if the * sumner had stood on his * and * and struck back when preston * * him preston * blow need not have been the opening skirmish of the war * country took up the fight because he did not sumner * his own battlefield and it was the worse for us what an awful * that preston * business was * said yankees did not fight for the fun of it they always made it pay or let it alone met mr * with news * man here in the midst of us taken with * * etc in his * * spy mr * said he would be * all human * that is a letter from my husband written at camp * and saying if you and mrs preston can make up your minds to leave richmond and can come up to a nice little country house near orange court house we could come to see you frequently while the army is stationed here it would be a safe place for the present near the scene of action and directly in the line of news from all sides so we go to orange court house read the story of * the * man he has wonderful interest just now slavery has to go of course and joy go with it these yankees may kill us and lay * our land for a while but * * russell * us in his letters people here care a great deal for what russell says because he * the london times and the times * the sentiment of the english people how we do * to the idea of an * with england or france without france even washington could not have done it we drove to the camp to see the president present a flag to a maryland regiment having lived on the battlefield * near * we have an immense respect for the maryland line when our * in that fight ran away colonel * and the * held their own against * * and the rest and everywhere around are places named for a * captain killed in our * de * etc the last however was a * count a letter from my husband written june #* has just reached me he says we are very * posted * and have now at our command about # of the best troops in the world we have besides two batteries of artillery a regiment of cavalry and daily expect a * of flying artillery from richmond we have sent forward seven regiments of infantry and * toward alexandria our * have felt the enemy several times and in every instance the enemy * general johnston has had several * advancing columns of the two * with him too the enemy although always superior in numbers are * driven back there is great * in the matter of ammunition general * command in the very face of * numbers have only thirty * each if they had been well provided in this respect they could and would have defeated * and * with great ease i find the opinion * throughout the army that there is great * and * * in the war department unless the * fall back we must soon come together on both lines and have a decided engagement but the opinion * here that * army will not meet us if they can avoid it they have already fallen back before a slight check from # of * men they had # and were * * you have no idea how * and * the camp life is you would hardly know your best friend in camp * noise of * tramp of marching regiments all day long * of artillery wagons * of music friends from every quarter coming in we ought to be miserable and anxious and yet these are pleasant days perhaps we are * * and excited heard some people in the drawingroom say mrs * ladies are not young are not pretty and i am one of them the * of the remark did not * to * its bitterness we must put * * and mary * in the * as youth and beauty are in request at least they are young * * in a * picture the president does not * our going but he is very much * to it we are consequently frightened by our own * but we are * women and so we go * white * springs * july # #* * came here with us the cars were * with soldiers to the * they were very * and * and we had an agreeable journey in spite of heat dust and crowd * robert * was with us he means to * a hospital for sick and wounded there was not an * of * even so * so close but everybody in * spirits mr preston and mr chesnut met us at warrenton saw across the lawn but did not speak to them some of judge * family there they * * just outside the * of their * a resigned judge of the supreme court of the united states resigned and for a cause that he is hardly more than half in sympathy with judge * is one of the * cases this water is making us young again how these men enjoy the * they say beauregard can stop the way with sixty thousand that many are coming an * female with every hair * and * said to be a yankee spy * opposite us * * wondered with * and the judgment to come so near at hand how she could * her few remaining minutes * her hair he bade me be very * for she would ask me questions when we were walking away from table i demanded his * of my * under such trying circumstances it seems i was not as calm and * as i thought myself * answered with * do you always carry * like that in your pocket ready for the first word that * you you must not do so when you are with * from the other side i do not feel at all afraid of * hearing anything through me for i do not know anything but our men could not * with us in these cool * and comfortable quarters with water * excellent table etc they have gone back to manassas and the faithful * with them to bring us the * news they left us in excellent spirits which we shared until they were out of sight we went with them to warrenton and then heard that general johnston was in full retreat and that a column was advancing upon beauregard so we came back all * if our husbands are taken prisoners what will they do with them are they soldiers or * mrs * read us a letter from richmond how * they are there at joe * retreating and the enemies of the war department * * of not sending general johnston ammunition in sufficient * say that is the real cause of his retreat now will they not make the ears of that * the secretary of war * mrs * maid * has a way of * * you hear the cannon we * to the windows * out to our * * all the hair away from our ears but can not hear it lincoln wants four hundred * of money and men in * can he get them he will find us a heavy * midnight i hear * guns we are always * up some good thing of the rough * saying lincoln * to some * he is too * that is a * style of man or woman the * i know the thing but had no name for it before our battle summer may it be our first and our last so called after all we have not had any of the horrors of war could there have been a * or * life than we led in charleston and * how * it all was there so many clever men and women * from every part of the south * and a want of * and a want of good things to eat drove us away in richmond the girls say it is perfectly delightful we found it so too but the * and * have begun there at table today we heard mrs * ladies described they were said to wear red * and * on their heads we sat * as * one woman said she found the drawingroom of the * was warm * and * poor soul * the * * and no man came to air her in the moonlight * you know why * somebody ask her out on the * to see the * * above what * was done in the name of the * when you * on a * on the * they lifted their eyes and * was the only word you heard * came back with a paper from washington with * * of what they will do to us threatened men live long there was a soft sweet low and slow young lady opposite to us she seemed so gentle and * and so * of everything mr * called her miss * * who always asked her maid when a new book was mentioned * have i * that volume mary * having a * in the * is * at times to be sad and * mrs preston * her negro nurse to her never take any more trouble in your heart than you can * off at the end of your * we did hear cannon today the woman who * mrs * republican court of which we are honorable members by saying * were not young that they wore * colors and dressed * took an * today as to her * she is * deeply * * she * a * which is kept in place by a * of * * she has the * of arms and * black * * the one who is under a cloud * as a yankee spy has * our worst * she exhibited * joy as she reported seven hundred sick soldiers in the hospital at culpeper and that beauregard had sent a flag of * to washington what a night we had * had seen * persons * about all day and mrs preston a * which could easily be placed so as to reach our rooms mary * saw * * about among the trees and we all heard guns so we sat up consequently i am writing in bed today a letter from my husband saying in particular our orders are to move on the date july #* here we are still and no more * of movement now than when i last wrote to you it is true however that the enemy is advancing slowly in our front and we are preparing to receive him he comes in great force being more than three times our number the spy * gave us a parting shot said beauregard had arrested her brother in order that he might take a fine horse which the * brother was riding why beauregard at a moments notice could have any horse in south carolina or louisiana for that matter this man was arrested and sent to richmond and will be * as they always are said * they send them first to richmond to see and hear everything there then they * them and send them out of the country by way of norfolk to see everything there but after all what does it matter they have no need for * our newspapers keep no * * the thoughts of our hearts are all revealed everything with us is open and * at * the yankees fired too high every daily paper is * them about it yet * fire low enough next time but no * man will be there to get the benefit of their * * alas * * july # #* we feel safe and comfortable we can not be * mr preston met us at warrenton mr chesnut doubtless had too many * to receive from washington * in with the * numbers of the enemy done up in their back hair * hampton is here doctor * * and

his youth bore him off today they say judge longstreet has lost the keen sense of fun that * his life in days of * mrs * and her daughter were here the president met us cordially but he laughed at our sudden retreat with * lost etc he tried to keep us from going said it was a dangerous * dare say he knows more about the situation of things than he * to tell us today in the drawingroom saw a * in the flesh she was in the uniform of her regiment but wore * * she * about in her hat and * did not * her head as a man would have done played the piano and sang * she had no * but she gave us * she was followed at every step by a * of * soldiers and boys yesterday as we left the cars we had a * of war it was the * sight the memory of it is hard to shake * soldiers not wounded ones there were quite two hundred they said lying about as best they might on the * robert * was there doing all he could their pale * faces so here is one of the horrors of war we had not * on there were many good men and women with robert * * all the service possible in the circumstances just now i happened to look up and saw mr chesnut with a smile on his face watching me from the * i * across the room and as i got * saw mrs davis touch him on the shoulder she said he was to go at once into mr * room where general lee and general * were after he left us mrs davis told me general beauregard had sent mr chesnut here on some army business mr chesnut remained * with the president and general lee all the afternoon the news does not seem pleasant at least he is not * to tell me any of it he satisfied himself with telling me how * and * this handsome general lee is general lees military * was also his * of course the president * the party as well by his weight of brain as by his position i did not care a * for a description of the war council i wanted to know what is in the wind now * today at the presidents table joe davis the * asked me if i * white port wine i said i did not know all that i had ever known had been dark red so he poured me out a glass i * it and it nearly burned up my mouth and throat it was * but i did not let him see how it * me i * to be glad that any one found me still young enough to play off a * * upon me it was thirty years since i had thought of such a thing met colonel * in the drawingroom he pointed * to his confederate * * and gray coat at the white * last summer he was a union man to the last point how much have you changed besides your coat i was always true to our country he said she leaves me no choice now as far as i can make out beauregard sent mr chesnut to the president to gain permission for the forces of joe johnston and beauregard to join and united to * the enemy if possible over the potomac now every day we grow * and they stronger so we had better give a telling blow at once already we begin to cry out for more ammunition and already the * is beginning to shut it all out a young * is here his mother writes him to go back her franklin blood certainly calls him with no * sound to the northern side while his * is * and * * in half by * mrs wigfall says he is half * to go she wondered that he did not with a father in the enemys army he will always be * here let the president and mrs davis do for him what they will i did not know there was such a bitter cry left in me but i wept my heart away today when my husband went off things do look so black when he comes up here he rarely * his * a negro man * has charge of all mr * * clothes and two or three hundred gold pieces that lie in the * of his trunk all these papers etc he tells * to bring to me if anything * to him but i said * he will * off to the yankees and freedom with all that * he is not going to leave me for * else after all what can he ever be better than he is * * gentleman he is within sound of the enemys guns and when he * to the other army he is free * said of mr * man what he want with anything more * he was free dont he live just as well as * john do now mrs * mrs joe johnston mrs wigfall all came i am sure so many clever women could * a soul in * the hampton * all in a * i forget what standing on their dignity i suppose i have come to * a man who says my own personal dignity and * require i long to cry no need to respect yourself until you can make other people do it beauregard * yesterday they say to general johnston come down and help us or we shall be crushed by numbers the president * general johnston to move down to * aid at bull run * brigade ewells and longstreets encountered the foe and repulsed him six hundred prisoners have been sent here i arose as the * say and * my face and * my head and went * at the foot of them stood general * radiant one finger * * his * * or * his neck to it after his * he called out your south carolina man * has done a capital thing at bull * back the enemy if not defeated him with killed and prisoners etc etc * came to tell the * and colonel smith one of the * with garnett mcclellan who were sent to europe to * and report on military matters poor garnett is killed there was * or * on the part of * up there or some of governor * * to military * i hear all these things said i do not understand but it was a fatal business mrs * says she * we do not believe a word of any news unless it comes in this * a great battle fought not one confederate killed enemys loss in killed wounded and prisoners taken by us immense i was in hopes there would be no battle until mr chesnut was forced to give up his * * to come and attend to his regular duties in the congress * has come in he says * battle was a skirmish of * joe davis * said would heaven only send us a napoleon not one bit of use if heaven did * would not give him a commission mrs davis and mrs joe johnston her dear * were in fine spirits the effect upon * * was evident we * * south carolina troops pass every day they go by with a gay step tom taylor and john * bowed to us from their horses as we leaned out of the windows such * of * we are forever at the windows it was not such a mere skirmish we took three * cannon and six hundred stands of arms mr davis has gone to manassas he did not let wigfall know he was going that * the * of * * no mistake today i was too ill to move out of my bed so they all sat in my room mrs davis came in so softly that i did not know she was here until she leaned over me and said a great battle has been fought joe johnston led the right wing and beauregard the left wing of the army your husband is all right * hampton is wounded colonel johnston of the * killed so are colonel * and colonel * * smith is wounded or killed i had no breath to speak she went on in that desperate calm way to which people * themselves under the greatest excitement * * his men leading them into the * of the fight died * at the head of his regiment the president * me only that it is a great victory general * has all the other * still i said nothing i was * then i was so grateful those * and dearest to me were safe still she then began in the same * voice to read from a paper she held in her hand dead and dying cover the field * battery taken lynchburg regiment cut to pieces three hundred of the * wounded that got me up times were too wild with excitement to stay in bed we went into mrs * room and she made me lie down on her bed men women and children * in every living soul had a story to tell complete victory you heard everywhere we had been such anxious * the * of feeling was almost too much to bear today i met my friend mr * i was on my way to mrs * room and begged him to call at some other time i was too * just then for a morning visit from even the most * person a woman from mrs * country was in a fury because they had stopped her as she rushed to be the first to tell mrs * her husband was killed it having been decided that mrs davis should tell her poor thing she was found lying on her bed when mrs davis * come in she said when she saw it was mrs davis she sat up ready to spring to her feet but then there was something in mrs * pale face that took the life out of her she * at mrs davis then sank back and covered her face as she asked is it bad news for me mrs davis did not speak is he killed afterward mrs * said to me as soon as i saw mrs * face i could not say one word i knew it all in an instant i knew it before i wrapped the shawl about my head * mrs * maid * * came into my room these colored people say it is * in the papers here that the virginia people done it all now * * had so many of his men killed and he wounded it stands to reason that south carolina was no ways * if there was ever anything plain thats plain * for the first time a military funeral as that march came * up they say mrs * * the empty saddle and the led * saw and heard it all and now it seems we are never out of the sound of the dead march in * it comes and it comes until i feel * to close my ears and * yesterday mrs * and ourselves sat on a * and mingled our tears for those noble * * * * and james * today we find we * our grief they are not so much as wounded i dare say all the rest is true about * the face of the enemy with * in their hands leading their men but dr * is a surgeon he is as * to forget that as i am he is * of colonel * of the revolution called by way of pet name by his soldiers old danger thank heaven they are all quite alive and we will not cry next time until * * here mr chesnut opened my door and walked in out of the * of the heart the mouth * i had to ask no questions he gave me an account of the battle as he saw it walking up and down my room occasionally * himself on a window * but too restless to remain still many moments and told what regiments he was sent to bring up he took the orders to colonel jackson whose regiment stood so * still under fire that they were called a stone wall also they call beauregard * and johnston * mr chesnut rode with * cavalry after the retreating enemy in the pursuit they following them until midnight then there came such a fall of * such as is only known in * lands in the drawingroom colonel chesnut was the belle of the ball they crowded him so for news he was the first arrival that they could get at from the field of battle but the women had to give way to the * of the land who were as filled with curiosity as * * mr * mr * captain * etc * de * says * of massachusetts a senator of the united states came to manassas en route to richmond with his * shoes ready for a * scene which was to * a triumph the new york * said in a few days we shall have richmond * and new orleans they must be taken and at once for a few days * now they will * * in a few years they brought me a yankee soldiers * from the battlefield the letters had been * by senator * one might shed tears over some of the letters women * and mothers are the same everywhere what a comfort the * was we had been willing to admit that their * * education had put them rank and * ahead of us * but these letters do not * that fact the * is * bad mrs * drawingroom last night was brilliant and she was in great force outside a * called for the president he did * old * who * the * from * his enthusiasm was * they called for colonel chesnut and he gave them a capital speech too as public * say sometimes it was the * moment of my life i did not hear a great deal of it for always when anything * of any moment my heart * up in my ears but the distinguished * who crowded round told me how good a speech he made i was * there goes the dead march for some poor soul today the president told us at dinner that mr * * of * in the congress was * * men * it two * * * in * hours is doing pretty well and now i could be happy but this cabinet of ours are in such bitter * among * * everybody last night while those splendid * of the battle were being given to the crowd below from our windows i said then why do we not go on to washington you mean why did they not the opportunity is lost mr * said to me silence we want to listen to the * and mr * smiled * dont ask * questions * smith came down on the turnpike in the very * of time still the * who fought all day and held the yankees in check * credit beyond words or it would all have been over before the joe johnston * came it is another case of the * * the * men claim all the credit and they who bore the heat and * and burden of the day do not like that everybody said at first * there will be no war those who * evil were called * * now the same * people all cry the war is * very same who were * to leave richmond a few days ago many were ready to move on at a moments warning when the good news came there are such * everywhere but to * to the other kind the * and * those who say very little but that little * they think the war * begun mr * and mr * have just called * * * * came to see me at the same time he said there was no great show of victory on our side until two oclock but when we began to win we did it in * time i mean of course the battle last sunday * * told mr wigfall the news from washington last sunday for hours the * reported at rapid * great victory * them at all points the * began to come in on horseback and at last after two or three oclock there was a sudden * of all news about nine * with * came on foot or on * weary * * * in their path on every hand terror and * that was our opportunity wigfall can see nothing that could have stopped us and when they explain why we did not go to washington i understand it all less than ever yet here we will * and congress * and generals * until they in the north get up an army three times as large as * which we have just defeated * says this victory will be our ruin it * us into a * * of * at our superior * and the * * of their flight will * every * of their * it was the very * they needed there are a * sort here who know their yankees well they say if the thing * to * * and all * will never hear the end of it at least until they get their pay in some way out of us they will not lose money by us of that we may be sure trust yankee * and * for that there seems to be a battle * at * but no * here can be got to think of anything but manassas mrs * says she does not see that it was such a great victory and if it be so great how can one defeat hurt a nation like the north john * fought the whole battle over for me now i understand it before this nobody would take the time to tell the thing * * and in order mr * said he did not see a * thing done than the cool * of a columbia negro he carried his master a * of * and * which he had * for him and he cried you must be so tired and hungry * make haste and eat this was in the * of the fight under the * of the enemys guns the federal * had been making a * of it their * was all * to richmond * has issued a * they are making ready to come after us on a magnificent * they * us at last * worthy of their * the lord help us since england and france wont or dont if we could only get a friend outside and open a port one of these men told me he had seen a yankee prisoner who asked him what sort of a * richmond was for trade he was tired of the old * and would like to take the oath and * here they brought us * found in the * of the yankee army for whom were they jeff davis no doubt and the * tell that to the * we have * the * business on this side of the water dr gibbes says he was at a country house near manassas when a federal soldier who had lost his way came in exhausted he asked for * which the lady of the house gave him upon second thought he declined it she brought it to him so promptly he said he thought it might be * his mind was she was * and said sir i am a virginia woman do you think i could be as base as that here bill tom * this man he is our prisoner the negroes came running and the man surrendered without more * another federal was * at the well a negro girl said you go in and see * the man went in and she followed crying * look here * i got a prisoner too this lady sent in her two prisoners and beauregard * her on her * and patriotism and her presence of mind these negroes were * by their * now if slavery is as * to negroes as we think it why dont they all march over the * where they would be received with open arms it all * me i am always * these * they are to me * in their way and past finding out our negroes were not * for john brown this is how i saw robert e lee for the first time though his family then living at arlington called to see me while i was in washington i thought because of old colonel * * with * custis in the old philadelphia days mrs lee being * * * i had not known the head of the lee family he was somewhere with the army then last summer at the white * were * lee and his wife that sweet little * * and i spoke of * with great praise mrs * said dont * your admiration on him wait till you see his father he is the * to a perfect man i ever saw how in every * clever agreeable * now mrs * came for mrs preston and me to drive to the camp in an open carriage a man riding a beautiful horse joined us he wore a hat with something of a military look to it sat his horse * and was so distinguished at all points that i very much * not * his name as mrs * gave it to us he however heard ours and bowed as * as he rode and the few * he made to each of us showed he knew all about us but mrs * was in * of * excitement i felt that she had * a big * for just then they * in richmond mrs * * him of being * etc he * and said his * were of the * he only wanted a virginia farm no end of * and fresh * and * * one * * or two but * * * to all this light * did we seriously * because the man and horse and everything about him were so * * in fact no fault to be found if you * for it as he left us i said eagerly who is he you did not know why it was robert e lee son of light horse * lee the first man in virginia raising her voice as she * his * all the same i like smith lee better and i like his looks too i know smith lee well can * say they know his brother i doubt it he looks so cold quiet and grand * smith is our * he came on the field in the * of time as * at * and now we are as the british who do not remember * it is all * so every individual man i see fought and won the battle from * up and down all the * men won the battle turned the * the * * never * * little as one * of * in the english stories of * mr * was * * garden and * regiment generally this was delightful they are my friends and * at home i showed him mary * letter and we agreed with her at the * of our hearts we believe every confederate soldier to be a hero * * * * * hope for the best today things must be on a * * all over the world met the president in the * he took me by both hands have you * said he come in and breakfast with me alas i had had my breakfast at the public diningroom where i had taken my breakfast with mr chesnut mrs davis came to him while we were at table she said she had been to our rooms she wanted wigfall * up mr davis thought chesnut would be * to know his * i ran to mrs * room who told me she was sure he could be found with his regiment in camp but mr chesnut had not to go to the camp for wigfall came to his * room while i was there mr davis and wigfall would be friends * the northern papers say we hung and * a * cut him into four pieces and that we * prisoners to a tree and * them in other words we are * it ought to teach us not to credit what our papers say of them it is so * an imagination of evil we are absolutely * their prisoners as well as our own men we are * of for it here i am going to the * for the enemys sick and wounded in order to see for myself why did we not follow the flying foe across the potomac that is the question of the hour in the drawingroom with those of us who are not * as to who took * battery * green for one took it * told us that finding a * with nice * * he was so hot and * he stepped behind a tree and put on a * yankee * and was more comfortable the new york * * the yankee * which has received a * by saying we had # men on the field at manassas we had about # * men in all and then the * * to * and * them against us by telling lies as to our * of prisoners they say when they come against us next it will be in * force i long to see * letter to the london times about bull run and manassas it will be rich and rare in washington it is * and * well let them * one another to their hearts * mrs wigfall with the * star flag in her carriage called for me we drove to the fair grounds mrs * * with her * * rolled along in front of us the fair grounds are as covered with * soldiers etc as ever as one regiment * off to the army a fresh one from home comes to be * in and take its place the president with his * dashed by my husband was riding with him the president presented the flag to the * mr chesnut came to us for the flag and bore it * to the president we seemed to come in for part of the glory we were too far off to hear the speech but jeff davis is very good at that sort of thing and we were satisfied that it was well done * how that * wigfall did rush those poor * about he * and marched them until i was weary for their * poor fellows it was a hot afternoon in august and the * in the * mr davis * to speak wigfall replied with his hat on is that military at the fair grounds today such music * and marching such cheering and flying of * such firing of guns and all that sort of thing a * day it was with * * feeling in the midst of it all a * came to tell mrs wigfall that a telegram had been received saying her children were safe across the lines in * that was something to thank god for without any doubt these two little girls came from somewhere in * with mrs * * one who gave me my * the only person in the world except * * who ever seemed to think i had a soul to save now suppose seward had held * and * as * for * * good * * excitement number two that bold * the georgia general * * about too * got thrown his horse dragged him up to the * of our carriage for a moment it was * down there among the horses * was a face turned up toward us purple with rage his foot was still in the * and he had not let go the * the horse was * over him * and * everybody was * him in and they seemed so slow and * about it we felt it an * looking down at him and * him to be killed before our very faces however he soon got it all straight and though * * and * * * and flushed with * face and * hair than ever he rode off * having to our admiration bravely * the * * now if i were to * out the best * one where all catch it so * i should say mr * * was the most * and * man in the confederacy he is held * for everything that goes wrong in the army he may not be * but having been a * and * of jeff davis at west point points the moral and * the * i hear that * to * of his many * they say beauregard writes that his army is upon the * of * here every man woman and child is ready to * to the first * * of whom that army * every manassas soldier is a hero dear to our * hearts put up with any * of the * of the #* * and now they say we did not move on right after the flying foe because we had no provisions no wagons no ammunition etc rain mud and * where were the enemys supplies that we * so of * * * where where there is a will there is a way we stopped to * that rich * and * for a day or so everybody thought the war was over and stopped to * so it appeared here all this was our * talk today mr * * with us and mr * * by me always the latter * me * but mr * laughed at this * * womans * and female * and their * a * in the autumn does not * for a * in the spring time and * wait for no man and there was a * in our affairs which might have led to washington and we did not take it and lost our fortune this round things which nobody could deny mcclellan * * the * scott * general scott is the * man i ever saw mrs scott said nobody but his wife could ever know how little he was and yet they say old * scott could have organized an army for them if they had had patience they would not give him time prince * has gone to washington now the yankees so far are as little * as we are * troops are they as yet suppose france takes the other side and we have to meet * and armed men soldiers who understand war * with all the * we * of * * * preston and doctor * boys are here these * * * southern * have been within an * of a fight with a maryland company for their * grounds it is much too * to be so ready to fight * friend or foe men are * with fiery * the * southern * spirit is in the air these young men however were all * abroad and it is french or * ideas that they are filled with the * were as * and reckless as the others and had their * ready for * to * on * fair * one would think there were yankees enough and to spare for any * to be done it began about * their horses but these * young soldiers have lovely * they are so * when seen here among us at the arlington a heavy heavy heart another * from * * and * things are all * * had been crossed not the stream in * fair and happy land where our * lie they seem to feel that the war is over here except the president and mr * above all that * friend of mine captain * he thinks it hardly begun another * from * beauregard is not * * * to think that any * general even though he had * up in a month or so from captain of artillery to general could be so * up with * so * by any false idea of his own consequence as to write to * that man or men would sacrifice their country * themselves ruin their families to spite the * general * and * can never reach a higher point than that and yet they give you to understand mr davis does not like beauregard in point of fact they fancy he is * of him and rather than beauregard shall have a showing the president who would be * at least if things go wrong will * the army to spite beauregard mr * says how we could laugh but you see it is no laughing matter to have our fate in the hands of such * vain army * so the * of life are * in the * we seem to be resting on our * * in congress while the * yankees are * their army at their * every day some of our regiments march away from here the town is crowded with soldiers these new ones are * running in * the war will be over before they get a sight of the fun every man from every little * wants a place in the picture * north * # men to * us truly we are a formidable power the * says it is useless to move with a man less than that england has made it all up with them or rather she will not break with them * napoleon is in washington and not our friend doctor gibbes is a bird of ill * today he tells me eight of our men have died at the * hospital it seems * is more * in an army than the enemys guns there are # there * de combat and * fever is with them they want money clothes and * so as i am writing right and left the letters * calling for help from the sister * at home good and * women at home are easily * to their work mary * has many * to her * * in the army and doctor * in town today she drove out with major smith and colonel hood yesterday custis lee was here she is a * little * and needs no good advice if i were one to give it * does all our * all his * money has been in his hands until now i thought it * when gold is at such a * to leave it lying * in the * of a trunk so i have * it up in a * which i can wear upon an * the * is * and my * are there too it has strong * and can be tied under my * about my * if the worst comes to the worst as the saying is * * the same * * no sign of anything he may feel or think of my * fancy only i know he * for twice as much money now when he goes to buy things today i saw a sword captured at manassas the man who brought the sword in the early part of the * was taken prisoner by the yankees they * him possessed themselves of his * and were in the act of * him of his * when the * began and the play was * * then took the opposite * from a small * in the mountain has * the mighty stream which has made at last * wigfall the worst enemy the president has in the congress a fact which * our affairs no little mr * hands ought to be * he ought to be * a divided house must fall we all say mrs * jones who is called * by her friends and * * and female said that mrs * had * to the * jones * taylor and so of the president taylor family and cousin of mr * first wife that mrs wigfall described mrs davis to mrs * as a * western woman now the fair lucy * and mrs wigfall had a * of their own out in texas and though * there was bitterness * at first mrs joe johnston called mrs davis a western belle but when the * between general johnston and the president broke out mrs johnston took back the belle and * woman in the narrative * from mrs jones * * came with glad * we had taken three * at sea and brought them in safely one * with * general * told us the president * mr chesnut when he described the battle scene to his cabinet etc general * is certain colonel chesnut will be made one of the new * of * next came mr * who * informed us jeff davis would not get the vote of this congress for president so we might count him out mr * first told us how * a christian soldier was * how he prayed got up * his knees and led his men on to victory with a * and courage equal to any old * mighty man of war governor * account of prince * napoleon he is * and he is not handsome neither is he young and as he * our troops he was * * he heard him say en * of that he could * of his own knowledge and he was told he had been heard to say with * * more than once the sight of the battlefield had made the prince * and he received * a * of fiery * * seemed deeply interested in confederate * and * our * deeds to the * it was but soldier * our guests received though we did our best it was hard sleeping and worse * in camp beauregard is half * and * french like a native so one * * was done away with and it was a comfort to see beauregard speak without the agony of finding words in the foreign language and forming them with * brow into * a different fate * others who spoke a little french general and mrs * came to see us she is mrs smith lees sister they were talking of old george * virginia a name to * with george * * opposed the * of slavery he was a * * and gave as his reason for * the blessing of slaves to the new states * and * that * new people were * of so sacred a right as that of holding slaves it was not an institution intended for such people as they were mrs lee said after all what good does it do my sons that they are light horse * lees * and george * i do not see that it * them at all a friend in washington writes me that we might have walked into washington any day for a week after manassas such were the * and confusion there but the god * was still * his * in the woods now she says northern troops are * * in from all quarters the horses cover * of ground and she thinks we have lost our chance forever a man named grey the same gentleman whom secretary of war * so * by * him with well sir and what is your business described the battle of the #* as one * of * * by the * courage of the * who did not run away on our side doctor

united we stand divided we fall mrs davis showed us in the new york * an * from an * georgia paper saying * is our man davis is at heart a * we may be * on the * we know our * but mrs preston and myself have entered into an * our oath is * on high we mean to stand by our president and to stop all * with the powers that be if we can and where we can be the * generals or cabinet * * robert * says the * influence began this opposition to jeff davis before he had time to do wrong they were * not with him so much as with the man who was put into what they considered * * * place the latter had * * and secession so long that when he found his ideas taken up by all the confederate world he felt he had a * right to * * * * still writes to mr chesnut that the * among the * troops in that camp is fearful everybody seems to be doing all they can think of the british sick and wounded away off in the * our people are only a * journey by * from richmond with a grateful heart i record the

began talking of something else our people are * themselves into a fury against the prisoners only the * in any country would do that but i am told to be quiet * and * will not be forgotten and the prisoners will be treated as prisoners of war ought to be in a * country mrs randolph came with her were the * rose and * the men * over mrs * beauty called her a magnificent * of the * * of * rich

there ever in paris the show of soldiers preparing for the war such as he saw at new york the face of the earth seemed covered with marching regiments not more than # * men are in * * but they kept the whole yankee army at bay until * two then just as hampton was wounded and half his * shot * and * from mrs smith lee * how about * smith dashed in and not only turned the * but would have driven the * into washington but beauregard recalled them mr chesnut * all this very * as he posted many of the regiments and all the time was carrying orders over the field the * in all these private memories * him but he smiles * and * every man tell the * in his own way mr * says fame is an article usually home made you must * your own * or * their * and you must see that the newspapers * your

them he was so * * to my husband that i found him very pleasant company found it quite * to have a spy * his tea with * because i knew his * i did not like his face he is said to have a scheme by which washington will fall into our hands like an * * mr * * mr chesnut to remain in the senate there are so many generals or men anxious to be he says mr chesnut can do his country most good by wise * where they are most needed i do not say to the contrary i dare not throw my influence on the army side for if anything happened mr miles told us last night that he had another letter from general beauregard the general wants to know if mr miles has delivered his message to colonel * mr miles says he has not done so neither does he mean to do it they must * these matters of * according to their own military * he is a * once more it is a * * colonel * ought to have reported to his commanderinchief and not made an independent report and published it he meant no * he is not yet used to the fine ways of war the new york * is so * it began by * to get * of us we were so * now that we are so willing to leave them to their * * they cry crush our enemy or they will * us the idea that we want to *

island mr * who was trying to save his sisters life lost his own and his childs people seem to die out of the army quite as much as in it mrs randolph * in all her beautiful * at an aid association the ladies were old and all wanted their own way they were * and * and the blood mounted * into mrs * * cheeks but she held her own with dignity and grace one of the causes of * was that mrs randolph proposed to * everything sent on equally with the yankee wounded and sick prisoners some were * from a christian point of view some * in * at the bare idea of putting our noble soldiers on a * with yankees living dying or dead fierce * were some of them august severe * who evidently had not been accustomed to hear the other side of any question from * and just old enough to find the last pleasure in life to * in * power to make their * felt a brother of doctor garnett has come fresh and straight from * mass and says or is said to have said with all the difference there is between the two that * up there is dead he came by * and * and says all the way through it was so sad mournful and quiet it looked like sunday i asked mr * if it were true senator * had turned * yes * is in the air every one will have a touch of it * could not stay in the cabinet why * of * he * too high a horse that is for so * a person as jeff davis i have tried to find out the * but i cant mr * has been

the horrors to be taken in at one glance then we went to the st charles horrors upon horrors again want of organization long * of dead and dying awful * a boy from home had sent for me he was dying in a * ill of fever next him a man died in * as we stood there i was making arrangements with a nurse * him to take care of this * but i do not remember any more for i * next that i knew of the doctor and mrs randolph were having me a * * put into a carriage at the door of the hospital fresh air i dare say brought me to as we drove home the doctor came along with us i was so * he said look at that georgia regiment marching there look at their servants on the * i have been * them making an estimate there is #* thousand dollars worth of negro property which can go off on its own * to the yankees whenever it * * of the * was at the presidents * de * wondered if a fellow did not feel a little * * his * in person at the house of a man whom he * daily in his * a * an * engaged to two young ladies in the same house the ladies had been * but became friends * when his * among many other * was revealed under that august roof fancy the * when it all came out mr * said we have already * one good result from the war the * the * the furious * that could hardly be held down and who were so * anxious to do or die for their * had been the * of our lives now they either have not tried the battlefield at all or have * left it at their * * for very shame we are * of them for a while i doubt it * speech is dead against us reading this does not * one mr * says * lead to * to be always * is to be always false so both we and the yankees are * as * our own * how about * were there ever more * lies than the * * mr * went on people dare not tell the truth in a * they must * their * now everybody in a * always wants an office at least everybody in richmond just now seems to want one never * * he went on as a nation the english are the most * in the world and so are our country gentlemen they own their * least in some of the * where there are few * only immense * * by negroes * * of the lies that were told on both sides in the british * with france england kept quite * of her * in that fine art england * then as * as russell lies about us now went to see agnes de * my columbia school friend she is fresh from * and i wished to hear of the * the * the * the * and the * but her head ran upon washington life such as we knew it and her soul was here no * was possible but a discussion of the * war news mr * * secretary of state says we spend two * a week where is all that money to come from they dont want us to * cotton but to make provisions now cotton always means money or did when there was an * for it and * to buy it where is money to come from now mr * new * i dare say is a joe * but mr * laughed in telling it till he cried a man was * for * of court and then his case coming on the judge talked such * * and was so * in his mind against the poor man that the * one walked up and handed the august judge a * bill why what is that for said the judge oh i feel such a * of this court coming on again i came up tired to death took down my hair had it hanging over me in a * jane * and sat still hands over my head half * but too * and * to move i was sitting in a * by an open window taking my ease and the cool night air when suddenly the door opened and captain walked in he was in the middle of the room before he saw his mistake he * and was * as the * say i dare say i looked an ancient * then with a more * * he turned and fled without a word i got up and * the door after him and then looked in the glass and laughed myself into * i shall never forget to * the door again but it does not matter in this case i looked * * the person bearing my name who covered with lace cap etc * the drawingroom i doubt if he would know me again the terror has full * at the north now all the papers favorable to us have been * how long would our * stand a yankee paper here but newspapers against our government such as the * and the * * like green * a man up to the * in * said today * story is all * they do sometimes pay out two * a week they paid the soldiers this week but they dont pay the soldiers every week not by a long shot cried a soldier * with a * why do you write in your * at all some one said to me if as you say you have to * every day what you wrote yesterday because i tell the * as it is told to me i write * * i do not * for anything we went to * that very best of * * from there we went to miss * * hospital * with good things for the wounded the men under miss * kind care looked so * and * one might say they were pleasant and nice to see one however was * in tone and * and he repeated at * with no change of words in a * * what a hard time we have had since we left home but nobody seemed to * his * and it did not * his * at mrs * who was * so * she will not even admit that the president is ill all * but what good could * to be ill do him that reception now was not that a * such a failure mrs * could have done better than that mrs * is a * beauty with such magnificent * she was an * and is so * with richmond accustomed as she is to being a belle under different conditions as she is as handsome and well dressed as ever it must be the men who are all wrong did you give * that * bill to go out and change it i was asked suppose he takes himself off to the yankees he would leave us with not too many * * he is not going * however i think his situation * him that * * of mine with the gold pieces * in has made me ashamed more than once i leave it under my pillow and my maid * it there and * it over the back of a chair in evidence as i * the room after breakfast when i forget and leave my trunk open * * me the * and tells me you * to do so miss mary mr chesnut leaves all his little money in his * and * says thats why he cant let any one but himself * * * clothes * * and james * came the latter has been * treated a man said all that i wish on earth is to be at peace and on my own plantation to which mr * replied quietly i wish i had a plantation to be on but just now i cant see how any one would feel * in leaving the army mr * was bitter against the spirit of * so * among us the gentleman who had been answered so completely by james * said with * those women who are so * for their husbands to join the army would like them killed no doubt things were growing rather * but an * came in the * of a * an old * of mr * * just now fresh from * his * so quickly that mr chesnut had hardly time to tell us that in * college they called him * * he was so * he entered he is * still but the service and * rough life have destroyed all * and * he will never be so pretty again the north is * they move as one man with no states but an army organized by the * power russell in the northern camp is * of yankees for that bull run letter russell in his capacity of * * both sides he * us equally into north and south he * to * our victory at bull run to yankee * rather than to southern courage he gives no credit to either side for good qualities we are after all mere * everything not national is arrested it looks like the business of seward i do not know when i have seen a woman without * in her hand * for the soldiers is the cry one poor man said he had * of * and but one * he preferred more * and * * we make a * appearance with this * of * and the * * * below they have arrested * b * and miss * she * * herself a * why should she seek a * crown writing people love * it is so delightful to be of enough consequence to be arrested i have often wondered if such * was ever offered as * * * and * * of madame de * russell once more to whom london paris and * have been an * sight and * too streets and all how * for him to go on in * because there have been women on negro * who were not * * negro women get married and after marriage * as well as other people * is the * of their lives they take life easily so do their class everywhere bad men are * here as elsewhere i hate slavery i hate a man * say there are no more fallen women on a plantation than in london in * to numbers but what do you say to * a * who * a * black * with its * under the same roof with his lovely white wife and his beautiful and accomplished daughters he * his head high and * as the * of all human * to these poor women whom god and the laws have given him from the height of his awful * he * and * at them as if he never did wrong in his life fancy such a man finding his daughter reading * * you with that * book he would say and then he would order her out of his sight you see mrs * did not * the * spot she makes * a * remember george * and his * oh i know half a * man said to be as cruel as * but the other half of him did not * he was a man of * * and the best husband and father and member of the church in the world can that be so yes i know it * case that sort of thing always and i knew the * half of * well he was high and mighty but the * creature to his slaves and the unfortunate results of his bad ways were not sold had not to * over * they were kept in full view and provided for * in his will the wife and daughters in the might of their * and * are supposed never to dream of what is as plain before their eyes as the * and they play their parts of * * to the letter they * to * the father as the * of all * * well yes if he is rich he is the * from whence all * * the one i have in my * half of * the * * so furious in * and * his * so at the poor women they were glad to let him do as he pleased in peace if they could only escape his * * and * * making everybody so * * do you know any woman of this * who would stand that sort of thing no never not for one moment the * * were of the last century we know and we wont have it the condition of women is * it seems women are brought up not to judge their fathers or their husbands they take them as the lord * and are * if they should not go to heaven after all think what lives most women lead no heaven no * * other thing never i believe in future * and * how about the * of * i heard a woman say once to a friend of her husband tell it as a cruel matter of fact without bitterness without comment oh you have not seen him he has changed he has not gone to bed * in thirty years she has had her * if not the other thing here in this world we all know what a * man is to think for no crime a person may be * to live with one thirty years you * from the question i asked are southern men worse because of the slave system and the * black women not a bit they see too much of them the * people dont drink the * people * * they are sick of the black sight of them you think a nice man from the south is the * thing in the world i know it put him by any other man and see have seen yankee letters taken at manassas the * is often * and we thought they had all gone through a course of * * * * our soldiers do * * there is * * they say he cant read his own * but he is * enough and * all * he says in his paper that in our army the north has a hard * to * and that the rank and * of our army is superior in education and general intelligence to * my * imagination will not picture mr * as a * he will say * for * and he will call himself * and he will wear a dress coat to breakfast over here whatever a * does is right in his own eyes he is above law somebody asked him how he pronounced his * * name she was a miss * from philadelphia they say the english will like mr * he is so * so * so * and bold a fine old english gentleman so said russell to me but for * i like mr * and mr * better than * else and yet they are * * now you just listen to me said i is mrs davis in * well this sending mr * to london is the * thing yet worse in some points of view than * and that was a * no more * * but the * * the mighty russell of the times he says the battle of the #* was fought at long range # yards apart were the * the confederates were steadily retreating when some * in the wagon train frightened the * and they made * in good english they fled * and on our side we were too frightened to follow * * english to * the flying foe in spite of all this there are * of the truth sometimes and the story * to our credit with all the * and * when he * of the yankees * * * and * the best words are in his mouth he * the * * so often * and denied that we were * to wounded prisoners dr * told me that their * has written to thank our * yankee officers write very * from russell i know that in that hospital with the sisters of charity they were better off than our men were at the other * that i saw with my own eyes these poor souls are * guarded night and day it is a * * they tell of their * women who come before the public are in a bad box now false hair is taken off and * for papers * are * all manner of things they say come over the * under the huge * now worn so they are * torn off not * but arms are looked for under * and sad to say found then women are used as * and * to see that no men * over in * so the poor * coming this way are * to the * degree to men glory honor praise and power if they are * to women daughters of * * comes still in some * do what they will mary * eyes were * from her head with * while a very large and handsome south * talked rapidly what is it asked i after he had gone oh what a year can bring * year last summer you remember how he * he was in love with me he told you he told me he told everybody and if i did refuse to marry him i believed him now he says he has seen fallen in love with * and married another person and he * of his little daughters beauty and they say time goes * spoke mary * with a sigh of wonder at his wonderful * time works * said the * what conclusion did you come to as to southern men at the grand * you know they are * than the * gentlemen you know there are not too many of that kind * ours are generous * brave * to us you know a southern husband is not a bad thing to have about the house mrs frank hampton said for one thing you could not * with these south * they would not stay at the * degree of * they grow so * in earnest before you know where you are do you think two married people ever lived together without finding each other out i mean knowing exactly how good or how * how weak or how strong above all how * each was yes unless they are * they know to a * but you see if they have common sense they make believe and get on so so like the * * wine in old curiosity * a violent attack upon the north today in the * they mean to let freedom * a while until they * us the * says they use * de * * and all the * * of * * russell * the tramp of the coming * king and * * that is to rule them is it * * we may * when he comes we down here have only the * * thing armed * our * * among themselves mcclellan is of a * spirit he does not * * * upon yankees but with good policy has russell with him as a guest the * of an * * as one who knows that sumter andersons heart is with us that he will not fight the south after all is said and done that sounds like * sumter andersons wife was a daughter of governor * of georgia does that explain it he also told me something of garnett who was killed at rich mountain he had been an * man clear through in the army before the war the * had found him proud reserved and * cold as an * to all but for his wife and child he was a different creature he * them and * for nothing else one day he went off on an expedition and was gone six weeks he was out in the * and the indians were * when he came back his wife and child were * he said not one word but they found him more * stern and * than ever that was all the night before he left richmond he said in his quiet way they have not given me an * force i can do nothing they have sent me to my death it is * that he threw away his * * man said the * and the * on the front steps every evening we take our * and * at our pleasure a * or more agreeable set of people were never assembled than our present arlington crowd tonight it was * who occupied our * send a man to england who had killed his * in a street * that was not knowing england or * surely who wants * we want somebody who can hold his * people avoid great * men who * men given to * as they would avoid fire * or * * will have no * to * no * * will be possible * as are his of their kind but little quiet conversation is best with slow * * people who begin to * as soon as any * of * * their ear if * should use his fine words who would care for them over there * * when

and * that kind of british * takes me it is not * * * not a bit of it but now my * stand firm and now up and let them have it our name has not gone out of * today the * as usual * into the president it thinks * * * * or chesnut would have been far better in the office there is considerable choice in that lot five men more utterly * were never named in the same * a painful piece of news came to us * cousin mrs * of society hill was found dead in her bed she was quite well the night before killed people say by family * she was a proud and * woman nothing * in word thought or * ever came * her she was of a warm and tender heart too truth and * itself few persons have ever been more loved and looked up to she was a very handsome old lady of fine presence * and commanding killed by family * so they said when mrs john * * died so uncle john said yesterday of his brother * death * the army said that * old soul and takes fancy * of the most * kind nearer home the high and * conduct our enemies seem to expect of us is * and * praise they pay us the * to look for from us and * us for the want of it a degree of * they were never able to * themselves it is a * * for us to hold still in slavery those * whom they brought here from * or sold to us when they found it did not pay to own them themselves gradually they * or sold them off down here or * them * giving themselves years in which to get * of them in a * way we want to spread them over other lands * and south or * where the * would free them or kill them or * them out of the world as our friends up north do the indians if they had been forced to keep the negroes in new england i dare say the negroes might have shared the indians fate for they are wise in their * these yankee children of light those * * so have just spoken mr chesnut and uncle john both * union men now utterly for state rights it is * how different the same man may appear * from different * what a perfect gentleman said one person of another so * * distinguished easy free and above all graceful in his bearing so * he is always * at any * of * he is * man of all others i like to have strangers * noble * of our country yes every word of that is true was the reply he is all that and then the other side of the picture is true too you can always find him you know where to find him wherever there is a * a * or a woman there will he be also my god and you call yourself his friend yes i know him down to the ground this conversation i * from an upper window when looking down on the * * * character truly beyond la * what mrs preston calls * spread thin until it is * only an iron steamer has run the * at savannah we now * our * heads like flowers after a * this drop of good news * us * s c february # #* an * for my * breakfast always breakfast in bed now but then my * contained such bad news that is an * style of * * fort * has fallen but no men fell with it it is prisoners for them that we can not spare or prisoners for us that we may not be able to * that is so much to be * as * says they lost six thousand we two thousand i * that * in vain alas * gallant * but * again they make a stand we have * beauregard and * * johnston with such leaders and gods help we may be saved from the * yankees who knows a crowd collected here last night and there was a * i am like mrs * who never saw a horse coming full speed but she thought

* that georgia is not the only place where good men have been so ill used the governor and council have * the * or at least the * they talk of making a call for all silver etc i doubt if we have enough to make the sacrifice worth while but we * to set the example what a beautiful day for our confederate president to be * god speed him god keep him god save him john * letter was quite what we needed in spirit it is all that one could ask he says our late * are acting * with the army of the potomac a few more * and every man will * for the war * made us too * and easy not to say * now for the * and let them have it a lady wrote to mrs * dear * when shall i call for you to go and see madame de st * she was answered dear * i can not go with you to see madame de st * but will always * the * feeling toward you on account of our past relations etc the * friend wrote to ask what all this meant no answer came and then she sent her husband to ask and demand an explanation he was answered thus my dear fellow there can be no explanation possible * there will be no * between my wife and yours simply that nothing more so the men meet at the * as before and there is no further trouble between them the lady upon whom the * is cast says and i am a woman and cant fight while mr chesnut was in town i was at the * john * and some other prisoners had asked to walk over the grounds visit the hampton * and some friends in columbia after the dreadful state of the public mind at the escape of one of the prisoners general preston was obliged to refuse his request mrs preston and the rest of us wanted him to say yes and so find out who in columbia were his * friends pretty bold people they must be to receive yankee * in the midst of the * over one enemy already turned * amid us general

never * those * * and * they had themselves a good and * country a good constitution and were satisfied but they had to * leave all and fight for the others who brought on all the trouble and who do not show too much * to fight for themselves that is the extreme * view the extreme * says jeff davis is not enough out of the union yet his * address * as one of his * did four years ago in the united states senate a letter in a morning paper * mr chesnut of * too long in charleston the editor was asked for the * name he gave it as little * the * secretary when little * was spoken to in a great *

with me from columbia she found a man there tall enough to take her in to * * who is six feet four the same height as her father tom was very handsome in his uniform and mary prepared for a nice time but he looked as if he would so much rather she did not talk to him and he set her such a good example saying never a word old colonel chesnut came for us when the train stopped * * black was seen on his box as * and perfect in his way as his * * but the old colonel would stop and * up the * little negro i ever saw who was crying by the * this ragged little black * was made to * up and sit beside

ill at * and never left my room doctor * came more military than * colonel chesnut brought him up also * who said he was down in the mouth our men were not fighting as they should we had only * and * and a * spirit of fighting to * their weight in men and * of war i wish i could remember * words this is only his idea his language was * and * * but no end of sense and good feeling old colonel chesnut * a word began his * saying numbers will tell napoleon you know etc etc at * the war has been ever * off but * to take the silver came very near * that we had before the revolution silver that

men who would not * step into jeff * shoes with a firm * that they would do better in every respect than he does the * * the * * of these * it is pleasant to hear mrs * on this subject when they begin to shake their heads and tell us what jeff davis ought to do in the * battle the other day we had twentyfive guns in all the enemy had * in the * * in the st * besides a * of gunboats filled with * cannon why not they can have as many as they please no * * * their powers the whole * world being * to * in ours is only this one little spot of * * or * which * us in with only the sky open to us and

and * from the poor old blind * * everybody is * him to let off students * and other from going into the army one comfort is that the boys will go mr chesnut * wait until you have saved your country before you make * and * when you have a country there will be no * of * students * to * and * it he says he is a * man that idea is to get every possible man into the ranks professor le * is an able * he has * to * and carry on the * * very first attempted in the confederacy and mr chesnut is proud of it it is a brilliant success thanks to le * mr chesnut * * letters * him to arrest the judge as * they say he is a dangerous and * person his * of jeff davis and the council is * mr chesnut * and * the letters into the fire * to jeff davis says he * to the council that dont count he knows what he is about he would not * his country for the world read uncle * * again these negro women have a chance here that women have * else they can * * * can they can marry * and nothing is remembered against these colored ladies it is not a nice * but mrs * * in it how * * a feeling it must be to rise superior and fancy we are so * as to defend and like to live with such * * around * men as * and his women the best way to take negroes to your heart is to get as far away from them as possible as far as i can see southern women do all that * could do to prevent and * * the social evil has not been * in old england or in new england in london or in boston people in those places expect more * from a plantation * than they can * in * among themselves with all their own high moral * education * and support lady mary * says only men and women at last * and female * he them says the bible there are cruel graceful beautiful mothers of * * north as well as south i dare say the northern men and women who came here were always * for they expected an * to work and * as a white man we do not i have often thought from observation truly that perfect beauty * the heart and as to grace what so graceful as a * a * or a * much love admiration * * an * heart it * utterly * and * it * to receive all and to give nothing it even * the excitement of seeing people suffer i speak now of what i have watched with horror and * * i have known but none that were * or * * are * in the heaven of mrs * imagination people cant love things * * and * simply because they ought to do so but they can be good to them at a distance thats easy you see i can not rise very high i can only judge by what i see thank god for a ship it has run the * with arms and ammunition there are no negro * relations half so * as * and yet the united states government makes no * of receiving * into its sacred heart mr * said england held her hand over the * and the * * to save and protect him slaves * and all but she * up the * of her eyes at us when slavery bad as it is is * out into freedom every moment through christian * they do not * the * even his * and * * to a * wife it is here * the * there * the sea etc and france

and active as a * of a curiosity that knows no * black and * also she knows a * at first sight and she is honest i fancy the negroes are ashamed to rob people as * as james chesnut and myself one night just before we left the * house mr chesnut had forgotten to tell some * thing to governor * who was to leave on a public mission next day so at the dawn of day he put on his * and went to the * room he found the door * and the governor fast asleep he shook him * the governor sprang up and threw his arms around mr * neck and said * is it you the mistake was rapidly set right and the * * was given his instructions mr chesnut came into my room threw himself on the sofa and nearly laughed himself to * * again and again the * tone of the * * mr chesnut calls * * but says he is simply perfect as a servant mary * said i thought cousin james the * man alive until i knew his man * * will not move an * or * a finger for any one but his master mrs * * sent him on an * * too was very * hours

from our * at * his * * * had two horses shot under him the old colonel has his * thats enough for glory and no hurt after all he * however with his * * we cant fight all the world two and two only make four it cant make a thousand numbers will not lie he says he has lost half a * already in railroad bonds bank * western notes of hand not to speak of negroes to be * and lands to be * for he takes the * views of all things * * * * * say the * * has passed the forts at new orleans down into the very * of despair are we new orleans gone and with it the confederacy that mississippi * us if lost the confederacy has been done to death by the * what wonder we are lost the soldiers have done their duty all honor to the army * as busy as * about their own places or their personal honor too busy to see the enemy at a distance with a * they were * their own interests or their own * * the interests of the people they represented they were * * * to * the government no matter how * it may be nothing can be kept from the enemy they must * themselves night and day what they are doing or the * * will forget them this fall of new orleans means utter ruin to the private * of the * mr preston came from new orleans so satisfied with * * and the tremendous * he saw there while in new orleans burnside offered mr preston five hundred thousand dollars a * due to him from burnside and he refused to take it he said the money was * in * hands than his and so it may prove so * is the * now burnside is wide * he is not a man to be caught * mary preston was saying she had asked the * how they * the idea of being * if the country is saved none of us will care for that sort of thing * and * mr chesnut came in saying * has been * from new orleans that the great * louisiana went down at the first shot mr chesnut and mary preston walked off first to the * and then to the * a grand * the news from new orleans fatal to us met mr * he wanted to know where he could find a place of safety for two hundred negroes i looked into his face to see if he were in earnest then to see if he were * there was a certain set of two hundred negroes that had grown to be a * apparently all the white men of the family had felt bound to stay at home to take care of them there are people who still believe negroes * * * who insisted that the * would only be a little * after all these negroes however were * * a * different part of speech he gave * to one company and forty thousand dollars to another he is away with our army at * so i said you may * upon mr chesnut who will assist you to his * in finding a home for these people nothing belonging to that * gentleman shall come to grief if we have to take charge of them on our own place mr chesnut did get a place for them as i said he would had to go to the * or they would think we had * the black flag heard there we are going to be * as * beat the * superior arms mexican * and * made a poor showing in the face of * * our enemies have such superior * of war we hardly any but what we capture from them in the * the * and the * were in the same * war seems a game of * but we have an * number of * to begin with we have * * * * and * enough but our * generals whenever they can not * the board to suit them exactly burn up everything and march away we want them to save the country they seem to think their whole duty is to destroy * and save the army mr robert * wrote that he had to * his head for south carolina we had not furnished our * of the new * five thousand men today colonel chesnut published his statement to show that we have sent thirteen thousand instead of the mere number required of us so mr * can hold up his head again the last day of this month of * * left the women and children to be * and took the army to a safe place i do not understand why we do not send the women and children to the safe place and let the army stay where the fighting is to be armies are to save not to be saved at least to be saved is not their * * exactly if this goes on the spirit of our people will be broken one * of comfort comes from henry * our army of the * is fine so good i do not think mcclellan will venture to attack it so * it be mine is a painful * task but why write when i have nothing to * but disaster so i read instead first * then * two * of the * certainly and then a * * of * * food enough for thought in every one of this * * of books at the * where i am * because mr chesnut has gone to see his * old father whom he loves and who is reported ill i met * hampton he tells us wigfall is out on a * wants them to strike for maryland the presidents opinion of the move is not given also mr hampton met the first lieutenant of the * e m * says he is just the same man he was in the south carolina college in whatever company you may meet him he is the * man there a telegram * we have repulsed the enemy at williamsburg oh if we could drive them back to their * * richmond was hard pressed this day the * of today says jeff davis now * all men as if they were * * mary preston said all sisters * no we never * i and mine we keep all our bitter words for our enemies we are frank * we hate our enemies and love our friends some people our kind can never make up after a * hard words once only and all is over to us * is impossible * means calm * * while love * * of loves * is impossible those * * who * * * not care one * for their husbands i settled that in my own mind years ago some people think it * to praise their enemies and to show their * and justice by * the * of their friends i am for the simple rule the good old plan i praise whom i love and * whom i hate mary preston has been * * aloud we are provided with * * mrs * * and * and we show how each * the passage mary is to * into english in * at one point of the * and * scene i like carlyle better than * though they say * * is the only * in the world half so good as the original mrs * repeated some beautiful * by * which i had never heard before she is to

letter not beauregard but the soldiers who stopped to drink the * they had captured from the enemy lost us * * * is as dead as he ever will be now what matters it who killed him mr chesnut says he is very glad he went to town everything in charleston is so much more * than it is reported troops are in good spirits it will take a lot of * to take that city * hayne said at dinner yesterday that both beauregard and the president had a great opinion of mr * natural ability for * and military * * mr * * that is mr * had been told so by the president then why did not the president offer me something better than an * i heard he offered to make you a general last year and you said you could not go over other * shoulders until you had * * you are too hard to please no not exactly that i was only

with the purpose to prevent lees receiving * from there sat down at my window in the beautiful moonlight and tried hard for pleasant thoughts a man began to play on the * with piano * first ever of * i am * * and then the long long weary day at first i found this but a * to the beautiful scene and it was * to my * * but * * last * was too much i broke down * what a bitter cry came forth with such * of tears the wonder is there was any of me left i learn that richmond women go in their * for the wounded carry them home and nurse them one saw a man too weak to hold his * she took it from him put it on her shoulder and helped the poor fellow along if ever there was a man who could control every expression of emotion who could play * or an * chief it is james chesnut but one day when he came in from the council he had to own to a * he was * ashamed of his * there was a letter from mrs * asking him to help her and he tried to read it to the council she wanted a permit to go on to her son who lies wounded in virginia colonel chesnut could not control his voice there was not a dry eye there when suddenly one man called out god bless the woman johnston * * says he left his chief mortally wounded on the battlefield just before johnston * went to * to take a hand in the war there for freedom i met him one day at mrs frank * a number of people were present some one spoke of the engagement of the beautiful miss to * rose some one else asked how do you know they are engaged well i never heard it but i saw it in london a month or so ago i entered mrs s drawingroom and i saw these two young people seated on a sofa opposite the door well that * to nothing no not in itself but they looked so * and so happy i have noticed * engaged people always look that way and so on johnston * was white and red in quick * during this turn of the conversation he was in a rage of * and * i think this kind of talk is taking a liberty with the young * name he exclaimed finally and that it is an * in us i fancy him left dying alone i wonder what they * who are left to die of their * the battlefield free * are not everything as witness this * yankee * found in camp show how * they can be with all their * * fredericksburg is * * * * and we read to my * brother etc for the first time in my life no books can interest me life is so real so utterly earnest that * is * nothing but what is going on in this * world of ours can arrest my attention for ten minutes at a time battles * near richmond with * of charleston beauregard is said to be fighting his way out or in mrs * is here at doctor * tears are always in her eyes her * son is * * lieutenant they are down on the coast she * that she has no hope at all she was a miss * of philadelphia and says we may look for burnside now our troops which held him down to his iron * have been withdrawn they are three to one against us now and they have hardly begun to put out their * numbers i mean we have come to the end of our * except we wait for the * * of boys as they grow up to the * age she would make * the most * person alive as a general rule says mrs * government people are * but the son of one high * whispered to mary g as he handed her into the car richmond is bound to go the idea now is that we are to be * out if they shut us in * the agony it can then have but one end mrs preston and i speak in * but mrs * * * and * out she says there are our soldiers since the world began there never were better but god does not * to send us a general worthy of them i do not mean * or military old * who will not fight until everything is just so the real ammunition of our war is faith in ourselves and enthusiasm in our cause west point * down on enthusiasm * it to * it wants * and now comes a new danger these * they are * their * and they * and * at the * who fight dont you see this stonewall how he * the soldiers hearts he will be our leader * after all they say he does not care how many are killed his business is to save the country not the army he * to win god bless him and he * if they do not want to be killed they can stay at home they say he leaves the sick and wounded to be * for by those whose business it is to do so his business is war they say he wants to * the black flag have a short sharp decisive war and end it he is a christian soldier beauregard retreating and his * cut off if * veterans will not stand why should we expect our * * * to do it the yankee general who is * savannah * his orders are to take savannah in two weeks time and then proceed to * charleston from the face of the earth * * was killed in the battle of june 1st last summer when a * fell in the very thick of his company he picked it up and threw it into the water think of that those of * who love

richmond he came to see me never did man enjoy life more the preston girls were * at my house then and it was very gay for the young soldiers who ran down from the army for a day or so we had heard of him as usual * * * at sharpsburg and he asked if he should chance to be wounded would i have him brought to clay street he was shot at chancellorsville leading his men the surgeon did not think him mortally wounded he sent me a message that he was coming at once to our house he knew he would soon get well there also that i need not be * those yankees could not kill me he asked one of his friends to write a letter to his mother afterward he said he had another letter to write but that he wished to sleep first he felt so exhausted at his request they then turned his face away from the light and left him when they came again to look at him they found him dead he had been dead for a long time it was bitter cold wounded men lost much blood and were * in that way they * warm * and all * many died who might have been saved by one good hot drink or a few * of * food one of the generals said to me fire and reckless courage like captain * are * such men in an army are * losses like this * us indeed but i must not * longer around the memory of the * of the * true * of our old * gallant gay * b c august #* * * drove down to my sisters in his heavy * english * with * and strong horses to * i

prayed for me most * there was i down on my knees * with rage and fury * w said it was a clear case of * a fellow when he was down afterward the fun of it all struck me and i found it difficult to keep from * with laughter it was not an * religious exercise to say the least as far as i was * before chancellorsville was fatal sharpsburg my friend colonel means killed on the battlefield his only son * wounded and a prisoner his wife had not recovered from the death of her other child * who had died of * early in the war she was lying on a bed when they told her of her husbands death and then they tried to keep * condition from her they think now that she * and believed him dead too she threw something over her face she did not utter one word she remained quiet so long some one removed the light shawl which she had thrown over her head and found she was dead miss mary * her sister said afterward no wonder how was she to face life without her husband and children that was all she had ever lived for these are sad unfortunate memories let us run away from them what has not my husband been doing this year 1862 when all our south carolina troops are in virginia here we were without

our very * before our eyes a party had come to columbia who said they had run the * had come in by flag of * etc colonel * asked me to look around and see if i could * out the * * it was easily done we were all in a sadly * condition we had come to the end of our good clothes in three years and now our only * was to turn them * down or inside out and in * * * etc near me on the train to alabama sat a young woman in a * dress of bright yellow she wore a * of * had pink cheeks was * * and easy in her manner and was absorbed in a * with a confederate major who in spite of his nice new gray uniform and two stars had a very yankee face fresh * sharp utterly * * * handsome what more in * can one say of ones enemies two other women * this man and woman and we knew them to be * by their good clothes one of these women was a * she it was who had * them i found that out afterward the * of the three women had a hard northern face but all were in splendid * as to * flowers lace and * if they were * why were they so * as to * of new york and * us * with the other side all the time and in loud * * surely that was not the way to pass * in the confederacy a man came in stood up and read from a paper the surrender of * i felt as if i had been struck a hard blow on the top of my head and my heart took one of its * * i was utterly * not long i dare say the first thing i heard was * of joy and * from the * party my rage and * were great a man within * of this party had slept through everything he had a * face eager and * when * but now he was as one of the seven * colonel * wrote on a * page of my book one of de * note is there now that the * was a richmond * finally hot and tired out we arrived at west point on the * river the * cars were quite still except for the * * of the yellow * and her major two confederate officers walked in i felt * in the air one touched the * major who was * to yellow * the major turned quickly instantly every drop of blood left his face a * seized his throat it was a * sight and at once i was * sorry for him he was marched out of the car poor yellow * color was fast but the * of her eyes were * of the three women * we never heard again they never do anything worse to women the * confederates than send them out of the country but when we read soon afterward of the execution of a * spy we thought of the major at * the boat waited for us and in my haste i * out of the * with dr robert * assistance but nearly broke my neck the * was high up in the * and they gave me a * over the * i paid out my confederate * of money freely to the maid in order to get out of that * surely go where we may * an alabama steamer in august lying under the * with the sun looking down will give one a * almost an * idea of * to come as far as heat goes the * of the floor burned ones feet under the * at * where we stayed nearly all * do not know why met james * who had lost # * of cotton at * and charged it all to jeff davis in his * which did not seem exactly * to me at * there was a horse for james * and he rode away * to have a carriage sent for me at once but he had to go seven miles on horseback before he reached my sister * and then * was to send back on that lonely * * and i remained with * * on every side and immense * the white people few or none in my heart i knew my husband was right when he * me to * this journey there was one living thing at this little * * white man who had a store opposite and oh how * he was hot as it was * kept up a fire of pine * there was neither lamp nor * in that deserted house the * man * over now and then * in hand he would stand with his * * * or go * * round us but always * in his * he nearly fell over us but i sprang out of his way as he asked well madam what can i do for you shall i ever forget the * of that night and the * my * * with * misery i sat upon a chair * on the floor with her head resting against my chair she was as near as she could get to me and i kept my hand on her * said she now i do believe you are * * of that poor * thing if he was * i could * him in a fair fight and * as he is i * throw him over the * * he so much as * you i dont value him a * taking heart from such brave words i laughed it seemed an * but the carriage came by ten oclock and then with the * as our sole * we poor women drove eight miles or more over a carriage road through long * * of * darkness with * on every side the house as we drew near looked like a * in a * so * and * were its * i found my mother ill in bed feeble still but better than i hoped to see her i knew you would come was her * with * hands then i went to bed in that silent house a house of the dead it seemed i supposed i was not to see my sister until the next day but she came in some time after i had gone to bed she kissed me quietly without a * she was thin and pale but her voice was calm and kind as she lifted the * over her head to show me something on the wall i saw that her pretty brown hair was white it was * hard not to burst out into violent * she looked so sweet and yet so utterly * but as she was without emotion apparently it would not become me to * her by my tears next day at noon * mothers old maid brought my breakfast to my * such a breakfast it was * could do no better it is ever so late i know to which * replied yes we would not let * * you what a splendid * you have here my daughter * is miss * * * well enough as times go but when our miss mary comes to see us i does it myself and she * down to the floor bless your old soul i cried and she rushed over and gave me a good * she is my mothers * has been her maid since she was six years old when she was bought from a virginia * along with her own mother and all her brothers and sisters she has been * until she is a rare old * at times she can do everything better than any one else and my mother * on her heavily * is * wife * is the butler they have over a dozen children and take life very easily * came in before i was out of bed and began at once in the same * way pale and cold as * to tell me of the death of her children it had happened not two weeks before her eyes were utterly without life no expression whatever and in a composed and sad sort of manner she told the * as if it were something she had read and wanted me to hear my * daughter mary had grown up to be a lovely girl she was between thirteen and * you know baby kate had my sisters gray eyes she was evidently to be the beauty of the family strange it is that here was one of my children who has lived and has gone and you have never seen her at all she died first and i would not go to the funeral i thought it would kill me to see her put under the ground i was lying down * with grief when aunt * came to me after the funeral with this news mary has that awful * too there was nothing to say i got up and dressed instantly and went to mary i did not leave her side again in that long struggle between life and death i did everything for her with my own hands i even prepared my darling for the grave i went to her funeral and i came home and walked straight to my mother and i begged her to be * i would bear it all without one word if god would only spare me the one child left me now * has never shed a * but has grown twenty years older cold hard * with the same * of manner she began to go over all the details of * illness i had not given up hope no not at all as i sat by her side she said * put your hand on my knees they are so cold i put my hand on her knee the cold struck to my heart i knew it was the * of death * put out her hand on me and it seemed to recall the feeling she fell forward in an agony of * that * for hours the doctor said this * was a blessing without it she must have died or gone mad while the mother was so bitterly * the little girl the last of them a bright child of three or four * into my bed now * she whispered i want to tell you all about * and * but they watch me so they say i must never talk about them * died because she * * i know that and then aunt * read * a letter and that made her die too * * says they have gone to god but i know the people saved a place between them in the ground for me

us mary preston gave him a * * he * a bible which he carried in his pocket he said his mother had given it to him he pressed a flower in it mary preston suggested that he had not worn or used it at all being fresh new and * kept every word of this the * heard as they marched by almost touching us they laughed and * and made their own rough * major * johnston did not get into the confederacy until after the first battle of manassas for some cause before he could * that * seward rang his little bell and sent him to a prison in the harbor of new york i forget whether he was exchanged or

into a state of * * as soon as he became the least startled or * in such times he seemed * to be * one eye at you he meant nothing by it and in point of fact did not know himself that he was doing it in mexico he had been wounded in the eye and the * * * of his will during the winter of 1862 and 1863 he was on * after a while he * down franklin street with us we proud to * our * to that of the wounded general his * continued * so when he sat down another chair had to be put before him on this he stretched out his * * straight as a * at that time he was our only wounded * and the girls waited on him and made life pleasant for him one night i listened to two * at once in a * state of mind between the two william * miles in a perfectly * voice in * * and low tones was * the happy end of his affair he had been engaged to sweet little * * and i gave him my * with all my heart it was a capital * * in every way good for her and good for him i was deeply interested in mr * story but there was * and * on the other hand old * our pet general sat * across the room with one * straight out like a * wrapped in red * * as red as a * in the face his head is * * like a * or an * * or as * said there are three * of it it is like a * * there he sat with a loud voice and a thousand * making love to mary p i make no excuse for listening it was impossible not to hear him i tried not to lose a word of mr * * as the despair of the * was * into my other ear i * an ear to each * mary can not altogether control her voice and her * * of * no no never etc utterly failed to * her wounded * * * of his * affection for her * said afterward we heard every word of it on our side of the room even when * * to him that he was talking too loud now * said we afterward do you think it was kind to tell him he was forty if he was a day strange to say the pet general * * his love in a day at least two days after he was heard to say that he was * * now to his cousin john * second daughter her name * but they called her * * campbell preston a lovely girl and with her he now drove rode and * on his * sent her his * and in due time * her from the same spot where he had * mary with * to marry him * was never so decided in her * as mary not so loud at * in * says * who always * what i have written and makes * of * or * so again he began to thunder in a womans ears his tender * as they rode down franklin street * says she knows the people on the * heard * of the conversation though she rode as rapidly as she could and she begged him not to talk so loud finally they dashed up to our door as if they had been running a race unfortunate in love but fortunate in war our general is now * new * with ewell in the valley or with the army of the potomac i think i have told how miles still so gently * me leaning told of his successful love while general * johnston * * * and disappointment over his * mr miles spoke of sweet little * * as if she had been a french girl just from a * kept far from the * of men * for him one would think to hear him that * had never cast those innocent blue eyes of hers on a man until he came along now since i first knew miss * in # when * * was to the * she has been followed by a * of men as long as a * * every summer at the springs their father appeared in the * a little before twelve and * the three beautiful * home before him in spite of all * and he was said to * away their too numerous * at all hours of the day this new engagement was * to me as a profound secret of course i did not mention it even to my own household next day little * * * and george * called as colonel * removed his * he said oh the miles and * * you heard of it no what is the * about they are engaged to be married thats all who told you miles himself as we walked down franklin street this afternoon and did he not beg you not to mention it as * did not wish it spoken of god bless my soul so he did and i forgot that part entirely colonel * begged the * * not to take his * * of faith too much to heart miss * engagement had caused him a dreadful night a young man who was his * friend came to his room in the * of despair and handed him a letter from miss * which was the cause of all his * not knowing that she was already * to miles he had proposed to her in an * letter in her reply she * stated that she was engaged to mr miles and instead of * her for putting him at once out of his misery he considered the reason she gave as * * the agony of the * and the * too late he * by * so much for a secret miss * and i became fast friends our friendship was * on a * admiration for the honorable member from south carolina colonel and mrs * and colonel and mrs chesnut were the only friends of mr miles who were invited to the wedding at the church door the * demanded our * no one but those whose names he held in his hand were allowed to enter not twenty people were * mere * * about the altar in that large church we were among the first to * then came a faint * and mrs * the * sister * in * for her young husband who had been killed within a year of her marriage came rapidly up the * alone she dropped upon her knees in the front * and there remained * during the whole ceremony a mass of black * and a dead weight on my heart she has had experience of war a * around richmond interrupted her marriage * * * in a year * her * was * and * upon the field of battle while the * turned our thoughts from her and * us with sympathy the bride advanced in white * and point * mrs * whispered that it was mrs * * that the bride had on she remembered the

for him they will soon be here and we shall know all about it unless * wife takes him to her grandfather poor * mother i am useless to my children mrs * said you need not be * the general said in his telegram that it was not a severe wound you know even yankees believe general lee that day mrs lee gave me a * of the general in a * taken soon after the mexican war she * it so much better than the later ones he certainly was a handsome man then * even than now i shall * it for mrs lees sake too she said old mrs chesnut and her aunt * custis mrs * were very * during * administration in philadelphia i told her mrs chesnut * was the * member of our family she had so much to tell of * times she was one of the * * of little * who scattered flowers before washington at * bridge which

nearly all that pleasant company are dead and our world the only world we * for * * to pieces and she cried we are two * women * here * robert * was in a desperate condition and mary * her daughter

sat * on the floor resting her head against my chair i * cold and * an officer who did not give his name but said he was from louisiana came up and urged me to go near the fire he gave me his seat by the fire where i found an old lady and two young ones with two men in the uniform of common soldiers we talked as easily to each other all night as if we had known one another all our lives we * the war the army the news of the day no questions were asked no names given no personal * whatever and yet if these men and women were not * and of the best sort i do not know ladies and gentlemen when i see them being a little surprised at the want of interest mr * and * showed in my * i walked out to see and i found them working like * they had been at it all night in the * my * were * they had first gathered up the contents and were trying to * up the * so as to make them once more * at petersburg a * dressed woman came in looked around in the crowd then asked for the seat by me now * seat was paid for the same as mine but she got up at once gave the lady her seat and stood behind me i am sure * * herself my * as well as my servant the lady then having arranged herself * in * seat began in * * to tell her melancholy * she was a widow she lost her husband in the battles around richmond soon some one went out and a man offered her the * seat straight as an * she went in for a * with the * gentleman another person a perfect stranger said to me well look yonder as soon as she began * about her dead * i knew she was after another one * indeed cried another * she said it was her husband husband or * all the same she wont lose any time it wont be her fault if she * have another one soon but the grand scene was the night before the cars crowded with soldiers of course not a human being that i knew an * woman so announced by her * came in she marched up and down the car * * the want of * in the men who would not make way for her two men got up and gave her their * saying it did not matter they were going to get out at the next * she was * with the most pronounced * i ever heard and she gave us a taste of it she continued to say that the men ought all to get out of that that car was * only for ladies she placed on the * seat next to her a large * she continued to * until she fell asleep a tired soldier coming in seeing what he supposed to be an empty seat quietly slipped into it * went the glass the soldier * the * woman * the man was * cut by the broken glass she was simply a mad woman she shook her * in his face said she was a * woman and he had got into that seat for no good purpose how did he dare * i do not think the man uttered a word the * took him into another car to have the pieces of glass picked out of his clothes and she continued to * mr * * aloud and laughed as if he were in the * swamp the womans * * and * * were * no doubt soon the car was silent and i fell into a comfortable * i felt * give me a gentle shake listen * how loud * * * is talking and all about * * and our business and to strangers its a shame is he saying any * of us no * not that he is * for dear life * how * * * is and how rich he is an all that i * tell him

husband * him * he soon ceased to talk * * and * down to his usual strong common sense i knew it was quite late but i had no idea of the hour my husband * me out it is all your fault said he what why will you * in looking so interested in all wigfall is saying dont let him catch your eye look into the fire did you not hear it strike two this attack was so sudden so violent so * for i could only laugh * however as an * wife i went back * took my seat and looked into the fire i did not even dare * my eyes to see what my husband was * he too looked into the fire wigfall soon tired of so * an audience and took his departure general * was here he was one of * generals so i listened with all my ears when he said stonewall could not sleep so every two or three nights you were * up by orders to have your brigade in marching order before daylight and report in person to the commander then you were marched a few miles out and then a few miles in again all this was to make us ready ever on the * and the end of it was this jacksons men would go half a days march before * longstreet * and * i think there is a popular * about the amount of praying he did he certainly preferred a fight on sunday to a * * to * a fight he loved best a long * * * to the * he had shown small sympathy with human * he was a * man he looked upon * men and * as the same thing he * all who were weak and weary who * by the * as men * in patriotism if a mans face was as white as cotton and his * so low you * could feel it he looked upon him merely as an * soldier and rode off * he was the true * of all great soldiers like the successful * of the world he did not value human life where he had an object to accomplish he could order men to their death as a matter of course his soldiers * him to the death faith they had in him stronger than death their respect he commanded i doubt if he had so much of their love as is talked about while he was alive now that they see a few more years of stonewall would have * them from the yankees they * him any man is proud to have been one of the famous stonewall brigade but be sure it was bitter hard work to keep up with him as all know who ever served under him he gave his orders rapidly and distinctly and rode away never * answer or * it was look * that * it when you failed you were * to be put under arrest when you reported the place taken he only said good spent * dollars today for a little tea and * and have five hundred left my husbands pay never has paid for the * of our * he came in with dreadful news just now i have wept so often for things that never happened i will * my tears now for a * today a poor woman threw herself on her dead husbands coffin and kissed it she was * bitterly so did i in sympathy my husband as i told him today could see me and everything that he loved * drawn and * without moving a * if a crowd were looking on he could have the same gentle * performed on himself and make no sign to all of which violent * he answered in * tones so would any * man * * at * more * in that particular than we are * * grief never * me at all it * me * is what we all need you are a * of * * is what you need so you are * i said some day i mean to be come here mrs chesnut said mary preston today they are * general hood out of his carriage here at your door mrs * promptly had him borne into her drawingroom which was on the first floor mary preston and i ran down and greeted him as * and as cordially as if nothing had happened since we saw him standing before us a year ago how he was waited upon some * * were brought him how kind people are said he not once since i was wounded have i ever been left without * hard as it is to get now the money value of friendship is easily * now said some one * are five dollars * mrs davis and mrs * came we had * brought in for them and then a * explanation of the * * of which * j is the * we walked home with mrs davis and met the president riding alone surely that is wrong it must be * for him when there are so many * not to speak of * negroes * harrison says mr davis * to go alone and there is none to * him my husband laid the law down last night i felt it to be the last drop in my full cup no more * in this house said he this is no time for * and * and you said you brought me here to enjoy the winter before you took me home and turned my face to a dead wall he is the master of the house to hear is to obey drove out with mrs davis she had a watch in her hand which some poor dead soldier wanted to have sent to his family first we went to her * then we drove to the fair grounds where the band was playing suddenly she * the watch she remembered having it when we came out of the * we drove back instantly and there the watch was lying near the steps of the little * in front of the house no one had passed in apparently in any case no one had seen it preston hampton went with me to see * cary the talk was * literary which preston thought hard on him i had just brought the st * number of * * sunday * hampton walked to church with me coming out general lee was seen slowly making his way down the * * * to right and left i pointed him out to * hampton when general lee happened to look our way he bowed low giving me a charming smile of * i was ashamed of being so pleased i * like a * we went to the white house they gave us tea the president said he had been on the way to our house coming with all the davis family to see me but the children became so * they turned back just then little joe rushed in and insisted on saying his prayers at his fathers knee then and there he was in his * a box has come from home for me taking advantage of this good fortune and a full * have asked mrs davis to * with me * hampton sent me a basket of game we had mrs davis and mr and mrs preston after dinner we walked to the church to see the * wedding mr preston had mrs davis on his arm my husband and mrs preston and * harrison and myself brought up the rear * *

the * the happy * kissed * and several girls * but he said how am i to know * * whom i was to kiss it is better to show too much affection for ones new relations than too little joe johnston has been made commanderinchief of the army of the west general lee had this * said miss agnes lee and little robert as they * call general lees * son in this * community called they told us the president general lee and general * had gone out to look at the * around richmond my husband came home saying he had been with them and * general lee his gray horse mrs * mrs * mother says a year ago on the

late the army of the west has not been in a condition to * to friend or foe certainly jeff davis did hate to put joe johnston at the head of what is left of it * from general lee what a horrible failure is longstreet oh for a day of * * johnston out west and stonewall could he come back to us here general hood the wounded * came for me to drive i felt that i would soon find myself * some girls but i asked no questions he * the time between franklin and cary streets by saying i do like your husband so much so do i i replied simply * was ill in bed so william said at the door but she recovered her health and came down for the drive in black velvet and * looking * and then with the top of the * thrown back wrapped in * and * we had a long drive that bitter cold day one day as we were * us home from the fair grounds * the wounded * asked * what are the * of a mans being in love * hood is called * entirely but why i do not know said for his part he did not know at * he had * himself in love but that was a long time ago * spoke on the * of love when you see her your breath is * to come short if it * to * * you have got it bad you are * * * with * and have a gloomy fixed * that she * every * you meet better than she does you especially people that you know she has a * * for that is you knew it before you lost your head i mean before you fell in love the last * of * * i will spare you said * with a * and a wave of the hand well said * drawing a breath of relief i have felt none of these things so far and yet they say i am engaged to four young ladies a * * you will admit for a man who can not walk without help another day the * we called on our way from church to see mrs wigfall she was ill but mr wigfall insisted upon taking me into the drawingroom to rest a while he said * was there so she was and so was * hood the wounded * stretched at full length on a sofa and a * thrown over him * wigfall said to me do you know general hood yes said i and the general laughed with his eyes as i looked at him but he did not say a word i felt it a curious * upon the reports he had spoken of the day before * wigfall is a very handsome girl as we walked * reported a * he had had with general hood * had told those six young ladies at the * that old * was in the habit of saying he would not marry if he could any * * girl who would throw herself away upon a * creature such as he was when * went home he took pleasure in telling * how the ladies had * his good sense * the general rose in his * and threatened to break his * over * head to think he could be such a * go about * to everybody his * i was taking my seat at the head of the table when the door opened and * walked in * he took his stand in front of the open door with his hands in his * and his small hat pushed back as far as it could get from his forehead what said he you are not ready yet the generals are below did you get my note i begged my husband to excuse me and rushed off to put on my * and * i met the girls coming up with a strange man the * of two * had been too much for me and i forgot to ask the new ones name they went up to * in my place with my husband who sat * his dinner with * * attention given to him amid this * and * in and out of the world * mary preston and i then went to drive with the generals the new one proved to be * who is also a * the two men told us they had slept together the night before * it is useless to try * cant any longer be kept out of the conversation so general * said once before i slept with a man and he lost his * next day he had made a * never to do so again when * and i parted that morning we said you or i may be killed but the cause will be safe all the same after the drive everybody came in to tea my husband in famous good * we had an * gay evening it was very nice of my husband to take no notice of my conduct at dinner which had been open to * all the comfort of my life * upon his being in good * yesterday * with the * wore one of my *

were i prefer a ride with you to the company of any woman in the world * had answered i prefer your company to that of any man certainly was hoods reply this became the standing * of the dinner it flashed up in every form poor * got out of it so * if he got out of it at all general * said * * * all hood never * out of any * is unless he can fight out others dropped in after dinner some without

stonewall would have saved us * is the only battle we have gained since stonewall died and no results follow as usual stonewall was not so much as killed by a yankee he was shot by his own men that is hard general lee can do no more than keep back meade one of meades armies you mean said i for they have only to double on him when lee * one of them general * johnston says he got grant a * de corps

* toward the back part of the room the mass of black and gray was * captain * * his fate he was * out there with those * men but could see us laughing and * what we were saying was worth a thousand * he preferred talking to a clever woman to any known way of passing a pleasant hour so do i somebody said on a sofa of state in front of all sat the president and mrs davis little * davis was one of the child * her * had a right to be proud of her with her * black eyes she was a marked figure on the stage she is a handsome creature and she * her part * the * was beautiful beyond words the * and *

chief * * * * big thunder or whatever his character was so he folded up his loved and lost * the * red * and laid it on the altar the most sacred * of his life the witness of his most heroic sacrifice on the * senator hill of georgia took me in to supper where were * * * * and * the president came in alone i suppose for while we were talking after supper and your humble servant was standing between

no older than they are or * either sad to say now the president walked with me slowly up and down that long room and our conversation was of the * nobody knows so well as he the difficulties which * this * confederacy he has a voice which is perfectly * a comfort in this loud and rough soldier world i think there is a melancholy * in his voice at times of which he is * when he * of things as they are now my husband was so * * with * cary that he declined at the first call to accompany his wife home in the * carriage he ordered it to return when it came his wife a good * * the * and him in with herself leaving the other two men who came with the party when it was divided into * to make their way home in the cold at our door near daylight of that bitter cold morning i had the pleasure to see my husband like a man stand and pay for that carriage today he is pleased with himself with me and with all the world says if there was no such word as * you would have to * one to describe * cary met mrs wigfall she wants me to take * to mrs * * i am to get him up as sir * * now general * has come i like him better than any of them * also is here these huge * fill the town * says they hold * * for

the * servants all have been birds of passage first they were seen with gold * and then they would * to the yankees and i am sure they had nothing to tell it is yankee money * i do not think it had ever crossed mrs * brain that these two could leave her she knew however that * had * dollars in gold and two thousand four hundred dollars in confederate notes everybody who comes in * a little bad * much in itself but by * * the effect is * indeed tonight there will be a great gathering of * * gives them a dinner the city of richmond * john * he is at free quarters the girls * here * cary came

with which * had * the slight loss we had * upon its mighty breast she had * * * over the * so * that unless we had told about it no one would ever have known that the huge bird was making his second appearance on the board * was more * and * than ever my husband * like a * * man with all his * about him so things went off * enough * had just read * across the water he said it was the rage i am sure it is not as good as * * or * * it is not worthy of the woman who was to * all but * name below what is the matter with * he asked * is so mean and he is mean in such a very mean way and the end is so * * the husbands * children and * * may be * but human nature * at it womans nature you mean yes and now another * two weeks ago i read this thing with intense interest and already her * has * from my mind i have forgotten her way of showing * as completely as i always do forget * * oh i understand you now it is like * * has * all other * you cant * your mind upon any other the devil always must be of * * or you do not believe in him * * * the crown of the * with * but soon you begin to feel that * to be a * devil an * of the devil only is there any * * but * any * but * * but the list is too long of those who have been * into your brain by genius the * * the woman who stands by * and * her soul those * * * * by the author of * * bear them well in mind while i tell you how this writer who so well * and * female * and * was a governess or something of that sort and perhaps wrote for a living at any * she had an * * which was * to by george * and so she lives with * i do not know that she caused the separation between * and his * wife they are living in a * on some * * and mrs * of the hour is a * * agreeable * woman of genius * seemed without * on the subject at least he expressed neither surprise nor * he said something of genius being above law but i was not very clear as to what he said on that point as for me i said nothing for fear of saying too much you know that * is a writer said he some people say the man she lives with is a noble man they say she is kind and good * fallen woman here the conversation ended and now comes a grand * made by the yankee congress they vote one * of men to be sent down here to free the prisoners whom they will not take in exchange i actually thought they left all these yankees here on our hands as part of their plan to * us out all * under fifty years of age are to leave * and report for military duty or be * what enthusiasm there is in their * confusion rather it seems to me mrs * says the men who * her house are more * now than ever since this thing began our congress is so * so * so * they have asked the president whom they have so * so * so crossed and opposed and * in every way to speak to them and * them what to do both of us were too ill to attend mrs * reception it proved a very * one first a fire in the house then a * to be an arranged plan of the usual * servants there and some escaped yankee prisoners today the * is lost in wonder at the * of the fire and * * if they had only waited a few hours until everybody was asleep after a reception the household would be so tired and so sound asleep thanks to the * kind * * the * * will wait and do better next time letters from home carried mr chesnut off today * is dead i * upon * fair for myself i had never heard of * before i think it was in # i know i had been ill at the new york hotel and when left alone i slipped * and into a * that i had noticed under the hotel for something to read they gave me the first half of * i can recall now the very kind of paper it was * on and the * as they took effect upon me and yet when i * over it and was wild for the other half there were people who said it was slow that * was evidently a * * * writer that he * human nature bare and made it * etc at mrs * met another beautiful woman mrs * the wife of colonel * who is making shoes in a yankee prison she had a little son with her * two years old a mere * she said to him * * butler the child crossed his eyes and made himself * then laughed and * around as if he enjoyed the * * went to mrs * it was sad enough fancy having to be always ready to have your servants set your house on fire being * to do it such constant * such servants coming and going daily to the yankees carrying ones silver ones other * does not * to home happiness saw hood on his * once more he rode off on a fine horse and * it well though he is * in one hand too after all as the woman said he has body enough left to hold his soul how * of him to ride a gay horse like that oh a * * himself upon being half horse and half man and the girl who rode beside him did you ever see a more brilliant beauty three cheers for south carolina i * a plan of mine to * i would have a breakfast a * a * call it what you please but i would try and return some of the * of this most * people just think of the * * * we have been to people have no * in war times but they make up

as i was away * was giving the nurse a * in the yard accompanied by * and * worthy of a * the small nurse * my * no doubt for in two * peace was restored mrs * said she * with the * mother so i * the * i have excellent servants no matter for their * behind my back they save me all thought as to household matters and they are so kind * and quiet they must know what is at hand if sherman is not * from coming * my * but these * give no sign unless it be increased * and * silence as certain in their action and as * as a law of nature at any * when we are in the house that fearful hospital * me all day long and is worse at night so much suffering such * * such * with * of * not half * exhibited to all then when i was so tired yesterday * was looking more like an * * than anything else * that her * neck was broken and * * of * the poor little * * dark face had an * * of gray terror she was * near the ground like an animal trying to * and her mother striking at her as she rolled away all this was my welcome as i entered the gate it takes these * but a moment to go back to their * * animal nature mrs * is a charming person she tried so to make me forget it all and rest the battle has been * at * and our fate hanging in the * * indeed is gone well that agony is over like * when the child was dead i will get up from my knees will * my face and * my hair no hope we will try to have no fear at the * i found them drawn up in line of battle every moment looking for the doctor on his way to richmond now to * thought for our day is done read * * * * ought to * with us we are not as * as this even if mrs * word be taken * men with * power are the same all over the world see * * run * they say general * has been killed we are hard as * we sit * and hear any bad news chance may bring are we * my pink silk dress i have sold for # to be paid for in * two hundred a month for three months and i * my * and * from home for two hundred dollars a month does it not sound * hundred dollars a month * but in what in confederate money * went with mrs * to hear dr * i did not know before how utterly hopeless was our situation this man is so * it was hard to listen and not give way despair was his word and * he offered us nothing more in this world than the * crown he is not for slavery he says he is for freedom and the freedom to * our own country as we see fit he is against foreign * in our state matters that is what mr * went to war for it appears every day * that slavery is * the world over for that he * god he spoke of our agony and then came the cry help us o god vain is the help of man and so we came away * to the * the end has come no doubt of the fact our army has so moved as to * * and * we are going to be * off the face of the earth what is there to prevent sherman taking general lee in the rear we have but two armies and sherman is between them now these stories of our * in the valley fall like * upon a dead body since * fell i have felt as if all were dead within me forever captain * of general * staff * here today had ever * with little or no brigade so magnificent a staff the * as somebody said have been secured only by * the * and the * men too old the boys too young * hayne * * * * * miles are the picked men of the agreeable world mary * * wedding day has come and gone and mary is mrs john * now * * dressed the * hair * they said but it was all

to side of the street and my lady * it when he leaves her he * her hand * so low to do it * that we see it all * president will be with us here in columbia next * so colonel * * us word i have begun at once to prepare to receive him in my small house his * have been * as well as confederate * would permit the * were not great but i did what i could for our * chief besides i like the * has been so kind to me and his wife is one of the few to whom i can never be grateful enough for her generous * and attention i went out to the gate to * the president who met me most cordially kissed me in fact custis lee and governor * were at his back immediately after breakfast the * party arrived a little before daylight general chesnut drove off with the presidents * and mr davis sat out on our * there was nobody with him but myself some little boys * by called out come here and look there is a man on mrs * * who looks just like jeff davis on * people began to * at once on the street mr davis then went in mrs * sent a magnificent * thought of course for the president but she gave me such a * afterward she did not know he was there i in my mistake about the * thought she knew and so did not send her word the president was watching me prepare a * * for custis lee when colonel * came to * us that a great crowd had gathered and that they were coming to ask the president to speak to them at one oclock an immense crowd it * women and children the crowd * the house the presidents hand was nearly * off i went to the rear my head * on the dinner to be prepared for him with only a confederate * but the * public had come to the * i had been gathering what i could of * for a month and now i found that nearly everybody in columbia was sending me whatever they had that they thought nice enough for the presidents dinner we had the * * from * and the beautiful old * etc mrs preston sent a * * * with * * * and * * each made a * as pretty as it was * a * of small boys only came to pay their * to the president he seemed to know how to meet that * * then the presidents party had to go and we bade them an affectionate farewell custis lee and i had spent much time * on the back * while i was * * for the * he sat on the * with a cigar in his mouth he spoke very * telling me many a hard truth for the confederacy and about the bad time which was at hand ten pleasant days i * to my sister kate has * upon me * from the mountains of * rock we are true sisters she * me without words and she is the * * woman i know so graceful and * in manner so good and * in character but best of all she is so agreeable any time or place would be charming with kate for a companion general chesnut was in * but i could not wait i gave the beautiful bride mrs * a dinner which was simply * i was satisfied for once in my life with my own table and i know * guests were never seated around any table * my house is always crowded after all what a number of pleasant people we have been thrown in with by * * i call such society glorious it is the * but the old life as it * to die will die * general chesnut came back * he * that such a life as i lead gives him no time to think * harrison writes to general preston that supreme anxiety * in richmond oh for one single port if the alabama had had in the whole wide world a port to take her * to and where she could be * i believe she would have borne us through oh for one single port by which we could get at the outside world and * our whole confederacy if we could have * regiments from europe or even have * ammunition and food for our soldiers some days must be dark and dreary at the * however i saw an instance of faith in our future a * * and the radiant bride herself the * * and * now within twenty miles of chattanooga and * bound to face the foe saw at the * not only * * a perfect little beauty but the very table the first declaration of independence was written upon these * are * of henry * of the first revolution alas we have yet to make good our second declaration of * * yankee * and yankee rule hood has written to ask them to send general chesnut out to command one of his brigades in whose place if * * johnston had lived poor old general lee has no * stonewall would have saved us from * sherman will now catch general lee by the rear while grant * him by the head and while hood and thomas are * an * * on the * hood means to cut his way to lee see if he * the * have had a struggle for it more than once we seemed to have been too much for them we have been so near to success it * one to think of it so * the * next to our house which * calls * since mr * visit is a common of green grass and very * beyond which comes a * of * on this open space within forty * of us a regiment of foreign * has * they have taken the oath of allegiance to our government and are now being * and * into form before being sent to our army they are * * with some * however their close * * me miserable * once * forever * has always been held * for all the * * and indeed for whatever beauregard reported or * now he has left that mighty chief and * here comes from beauregard the * and most * of his military * he * of * that was not the way the story was told to us a letter from mrs davis who says thank you a thousand times my dear friend for your more than * kindness to my dear child that is what she calls her sister * * as to mr davis he thinks the best * the best * the best coffee the best * in the world rendered columbia delightful to him when he passed through we are in a sad and anxious state here just now the dead come in but the living do not go out so fast however we hope all things and trust in god as the only one able to * the opposite state of feeling into a * happy whole i had a surprise of an * * nature a few days since i found i could not keep my horses so i sold them the next day they were returned to me with a handsome * note to the effect that they had been bought by a few friends for me but i fear i can not * them * between us things look very anxious here * hampton went to richmond with the * mr * she arrived there on * on * her father * hampton fought a great battle but just did not win * victory * * darkness * and * woods prevented that * * preston hampton rode * into the * fire his father sent his brother * to bring him back * saw him * in the saddle and * up to him general hampton following as young * reached him preston fell from his horse and the one brother * to * the other was himself shot down preston recognized his father but died without speaking a word young * though wounded held his brothers head up tom taylor and others hurried up the general took his dead son in his arms kissed him and handed his body to tom taylor and his friends bade them take care of * and then rode back to his post at the head of his troops in the * of the * he directed the fight for the rest of the day until night he did not know young * fate that boy might be dead too now he says no son of his must be in his command when * * he must join some other division the agony of such a day and the anxiety and the duties of the * is all more than a mere man can bear another letter from mrs davis she says i was * * at preston * * * fate i know nothing more touching in history than general * situation at the * moment of his misery when he sent one son to save the other and saw both fall and could not know for some moments whether both were not killed a thousand dollars have slipped through my fingers already this week at the * i spent five hundred today for * * and a lamp etc * * are bad enough but of them there seems to be an end too now we are * to * * * is a preparation of * when the * of the lamp * as * it will we * up the place with paper thick old * * the * * kind in the hunt for paper * old letters come to light sherman in * has left thomas to take care of hood hood has thirty thousand men thomas forty thousand and as many more to be had as he wants he has only to ring the bell and call for them grant can get all that he wants both for himself and for thomas all the world is open to them while we are shut up in a * we are at sea and our boat has * a * although sherman took * he does not mean to stay there be it heaven or * fire and the sword are for us here that is the word and now i must begin my columbia life * and alone it will be a short * captain * came to dinner on sunday and in the afternoon asked me to go with him to the * church and hear mr * we went and i felt very youthful as the country people say like a girl and her * * took me into a * and my husband sat * off what a * the * * my blood my very flesh crept and * a * glow of patriotism passed through me such a * must * the hearts and the hands of many people there was more * to fight and die la * than *

everybody * it who * * comes * to see what i have written last and makes faces when it does not suit her * still calls me * and * her hands to her ears when i begin to * well * only records what she * she does not * for it for really one * never * certain of anything we * at mrs * she is as strong a cordial for broken spirits and * heart as one could wish how her strength * with our * like doctor * she * one up to bear bravely the worst she has the * of a man and the * and * of a woman we have lost nearly all of our men and we have no money and it looks as if we had taught the yankees how to fight since manassas our best and * are under the * we shall have to wait till another * * up here we stand despair in our hearts oh * dont * * with our houses burning or about to be over our heads the north have just got things * a splendid army perfectly * with new * coming in day and night their * do not go into the ranks they hardly know there is a war up there at * yankees are landing in great force our troops down there are * * old men and boys never under fire before some college * in all a mere * the * and the grave have been * by us they say sherman goes to savannah and not to * * and i put on * and * and went * out for news we determined to seek until we found met a man who was so * i could not forget him or his * he was * in love with me once he did not know me but * * when * told him who i was he had forgotten me i hope or else i am changed by age and care past all * he gave us the * information that * had been burned to the ground when the call for horses was made mrs * sent in her fine * she comes now with a pair of * and looks too long and * at my * if i were not so much afraid of her i would * that those * would be of far more use in camp than my * but they will seize the * no doubt in all my life before the * were far off from the house and i had nothing to do with them now my * are kept under an open shed next to the back * here i sit with my work or my desk or my book * in our southern sun and i watch * * * and * down the horses and then he * their * as thoroughly as smith does my drawingroom i see their * of * * laid * says * * aint * business to look so much in de * i care nothing for his * and i have never had horses in better condition poor * you * every attention and enough to eat grass does not grow under your feet by night and day you are on the * today general chesnut was in charleston on his way from * to savannah by * the telegraph is still working between charleston and savannah * certainly is burned there was fighting down there today i came home with enough to think about heaven knows and then all day long we * a * * in honor of mrs * who has things so nice at home the * was a success but was it worth all that trouble as my party were driving off to the * an * * up enter captain * of general * staff of as * a presence as a * handsome and * he was here on some military * and brought me a letter he said the yankees had been repulsed and that down in those * we could give a good account of ourselves if our government would send men enough with a sufficient army to meet them down there they could be * where are the men to come from asked * * general hood has gone off to tennessee even if he does defeat thomas there what difference would that make here we * tea at mrs * she had her * too the night before a country cousin claimed her * one who * would take the train at five this morning a little after midnight mrs * was startled out of her first sleep by loud * of * an alarm at night may mean so much just now in an instant she was on her feet she found her guest who thought it was daylight and wanted to go mrs * * * how * it was to get up five hours too soon mrs * once more in her own warm bed had fallen * to sleep she was * by feeling two * hands pass * over her face and person it was * dark even mrs * gave a * in her * she found it was only the * guest up and at her again so though it was only three oclock in order to quiet this * spirit she rose and at five drove her to the station where she had to wait some hours but mrs * said anything for peace at home the restless people who will not let others rest miss * * and mr * * are to be married we confederates have * the * for the wedding night * calls it the * not the wedding of the parties married the ceremony will be performed early in the evening the whole company will then sit up until five oclock at which hour the * * take the train for * hope sherman will not be so * as to cut short the * in * * with his hat on his head both hands extended and his * well here we are he was * * * with * the * would have to send him many times to * in * before he could be pronounced * hood will not turn and * sherman thomas is at his * with forty thousand men and can have as many more as he wants for the asking between thomas and sherman hood would be crushed so he was * do not remember where or what i know there was no comfort in anything he said * account of money spent paper and * # * to * # * # * # and now the young ones are in bed and i am wide * it is an * thing in all my life how many persons have i seen in love not a * and i am a * close * a faithful * have i been from my youth * of men and * society has been for me only an * field for character study * is the business of society that is playing at * it * in * it * in * it is * on by * and a want of any other excitement * * and * how in this game * is dashed * and forward it is so * to * if it * and * in * * of spirit * sometimes they do occasionally burn their fingers * playing with fire but there are no hearts broken each party in a * has secured a * * to whom he or she can talk of himself or * who for the time * one * and as the french say * it is a pleasant but very * game and so to bed hood and thomas have had a fearful fight with * and loss of generals * in * to numbers that means they were leading and * their men up to the enemy i know how * and * * were killed bringing up their men one of mr * * thrown in his teeth by the legislature of south carolina was that he * the * of * state rights * by his influence in richmond what have these comfortable * * to say of general * now and how could man die better than * fearful * etc so fort * has fallen * savannah our governor * himself a * of joe brown of georgia another famous joe the deep waters are closing over us and we are in this house like the * at the time of the * we care for none of these things we eat drink laugh dance in * of heart doctor * came to tell me the * news how he * on the agony * * despair general young with the flower of * cavalry is in columbia horses can not be found to mount them neither the governor of georgia nor the governor of south carolina is moving hand or foot they have given up the yankees claim another victory for thomas hope it may prove like most of their * * and * cant say why * i am * but i do not feel so * miserable oh why did we go to * the very * christmas * us there miss * went with * brilliant woman and very agreeable the world you know is composed said she of men women and * see lady * now we feel that if we are to lose our negroes we would as soon see sherman free them as the confederate government * negroes is the last confederate government * we are a little too slow about it that is all sold fifteen * of cotton and took a sad farewell look at * it is a magnificent old * with old * green * and all so i took that last farewell of * once so * now so beloved sherman is at * and hood in tennessee the last of his men not gone as * wigfall so * * * went for a * today to the * her teeth are of the * and most regular simply * she * it was better to have a * look in her mouth before returning to the mountains for that

wrote and wept over your * pages my ideas of those last days are * the * left columbia the * before i did and mammy the negro woman who had * them refused to go with them that * me then mrs * who was to send her girls with me changed her mind she sent them upstairs in her house and actually took away the * that was her plan then i met mr * hampton * to take off his sisters they were * but were to go only as far as * he said it was time to move on sherman was at * * a days journey from columbia and had left a * as bare and * as a fire leaves on the * so my time had come too my husband urged me to go home he said * would be safe enough they had no spite against that old town as they have against charleston and columbia * * and * came in while we were at table * her * face with the * * * she said i ought to go among our own black people on the plantation they would take care of me better than any one else so i agreed to go to * or the * plantation and sent * down with a * of my * then a

when the telegram was handed to him so he took the train and came back mr chesnut sent him with us to take care of the party we thought that if the negroes were ever so loyal to us they could not protect me from an army bent upon * us from the face of the earth and if they tried to do so so much the worse would it be for the poor things with their yankee friends i then left them to * for themselves as they are accustomed to do and i took the same liberty my husband does not care a * for the property question and never did perhaps if he had ever known * it would be different he talked * about it as he always does about everything i have told him often that if at * gate st * would listen to him a while and let him tell his own story he would get in and the * might give him a crown * now he says he has only one * i should be safe and not so * with dread and then there is his blind old father a man said he can always die like a * and a gentleman with no * and take it * it is hard not to * those who are out of all this their difficulties * who have met death * on the battlefield their * all * one can but do his best and leave the result to a higher power after new orleans those vain passionate * little * were forever * * driven to it by despair and * butler as we read these things mrs davis said if they want to die why not first kill * butler * the world of their foe and be saved the trouble of * themselves that * way of * their * burden did not * to them i repeated this * * to our corps of generals without troops here in this house as they spread out their * on my table where lay this * of paper from which i write every man * of them had a safe plan to stop sherman if even beauregard and lee were expected but grant had * on lee lee could not save his * could he come

#* when the yankees * up the railroad * that * him of course and he found everybody had left columbia and the town was surrendered by the * colonel * hampton and his command had been gone several hours * hayne came away with general chesnut there was no fire in the town when they left they * * command at * mill that night from the hills where they * they saw the fire and knew the yankees were

friends and the * were pointed out to me as the * women in the united states now that i do know them all well i think the world was right in its estimate of them met a mr * of * cheerful * happy and * all right now said he sherman sure to be * joe johnston is in command dr * says when the * joseph the * gave up his command to hood he remarked with a smile i hope you will be able to stop sherman it was more than i could do general johnston is not of mr * way of thinking as to his own powers for he stayed here several days after he was ordered to the front he must have known he could do no good and i am of his opinion when the wagon in which i was to travel to * rock drove up to the door covered with a * white * in my * for an opening in the conversation i asked the * name he showed great * in giving it but at last said my name is sherman * and now i see by your face that you wont go with me my name is against me these times here he * and remarked but you would leave * that name was the last drop in my cup but i gave him mrs * reason for * here general johnston had told her this might be the * place after all he thinks the yankees are making straight for richmond and general lees rear and will go by * and * leaving * on their west flank the * are kind people they ask no * for their * # a week for * twenty dollars and such * * paper mrs * took up my * book in which i have a picture of all the yankee generals i want to see the men who are to be our * said she not mine i answered thank god come what may this was a free fight we had as much right to fight to get out as they had to fight to keep us in if they try to play the * * upon the * * will i go never to see a yankee and if i die on the way so much the better then i sat down and wrote to my husband in language much worse than anything i can put in this book as i wrote i was * by tears of rage indeed i nearly wept myself away mrs * offered me religious books which i declined being already provided with the * of * the * of * the * of * and above all the patient * of * * is my * now i should be so * to know life never would be any worse with me my husband is well and has been ordered to join the great * i am * comfortable if somewhat * * and i daily part with my * for food we find no one who will exchange * for confederate money so we are * our clothes * for social * are not * miss * and * often drink a cup of tea with me one might search the whole world and not find two * or more agreeable women miss * is brilliant and accomplished she must have been a hard * all her life she knows everybody worth knowing and she has been everywhere then she is so * * pure and true she is so * she could not harbor a wrong thought she is utterly * a devoted daughter and sister she is one among the many * women a kind * has thrown in my way such as mrs * daughter of judge * mary preston * mrs * * of old franklin the american wise man and mrs jefferson davis how i love to praise my friends as a * of * sunshine mrs * sent me an * * thinks we are at the last * and now england and france are bound to step in england must know if the united states of america are * they will * her next and france must wonder if she will not have to give up mexico my faith * me it is all too late no help for us now from god or man thomas * says was now to * georgia but sherman from all * has done that work once for all there will be no * they say no living thing is found in * * only * like telegraph * to carry the news of * army * in all that * * mrs * sent me * and an * with the message come over i went for it would be as well to * in the streets as to * myself at home to my own * at mrs * i met a miss * her father for seven years was the * * at our negro church the negro church is in a * just opposite * house she says her father has so often described that fine old * and its beautiful lawn * etc now i dare say there stand at * only * * of * we have made up our minds for the worst * house is no doubt * to the ground miss * was * to praise us she said as a general rule the * minister went to the family mansion and the * * * to the negroes and * with the * at his house but at * her father always stayed at the house and the family were so kind and * to him it was rather pleasant to hear ones family so spoken of among strangers so well * to brave the weather armed * so to speak i continued my * farther * and brought up at the * i may have surprised them for at such an * season they hardly expected a visitor never however did lonely old woman receive such a warm and * welcome now we know the worst are we growing * we avoid all * to columbia we never speak of home and we begin to * the certain * that lies ahead how it * could i live many days in solitary * things are beginning to be * but i must sit down and be satisfied my husband is safe so far let me be * it is no worse with me but there is the * pain all the same what is the good of being here at all our world has simply gone to destruction and across the way the fair * * she has not even my resources against * she has no * no miss * two as brilliant women as any in * oh how does she stand it i mean to go to church if it * * and * my feet are * two or three times a day we never take cold our hearts are too hot within us for that a carriage was driven up to the door as i was writing i began to * on my * and said to myself in the glass oh you * woman i was all in a * so great was my haste to be out of this mrs * had the carriage she came for me to go and hear mr * * he * our spirits from this * earth he takes us up to heaven that i will not deny still he can not hold my attention my heart * and my mind * back to south carolina oh * sherman what are you at there * * that you are a letter from general chesnut who writes from camp near * under date of february #* i thank you a thousand thousand times for your kind letters they are now my only earthly comfort except the hope that all is not yet lost we have been driven like a wild * from our country and it is not from a want of spirit in the people or soldiers nor from want of energy and * in our commanders the * of joe johnston it is hoped will * to the advantage of our cause and the * of our * i am still in not very agreeable circumstances for the last four days completely * i am informed that a detachment of yankees were sent from liberty hill to * with a view to * all the houses * and provisions about that place no * have reached me you know i expected the worst that could be done and am fully prepared for any report which may be made it would be a happiness beyond expression to see you even for an hour i have heard nothing from my poor old father i fear i shall never see him again such is the fate of war i do not * i have * chosen my lot and am prepared for any fate that * me my care is for you and i trust still in the good cause of my country and the justice and mercy of * it was a * * young set that south carolina put to the * they knew it was a time of * danger and that the fight would be ten to one they expected to win by * energy and enthusiasm then came the * * the * now these are * * * * about their heads to fall with dignity those gallant * who dashed so * to the front lie * in bloody * well for them * there are worse things than honorable * * thoughts late in life we are to begin * and have * difficult days ahead we have * * governor * has passed through saying sherman left columbia as he found it and was last heard from at * dr * walked home with me he says that is the last * of the story now my husband wrote that he himself saw the * which burned up columbia the first night his camp was near enough to the town for that they say sherman has burned * sherman * that * that * but i do not believe it he takes his time there are none to * him he does things * and * why stop to do so * a thing as burn * courthouse the * and the tavern as i remember it that description * * a * party they say did for * no train from * yesterday * says sherman is in * trying to brave it out they have * yet let our men * and * in their * would you be willing to be as * as they are a thousand times no but we must * our army * we can do so much as that our * need not * if lincoln would consent to exchange prisoners but men are nothing to the united * to throw away if they send our men back they * our army and so again their policy is to keep everybody and everything here in order to help * us out that too is what * destruction * * us out young * asked me to play * for him the * is my * or was so i sang and played to my own great delight it was a * then i made * for the soldier boys below and came home have spent a very pleasant evening * * care you and i never * * and i are shut up here it is rain rain * rain as our

on this my * day mrs * sent me a * of * mrs * nearly enough food supplies for an entire dinner miss * a * for * * * and served up the material * at hand very * indeed there never was a more successful dinner my heart was too full to eat but i was quiet and calm at least i spared my husband the trial of a broken voice and tears as he stood at the window with his back to the room he said where are they * old blind father and my sister day and night i see her leading him out from under his own * that picture * me * but come let us talk of * things to which i answered where will you find them he took off his heavy cavalry * and * carried them away to * the mud off and dry them she brought them back just as miss * walked in in his agony while * with those huge * and trying to get them on he spoke to her * in french she turned away from him instantly as she saw his * * and said to me i had not heard of your happiness i did not know the general was here not until next day did we have time to remember and laugh at that * of french miss * answered him in the same language he told her how * he was with my * and that he would go away with a much * heart since he had seen the kind people with whom he would leave me i asked my husband what that correspondence between sherman and hampton * while i was preparing something for our dinner his back was still turned as he gazed out of the window he spoke in the low and steady * that * our conversation the whole day and yet there was something in his voice that * me as he said the second day after our march from columbia we passed the * he was a * man and not at home his wife said at first that she could not find * for our horses but afterward she succeeded in * some i noticed a very handsome girl who stood beside her as she spoke and i suggested to her mother the * of sending her out of the * of both armies things were no longer as * there was so much * so many camp * with no * on the * of the army the girl answered quickly i wish to stay with my mother that very night a party of * men came to our camp and such a * they told of what had been done at the place of horror and destruction the mother left * the * had been committed before her very face she having been secured first after this crime the * moved on there were only seven of them they had been gone but a short time when * men went in pursuit at full speed and * them cut their * and wrote upon their * these were the seven but the girl oh she was dead are his * as violent as ever against the president asked i when recovered from pity and horror sometimes i think i am the only friend he has in the world at these * which they give us everywhere i * the * for i will not sit still and hear jeff davis * for things he is no more * for than any man at that table once i lost my * and told them it * like * * to me and that jeff davis was a gentleman and a * with more * than the assembled company you lost your * truly said i and i did not know it i thought i was as cool as i am now in washington when we left jeff davis * second to none in * and may be first from the south and mrs davis was the friend of mrs * mrs joe johnston and mrs * * and others of that circle now they * that he is nobody and never was and she i asked oh you would think to hear them that he found her yesterday in a mississippi swamp well in the french revolution it was worse

such kind clever agreeable * companions the * refused to be paid for their rooms no * can sound the * of the * and kindness of the north carolina people misfortune * us from the * everything went wrong with the train we broke down within two miles of * and had to walk that distance which was pretty rough on an * * out of a fever my spirit was further broken by losing an * lace veil which was worn because i was too poor to buy a * * is if there were any * at all for * in our region my husband had ordered me to a house in * kept by some great friends of his they established me in the drawingroom a really handsome apartment they made up a bed there and put in a * and * of water with everything * * and nice but it continued to be a public drawingroom open to all so that i was half dead at night and wanted to go to bed the piano was there and the company played it the * announced * that for supper there were nine * of * * * nice and light so i sent for some but found it heavy * * i said * this may kill me though * * did not dont you believe dat * try we * ourselves in the drawingroom that night and left the next day at dawn arrived at the station we had another disappointment the train was behind time there we sat on our * nine long hours for the cars might come at any moment and we dared not move an * from the spot finally the train rolled in * with * prisoners but heaven helped us a kind * agent invited us with two other * women into his comfortable and * * * true to his theory did not stay at the * as we did some christian * took him in for the night this he explained with a * my husband was at the * station with a carriage we drove at once to mrs * * i have been ill but what could you expect my lines however have again fallen in pleasant places mrs * * is young handsome and agreeable a kind and perfect * and as to the house my room is all that i could ask and leaves nothing to be desired so very fresh * warm and comfortable is it it is the drawingroom suddenly made into a * for me but it is my very own we are among the * of the earth once more i have moved again and now i am looking from a window high with something more to see than the sky we have the third story of dr * * house which * on the straight street that * to the railroad about a mile off mrs * is the * of young * yesterday at church * hayne * so close to her * that i had to touch him and say sit up * * was killed in that famous fight of the charleston light * the * stood still to be shot down in their * having no orders to retire they had been forgotten doubtless and they * to take care of themselves in this high and * retreat as in richmond then in columbia and then in * my cry is still if they would only leave me here in peace and if i were sure things never could be worse with me again am i surrounded by old friends people seem to * with each other to show how good they can be to me today smith opened the trenches and appeared * with a * covered with a * * here was my first help toward * again mrs pride has sent a * * a * of bread a huge * another * coffee already * and ground a * of * already * * * and all the other things one must trust to love for now such money as we have * us nothing even if there were anything left in the * to buy we had a * * james * called the best of good company he said of * she is a queen and ought to * in a * no prince charming yet no man has yet approached her that i think half good enough for her then mrs * * * * came with the story of family progress not a royal one from columbia here before we left home said she major * spread a * of the united states on the table and showed me with his finger where sherman was * to go * i * i but suppose he does not choose to go that way * * what do you know of war so we set out my husband myself and two children all in one small buggy the #* of february we took up our line of march and straight before * men for five weeks we fled together by * * and * from * to post we succeeded in acting as a sort of * of the yankee army without rest and with much haste we got here last * and here we mean to stay and * sherman and his * much the worse for wear were we the first night their beauty sleep was * broken into at * with a cry move on the * are upon us so they hurried on * to * but with no better * there they had to * the ship leave * etc and put on all * for this time the yankees were only five miles behind * and * ride for your life was the cry * * point seemed to be our buggy said she for you know that when we got to * sherman was expected there and he * his * that is he kept that one two small children were in our * and i began to think of the red sea expedition but we lost no time and soon we were in * clearly out of the * we * god for all his * and * to our * fond hopes of a bed and * so much needed by all especially for the children at twelve oclock general * himself * us up with word to march march for all the blue * are over the * in mad haste we made for * when they said god bless your soul this is the seat of war now the * where sherman and johnston are to try * so we * back as the * say and cut across country * for this place * clothes my dear never a one except as we took off * by * and * it and * it by our camp fire with our * * and in haste i was * and comfortable all that time in * today * d lees corps marched * to surrender the camp songs of these men were a * so sad yet so * they would have * the blood of an * the leading voice was powerful * clear * * sweet so i sat down as women have done before when they hung up their * by strange * and i wept the bitterness of such * music away away * * to me of things which in all my long life i have not found and i shall not find there they go the gay and gallant few * the last gathering of the flower of southern pride to be killed or worse to a prison they continue to * by light and * they march with as * a * as if they still believed the world was all on their side and that there were no yankee * for the * what will joe johnston do with them now the hood * is over though the * has not fallen on the last scene * * and makes many * but today she * that hood * is going down when that style of enthusiasm is on the * the * of its * is * it is like the * out of a * one moment white then gone forever no that is not right it is the * on the river that is referred to i am getting things as much * as do the fine ladies of society lee and johnston have each fought a drawn battle only a few more dead bodies lie * and * on an unknown battlefield for we do not so much as know where these drawn battles took place * * after * with me my first * failed me * he was to come for me to go down to the train and see * pass by one word with * worth a thousand ordinary ones so she has gone by and * not seen her old colonel chesnut * to say grace but as he leaves the table * * i thank god for a good dinner when asked why he did this * thing he said my way is to be sure of a thing before i return thanks for it * * * sherman for promised protection to columbia soon after the burning began i received the wife of a * * the poor thing had done no wrong and i felt so sorry for her who would be a woman who that * a * * faithful woman she * hard measures still when she hopes * and all her beauty only makes * i was * with a * of violets from mrs pride violets always * me of kate and of the sweet south wind that * in the garden of * part of my life then it all came back the dread * that lies behind every thought now * find i have not spoken of the * which held the preston party that day on their way to york from richmond in the party were mr and mrs * clay general and mrs preston and their three daughters captain * and mr * whose father is an english earl and connected * and * with * square in my american * i may not state mr * case plainly mr * is of course a * son then there was * and her baby and * with no end of servants * and female in this * they slept * and * such being the fortune of war we were there but a short time but mr * during that brief visit of ours was said to have * three * and the number of his * * so called were * too mr * * to the * had been three small * they were however run over by the train and made * * of * and before their time general lee says to the men who * duty this is the * war when they * i stop wigfall says it is all over the game is up he is on his way to texas and when the hanging * he can step over into mexico i am * up heart such troops do i see go by every day they must turn the * and surely they are going for something more than surrender it is very late and the wind * my * which seems to * too late all this will end by making me a nervous * yesterday while i was driving with mrs pride colonel * passed us he called out i do hope you are in comfortable quarters very comfortable i replied oh mrs chesnut said mrs pride how can you say that perfectly comfortable and hope it may never be worse with me said i i have a * little parlor # by # with its bare floor well * a * six * * that is all but i have a charming * from my window high my world is now thus divided into two * yankees are and where yankees are not as i sat * looking out ready for any new tramp of men and arms the magnificent figure of general preston * in sight he was mounted on a mighty * worthy of its * followed by his * * william * who bore before him the generals * when i had time to realize the situation i * at general * right hand mr * hampton and mr * who passed by soon mrs pride in some * way * or heard that they were coming here and she sent me at once no end of good things for my * general preston entered very soon after and with him * clay of alabama the latter in pursuit of his * trunk i left it with the * mr * and have no doubt it is perfectly safe but where we have written to mr * to * then * de * appeared i am here he said to * with general chesnut he and i always think alike he added * slavery is stronger than ever if you think so said i you will find that for once you and general chesnut do not think alike he has held that slavery was a thing of the past this many a year i said to general preston i pass my days and nights * at this window i am sure our army is silently * men are moving the wrong way all the time they * by with no songs and no * now they have given the thing up see for yourself look there for a while the streets were * with soldiers and then they were empty again but the marching now is without * of * mr * * told us of a great * mrs preston was put under his care on the train he soon found the only other women along were * unfortunate * as carlyle calls them beautiful and * he had to * the * fact to mrs preston on account of their * and was lost in admiration of her silent dignity her quiet * her * her * and * her * * of all that she did not care to see some women no matter how * would have made a * or would have * but mrs preston * the situation and possessed her soul in * and peace met robert johnston from * he has been a prisoner having been taken at * the yankees * * * of his forks and * when * did not seem to like it they laughed at him when he said he did not see any fun in it they * to * and * their eyes with their * all this * * * said was as hard to bear as it was to see them ride off with his horse * they stole all of mrs * * and silver when the yankee general heard of it he wrote her a very * note saying how sorry he was that she had been * and returned a * of * * written to her before she was married robert johnston said miss chesnut was a brave and determined spirit one yankee officer came in while they were at breakfast and sat down to warm himself at the fire rebels have no rights miss chesnut said to him * i suppose you have come to rob us please do so and go your presence * my blind old father the man * up in a rage and said what do you take me * * no indeed said she and for very shame he marched out * saw general preston ride off he came to tell me * i told him he looked like a * on his great white horse with william his * at his * our men are all * * and have their servants well mounted behind them carrying * and * different from the same men * like * in * railroad cars usually * * deep in * * * for the * and * comfort i wanted a pine table and a * chair a woman sold me one today for three thousand confederate dollars mrs * has been disappointed again * * says the person into whose house they expected to move today came to say she could not take * for three reasons first that they had * in the house and the two others oh i did not ask for the two others miss * letter came in answer to mine telling her how generous my friends here were to me we long she says for our own small * of wood corn and * here is a struggle * death although the * continue to * us as you would say with a * we have fallen upon a new * we keep a * book on the * and when the dinner is * we just read off a * or a * it does not entirely * the * this * in imagination but perhaps it is as good for the * as i was ready to go though still upstairs some one came to say general hood had called mrs * cried out send word you are not at home never said i why make him * all these * when you must go in five minutes if he had come here * sherman as a * at his * * i might say not at home but not now and i ran down and greeted him on the * in the face of all and walked slowly beside him as he * up the weary three stories * * he was so well dressed and so cordial not * in the * he was so glad to see me he calls his report * says joe johnston attacked him and he was obliged to state things from his point of view and now follow * where one may read between the lines what one * he had been offered a command in western virginia but as general lee was * because he and joe johnston were not on cordial terms and as the * of the mountain campaign would be too great for him he would like the chance of going across the mississippi texas was true to him and would be his home as it had * him a * somewhere out there they say general lee is utterly * and has no plan if richmond goes as go it must richmond has fallen and i have no heart to write about it grant broke through our lines and sherman cut through them * is this side of * they are too many for us everything is lost in richmond even our * blue black is our * hood says we shall all be obliged to go * texas i mean for our own part of the country will be * yes a solitude and a wild * it may become but as to that we can rough it
