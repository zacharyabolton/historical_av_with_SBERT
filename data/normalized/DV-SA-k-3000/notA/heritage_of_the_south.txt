that much * was show by some of the british military * a * review of the history of the difficulties * * * must lead any honest mind to the conclusion that while the british * * * and * as the * approached its * the people of massachusetts with whom the conflict began exhibited a very * spirit and often * with * * the * of massachusetts on account of their peculiar religious * had from the

government as the articles * entered very little into their * and no troops had been * among them in an * manner since the * expedition they made common cause with the people of massachusetts as it was a question of power which * the rights of all the colonies the difference was that the people of massachusetts and new england were anxious to bring on a separation while those of virginia were not unless it was necessary for the protection of the rights of all of the colonies the * of virginia entered * into the * both by speaking and writing and when the * * took place the people sprang to arms and sent to massachusetts aid in both men and provisions it was the attempt to * the people of massachusetts in an * manner to * with * laws on the part of the british government more than any * * of their own that aroused the people of virginia to action as that * if successfully applied to one * might be used for the destruction of all * in the others this became the * policy of virginia as a sovereign state after the struggle began she gave a leader to the * army her * and best * to the * * her * citizens to the ranks and her resources to the * of the war that war which was begun in massachusetts long after it ceased to * within the limits of that state was finally * ended on the soil of virginia after that soil had been * * by the * armies of great * * similar to those which * virginia * the action of all of the other southern colonies and none suffered greater losses in war for the common defence than south carolina this statement is not made in order to claim for virginia and the other southern states more than their due share of credit for services in the war of the revolution nor to * the valuable services rendered by the more northern states of the confederation the war was * by the colonies as a confederacy of sovereign states the * congress was in fact but a congress of commissioners or * whose acts * their * from the * adoption and * of the several states and the * were at all times subject to recall and * by the appointment of * power which was * * the declaration of independence itself was made in * with powers * delegated for that purpose to the representatives of the several * powers and * its force not from the action of congress but from the adoption of that action by those represented in that body in the case of virginia her independence had been declared by a convention of her own and a state government had been actually organized in advance of the action of congress and she was the first thus to * her sovereignty on the 15th of may # the virginia convention resolved to * a bill of rights and frame a state government and on the 29th of june following the government was put into * by the election of a governor and other * bill of rights and state constitution having been * and adopted in the * articles of confederation were proposed in # more than a year after the adoption of the declaration of independence for ratification by the thirteen sovereign states these articles required the * ratification of all of the states and as maryland * her consent to this until the 1st of march # they did not go into effect until that time in the meanwhile the congress had continued to exercise its * powers in the * of the war but it had no means of * its * except in the * * of the several states the first three articles were as follows article i the style of this confederacy shall be the united states of america art * each state * its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power * and right which is not by this confederation * delegated to the united states in congress assembled art * the several states * * enter into a firm * of friendship with each other for their common defence the * of their * and their * and general * * themselves to assist each other against all force opposed to or * made upon them or any of them on account of * sovereignty trade or any other * whatever the other articles of confederation * upon congress very little more power than it had been * all important measures required the * of nine states the * being given by the * from each state as a * and not in their individual capacity the right of the states to recall their * and to * others was * reserved so that five states acting together could at any time * the government and the latter had no means of * its * when made but had to * upon the * * of the states as before it will thus be seen that the government organized under the articles of confederation remained still a mere confederacy of several independent states when peace was finally made with great * that power recognized the sovereignty and independence of the several states of new * massachusetts * island * new york new * pennsylvania * maryland virginia north carolina south carolina and georgia by name and not the sovereignty and independence of the united states after the * of peace under the * laws of great * american * * with that country were * to the * of * of the several states to which they belonged which put those states upon the * of so many separate nations the action of the several states upon the subject of slavery and the slave trade during the war and afterwards to the time of the adoption of the constitution of the united states was as follows * as before stated by her constitution adopted in # * the further introduction of slaves virginia did the same thing by her law adopted in # pennsylvania whose legislature had ceased to be under the control of the * as they refused to take part in the revolution adopted a law in # * the further introduction of slaves and giving freedom to all children of slave mothers born after its passage massachusetts * a declaration in her bill of rights adopted in # that all men are born free and equal and under that declaration it was decided by the supreme court of that state in # that slavery was * it cannot be claimed that this declaration was intended to have that effect for if such had been the case it would not have been left to * * to give it but an express provision would have been * on the subject it was a * of * * which was submitted to because no important interest was at * there were a little over # slaves in massachusetts at the date of the revolution * in small numbers among the * and employed * as household servants the * was * engaged in * * * etc and the character of the * was not at all * to slave labor nothing of consequence therefore was to be gained by * the * of the decision and it was the * way of getting * of the matter by quiet * new * adopted a similar * in her second constitution in # and under that it was held that freedom was * to all children born after its adoption maryland adopted in # laws in regard to the introduction of slaves similar to those of virginia * and * island in # adopted laws on the subject of slavery similar to those of pennsylvania the effect of these laws and * was to put an end to the slave trade in all of the states but north and south carolina and georgia to * it in massachusetts and provide for its * * in new * * island * and pennsylvania while it still remained as before in the other states it has been * and probably was true that a large number of the slaves in the northern states were carried to the south and sold there to avoid the * of the * measures which were * this * * very strong * from a comparison of the free colonies * at the north at different * with the number of slaves known to be there at the date of the institution of * measures when taken in connection with the * to that colored * from * slaves and * from the south notwithstanding the provisions for * slavery in the new england states the * and * of those states resumed the * of slaves from * to the * and georgia immediately after the close of the war north carolina however had * the trade as * and * a duty on future * which furnished an * to it so far as that state was * the confederation which during the war under the pressure of the public danger had answered the purpose was found to work very * when peace ensued and the states were no longer * to * with the * of congress by immediate necessity though the states were all * with full powers to * their domestic affairs yet there was a large * * in common which it was necessary to provide for and as the states were * by the articles of confederation to make * and congress had no power to * * or duties on * or * which power rested entirely in the state * there was a very great * of the * * and business of the country * very * * upon all * and interests it became therefore necessary to provide a * for existing * and a convention of * from the states assembled at philadelphia in the year # for the purpose of * the federal system this convention was assembled in * with the * of a previous one that had assembled at * on the invitation of virginia but found its powers * the * of the philadelphia convention which were * over by general washington resulted in the adoption of the constitution of the united states for * to the states for their ratification and by the terms of the constitution it was provided that it should go into effect when * by nine states as to the states * it there were many difficulties in the way of the * of the constitution by reason of * views and interests and the * as * by the convention was the result of a compromise of those views and interests the only questions * in regard to slavery was in * to the * of * in congress and * the foreign slave trade and the * of * slaves the questions in regard to * and * were settled by compromise as was that in regard to the slave trade virginia and maryland were in favor of an * and immediate * of the foreign slave trade while south carolina and georgia opposed any * with it with the two latter states some of the new england * * and after much discussion a compromise was finally effected by * a provision * congress from * * to the year # the * of any persons the states might think proper to admit but giving the power to * a duty on such persons in the * not to * # per head this compromise was effected by an * between the * of south carolina and georgia on the one side and the new england * on the other by which it was agreed to * a provision * congress with the power to pass * laws by a majority * was earnestly desired by new england but was opposed by some of the other * to * the * * any * with the slave trade until the time * for the provision in regard to the slave trade as adopted massachusetts new * and * the only new england states represented * while virginia * with some of the other states against it in all its * final vote being massachusetts new * * maryland north and south carolina in the * and new * pennsylvania * and virginia in the * absent or not * new york * island and georgia the * in regard to the * of * slaves was adopted without any * from any quarter and it was * in almost the * language of the provision on the same subject contained in the old compact of the united colonies of new england without the provision for the return of slaves * into any of the states or the public territory not a solitary southern state would have accepted the constitution and its necessity * and justice were * on all sides without question when the constitution was submitted to the states for ratification it met with a good deal of opposition because it was thought to * too great * on the rights of the states but it was finally * by the end of july # by eleven states and steps were taken to * the government under it which was done in april # by the meeting of the first congress under the constitution and the * of general washington as president north carolina did not * the constitution until november # nor * island until may # and until they did * it they remained as foreign nations to the other states when the ratification was under consideration there was much discussion as to the * of various * and most of the states were induced to give their * by the hope of adoption of * * all * and * * and the ratification was accompanied with the * of such * as were desired in passing the * * the constitution the virginia convention adopted an * * * that when the powers delegated should be * they would be resumed and the new york convention accompanied the ratification with a declaration of the right to withdraw it it is curious in view of subsequent events that massachusetts proposed as an * that all powers not * delegated to congress should be reserved to the states and another that no person be tried for any crime cases in the military and * service * without previous * by a grand * and that in civil cases the right of trial by * be * the first of these was * by virginia and south carolina also and the last by virginia and both were subsequently adopted as * to the constitution on the * of the first congress with only a change of * not at all * their * massachusetts has changed her views since she asserted these * of states rights and civil liberty the constitution of the united states left slavery in the states * where it was before the only provision having any reference to it whatever being that which fixed the * of * in the house of representatives and direct * that in reference to the foreign slave trade and that * the return of * slaves had it been proposed to * any provision giving congress any power over the subject in the states it would have been * and the * of such provision would have * the * of the constitution the government * under this constitution being one of delegated powers entirely those powers were * limited to the * for which they were granted but to prevent all * the 9th and #* * were adopted the first * that the * in the constitution of certain rights shall not be * to deny or * others * by the people and the other that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor * by it to the states are reserved to the states * or to the people it has now been shown how slavery * in the united states and that the federal constitution left its * in every particular where it belonged that is to the several states where it existed save only in regard to the foreign slave trade and the * for the return of * slaves as mentioned state action had already provided for the * of slavery from several of the northern states and this was followed later by a law adopted in new york in # * that all children of slaves born after the #* of july of that year should be free * at # and * at # years of age and a law adopted in new * in # * that all children of slaves born after the #* of july of that year should be free the * at # and the * at # years of age this was the last of the acts for the * of slavery where it previously existed and therefore so far as regarded the original thirteen states slavery was confined to * maryland virginia north and south carolina and georgia except as to the * left in the other states by the acts for * * which * in some of them for a long time if * slavery was a crime who was * for it did the sole * or the greater part of it rest upon the shoulders of the * who * the slaves already * from their homes in the * and * of * or on the shoulders of the * of the original * who found the institution already established as a settled policy or did it rest with those who * the * of these ignorant and * * and * the * * * from their * in their persons * it as national or individual sin where does the * lie the * * of great * and new england are * to the * slave trade upon the * of which they were * built up it has been often said that the assertion contained in the declaration of independence that all men are * equal etc was entirely * with the * of slavery in any of the united states and that the states which continued it were * of a great * who had then a right to make this * was it the * with lord * decision * him in the face and his * of liberty under the common law on his * while his * was upon the neck of * his * * the main * with human * * to * and his * of execution * upon the bodies of

had * * under his feet and caused order to * in * while he * * with every age and * and his ears were * by the sound of the * * was it the * the * the * the * or the * the * the * and the * have not troubled themselves about the matter the fact is that the assertion of independence was made by the * congress by a resolution adopted on the 2d of july # in the following words resolved that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are * from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great * is and ought to be * * that was the * assertion of the independence of the colonies and the declaration of independence adopted afterwards was merely a * put forth to the world to show the reasons which * them to the step and to * it the assertion that all men are * equal was no more * by that declaration as a settled principle than that other which * george * to be a * and * to be the * of a free people the declaration of independence contained a number of * correct principles and some * * uttered under the enthusiasm and excitement of a struggle for the right of * the portion of it in question was not * for the wide application which is sought to be made of it nor is it * of that application the intention of it was to * the right of the people on whose part the declaration was made to * under the law with all other british subjects and to maintain their right to set up a new government for themselves when the one under which they had been living had been * to their * if it was intended to * the * * of all men it was false in principle and in fact taken in its * sense it might be * to mean that all men are * equal in every respect but does any one believe or will any one ever believe that the native * the * or the * negro is the equal * * and * of the * whatever * the words * and those following them may admit of let it be borne in mind that they belong to the * and not to the fact the separation and independence were asserted by the resolution adopted on the 2d of july and not by the declaration adopted on the #* and the latter was no more a part of what was * established than the * * of a judge is a part of his decision the truth is that several of the * of the south and especially of virginia * slavery as an evil and expressed the hope that at some future time in some way that might be desired the institution might be * in such manner as to secure the * of both * but none of them could * any * for doing so and though perfectly * they * themselves with * the hope that the way might be discovered slavery was a fixed fact fastened upon the colonies by the mother country and in the south the slaves bore such a * to the white * and the whole business of the country was so * with their labor that it was impossible to * them without * on both * * far greater than those supposed to result from the existence of slavery itself it was a * question with which the * of the country had to deal as * men and all they could do was to allow the system to remain as the best for all parties under the circumstances without * to the dangerous * of the * * of a false * as to the slave trade * virginia and maryland had already put an end to it as soon as they were * with the power to do so and north carolina followed suit very * after the adoption of the constitution and the * would probably have been made general but for the * of the new england states with the two southern states that were in favor of having the trade continued it would not be * to notice what was * in england on this subject at the time the federal constitution was being adopted * * and others were * the question of the slave trade at this time and the * that the * * then at the head of the government would venture to do was to * the passage of an act of * for the * of the * of the middle passage by which it was provided that slave * should not carry beyond a certain number of slaves in * to the * even this bill met with strong opposition and among others from lord * * the * of the * conscience in * the bill he said it appears that the french have offered * to * the * trade and that they have succeeded the natural * therefore is that we ought to do the same he further said one witness has come to your * bar with a face of * his eyes full of tears and his countenance * with horror and said my * i am * if you pass this bill i have * # on the trade of this year it is all i have been able to gain by my * and if i lose it i must go to the hospital i desire of you to think of such things my * in your * * and to show some humanity to the * as well as the negroes the bill however passed with * to grant * for losses and this was as far as english * would venture to go at that time was it to be expected that american * should be better * and more * than english * * after the close of the war virginia had * to the confederation for the common benefit of all the states the territory * of the * river and massachusetts new york and * had * their rights the claim of * * over pennsylvania and that state made a very good * for herself by * the title to the lands in what has since been known as the western reserve though no officer or soldier or so far as is known citizen of hers had even been in the * territory * original * the * of all covered the country but independent of that it had been * from the indians and british by the forces of virginia under george * * it was a magnificent * which virginia thus surrendered for the common good and for

since # was in consequence of the fact that from that time to the passage of the act the introduction of such persons was * by the laws of all of the states showing that the right to * slaves was

of slavery as it had not only been * by the law * the * of louisiana but existed by * of the old french and * laws still in force in # at the second * of the 9th congress on the * of mr jefferson then president an act was passed for the * of the slave trade from foreign * to the united states to take effect on the 1st day of january # up to that time the trade had been continued by english new england and new york * to south carolina and georgia by * the laws against it when such were in force but it ceased after the united states law went into effect many slaves were introduced into the

passed under the brief * of lord * the * of great * passed the act to * the trade on the part of british subjects though not without serious opposition among the * of the measure was another lord * of england lord * at that time for a short period out of the office which he had held for many years and to which he returned in about two months after the passage of the bill to continue in it until the year # in * the bill lord * said i do not believe the measure now proposed would * the * of negroes or that a single individual would be * by it at the same time that it would be utterly * of the british interests * in that * he asked was it right because there was a change of men and of public measures in consequence that the interests of those who * against the bill should be * and what was before considered fit matter of * should now be * as * and * in the * of * and others in favor of the measure it was shown that there had never been any natural * of the slaves in the british and west * * * of * over * in * being as follows the supply had therefore been kept up by constant * to meet the growing * and the * of the measure urged the following reasons for its adoption the grand the decisive advantage which * the abolition of the slave trade is that by closing the supply of foreign negroes to which the * have * been accustomed to trust for all of their * we will * them to * the * of the slaves on their * and it is * that this cannot be done without * their physical and moral condition thus not only will the * * itself be prevented in so far at least as the * of this country are * but a provision will be made for the * * of the black * in the west * and that too on the * of all * the interests and * * of the * in whose hands they are placed it seems from this that slave * was not considered a crime by the * of that day but this discovery was reserved for those of a later time slavery in the united states has now been brought down to the time of the abolition of the slave trade by both the united states and great * and it will be seen that the former government had no * over the matter in any way except to give protection to that * of property in the states where it existed in the same way that it was bound to protect every other * of property within the * of its delegated powers slavery existed in the states * to the * of the government and independent of it and the states in forming that government as sovereign states reserved to themselves the * power of * or * it at their * not only was this so with regard to the original states but by express * with the states of north carolina and georgia at the time of their * of territory congress had bound itself not to * with slavery in that territory kentucky had been formed out of part of virginia and was admitted into the union upon the same * as that state and by the * with france upon the * of louisiana the faith of the united states was * to respect and protect the right of property in slaves within the limits of the * territory in the same way that it was * to respect and protect the right of property in every thing else this * all of the territory within the limits of the united states except the * territory and to that the * against slavery had been extended by the * of # * to the adoption of the federal constitution the * of that * has been * and certainly if it had any * that was given by the * of virginia from whom the territory was * the act for the organization of the government of the * territory recognized the * of the * contained in the * and did not * it the states which had thought proper to * or * slavery because it was not to their interests to have it had no right to * of its existence in other states if they did not desire to be * to states which * slavery then they should have refused to * the constitution having * it the faith of those states became * by every consideration that can * states as * or men as * to respect the * rights and property of the

* when they came to form state * and that congress in the * should * no measures to * their action they urged that the territory was * by the common blood and * and that congress therefore in its

came to form new states slavery would be * and freedom given to the slaves within the limits of most if not all of those states but * of no kind whether political or religious * to reason and among the * there was much of the * of that old spirit which had * the hanging burning and * of * and * there were many * by trade whose * had been * and who * nothing for the negro or the cause of freedom but who fell in with the * movement as it was called with the * hope of building up a great sectional party under the * of which they could obtain and * that power which they had failed to * otherwise a very large mass of men rarely think for themselves and among this class the leaders of the * * * by * * to their * and * * them to believe that their * interests required that slavery should be * by

for the * of * into the union under a constitution * slavery which had been * adopted a bill to * a * government for * and a bill to * the northern and western * of texas with her * and to * a * government for new mexico it being provided in the * * that states * out of the two * organized when the * should be sufficient should be admitted into the union with or without slavery as the people themselves might decide along with these * another was passed for * the provision of the constitution in regard to the return of * slaves as the former one could not be * because most of the free states had * their officers from acting under it these measures as a whole were not * to the extreme men of either section but the more * portion of the two leading political parties hoped that they would put an end to the * and * peace and * to the country such appeared to be their first effect and both of the great political parties into which the country had been divided without reference to *

at all for slave labor and there was no territory out of which it was * that another slave state could be formed except by the * of texas while there was a * for the * of several more free states at no distant day out of the territory west of the mississippi and north of # # and on the * coast the * of * and * having already been organized by what was called the compromise of # the south had gained nothing whatever except the * principle * in the * and new mexico * of * by congress with the question of slavery and the * of the decision of the question to the people of the * when they came

the united states officers in their efforts to * the law and * in the free states who * its execution and even members on the floor of congress * the law and * resistance to it this served to prevent

of * their citizens and officers to * with the constitution and law many of the free states passed laws to make it a * for the * to arrest his slave or for any one to assist him at the * of congress for # in the introduction of a bill for the * of * for the * of * and * both north of # # a proposition was made by mr * a senator from * to * a provision in regard to slavery similar to that

more * than could be done by * * as * from the north could more * take possession of the * and * slavery from them than * from the south could * slavery there while in congress the southern representatives especially in the senate where the * were more nearly equal could with the aid of a few northern men prevent any * with slavery this view of the subject made the * of * sovereignty even more * than what was called the * * and southern men * that it was a * to * them it was in fact not a question of * of the * in the * bill but of the constitution itself if congress had no power to * on the subject then it could * none and if there was such a thing as * sovereignty it extended to all other subjects as well as to slavery and the * in the * might set up for themselves without any authority from congress which would * some very extraordinary * including that even of * of the public lands the * sovereignty view of the question was one not to be * and it applied to the * and new mexico * as well as to that in regard to * and * the great mass of southern * agreed with the southern * in their way of * the principle but they did not regard the question as one of sufficient * importance to make a fight over and old party divisions and * prevented a * of all of the southern men though considered by many an * question as it certainly was so far as it applied to * and * it seemed to * the * party into two wings a northern and a southern one with some * to either wing from the opposite section this division resulted in the * of two * of * by the * * of * and johnson of

with the * and * * bell of tennessee and * of massachusetts the * of this latter * proposed to * every other issue and stand for the union the constitution and the * of the laws at the election in # lincoln and * received the majority of the popular vote in nearly all of the northern states and by that vote alone secured a majority of the * of the * * but they * very nearly # * of receiving a

a southern man six had been selected from northern states and but one of them harrison of * but a native of virginia received a majority of the popular * of the southern presidents * * vote was * jefferson received twenty northern * * at his first election and all but nine of them at his second madison received a majority of northern * * at his first election and forty of them at his second *

the hands of the entire people under the circumstances * the election of lincoln those of the southern states which are usually * the cotton states * that their own safety required their * from the union and they consequently withdrew the legislature of south carolina was in * for the purpose of * * for president and when the result was * a convention for that state was called which adopted an * of secession on the #* of december # georgia * alabama mississippi and louisiana soon followed the example of south carolina and a congress of the * states met at * alabama early in february 1861 and organized a * government under the style of the confederate states of america of which the honorable jefferson davis of mississippi was appointed president and the honorable a h * of georgia * texas had previously adopted an * of secession which went into effect when it was * by the popular vote and that state soon afterwards became also one of the confederate states a * constitution was adopted for the confederate states to go into effect on the #* of february 1862 * after that of the united states but containing some * in the details and the powers delegated with more * * of states rights and a * of the introduction of slaves from any other than the * states and * of the united states the secession of these states had been without * except to take possession of some forts and * of the united states within the limits of the * states which had been accomplished without * commissioners were appointed to the united states government to effect a peaceful * of all questions between the two * in regard to the public * territory etc this change in the relations of the * states to the united states resulted in no change whatever in the domestic affairs of those states but they continued to be * as before under the laws and * of the several states the * slave states as they were called including north carolina tennessee and * which immediately joined the cotton states on the south though equally * the * upon their rights and the * to be * in the future were not at first disposed to * as they had * such an * * to the union that they were exceedingly * to give it up being * by that sentiment described in the declaration of independence in the assertion that * are more disposed to suffer while * are * than to right themselves by * the * to which they are accustomed the majority of the people of those states were * by hope that the party which was about to obtain possession of the government would not long hold together and they trusted that the * second thought of the people of the north would keep the * party within * until it could be * from power and that in the * * might be obtained for the rights of the states so as to bring the government back to a * with its original * and effect a * of the union this was especially the case with the state of virginia which had made so many * to * and * the union which in great part had been the work of her own hands the legislature of virginia was in * when the secession of the cotton states began and the * was of such a threatening nature that an act was passed * for the * of a convention * with the sovereign power of the state but * at the same time that a vote should be taken upon the question of any * of secession which might be adopted and that it should be submitted to the popular vote for ratification before it should be * the legislature also by resolution invited a convention of commissioners from all of the * states north and south to * at washington for the purpose of * upon and * some plan for * the * difficulties with a view to a * of the union this latter convention assembled and was known as the peace convention the election for members of the virginia convention took place on the first monday in february 1861 and a large majority of the * * were opposed to secession the convention assembled at the capitol in richmond on the 13th of february and a decided union man mr john * of * was chosen president a * body containing more general * and worth had rarely if ever assembled in the state and all of the members seemed to be impressed with the * character of the * this convention contained one distinguished gentleman who had been president of the united states another who had been governor of the state a number who had filled * in the federal congress two who had been heads of * in the cabinet at washington besides many others among the most * and distinguished * and * of the state there was a * of sentiment among the union members as to the terms upon which it would be safe for the state to remain in the union but a very large majority were earnestly in favor of some * in the way of * to the constitution of the united states by which the * states could be induced to return while the members * immediate secession * a very small * a committee was at once appointed which after considerable * reported a plan of * for * to the other states through congress after its adoption by the convention in the * the peace convention which assembled at washington had adopted a proposition for * which met with no favor at the hands of the republican members of congress and was not entirely * to a majority of the virginia convention * of compromise in congress had also failed the virginia convention engaged earnestly in the discussion of the report of its committee and * * and continued it until the month of april having in the * * down by a very large majority a direct proposition for secession it is difficult to describe the intense anxiety felt by most of the members of the convention to preserve the peace of the country and effect an * * of the * lincoln had been * president on the #* of march and had delivered an * address that was * in its terms during the whole of the discussion which was * in the virginia convention the members engaged in the effort to preserve peace and * the union received no offer whatever of * from the * of the white house and no direct answer ever reached them as coming from him to persons who approached him on the questions * all hearts and minds in the state in the early part of april the convention had become very anxious in regard to the * condition of things and appointed a committee of three of its members of great ability and experience to wait upon mr lincoln and * from him in a * manner what course he proposed to take in regard to the * states this committee reached washington a little before the attack on fort sumter in charleston harbor and had an interview with mr lincoln receiving very little * from him while the committee was awaiting a * answer which was promised the news of the * of the * of fort sumter was received and the reply from mr lincoln appeared in * * from the press without having been * to the committee this reply was * in its terms like the * but was rather stronger on the question of * the committee at once returned and reported to the convention the result of its mission and fort sumter having fallen a * from lincoln soon followed on the 15th of april calling on the states virginia * for # troops to * the forts places and property which have been seized from the union there was no * that this meant war on the * states and the virginia convention went into secret * when an * of secession was introduced by mr * preston * of the committee which had waited on lincoln and up to that time an * of secession after a very earnest discussion that * was adopted on the #* day of april a number of members of the convention including myself who afterwards fully * the action of the state * against the passage of this * with the hope even in that stage of the * that the people of the north would not * to the call of lincoln for troops and that a * of the union and the horrors of war might still be * the scenes which occurred during the discussion which ensued after the convention went into secret * were * by a * rarely witnessed in a * body and several members while speaking were unable to * their tears as for myself it was exceedingly difficult to surrender the * of a * to that union which had been * by the blood of so many * and which i had been accustomed to look upon in the language of washington as the * of the political safety and * of the country and therefore i had hoped even against hope but i soon became * fully that the action of the convention was right and that it could have pursued no other course * with the honor and dignity of virginia and in this opinion i have remained firmly fixed notwithstanding the result of the war which ensued after the passage of the * of secession provision was made for * it to the popular vote for ratification at the * to be held on the fourth * in may in the * steps were taken for * the state in a condition of defence and an * was passed * the governor to call into service of the state as many volunteers as might be necessary to defend it against invasion colonel robert e lee a native and citizen of virginia who had resigned his commission in the united states army on hearing the action of his state was appointed by the governor with the consent of the convention commanderinchief of all of the forces of the state with the rank of major general in the * an * was made with the confederate government for assistance in * the state in the event of an attempt by the government at washington to march troops into or through it with a view to an invasion of any of the * states and the confederate government was invited to remove to the city of richmond the convention remained in * until the first day of may when it * over to the second week in june to * the result of the popular vote on the * of secession the ratification was given by an * majority of the popular vote and upon the * of the convention the * was * * by the greater part of the members i had * for the ratification at the * and now put my * to the * virginia now had fully and completely * her connection with the united states and resumed the powers she had delegated when she * the constitution to this step she had been * against her previous * by the course of the government at washington to avoid being dragged into an * war against the cotton states and to maintain the * principles for which she had fought and which she had * asserted since the adoption of the united states constitution when the act of secession was complete she adopted the constitution of the confederate states both * and * and was fully admitted into the confederacy north carolina tennessee and * * withdrew from the union and became members of the confederacy for the same reasons which * virginia missouri subsequently passed an * of secession and joined the confederacy but that state was soon * by united states troops and the regular government was * and another * in its place by the force of federal * kentucky * to occupy a * position until the greater part of that state was in the power of the federal troops when an * government was formed which passed an * of secession and joined the confederacy the situation of maryland was such that she was soon * by troops and prevented any * expression of opinion the members of her legislature being seized and * little * was so * that its voice was never heard at all the causes which led to the secession of the southern states have never been given and when they are * with those which led to the american revolution as given by the first * congress the latter * into * * a large portion of the * * of in the declaration of independence were acts committed after the * of the * between the british troops and the * and if these were * with those committed by the federal troops in the beginning of the war in maryland kentucky and missouri to say nothing of the long list of * * during its progress the * against king george contained in the * language of the declaration of independence would be a very * affair in comparison with that which could be preferred against the government at washington the third article of the confederation had * the object for which it had been formed and that it was a firm * of friendship for the common defence the * of the * and the * and general * and that the states bound themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or * made upon them or any of them on account of * sovereignty trade or any other * whatever the * to the constitution * that it was made to form a more perfect union more perfect how to the * of the * and sovereignty of the states had the conduct of the northern states been that of the members of a firm * and friendship and when they had so * * and * the plain * of the constitution did not the southern states have the same right to withdraw from the connection with them that the colonies had to withdraw from the connection with great * because the government which had been * for the common defence and general * had become * of those * who was to judge of whether there was a necessity for * the connection the * or the * if the former then the decision would have been against the colonies if colonies the mere * from the mother country could * to judge the * of the * and the * and measure of * could not sovereign states which had * the government of which they * do the same thing in * from the union the cotton states had * as states and not as * * * the laws or authority of the government the right of no one had been * and it was not proposed to * the rights of any * or states but merely to * a compact the terms of which had been * to * to * those states by military force was * of the whole spirit and purpose of the constitution and made the government the master instead of the agent of the powers which had * it this * of * had never been asserted by any * * since the * of the government and was at war with all of its principles and * when therefore the other states were called upon to * in this war of * against the cotton states it was not only their right but their duty to resist by the very terms of the constitution it was made the duty of the federal government to protect the states against invasion did that government have the right to * the state it was bound to protect it was not authorized even to protect the states against domestic * except upon invitation of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature was not in * was it authorized to * that domestic * the power of * * the * consequence of * the states to * * when * and this * the * of the government itself in regard to this question of the right of the states to withdraw and the power of * it is not * to call attention to the following views expressed by mr * * one of the * * and * * of the republican or abolition party in an article published in the new york * a few days after the election of lincoln in # and * in his work * the american conflict he says that was a base and * * that was once raised at southern * about the ears of john * * because he presented a * for the * of the union the * had a right to make the request it was the members duty to present it and now if the cotton states consider the value of the union * we maintain their perfect right to * it * we hold with mr jefferson to the * right of * to * or * * of government that have become * or * and if the cotton states shall decide that they can do better out of the union than in it we * upon * them go in peace the right to * may be a * one but it * nevertheless and we do not see how one party can have a right to do what another party has a right to prevent we must ever resist the asserted right of any state to * in the union and * and * the laws * to withdraw from the union is quite another matter and whenever a considerable section of our union shall * * to go out we shall resist all * measures to keep it in we hope never to live in a * * one section is * to another by * but while we * the * liberty if not the * right of secession we must * that the step be taken if ever it shall be with the * and * becoming so * an issue let * time be given for reflection let the subject be fully * before the people and let a popular vote be taken in every case before secession is * let the people be told just why they are asked to break up the confederation let them * * then vote and let the act of secession be the * of an * popular * a judgment thus rendered a demand for separation so * would either be * in without * of blood or those who rushed upon * to * or defeat it would place themselves clearly in the wrong it would be hard to * language more * for * the right of the states to withdraw and the wrong and * of the attempt to * them when they had * that right than this of mr * it * additional force as coming from him when it is * that he had ever been * to the * of the south and it announced principles which had been previously asserted in all questions of the union and * the whole * of a government which itself was * on the right of revolution it is difficult to realize the fact that the man who uttered language like that * subsequently became one of the most * * of the war of * which was * on the southern states mr * cannot avoid the effect of his statement of the principles asserted in his article by * that the act of separation was not the * of an * popular * and that the southern people were * into secession without due * when the right to * * and decide * those * it must * be the sole * of how it is to be * the southern states did * and did decide that they could no longer remain in the union with safety and therefore they determined to withdraw from it if the southern people had been hurried into secession by their leaders they are the parties to * and to hold the * ones * they have not done so and what right had mr * and his party to become their * against their wishes he and his party are * from * that the southern people did with almost entire * * secession and * gave their support to the cause of separation for since their country was * by a superior military force their state * * military * established over them and in the effort to * the union the great mass of the people * and the right of * given to the * slaves because it was * that the southern people were still * and so * to the idea of secession notwithstanding the bitter experience of the war that they could not be trusted with the right to vote and hold office all of this was done with mr * full knowledge and * it has been shown how long how earnestly and how * the question was * in virginia and that secession was * to by that state only when a war of * had been * and she had been required to furnish troops to carry it on the state of virginia believed with mr * that it would be a * wrong to rush upon * to * and defeat the right of the cotton states to withdraw from the union and she determined to do what he had declared his purpose of doing that is resist all * measures the * of secession was submitted to the popular vote at an election held more than one month after its adoption by the convention and it was * by an * majority thus showing beyond * that it was the * of an * popular * did not those who rushed upon * to * and defeat a judgment thus rendered a separation so * place themselves clearly in the wrong yet virginia was the first of the * states * by the federal army her * and * were * by a long and cruel war her people * * and * her territory * and a new state * within her limits in * of the constitution of the united states subsequently a military * was thrust upon them and the * slaves were * with the right of * and the capacity to hold office while such wide measures of * were adopted that enough men * to fill the * * of state even with those whose * and * led them to * and the * of * could not be found in all the limits of that old * which has been * the mother of states and of * in the case of maryland kentucky and missouri the people were * by federal troops * to the peculiar nature of their situation and they were * of the opportunity of freely * and * upon the questions * though the legislature of missouri did pass an * of secession did not those people under such circumstances have the right * to resist so * an * upon their rights and * they were not only * of the liberty of * * to * their * but it was sought to * them of the right to keep and bear arms as * * by the second * to the constitution in order that they might have the means always of * their * and rights and the only * they had was to unite as * in the defence of the common cause and of their own * homes and * it has been said that the confederate states began the war by firing upon fort sumter if those states had the right to withdraw from the union and the united states had no right to resist or * them then the attempt to maintain a * fort in one of the most important * of the confederacy was an act of war this had nevertheless been * borne with for nearly three months after the secession of south carolina in whose * harbor the fort was * and it was only when the government of the united states had given notice of its intention to supply fort sumter * if possible otherwise by force and the * for that purpose had appeared off the harbor that the attack began the commissioners sent to washington to effect a * * of all questions had then been denied an audience and informed that the authorities at washington would hold no * with them the war was thus * and the federal authorities were quietly preparing for it in order to * the * states the * to supply fort sumter indicated a purpose of war was then the confederate government to wait until the measures of the government at washington had been so completely taken that the former would find itself helpless in the hands of its enemy the port of charleston was necessary to it as an * for * supplies and arms for its defence was it then to allow the port which could * the entrance to that harbor to be placed in a condition to render the * complete the harbor * and charleston * there can be no question of the right of the confederate government to force a surrender of the fort which had been refused and that it was fully * in * the course it did i must confess that at the time i deeply * and * the attack on fort sumter on the * of policy because i regarded the * of the washington government as * to * a * of the conflict by the firing of the first shot and not intended really to be carried into effect it is now * that war had already been resolved upon and the firing of the first gun on fort sumter was not its * the war was begun by the attempt to hold the forts in the confederate * it has been * that the southern states had previously * the policy of the government and that they * because they had now lost that power there had never been a president * from any of the cotton states which established the confederate government except from louisiana of which state general taylor was a * * but really a native of virginia and an officer in the army and he lived but a little over a year after his * these cotton states had furnished * few cabinet * and they had in the main been opposed to the policy pursued by the government in regard to the most important * of * such as * * the public lands * etc their leading interest the * of cotton had received no * care whatever from the government and south carolina had been * for more than thirty years that her interest had been * to northern * by high * and at one time she had taken steps to * the laws on that subject in no sense could the state which * secession be said to be * by disappointment at the loss of federal power it is true that they had lost the power to protect themselves in the union as the constitution had been so * * and were now threatened with * for this they * the state of virginia had given four of the southern presidents to the union and tennessee the other two washington had been the * choice of all of the states jefferson madison and * had been national men in their policy and had received the support of a large majority of the northern vote * being accepted without

times against mr clay and in the cases of harrison taylor and scott her vote had been cast for northern men against them all of the presidents she had given had been * because there was nothing sectional or * in their policy while no northern president had been * though three out of the six had been * again in the election of # the state of virginia cast its vote for bell and * by a * vote over * and * and * and johnson showing that in this election she was not * to the charge of * even if that charge could be brought against the * of * and * which is by no means admitted no interest of

idea that any of the southern states * to secession because of the loss of the power and * of the government is not * on fact as neither had ever been used for their special benefit even when in the

lands and the * system of * in the same quarter had been built up * from grants of this common property it has been further * that it was the slave power which attempted to break up the government because of its defeat and that that power had * * the government in its interest in the first place it is as well to state that as far as the executive * of the government was * there had been nothing of which to * on the part of the southern people the great difficulty had been with the * department which always * a * more or less to be * on the subject of slavery and the southern people looked to the executive to * its * influence the * of northern men in congress already increased by the * of * and * and soon further to be increased by the * of * had become so great that the only hope of the south was in the executive and when that * of the government was also * there was no safety for the * section the people of the south had never asked the government to protect slavery they had merely asked that it should be let alone and left where the constitution left it in * the union they had * for a government for certain general purposes and not one to * their domestic affairs and they claimed that the government should be confined to the purposes for which it was * that government had in no way * so as to * slavery and it had not been able to * with the express * for the return of * slaves slavery had been * from an immense territory by the action of the government but it had not been carried to one foot of territory by that action all of the new states east of the mississippi except * had been formed out of territory * belonging to the slave states and they had been admitted into the union under that provision of the constitution which declared that such states should be admitted upon the same * in every respect with the original states and to add to this * not to * with their domestic * the states * the territory had * * that there should be no * with slavery louisiana came in by * as slave territory and with a * for the protection of the people in their property out of that territory three slave states had been formed and they were the last there was any * of forming while the free states of * * and * had already been admitted from the same territory with the * of the * * of * and * and the not * * of an * number of other free states from the same territory texas had come in as a state from the condition of an independent * and the measures leading to her * had resulted in the * and * of * as a free state with a * of more free states from the territory * so that in every case of the introduction of new slave territory into the union there had been * more than * in territory for the * of free states except in the case of the slave territory of * and when that was * the * larger and more important slave territory of texas had been surrendered it is not a fact then in any sense of the term that the government had been used for the

power were the most * * of the condition of the slaves themselves and of the social relations of the southern people in order to * the * of the world against their cause this course of * had long been pursued before the war and was not confined to american * but many works appeared from the british press containing * upon the society of the southern states and false views of slavery as established there such works in both * were evidently written by persons with * minds or who knew little * of slavery as it existed in the south such was the * of the public sentiment which had been * in both * upon the subject that no * and * account of the * of domestic slavery as it existed in the southern states would be received with the * favor * the * * of * * by the * and * * of the slaves were eagerly accepted as the truth a very striking evidence of this * was furnished by the reception given to the works of two female * not many years since the one miss * * later mrs * wrote a work of * called uncle * * containing * of slavery and * upon southern society drawing upon a * imagination and * to the * of the * she published the book which had a great run in europe as well as america and

have been a * if every fact contained in it had been true in * cases but the book was received as a true and faithful picture of society and slavery in the south not merely by the * of abolition but by that very considerable class of persons in the world who allow others to do their thinking and when the * visited great * she was treated with great attention and * * by the * * and others the view

* of domestic slavery as it actually existed and in all of its details and she * herself of that opportunity to make her own * in letters to friends at home she gave the result of her * * and upon her
