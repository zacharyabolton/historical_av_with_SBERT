but i was * to act in the matter and though i * them to let me go to him if but for a moment it was refused after being * to the * and * conduct of captain * who seemed to * himself especially to make everything as * as he possibly could for me i arrived in * * about # am on * morning captain * immediately went on shore to report to captain * the * and * to butler to whose care i was to be committed until the exchange boat should start for richmond meanwhile all the * had * and i was left in the charge of the * * major now general * the exchange officer returned on board with captain * and was introduced to me i found him an * and * gentleman in a short time i was * from the boat to the * office passing between a company of negro soldiers who were * on each side thence i was taken into the * to * headquarters and after waiting a short time i was conducted into his august presence he was seated near a table and upon my entrance he looked up and said ah so this is miss * the famous rebel spy pray be seated thank you general butler but i prefer to stand i was very much * and trembled greatly this he noticed and remarked pray be seated but why do you * so are you frightened no ah that is yes general butler i must * that i do feel frightened in the presence of a man of such * reputation as yourself this seemed to please him * and * his hands together and smiling most * he said oh pray do be seated miss * but what do you mean when you say that i am * known i mean general butler i said that you are a man whose * conduct and * especially to southern ladies is so * that even the english * * upon it i naturally feel * at being in your presence he had evidently expected a * when i commenced to reply to his * but at the close of my * he rose and with rage * upon every * of his features he ordered me out of his presence i was conducted to the hotel and felt for the time being exceedingly * lest by my * shot at an enemy whom i thoroughly * i should have laid myself open to his * spirit of * i feared that i should be * to a dreary prison * for general butler was * in the north about this period events have since clearly proved this man even to the yankees themselves to be but a * hero and a political * like others who render themselves rather * than great he first pleased a * * by his acts of * then * his * who feared that he might become to america what * had been to france the * of new orleans having failed most * at * was discovered to be a * and * of being a * well might the * new england * * * * * in the hope of being * a modern * he retired to * to live upon the * * * by * or force from southern people but to * the * of my story i was obliged to give my * that i would not leave the house until permitted to do so here i found the * * sisters of the confederate general * and a miss * of baltimore who were to be sent south these ladies however were not the only confederate * in the hotel there were others whose names i dare not mention on * evening the order came for miss * and myself to be in * to start that same night for richmond the * * for some reason were not allowed to proceed but were sent back to baltimore when the time arrived for our departure we were taken back to the * office and here i found my * * of two * * and a * the * were demanded of me and i * with the request a man and two women immediately set to work to * my * although i assured them that they need not search as i had just come from prison this appeal however was * and they still continued their examination imagine their astonishment and my * when they * from the * of one of my * two * of private clothes a uniform for majorgeneral w a dozen * * c these things i had succeeded in * into prison by means of an * * of which * wood sharp as he * himself to be was little aware i was * as to how i had obtained the articles in question but they did not * in * anything by their * all the * considered * including several * of army * and felt * with a pair of * which had formerly belonged to general jackson and which i greatly * together with much clothing were taken from me i * them to let me * the * but this was * refused and they were to my * given to general butler when i saw how these * were * me of nearly everything i * in vain to * my tears and my * having been thoroughly * i was informed that i must * a personal search at this turn of affairs i began to feel very nervous for i had concealed about me twenty thousand dollars in confederate notes five thousand in * and nearly one thousand in gold as well as the letters of introduction which i have previously mentioned i earnestly * to their * * them that i had nothing * for i did not consider my money * as it was getting late the captain said well if you will take an oath to the effect that you have nothing * upon you no letters or papers you shall not be * as this was impossible i told him that i could not make such a declaration * him my letters at the same time he then asked if i had any money about me to this i replied by giving him a roll of two or three thousand dollars in confederate money which i had placed in my pocket this he regarded as * and * informed me that i might keep that * upon opening my letters and finding mention of my immense services to my country my kindness towards prisoners my devotion to the southern cause c he became very * and said i shall send this to general butler in the morning i would do so now but it is after office hours miss * sat by meanwhile a quiet * of the whole affair she having * the * of search in the morning we were then conducted to the * placed on board a * and sent off to the exchange boat the city of new york which lay at * in the stream upon our arrival on board we were kindly received by major * who conducted us to the * and introduced us to his wife a very charming * woman here we remained all night and next morning about seven oclock got under way * afterwards we ran * and it was not until # am that we succeeded in getting the vessel off again then under a full head of * we * for city point about this time the little * that had brought us * the city of new york * the * apparently in * of us my heart sank for i felt * that this pursuit had something to do with me and that general butler must have given an order for my * but the larger steamer had already waited so long that major * * and * at the delay took no notice of our * and to my great joy and relief kept steadily on our course i afterwards * that my * upon this occasion were not * when general butler * with the * of my farewell * had * the letters that captain * had taken from me he commanded that i should be followed and if * should be sent at once to fort warren in massachusetts bay as he issued this order he remarked to those who surrounded him that he would take a leading character in beauty and the * when the * returned from her * * he was almost beside himself with rage at being * in his * this i had from such good authority that i am * the general will not feel it worth his while to * the statement at the mouth of the james river we passed the federal * * and were here * by a boat from the * * commanded by * lee in a few moments we had entered the james whose waters are * from those of the potomac by a yellow * which appears on the * as we * our way up the river we could see the * at the different * * * our approach and occasionally we observed confederate soldiers on * duty everything * me that i was once more drawing near to the capital of my own * south * * * * * a * * in * e * * * * * * though exceedingly happy that i was again permitted to * the pure air of my native state i did not feel completely free for i was still under the federal * and could scarcely count upon my liberty as being yet fully assured to me we arrived at city point late on * evening this place which could hardly be * * with the name of village is * in a * of the river it was used as a * by the confederates for the purpose of * stores to those of their unfortunate * who were prisoners in the north * the city of new york coming to an * major * his wife miss * and myself stood * on the * major * remarked * to what was apparently the confederate * boat approaching after all ladies you will not have to remain on board here tonight looking in the direction indicated we distinctly saw a steamer which * from the distance between us would in less than ten minutes be * ten minutes however passed in * * then followed twenty more of hope * when major * who began to grow very * went on shore to * the reason of her remaining as she did he even sent a boat to her to * the reason of her * major * was so * that he had seen her that the confederate officer commanding the point * the news to richmond judge of our great surprise when the * reply brought to us on board * afterwards announced that the confederate * boat had left richmond exactly at the hour we had seen her as richmond was more than twelve hours distant from us at the then * of travel over that route we could only consider that we had been * by a * how often must such * have given rise to stories of * * a french * which had been up the river to richmond lay at * near us this evening in * of an invitation from major * the french captain and his lieutenant came on board to spend the evening with us and we enjoyed their visit * the next morning when i * i found that the * boat had arrived during the night captain * the confederate exchange officer presently came on board we were introduced to him and very soon afterwards were with our * safely * in the * little * of the here under my own * flag i felt free and * happy on our way up the river to richmond we had to pass the * * between * and * * these places take their names from the bold appearance that the shore here * the * * to * a * * became * * to our confederate vessel she ran * of them and it was found utterly impossible to continue the * at * * therefore we went on board a * in which we proceeded to richmond when we arrived at # * i went immediately to the * house and tired and worn out with the * of my journey i retired to rest * to see any one that evening kind reception at richmond i hear of my fathers death efforts of my friends to * my return home i go from richmond further south kindness of friends during my illness i am made * of * from richmond too late for the * i take passage in the * when i came down to breakfast on the following day my many * and friends in the hotel were * to see me for few had expected that i should be * and none that i should so soon * at richmond the morning papers announced my return in * terms and as it thus became generally known i was at once * with company and every afternoon and evening i held a perfect drawingroom if i may be allowed to make use of the expression my reception was everything that i could wish but alas my happiness was of short * and my freedom was * bought i was at a large * on a saturday evening exactly one week after the day i had arrived i was * and * little * of the blow that was to * me with * little * that i should be so * * of the words of the * that in the midst of life we are in death but so it was on monday morning the #* before i had * i received a little note from captain * in which he expressed great sorrow at having to be the * of mournful * and said that as soon as i was dressed he would call in person with the wife of the * of the hotel for one moment i could not imagine what he meant but * myself as speedily as i possibly could i sent for them they came captain * held in his hands a * he approached me saying miss belle you are aware that you left your father ill in one moment i * everything and * my god is he dead i sank * to the floor this * was succeeded by severe illness and i felt all the * of my position an * for the yankees held possession of martinsburg and an orphan these words described me and ah how hard they seemed one of those strange * that are sometimes given to * or that are some would say the * of an excited brain * by * ought to have prepared me for my sad * some say that * of a * world visit the soul in sleep the night upon which my father died i had retired to rest somewhat earlier than usual how long i slept i do not know but i suddenly * or seemed to * from my sleep although i had neither the power nor the wish to move in the centre of the room i saw general jackson whose eyes rested * upon me beside him stood my father * at me but saying nothing i was * or i should have spoken for i did not feel * as i looked upon those two standing together general jackson turned and spoke to my father i remember the words distinctly it is time for us to go he said and taking my fathers hand he led him away * as he did so poor child i afterwards * by a letter from my mother the first and only communication received from her until my arrival in this country that my beloved father at the news of my being sent south where i should have to battle alone with the world had grown rapidly worse and had * the very next day after my arrival in richmond my mother and the children had been sent for and reached my father just before he died although he * his * up to the last he frequently spoke of me declared that i was * around his * and would become quite restless if people in the room went to a certain spot near the bed * that i was being torn from him several of our * and exchange officers with many other * persons wrote to the federal government to try and obtain permission for me to return to my * mother i myself wrote to the northern president and secretary * at the suggestion of my friends and * to them as a * daughter but no every appeal was refused my letters to and from my mother in martinsburg were * and from december the #* until i arrived in london and then not until the following october did i receive one line from her though she had written * my health was very bad and my constitution greatly * so in february i went from richmond farther south visiting * * * and other * whose names have since become * i cannot express one half the gratitude that i feel to the many kind * whom i met in my journey through the south during my illness in richmond i was well * for and * the * of my friends must be * the wife of the * captain * afterwards * * of the * alabama mrs * treated me with as much attention as though i had been her own daughter and invited me to visit them at their home in * i had always been * the child of the confederacy or the child of the army and no matter where i went i was * both by the * and the people in march i returned to richmond when although somewhat recovered my health still required care i could not return home and i felt * restless and unhappy at the death of my father i determined therefore to visit europe so soon as i could * my affairs when i made known this resolution to president davis he * of the plan * me to need quiet and rest in some place * from the * of our * pressed country orders were given to the confederate secretary of state to make me the * of * i commenced preparations for departure as speedily as

departure of the * in which i was to have * this steamer would not be followed by another for at least a * because they did not run out during the brilliant nights of the full moon lest they should

not a * * in port one of the first * that arrived was the * commanded by captain henry formerly it is said an officer in the united states navy and who had at the * of the war with many of his

gladly accepted his kind invitation and took passage on board the * feeling * secure under such a * commander i leave * for europe running the * safe outside * de * the federal * the * the yankee * too fast the first shell the fire * hot forced to surrender the english * and his flag on the #* of may i bade farewell to many friends in * and stepped on board the * it was as may well be * an

my own resources and i looked to fortune who is so often the * of a daring * at the mouth of the river we dropped * and decided to wait until the already * moon should entirely * outside the bar and

the distance between us and our * her * rose higher and higher her * * larger and larger and i was told plainly that unless some * accident should * us such as a * * of the federal * * * or a breaking

a thin white * of smoke rose high in the air as the enemy * up and presented her formidable * almost * with the * sound of the shell as it buried itself in the sea within a few yards of us came the * report of its * under water the enemys * now followed each other in rapid * some fell very close while others less * * were wide of the mark and burst high in the air over our heads during this time *

burn her by all means i am not afraid i have made up any mind and am * to my fate if only the federals do not get the vessel to this captain henry made no reply but turned * away and walked * where his officers were standing in a group with them he held a hurried * and then coming to where i was seated exclaimed it is too late to burn her now the yankee is almost on board of us we must surrender during all this time the enemys fire never ceased round shot and shell were * up the water about us they * before behind and above everywhere but into us and although i knew that the first of those heavy * which should strike must be fatal to many perhaps to all yet so * did i feel that i could have * my own life if by so doing i could have * the federals of their * at this moment we were not more than half a mile from our * for we had * up in the wind and stopped our * suddenly with a deep * sound came a * * this shot was fired from their long gun * and passed just over my head between myself and the captain who was standing on the bridge a little above me by * dont they intend to give us quarter or show us some mercy at any * cried captain henry i have surrendered and now from the yankee came a * * steamer * * down that flag or * will * a * into you captain henry then ordered the man at the * to lower the * but he replied with true british * that he had * many times under that flag but had never yet seen it * down and added he i cannot do it now we were * under british * and the man at the * was an * all this time repeated * of * down that flag or we will * you greeted us until at last some one i know not who seeing how hopeless it must be to brave them longer took it upon himself to * captain * order and * the english * we are * by an officer from the yankee the us steamer * an officer but no gentleman strange state of yankee * scenes on board of the * after her capture aint * * a proud * before the * of our surrender had been made a * containing some twenty or thirty thousand dollars * in value to about six thousand * * had been brought up on * and * to the deep * all my * and letters of introduction of which latter i had many were * in the * very * afterwards we were * by a * * from our * under the command of the executive officer mr * * the side he walked up to captain henry and said good day to you captain i am glad to see you this is a very fine vessel and a valuable one will you be good enough to let me see your papers to this captain henry replied good day to yourself sir but as to my being happy to see you i cannot really say that i am i have no papers the federal lieutenant then said well captain your presence is required on board the united states steamer * captain * commanding and if you can prove yourself all right you will no doubt be permitted to go to this captain henry made no * but * into the * * his coat and returning on * said now sir i am ready shall we go without further * the two stepped together into the boat which was lying * and immediately * for the * one mr * was left in charge of our * * an officer as * for authority as any who has ever * the * of a * his * were i imagine well * with his character and * at all events they treated his orders not with respect but * now * said he * the * of * look out for your men and i will look out for mine by the way though station one man here to guard the * and dont let any one go below the first man i catch doing so i will blow his * out i will i would not let my own father have a drink he might possibly have * the * of a * * but he proved quite unable to * those of the men he had hardly finished speaking when a * whom by his * * i * at once for a true son of * approached and addressed mr * with all the native * and * of his country ah mr * will * be * * me have a small * of * to * out the could the * that ensued was * in the extreme * in a victory of the * * over the federal officer this example of successful * once set was soon followed and in every instance mr * yielded to the * or rather to the * * of his men here suddenly exclaimed he * a * of myself * of the guard * of the guard put a man in front of this door and give him orders to * this women if she * to attempt to come out this order so * becoming an officer and a gentleman so * in its language and * so necessary to the safety and * of the * was given in a * voice and in the very words i have used i record them for the purpose of showing how * the federal government has selected its * officers and how * and * they * the instructions of their * * * must have been * out from the * of the ancient poet read in those * which had the honour of * them mr * then came to the * door and introduced himself in these brief but delicate words now aint * * my blood was * and i replied no i am not i was never frightened at a yankee in my life this * of mine seemed to surprise him as he walked away without another word the * of his * however soon made themselves felt to my * * the officers and even the men were permitted to walk at pleasure into my * which i had hoped would have been * as the * of a * girl in this hope as in so many others i * far too much upon the * and humanity of yankees and these qualities were * exhibited when their enemies were * and consequently at their mercy officers and men now proceeded to help themselves to the private * of the captain in spite of the * of the * who had been placed in front of my door and of whom it is but justice to say that nature had * him to command when his * would have done well to obey while these scenes were being * my maid and a * woman whom captain henry was * to a lady in * were * to the rude * of the * * at this moment one of the * officers a mr * walked up to me and said do you know that it was i who fired the shot that passed close over your head was it replied i should you like to know what i said of the * i should like to know that man * he may be is an * * to fire upon a * ship after her surrender to this * of mine more * perhaps than * he made no reply but left the * with an * laugh an * meeting a gentleman at last a * * mr * i am disappointed a pleasant exchange farewell to mr * a * incident captain * best * i am discovered through * scarcely had the * yankee * himself to my intense satisfaction upon * when i noticed a young officer who had just come over the side he crossed the * by the * and approached the * i saw at a glance he was made of other * than his comrades who had * him and i confess my attention was * by the presence of a gentleman the first i think my readers will allow whom i had met in the hour of my distress a woman and a wife may perhaps be * if in a work which * of more serious * than those of love she * in a very brief * of the impression produced upon her by her future husband * may smile but i * myself that * so * and so * * for * devotion will forgive me his dark brown hair hung down on his shoulders his eyes were large and bright those who judge of beauty by * of * only could not have pronounced him * handsome neither * nor * would have chosen the subject for a * of * grace but the * of his manner was such his every movement was so much that of a * gentleman that my southern * strong as they were yielded for a moment to the * of my heart and i said to myself oh what a good fellow that must be to my secret disappointment he passed by the * without * or making any * about me i asked one of the * officers who was close to me the name of the new arrival in this party of pleasure lieutenant * was his reply soon afterwards i heard the following conversation which i perfectly well remember and which i * * between mr * and mr * mr * * * anything up what is it mr * yes sir by order of captain * i have come to relieve you of the command of this vessel it is his order that you proceed * on board the * you will be pleased to hand over to me the papers you have in * to this vessel mr * it is a lie it is a lie it aint no such thing i wont believe it you have been * * with the captain * it that is the way you always do mr * mr * i am but * my orders you must not * me if you continue to do so i shall report you mr * * at once i suppose as i heard nothing further on his side he promptly handed over his orders as desired by mr * * into the boat * and i caught the last sound of his charming voice as he uttered the word of command give way there to the * * he returned to the * and so passes out of this story if its pages ever meet his eye perhaps they may make him * that courtesy to a lady is * with the * duties of an officer and that * to the * has always been the * of a truly brave man within a few minutes of the departure of our * * mr * now in command issued his orders to the * of * as to how the men were to be posted and i * not without an emotion of pleasure the * telling one of our officers that although mr * might be a * * on duty there was not a * young fellow in the navy and that his men would follow him * before long mr * came * and * to me asked permission to enter my * for a moment certainly i replied i know that i am a prisoner i am now in command of this vessel said he and i beg you will consider yourself a * not a prisoner with the * of mr * command i may safely say from the very moment he came on board the conduct of the * * * a complete change and one of the yankee officers remarked in my hearing that although * was young he knew how to command other men and had * early in life the secret and the value of * half an hour or * * and i was * myself to my * when the return on board of captain henry was the occasion of a * incident which * me more than perhaps my readers will suppose i despair of * it as it appeared to me perhaps the * of my own feelings such as we experience after passing safely through sudden and serious danger gave it a * beyond its real * it was on this wise captain henry coming on board caught sight of a federal * * about on the cotton * in a pair of his captain * very best * * which the captain most particularly * here you fellow what are you doing with my * take them off at once or i shall report you to the officer in command for * but sir said the * * to part with his * * i bought them from a * of mine and * my own into the sea this * however did not * upon mr * sense of honour and * the ancient * had to remove the * * and return * to his ship the officers and * of the * together with my * mr * and mr * were taken on board the * the captain * * and * myself and my maid remained prisoners on board the * before we were taken indeed when we * from * it had been agreed that belle * should be for the time * and that mrs * should take her place it was * that in the event of capture i should run less risk suffer * * and be exposed to less * under an assumed name * then my surprise and * when i found that my secret had been revealed through the * of an * * captain henry told me that the * a * like the * which had been captured the day before by the * had been the means of our own * there can be no doubt that one of her officers was a * to the cause of his country and had through fear or * by some other * * * those he should have * with his life it is with * that i record this instance of * on the part of a * but i am resolved to be an * * and although often severe to the yankees by * of telling plainly their * i will not * from the truth when it is * to my * bound north we are taken in * our first evening at sea we * at * * * * * comes on board in james river we are * by him his * against mr * for flying the english * the * conduct * on board arrival at new york we go on shore i visit * * return * and departure for boston love * * were * passing to and fro between the * as she was * and the * with orders and * until the * of the * grew * i was relieved to hear that we were about to start and my pleasure did not * when at # * the command was given to get under * and proceed * keeping just * of the * which would accompany us * at the turn that the * of fortune had taken i retired to my * and * to sleep but prison walls could not be * from my imagination and the attempt was vain the next morning at daylight i was aroused by loud * from the yankee * as she passed close to us * that we should * to * she sent a boat on board we presently learned that our * was to be * * and that we were

little waves as they struck the * side seemed but the soft * to the * music with which captain henry had been * us here we sit and let the sounds of music * in our ears soft * and the night become the * of sweet * presently captain henry went forward on the bridge and * with mr hall the officer on watch we two were left to ourselves and mr * * some beautiful * from * and * then in a * * * style he * to * the home to which if love could but * its prayers this heart would lead * and from * he passed on to * an * * * as i was and having known him for so short a time a very * thought * through my

i should * at boston during our * mr * was so kind and * that captain henry took a great fancy to him and * eternal friendship to one of whom he afterwards spoke as the most * gentleman from * that he had ever met with the morning which succeeded the * * slightly * above * the * and * lying to off the * a * * us in * as to our * for some time and when it lifted we * up hampton roads i sat on the little * * watching with interest all that i saw and listened * to the captain and mr * as they * on various * from the latter i * that * butler was in command at * * and from him i could expect but little courtesy as we * our * i made out distinctly the grim * of the * rising in its * and strength i * myself to the * * the * old * who was eagerly watching for the moment when it should become * in his * * my capture had been * to those in authority the * had cast off from us about * up the river and had gone * to the mouth of the james where * lee then was but the * when opposite the * of the baltimore * came to an * mr * went on board the * * to report he was absent about two hours and when he returned we got under way * up stream to join the * mr * could tell me nothing of my probable * and i * that i was to be * in * * there to remain i knew not how long perhaps for ever after about * of an hour we again * this time close by the * * * * * who was acting in the place of *

some time such weather was in itself sufficiently dreary and * nor did the * that we were * toward a * of * appearance greatly comfort me i felt indeed some pleasure when i thought that the federals would perhaps lose their * a feeling which captain henry fully shared in this cheerful desire we were disappointed for as the captain afterwards remarked the vessel was * * by mr * amid * wind and * rain an english * had been flying from the stern and the federal flag which had been * when coming up the bay was conspicuous at the * this seems to have excited the * of the * who when the storm had passed * us with solemn * written upon his face i am * that i should have had a better opinion of the man had he remained in his own vessel for i now saw him far from * one of the officers remarked that it was after four oclock by way of an * to the * as he was pleased to term mr * * * * was not * and upon reaching the * * * and * * right and left and was evidently as wild a * man as ever * ship or cut a throat but then as it was a * day he had evidently been taking something hot within to guard him from the cold when the * approached my * door i heard mr * say sir a lady is * there will you be kind enough to wait she is my * and i am * for her i had finished however and the * servant opening the door said to mr * de lady am ready * on this the * remarked * got to that has it his * into the * was truly * for * over * cotton he * then slipped and made his * and bow at the same moment his * mr executive officer i believe looked * and seemed somewhat ashamed * following in the great mans rear with less of the * peculiar dignity so said the * this is miss belle * is it just then captain henry came in and turning round he exclaimed what by george old * then * his official position stopped suddenly in the midst of the * i do not remember much of the conversation which ensued but noticed that the executive officer was * and apparently * with the conduct of his superior the * at first would not be seated but did so after a few moments further conversation * and * were brought in and he soon became exceedingly * and with an oath * that captain henry should have a * extending as far as boston asking for pen * and paper which i immediately * he bade the executive officer write the required * and * it with his own hand mr * asked for the * or at least a copy of the same but he would not * * that his orders were sufficient as he rose to * he turned to me and said in answer to a request of mine you miss when you * at new york can go on shore provided mr * * you and he added * some * i will not * a written * with you but will take a * promise dont be at all * you * go to prison the * then left us his * into the boat was * in the same * and * manner as had been his * into my presence and i felt very * when mr hall informed me that the great man had gone half an hour may have passed when a boat came from the * to * mr * that the * had ordered that the * should be brought under the lee of the * my heart sank for it seemed that after all he had been playing with us still more so when as we * to under the * stern i heard the * threatening through his * to blow us out of the water in his condition he might have done anything so our anxiety may well be * * for a moment to the english * before mentioned as flying * the * i may describe how the * when he saw it * * * down that * mr * * to * that this was a * of the law * * * captured in time of war to which the * made answer by saying i dont want any * * and he afterwards sent a written order to mr * * him to * the english flag as we lay beside the * * * were made and * orders given now we were told to be off at once then not to think of moving at present until mr * grew restless at such constant * and taking advantage of a command to * the station * away without waiting for anything more right glad were we when the * of night * from our view the * * and yet * to captain * of the * who not being *

the latter of which we * a * as the weather was very warm had been * on shore for our * at length we proceeded to sea bound for boston massachusetts * new york where it was intended that we should

and mr * accompanied me we crossed to the new york side of the river and * at the foot of * street * a carriage we drove to a friends house where i took from off my person the money which i had concealed about me and the weight of which at times had almost made me faint this money belonged to myself and captain henry and was not as yankee papers * part of the * money we had thrown * previous to our capture captain henry placed our money in the bank where it was safe from further * we visited * * to witness the * of * * what a * did the gay * city of new york afford at this period to my

returned to the * which now lay in * captain henry had gone on board before us as also had mr * i forgot to mention that this gentleman had been * by mr * for the night for the rest of the time above four hours that we remained at new york we were * by visitors old * who were allowed to see me * them were several * and military officers about # * the * came on board and * * to the capital of *

* had called a * * that he might go * to report his arrival before * mr * came to me and asked where his papers were when i replied that i thought they must be in the lower * where he had been * himself he immediately went down to * them and this was the golden opportunity for which we had waited in less time than it takes me to write it captain henry stepped into the boat which dropped

looked very serious though all the while i was laughing in my * saying to myself again i have got the better of the yankees the vessel was thoroughly * * i believe that it was * or * to get the

to be the best in the world were all * that the * might be * in fort warren these * of northern power were certainly not * with a very * description of captain henry some declared that he wore a black

and through the * of a friend received several * from him in my * i assured him that he was already as good as free for two days he stayed quietly at the hotel and then i heard that he had set off for * * new york * had been sent all over the country to * him but it was one of the best * * from the * of the * yankees that ever took place captain henry actually remained for some time at one of the *

me of you was here and i do not know how long a time i should have stood * about me in silence had it not been for my * being * by the little negro servant who broke the silence by saying no ones ever sleep in * room since * belle been gone * says * de only person as should so when i retired to bed that night and * had been * from further * upon me i lay for a long time thinking looking into the fire that * and * about the room * you here there and everywhere about the chamber and thinking of you sadly far away from me in england the * lonely and sad about midnight i fell asleep and was only aroused from my * late the next morning by * who was making the fire when i had finished * i sat down near the * i hardly know what * me to do so but if you will * on the evening that we parted from one another you placed upon my finger a small * ring telling me that there was a peculiar * attached to it * of * the * when in danger by * or being taken off without thinking i did the latter now we * are somewhat * to * and i must confess that i felt a nervous * about myself which did not leave me * the * that i made to * my * i told mrs g of the * when i met her at breakfast and she laughed at my * but so firmly was i impressed with the belief that i already began to feel that i was * a marked man and i was at * five having previously * a pass i left for baltimore but at * station i was judge of my surprise arrested and kept confined all night under guard as a * as a prisoner i was of course * but finding nothing upon me the officer commanding told me that i might retire for the night where i asked oh on the floor by all means was the * accompanied with a * the next day at my earnest * i was sent to point of * where i was treated more like a dog than a human being but fortunately for myself i was sent on to harpers ferry under a guard of * * soldiers who were far * to me than their officers during the journey they gave me a long history of their * * upon oath that they had been * by the * * of federal * in * who had given them gold and promised them a farm and two hundred * * more in gold upon their arrival in the united states if they would only * for the purpose of * the land out west upon their arrival in new york however they were locked up as prisoners not allowed to see any one and were only after an * of over three weeks set free their liberty having been * by their becoming federal soldiers they were also promised eight hundred dollars * and three months * which they had never to this day received although they had applied for it from time to time for no sooner had they taken the oath of allegiance than they were sent to the front at the conclusion of this * which they * by the holy * was truth and nothing more or less one of them informed me that they had orders to * me if i was * to them even but we wont do it me * they * and if * says the word were * * to cut over the * with * this however was an utter * for the country was full of yankee cavalry looking after * and his men so i declined their * kindness much to their astonishment and * for they begged me for the love of heaven not to * them this i faithfully promised and kept and as i bade them good day just before i was conducted into the presence of general * one of them remarked to me * * be my * young fellow its too bad to see * in this condition when * ought to be * * into a saddle when * into general * room the general a * * * man * me closely for a short time after * this as long at least as my patience could stand it i said is there anything remarkable about me or that you * yes sir your * * i * * * * of the meaning of the word yes sir * you are a spy and i interrupted him somewhat * but * myself and held my * where are your papers passes * he asked * papers i have none except the new york * and the world of yesterday * excuse me did you say * yes sir * ill save you a * i remarked * i have none as for my passes they are there * to a formidable looking official * that had been brought on with me * was the * to this lieutenant * just then made his appearance and a very nice and * fellow he was too in striking * with the general was his * the lieutenant * the husband of miss belle * and you ought to be hung by the way we hung one today * we * what are you going to do * you if you cant prove your * send you to washington perhaps that will do sir and i left the room in a few moments lieutenant * came out and said and very kindly too now mr * well go and get something to eat and if i can * it you shall sleep elsewhere than in a * come into my office for a short time until i write a letter and then we will go * him for his * * i entered the room and seated myself near the fire for it was a * day and very * and listened with feelings of horror and * to the * * of a * * i wish i could * his name for the sake of humanity who * of having * the part of * * to a confederate soldier of * * that very day * by * the fellow * when the * broke and he added * a piece of the * young fellow * you like to * not with you at least for a * i said and i did not attempt to * my * from * d you ill give you a double * of * on nothing if i do was the reply * after this light and * conversation lieutenant * and myself left them and after a good * and a short * about the town we once more entered his office but this time i did not stay long for although lieutenant * did all in his power to keep me from the * to that * place i went under the tender * of the * who * to * me with stories of men that he had hung as for sleeping there it was out of the question a * fire * and * up the * * its heat into a room whose * might have been ten feet by twelve in this space were * some twenty * * soldiers and citizens and add to this the fact that other * besides * and * were at play in the room i think you will admit that i was at least * the next morning at a later hour i was allowed to proceed under guard to a very * * * in the name of a * where i succeeded in getting some * * and * coffee having finished this * breakfast i was again * that i was a prisoner in the yankees hands by the * who carried in addition to his gun a watch and who * glanced at it * as he did so times up any news from the front i * to remark no is * in the * i * so how often do the trains go * in the course of a day twice * i said i am quite an * in my way come you have excited my curiosity tell me * now what you are for you are the only one of the many soldiers that i have met in my * with the * for the last three or four days who is * * to the name he evidently felt * for it was the open * of his * and he * informed me that he was a * from the * who had been stationed in * and i wish to the devil i was back out of the * * set that * got into they say birds of a * * together but * if i am a bird of their * our conversation was brought to a close at this period by the door of the * once more being closed upon me for want of better * i stood watching the * or their * from the country round who came to * the necessary passes to return to their homes again and i must confess that the * * that accompanied the pass or * its * were enough to make the blood of any father brother or son * with * at # * just as i was beginning to despair of ever being sent away from harpers ferry a * came to me and said all * * the * are * come on to this tender appeal i merely said i am ready lead on as i passed out he * pointed to a * that was * to his side and remarked none o * * i could not but help laughing in the fellows face and i hardly know what would have been the * if lieutenant * who was passing in at that moment had not said * him like a gentleman calling him by his name and it is to this remark that i no doubt am * for the little * i received on my way to washington we arrived in washington about midnight and the * having visited the * office i was relieved of his further * upon me and at # * on sunday morning i was * to a horrible * known as the * hall filled with everything that was * low and * * hall a * on prison * the * close * the * ground a * * an * the * a * contest * to the * an honour declined the * prison * the walls * hall * * the colonel * hall or as it is somewhat * * by the fellows who board here at the * * the last * was without * the most fearful * of a prison that it was my misfortune ever to have anything to do with not that i would have you for one moment suppose that i am familiar with a * residence but i have mentioned it merely from the fact that until i was thus thoroughly * to the contrary i had always entertained the belief that in this age of * and * * had been * by * into * * * * places where * and * retire for a while to * their * * and in this respect i have always entertained the belief that in america they know how to * these things better than in europe you know but this * of st * and * * and * too any * * and very * ideas that i had * of prison * and the * * with which i had in fancy painted such * gave way to a most * picture * with black that nearly * me as i walked * * and * * my way * through * * of sleeping men or * of * with which the floor of this place was * * in * on the * of the city of washington * hall was before the * of this * struggle used as a place of public * where * and * were held or given a large * room it had nothing of beauty to * it even then much less at the present day when its walls are * with * pictures * * or * * and even in its * days it was such a room that one felt however warm one may have been * upon * four immense windows reaching from the top almost to the * bound with iron looked forth upon the street but none of us ever * to gaze from them for orders were given to * dead the * * who should thus * the laws four others looked out upon what was known as the * a small * where we were allowed to walk for half an hour daily one * of this yard as it was also called was the * an * of * which was applied to * who were supposed to be * from the united states army whether it was so or not it was almost impossible to say the manner of * the unfortunate man was after the most * * of yankee * and * you may doubtless somewhere have read of the prisoner who was * by being fastened in an * position beneath a * that permitted to escape every second one drop of water which fell always in one spot upon the forehead * a most fearful * * * in * well although it was not exactly the same thing nevertheless it approached it very nearly for in this instance the victim was made to stand bound * to a post * a steady stream of water whose force was thirty * to an * square was played upon the small of the back it was often the case that the victim unable to endure the * would * or not give in and the consequence was that the authorities having witnessed the * of his crime would * him in an exhausted state back to the hall to be led out to execution or conducted to the * to which he would be * for a * again some more * and * would remain firm and * however fearful the * until * would * or the * * who waited in person and watched closely the * * would say enough when he would be carried back to the room only to be brought forth to endure the same * when he had sufficiently * his * to be able to appear once more but to * once more to * hall in a space not more than * feet square were crowded together over five hundred * ragged and * * of all conditions and * who had been * here for many months with the * remark your case will be attended to the * that filled the floor was something awful to * upon and here they were obliged to live here sleep a space large enough for the * of the * who were relieved at the end of every four hours was reserved for them and * the poor * was that dared

with the same * orders to * * to the * of human blood the place * * with * and the air is * and * with * that are at least to be * in ones language * and * in the extreme it was early on a sunday morning that i entered this * after having * a rigid examination of my person at the hands of the officers who were * at the hall this done i was handed over to a * and conducted by him to the room that i have * to describe to you above it was so late that fortunately for me only some nine or ten out of the whole number that lay * together on the floor were * one or two * at me for a short time but went on again with their play at * a * was once more my friend in this place he * me i was glad to have any ones pity even for i felt almost like the desperate * at times and the future of my life was * in gloom so dark and * that it was in vain that i attempted to * it having passed the spot where i was standing wrapped up in my own thoughts he stopped suddenly and said you surely are not a * sir you have * * i replied what are you doing here then he added with some surprise that is just what i should like to know myself and if you will * me i shall thank you for the information an i suppose you are one of those fellows we call political prisoners and if you are by * * * more of your same * that would like to have the same information * after * and he resumed his beat in a short time he came to me and said why dont you sleep sleep i said in astonishment he * at the manner in which i spoke the word sleep and said by * only be a * * of you in the morning then i will try to fancy myself on the * for four hours and i commenced to * up and down with the * and it was not until late the next morning that i gave up and was forced to sit down but i first took my * and * away the * on the floor as well as i could before i did so as the morning wore on * the * who by this time were thoroughly * came and * at me or asked me questions of myself business c to the former i * a perfect * but to the latter i kept my * which brought down * * * from these fellows who saw in me as they did not * from * their comrades a * * silence for fear they became * one of them a * * * * my hat off * it up i * it on my head without apparently * the * growing * the * of * him * the * * * him * him were raised on all sides a * was getting stretched for my special benefit and i determined to act * near the * was a * * * of wood that was used for * the door when opened i determined to get possession of it so i walked up quietly and * possession of the * that was soon to decide my fate i retreated to a corner and waited for them it was not long a party advanced and then halted when the * man who was known as the * a name that he had won from his * in * the eyes from out the * of others came as near as was * safe for i swung the * * as he advanced and said now young * if * dont give in ill * * nose off come now are * * to to his tender and * * as regarded my nose i paid no attention oh * aint * to then are * well ill have a * breakfast by this morning at any * come on * i only remember one thing until the whole affair was over and this is the picture the * and his second advancing as i swung my * * in a circle about me the pointed edge of the * * into the bridge of the * nose and * closing an eye for him and the remaining force of the blow being received by his second on the temple who fell like a * of lead by his leader then it was that i sprang forward * right and left as i went but there was no necessity to do murder for they gave way before me and the * who had been watching the battle received me with the remark as i gained his side * from the * by if i * have * you * have shot you for * but you did that well they wont trouble you any more ill * nor did they on the contrary a select committee to my great surprise waited upon me about # am and their * informed me that by a * vote i had been chosen their president and if i would accept the * of the * it was at my command to their astonishment i refused them but not * to make them my enemies for i had no idea how long i was to remain here i did so as * as possible fortunately for me in the afternoon i was sent for and under guard i was * to the * office in washington city here i was kept for over an hour in a place that was * off for rebels a * looking * for military * * me the while several of the * who had * from their superior who i was attempted to * with me but in this they failed most * * after this i was taken under the * of captain and four of his * to the old capitol on

after running a * so to speak of the curious * for the * were fast * forth their * upon the street and the * fire of conversation from the captain which was by far the worst * i had to endure on my arrival at the old capitol i was * by a * lieutenant who had seen * but when he did not say and whom i * to belong to that body of men known as the * corps i was ordered to sit down and after a running fire of questions i was sent off to the * prison under the guard of two soldiers i was not long in reaching it for the political * is * not far from its * the old capitol i was received by the * who having * my name age * height business * c was good enough to relieve me of some money not all for i had been * of most by the gallant * of the * through whose * fingers i did not pass * and who certainly have a taking way about them a * * which was also captured although i begged to * it as a * was refused on the * that i might * myself this over i was conducted to room no # to keep company with a spy and a * * on its walls * * with a piece of * wood i wrote our names one day and drew above them the english and confederate * which coming under notice of the * outside drew down upon my

of a most * character occupy * of the space i very * slept in one of these * as they are * here but i can assure you that i * it exceedingly long before morning it was almost an utter * to tell the

that it is not until a very late hour in the * that daylight * us with its presence at all a * in the centre of the room is used by us to * whatever we choose to buy from the * mr * who has had the * of this prison since the beginning of the * the morning after my arrival at the * in company with the * i * into the yard when after * myself with a * * at the * i entered the * * for my breakfast i could eat nothing the coffee is a * of but i will not attempt to describe it * the hard * as the old * call it is the * kind of * that was ever * and * with the * of * so i walked out into the yard and * * about * as prisoners will when i should be * about # am i again went up to my room and received from the * a * for remaining below in the yard accompanied with the remark that if i * mind my

was not * upon the table an example which i was not slow to * for it had been over two weeks since i had the good fortune to get a * of anything really * december #* i * up very early this morning and having dressed myself * about the yard below for a while in conversation with two or three others * here for nothing at least that is the * answer by way of an explanation of this one of them said to

water in the * for * hours had it been discovered it is quite worthy of notice that one seems to take an * pleasure in * the * of the * at all times not so much for any particular reason but merely for the purpose of passing away the time and * that such a thing can be done in spite of the * and * captain * left room # today he had been prisoner here for some time but * was * without a trial or any satisfaction being * to him his arrest was very * * secretary * * him to report for examination for colonel at washington captain m was at the front * before richmond when he received this * but judge of his surprise when upon his arrival instead of being * he was ordered to the * and * there december 9th this evening as we were seated * or playing * for want of some better * we were somewhat startled by the cry of officer of the * * of the guard post no # and almost * with it came the report of a * that sent * and every one else to their feet officers and men rushed to their different * and the general belief for the moment was that some one had been shot in * to escape such however was not the case it * to be only the * * of a * through the * of a * who had just come off post and was * his piece in the * when it fell the * * it to go off the ball passed * through the floor going through a bed in # but fortunately without * its * this is not the first instance of this kind that has occurred said colonel wood who at that time was playing * of the rooms that * me of a good story the good story was as follows what became of him asked one of his audience why him he died in the hospital several days afterwards december #* a captain in the massachusetts #* was sent into # today he had been arrested and * in the baltimore * for six weeks in about an hour after his appearance *

he is a * * * looking man with black eyes and hair and has lost a finger in the service of the union i watched his countenance closely as his eyes met the * containing his sentence every one had seen it but none * to break the intelligence he gave a sudden * start and sat for as much as ten minutes * at it how he must have felt * at that time none can know but himself it made one feel cold and nervous to see him sit there so quietly ten years a * for him his hopes for the future were * farewell for him to all * * he is dead henceforth and for ever to the world i would not have been in his place for thousands there he sat without moving and room # was very quiet for the * of it were looking at him he evidently and suddenly became aware of this fact and looking up from the fatal star he said * in for it * done for me well ten years * * and he laughed * glad of that ill get out sooner then he got up and walked out of the room and we all of us * felt relieved when he had gone december 15th * up at the windows of room # i saw this afternoon * walking up and down the yard a poor little child a girl about four years old and standing close beside her was her mother she clasped the iron bars of the window with childish * and did not seem to be aware that the cold * touch of the iron that * her present * was that of prison bars that held her * from the * world her merry little laugh was truly painful to listen to aunt * was in the * at this time so i asked her who it was who dat lady * * mrs * what is her crime i asked oh her husband was * and she * at his escape out * de country so they arrested her an now * * feared that * * * up in her place december #* the ladies in room # sent me a note * by in which they * me for * at different times of wine and * for the table that i had * for i have followed the business of * * very successfully since i have been in here no matter if i have * for an * outside in that * and very * business december #* i cannot imagine why i can hear no news of you mr wood says you are very * mr h to * everything is fair in love and war so i am forced to * out of the latter portion of his sentence that others are employed in reading my letters what a * thing military * is introduced to the ladies ward colonel wood and his * interview with judge * * officers in georgia a * * christmas in prison * a * * another visit to the ladies the young girls sick bed a rough prison * december #* i was introduced to the ladies in # today and spent a very pleasant * in their society and so quickly did the time * away that i was only * that the thirty minutes were gone by the officer of the * who looking at his watch said times up mrs colonel m spoke of you and said that you were * the pet of the confederacy and would always be looked upon as its child as long as the confederacy existed and had a name december #* no * of my being * yet mrs colonel m remarked and in the presence of mr wood today i have material enough of * life as * in my * here for a book mrs m said wood and he laughed no one will ever be able to write a * account of the capitol and * * i have a * where i put everything that * of note within these walls if

up but this she could not do and the * * continued until she * and the * then left her the other story was this and not the less worthy of comment as it came from the lips of a lady both in position as regarded her standing in society and in wealth and * i have no reason to * you not to * it to the world near the * * a mrs lived quietly and * though the civil war * about her until a band of these * for the * of the union took possession of the place for a few hours several of them entered her house in the * and * to her room where she lay sick with * and unable to move her servant a young *

spirit as had the rest of our party two of whom were old gentlemen men who already had one foot in the grave political prisoners like myself men who had refused to take the oath of allegiance to the united states government this time we had a journey of eight miles on foot to make true apparently this was not long but to us it was indeed so the roads were very bad and almost all of the way we were over our * in mud and * snow and it was not until after three hours of this * that we marched into * as we passed through the * street women and men rushed to the windows and doors to see us * a guard of honour * from all the small boys and girls in the village attended us in the front and rear * at us in * * at the * landing much to our disappointment and surprise the steamer was not to be

their life which it would not do to * to the world during the late election in the united states tom made himself conspicuous by * down from the * upon which it was * the american flag and * it because it bore upon its folds the names of mcclellan and pendleton for this * act he was * to the position that he now * the female servants of the prison with the * of aunt * were the worst and most * * i ever had the misfortune of seeing the five points of new york or the * * of * could not * a worse crowd yet this * were * to wait upon the ladies who were here held for heaven knows what but

belonging to the corps that is commanded by colonel wood he is the * * of this institution his nose is everywhere and his eyes are upon everything if a visitor comes to see a friend confined here mr l stands near at hand * down in his memory the conversation * apparently engaged in * his * or * his eyes on * as he notes down their words if in the court when the prisoners are walking about he is always looking on and smiling or has some soft word of * to say to * to bring against them when their time comes i was particularly the object of his * and our hate was * i had very * * him one day a gentleman called to see me upon * i seated myself close to the gentleman mr l took a chair and * his * between us stretched himself * at full length and prepared as was his * to listen of course our hopes of a conversation were to all * at an end for some moments i stood it * but at last i could stand it no longer there are i said very quietly in this prison * * of stories ever ready for anything mean and * but the * and most * of them all is i beg your pardon sir turning suddenly to him is yourself mr l i cant help it said that individual looking * at me but the shot had taken effect mr l removed his chair to the fire and our conversation was * of the * of fort * there is not much to be said in praise two * are served out to us daily * of one piece of * * bread and one * of * * * * or

breakfast and dinner * for such * in the outside world however poor they may be what would our english friends who are i believe by no means * to good cheer think if they could try it for a few weeks of the * food the * good * of the prisoners held here of which the federals * so * these pleasant * are served to us at nine in the morning and three in the afternoon the * as it is named from whence

her way through the * * that * our progress to the * which although only about seven miles distant we were nearly two hours in reaching it was with feelings of * pleasure that i felt my feet pressing once more * * and * the * * * itself within me that i was once more my own master so drawing my * * about me i stepped into the hotel that stood near the landing and * the distance to * the * of this country place * me * the dog who had been * at the fire rose and * at me and the * of the place who were seated round the * * or * by their looks * as plainly as * could speak he is an escaped

pair of * * * * my lower * a * on one foot and the other wrapped up in old * is it a wonder then that i was an object of * character * myself near the fire i called for a glass of wine which was handed to me by the * who * something about a desire that he had of seeing the * of my money to this i replied by drawing out my * and offering him a * * * him to give me small * for it in an instant the conduct of those present * a complete change the * was all * and * and with an * that was all the more * * from his former * desired to know if i wished to have an apartment no i wish to go to * how far is it from here * miles was the reply is there any * that will take me there tonight there was none * not if i will pay you well for it i * let a dog of mine go out this night was the answer then i will walk i said walk was * * with astonishment * on their * yes walk i * * well if you get to * safely you will do more than i expect you will in that * especially and the * looked at my * with a * nevertheless i am going i said and * the action to the word i rose and attended to the door of the hotel by the group of * * i commenced the journey it had been * and * * throughout the day and the roads in this part of the country never at any time when i saw them remarkable for their * were * with mud i shall never have the * of that night * from my memory several times i was on the point of lying down on the * but the love of life and the thought that god willing i should soon be at home were strong within me and i * on through the * rain and * snow twice on the way i * at the door of a * the direction that i was to take and once the * wife of the quiet * where i gained * prepared for me with her own white hands a cup of coffee and pressed me to stay all night at her * place an invitation in which she was * by the rest of her family herself and husband were both english and i shall not forget their kindness to me and when i at last rose to * the husband wife and children bade me a kind * the husband * me down the road some distance at last just as the * was striking ten i * into the * at * just in time to catch the train for new york i had accomplished the distance in four hours but it was fully a week before i was able to walk or sit even with any degree of comfort early in the morning i arrived in new york and drove immediately to my brothers place of business he was perfectly * at seeing me and laughed * at the * figure i cut * having * a suit of clothes and enjoyed the * of a * and the * feeling of delight that one * in finding his body once more in * with * * i bade * to the united states and started directly for the * of * and peaceful england conclusion of mrs * narrative my * were written and a portion of them already in the hands of the * when the * news came which has * all europe and filled her * with horror the * of * lincoln president of the united states it was always the * of * were they northern or southern in their * that * was the only history that could show to the world a clear * record of successful republican rule but their * can be no longer so regarded for in the sudden * of mr lincoln by the * of an * * that peculiar institution of europe the school of the * has * itself to the * of america and that country can no longer * her former * that crime such as this had never been * under the government commenced by george washington * i had no * against the * gentleman who has * the * of northern power for four long years his has been a trying position no man probably in the pages of history took his seat under more * circumstances the press of the world * furious * upon him he was * and * at he was pronounced * * low * and * disappointed * and opposition * * with each other in calling him upon every occasion the * and * of * * speedily * that with such a man as * lincoln at the head of the government the union would most * be * with as much * and as quickly as mr lincoln had been known to * * when a * in the western * although a member of congress previous to his * to the * chair of all the united states not in * and having for his political * in his * campaign that great * the late mr * mr lincoln was not a * success his * and * * with * and dry * were better * to * the * by whom he was looked upon as a leading man than the * and more * * with which he was in * brought into * i can appreciate and * fully the character of such men who * the sentence out of nothing came something as such i looked upon lincoln when month after month and then year after year of his * term rolled by and i saw how well he * the northern * and how firmly he held the * of the federal cause which from time to time * upon the * of a * * now all is changed can any one believe that mr johnson is the man who is to * the * to what it was save the nation from * and bring peace and * to america it might not have been impossible with mr lincoln for that gentleman held out the * * no deadly * beneath it to general lee and his little band of * with mr johnson at the head of the government of the north who can * anything save * and * he will * * * is burning * i did not like mr lincoln for in him i saw the * as long as it served his purpose mr lincoln * * the right of secession i trust that the * will not * my readers but such was the case and i will * one instance when as a * he * * that any nation or people in any portion of the world had a right to rise up and rebel against the * if they wanted to when the north in # declared that she would * all rights and have whether or no the south wished it and in direct * of the constitution a * northern president * lincoln still true to his former assertion of the right of secession accepted the * of the * * and by this act * the * in that * called the union the * was * * through force of circumstances there are those who maintain that in this world women have no right to * in the affairs of state in * in * and * others there are who more * are willing to admit that women have as much right to act think and speak as men i do not set myself up as an * of the womans right * but would rather appear in the character of a quiet lady * her * not so much to the public as to her immediate friends therefore i trust that the former class of gentlemen will here forgive what to them may appear * especially as in the * * of my book i have * to avoid * as much as possible but to return to my subject the north * declared that she did not care much if the south did * and the south never * the * of the north took her at her word * and the consequence has been a civil war whose * has never been * and whose * can be * not by * but by * of thousands mr lincoln as the * of his nation took the oath of office to * the union as it was then after a while as it was became as it is finally when richmond fell and lee surrendered * to be what * johnson * butler or * * of * wanted him to be a * he * * his intention of * if possible a * union of north and south on the most * terms this was sufficient he was from henceforth a * man the * of his life were * and he slept little * of his danger of the sword hanging above his head not only was lincoln * but so also were all those most in * of * measures towards the south and her * the constitution as it is said the * senator * * of * is played out and i am ready to see any man shot down who * the union as it was talked of by mr lincoln and on the evening of the very next day after mr lincoln had * a * * towards the south he was shot down * i appeal to your * judgment i look to you for the * of the * charge which mr * has thrown upon the shoulders of our southern leaders that he might thereby * the * powers to withdraw their * of southern * it is not the * sons of the south who have done this * the papers indeed make the * use the words * * * but if this be true then as a * woman i say never was the * of virginia more * * and in truth our people have even more to regret in the death of president lincoln than have the people of the north when our noble old * general lee heard of the * he covered his face and refused to listen to the details of the murder * in the * prison where a large number of southern soldiers were confined the * on one of the * held a meeting and * the murder passing resolutions that they were soldiers and could not therefore * * yet mr secretary * * charges the commission of this * upon the south there are those in the northern states who will yet move heaven and earth to prove that it was the south and to prove it money will be spent * given and where money and * fail * will be used but i appeal to europe to judge * between north and south do not * too hastily your judgment nor cast upon a brave and * people the * of * many have advised me to * these * * that their * will probably cause my * * but i cannot i will not * i firmly believe that in this fiery * in this suffering misery and * the south is but * a * by fire and * that will in good time and by gods * work out her own independence
