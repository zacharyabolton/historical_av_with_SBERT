* and only * as far as a * * and when the order was * * under * general * came down from * with his * of cavalry * in the * of the #* as he * he * a cavalry force of the enemy * * the confederate left * and was * in * it he was * with * three thousand cavalry on the confederate left * the * order of the day for general battle and the * of the cavalry on our left the * and * corps * * during all of the * battle of the confederate right * the * and the part of that on the * left was only in * long enough to * the * * of the enemy when it * * a * of * * in position general * * to even * his

and * * was * as they * to look for a * of the enemy * * the far away left when the three * * * * it was night the * line to be * was * by * brigade of the * corps it was * by three * of * division and three from the * corps after * attack and * part of the line was * when the * after a * * between the * * * and * brigade * to the division part of the * * * of the point * * a * * when the corps * over to the left general * * to * before this general * * that the enemy in front of his division was * off his * and * to my battle of the right and * to general * that the moment had come for the * to attack and * his * from * about the * to be * after * * * on our * left general * ordered two * under general * * * to attack * had with his * brigade * north * brigade under colonel * he made as * a * as was ever made * to the * of the hill he * a * and * on in * order * some * and * until he * that his two * were * in a night * against a * army when he found that he was * in having night to

was a man on the left of the line who did not * to make the battle * he knew where it was had * it from its * * had * for his part in it but so * part of his command from it as to make * * of * * he had a * for the * of the field of * was * before the * of the * and his * of the * of * * * but when its * * were * to the * when the * field called for * work he found the * * far and away * the cavalry more * and * he * command of the * corps and * to it held the * position until general lee found at last that he must * him from field * general lee ordered * division of his left * part of the * * about * hill to be * during the night of the #* by two * of * division and one of * division * the other * of those * were not sent * not * but it * * that there was a place for them on * left in the * that were * by the federal * corps when called over to * the battle of * left * hill * the same * to the * right as little * * did to his left general * lee * * from general * that had * hill been * in force by * it would have * the * of the federal troops general * after the battle of his left ordered the * of his * corps back to their * to * the * * by the confederate left it was night when the first division * general * * thought to * his way through the * by a line of * he found the * * of his * * the * * and took * * his * he found the * line of his * * by the * in force and * his command to * for * the * division came during the night when general * * the corps * it on the left of the first and the division * ordered * in * * during the night general * held a * which * to * it out so it * to look as if the * of the day had so * as to * general * from * to * battle for * hill but the * * to see the * and force the * as it was * in general * * before the * on the * of the war he * his * of the first and * days at * thousand and * * of these to the battle of the #* as the * against the three * of our left after night and two * * in the night from our * could not

have had it before * was there under * * this * of the * day made from the * would be * and * but the battle of * which may be called the * of the war has been the * of many * of words * of the * have * many of their * * in * through * * and * their * for the battle * to * the * and to find a * and their * may be given though they do not * it a * of * general * * * * off when * a * * through the south for a * * for general lee he * that he made a * on the * of the #* of * and that upon his * it general lee ordered general longstreet to attack at * the next day he did not * to * that the * and * corps that were on the field and had had a good * * were part of the command ordered for the * battle for the * both * and not under the * * could have brought * * against him * did he * to put general lee in the * position * of * part of the first * should march through the night and all * make the battle * the point of battle was * of the * road to find it it was * to * that road but general * was * part of his corps over the road during that * and * there the * part of the day and during the night so to make the * general * passed the union troops in confederate * was * in his * found the point of battle * him * for the moment for this * work and the * order let us find the * to which it would * the only troops that could come under the order were * division part of * and the * * thousand men these after a * * march * general lees * about * of the #* and by * * march could have * the point of battle about * * away by * * where they would have * a division of the * corps * * the * and * corps under * and * then the first * and * under * * and * then the * of the * * in on our * * the * * * thousand men and more there was * to be * of the * of the troops of the first corps but to * a part of it with * under the * was not * that the confederate * corps did not have * for the * * battle is * by the * of its * who * for his work about * hill during the night of the #* and morning of the #* * of the morning it was now * and too * * that it was too * for him to attack and * that hill as general lee had * and * him to do during the night before if he had been ordered to take part in the * battle he would have been in the * of time that the * corps was not to be in it is * by the position of the * part of it on * * until near * of the #* so general lee must have ordered a position * at * by * thousand men after it had * * all * position that he would not * on the * of the #* with * thousand men * they should * * * as the other corps after * their * for the * battle of the #* * to * until after * it is not * that they would have found the * battle without * general * * * is in * with his * * in the * he * no * to the * order but * a * by which the left of the enemy could be turned * from the * * of general lees * and from his * * general a * long * that the * battle was not ordered and a letter from colonel * * that the * that it was so ordered was * up after general lees death in a * * general long * my * on the * of the #* for the * march around the * left which he * after * was * colonel * * that the attack by the confederate right should have been * and should have * the enemy back on his first or * line and before little * * was * but little * * was not * in force until after my battle * and general * * to his * * was made in * of the confederate * and would have been * or * * as that * was made he * the * of general lee to general * on the * of the #* an order general lee * it is the * of * * to * * of a * as * but when they are * with * that * the * of battle and * to the * they are not * and general * was * in not * attack that his * would not order and the * of his * is * and very * the virginia * have been so * in their * for a * in the * of the battle of the first corps that they * the only point into which they could have * their * at the * of the * general * was with general * * the * of * the * corps back to the line * * for it but the * was * * by the * of the confederate battle if that * had been * * or * * the corps would have been * back to the general line and my first * would have * little * * and * it before it could have been * * and general * would have * off to his line * * * * the point should have been that the battle was * too soon another point from which they * * is that * corps * was not up until a * * of the #* and would not have been on the field for an * battle but * was not * in the * battle and could have been back at * so far as the * battle was * and they * a little on the * of * * for * brigade to * its division but general lee called for the two * and had called for * brigade to * his division it was * his order for the division that * the march to have * without it would have * * as we were not * enough for the work with that brigade it is not * that we could have * more without it colonel * * that general lee * that the march of my troops should be * and was * at their * not one * did he * to me of their march until he gave his * at * * for the * to his right * for the troops to * their march of the #* were sent without even a * from him but upon his * that he * to * the next day if the enemy was there that he was * and off his * was * on the * of the #* and he * under that * until enough * was * to * him general lee has * of * for the day this is * he did not give or * me * for the morning of the * day * did he * me by * * for morning attack as his * were about * * from the command i did not * over but sent to * the work of the * day in the * of * i had * * out during the night in * of a way by which we might * the * left and * it down * his * i found a way that gave some * of * and was about to * the command when he * over after * and gave his * his * was to * the * left * by a * to be * of * and * * * by * * i thought that it would not do that the point had been * * the day before by more men when all were * that the enemy was there * for us as we heard him during the night * up his * that the * of * and * were * a * * the right of my line against * thousand men who would * their * * the * of the * * * it and get on our * * the * river that * thousand men was the * of force * for the work that even such force would * * * on other * of the line that the * as he * to * it would have only about * thousand men the * having * a * of their * the day before that the * would have to march a * under * * fire and a thousand * under * * that the * were * from those in the days of * when field * had a * of * * * and * about * * he

* by * of the * corps and * * and * the point to which the march should be * i asked the * of the * he * * thousand * was then * that the * thousand men who could make * * over that field had never
