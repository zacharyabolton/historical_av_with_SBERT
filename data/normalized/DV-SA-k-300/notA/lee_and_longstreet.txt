about the same * that * troops were being * near lees * and were * * upon the * federal right upon the first * of confederate * on the right and left we know that the * corps was * * in * and about * * * at the * over * * on the * * * for * * thought lee * to attack his right that lee * it is * * colonel * of his * was sent about * to * with * * upon the * of a general attack from his front lee * * * as to the * of * all the * troops around to that front for such a * * and * * from point to point to * if this should be * * * * lee himself came to * * and * the * for an attack on the union

* * was far * in point of time because by order of lee longstreet was * to * by back * and * out of * of the * * * on * * his troops * * * or * * to * the point of * longstreet * * about # * and the *

* * in another * * * of what the * * * will * an * * * * lee himself * no such order in his * * * * * * he * * that the general * was * and longstreet * ordered to attack next morning no * * being *

* longstreet the * morning there is no * however about the * of * * so that as * was * by lee to * the * and as lee knew * where * was it is * * that it was * for * * * before * troops were up in one

* if there were * in it this he did not do * did lee * upon the * * any * from its * as * did not come up until # am and as general lee * the morning was * in * * it was * and * * to make an attack at * and general longstreet states that it could not have been * * than it was * longstreet * * that lee ordered him to attack at * on the #* he * that he had no * of any * on that morning until lee *

with the * * of two * and many * * as a last * * to general longstreet who with the * * of * again passed for ever and ever to his * * and his old command we think it * to say that there is * in the *

could and the next day general longstreet * me for the * way in which i had brought them * for said he we are friends again if i ever knew i have long since * the * of the * it might have * at * it was my * to have * the * between general longstreet and president * so * * to as * at the * of the * hill * in * i had been given by colonel * * on that * the command of * * * and * confederate * when these two great * * and * my command went * and they never * into line any more longstreet was almost a * in * and always * * and * * * his * * were after the war was over he * and * * them but he never * * them to any one and it * yet to be seen * he was not right in many * * which he was * too * * by some people in # general * name was on the * * * he came to * to * the people on the * * of the day * not a * of his * * i had the * of * him to the people of my * * in the * words as * in the * * # # * and * few of the * of that * * who * to * in * of the * south more than a * of a * * without * to * or * * with * * have with only a few * * * to * an * * to one who with * and * * * the southern * through many * * like the * * * of * his * always * * where the * was the * his was the first voice of command to fire when the army of * virginia was * its * of fire at * * on the #* of * # and from the * * the * battle of * to * our * followed him from * to * with * * they went * he * them and from * to the * they * * his * his * has * the * * of us all no * the * * of southern * and eyes he is the * * of a * country and a * union his * his * his name are the * * of all the people both north and south he is with us * for only a few * * our eyes may never look into his again * our hands * his on * * ever * that voice once so * to * of his * that voice is * but he * it now only for the * of * his friends into what he * to be the * of * and * * to him with * i now have the * of * to you my * that * soldier and * general * * * * * * * * * of the army of the * has this to say of general longstreet it would be * in me to * * after * general * * * in * to that great battle in which the * and the * * at * a * of a * after that great battle i had longstreet * here as the * of the first corps of the army of the * he came to washington some two days in * and was a * of my * during that time we * a room * at * and went over the whole field when he gave me a * * of the * * he was never * to lee but he * the * * would not be as * as * at * longstreet * to * lee not to order it but * a * at night and take up a position on the south * of * * where * * to * the battle if we could have * a point to * our * of * i do not think we could have found a better one than that upon which they are now * all we have to do is to * our army around by their left and we shall * between the federal army and washington no said general lee the enemy is there and i am going to attack him there lee was a great * * he had before him * great * at * when he ordered * with * thousand men to * the * * but few of that * were * when * * that * * * if * * had been * it would have * the southern * as one of the * of the world for it would not only have had * * but * * upon every field * one lee had been * and that was a * battle he had great * in himself and thought that it was * to * him with his southern * under his command longstreet * from him on that * and i am * * for the * of my country that lee did not * to him they are both * * but it * * to me that any * * * * the * of longstreet at * the * death of the * old * of the army of * virginia general * longstreet has again * some of the * and * * of his * of * * and * of * at the battle of * i * to * some * in * to this * and the first * i * to say is that general longstreet * the love and * of the soldiers of lees army up to the * at * on the #* of * # his soldiers never for one moment * his * his * or his * if these * * of his * of * at * be * is it not * * that he * the love and * of general lee until the * of the war if longstreet had * lees * at * * * the battle to * of * to southern * * any one * to * that general lee would have * to place * and * in him his first * until the * of the war no man who has a * * of the * of * * lee as a soldier and as a great * * will * it another * * in * with these * * against general longstreet is that the men * the army of * virginia never heard a * of them until long after the death of general lee who could and would have * or * them the * and * of general lee as a great * * * not * that the * and * of another great and * soldier of the confederate army shall be * another * * is these * came from men that were only * at the battle of * * * it * first made this * against general longstreet in a * * at * virginia in # in which he said that general lee told him that he had ordered longstreet to attack at * on the #* of * longstreet * * that general lee ever gave him any such * and colonel * * * colonel * * * colonel * * and general a * long all of general lees * * after this * was made by * that they never heard of any such * colonel * * to general longstreet said i did not know of any order for an attack on the enemy at * on the #* of * * can i * any such order was * by general lee about * on the #* i was sent by general lee to general * to * him what he thought of the * of an attack on the enemy from his position i do not think that the * on which i was sent by the * general is * with the * of an attack at * by any * of the army it * * by the * of these * * and soldiers who were at that time * of general lees * * and were * * in that * * of * that this * by general * was only a * of * * i think the general * taken by the * * upon the * of the * at * on * the #* which was the * day of these * that up to # am general lee was * as to * he would attack on the right or left no * in what * words we may * our * for him as a soldier the soldiers of the army of * virginia would * all these * words of * as * to * the * we * for the * * in war and the * and * * * the confederate army by this * old * general * longstreet general lee told general * and the army of * virginia that the * of their * at * was his * this man of * and * * as the * * * of * * * that he himself had * the * of his army and * the army of his enemy who had the * of * and of far better position general lee * then as the world has since that he made a * in * the union army at * after general * had * and to some * had * an almost * position * made the same * when lee * him on the * in the * at * and at * * with this * * was * upon his * * and * while lee was * upon the * and * * of his army and while the * and * * of lees army were never * in the * of * * even they could not * the * and the * of general * * are * * of the * that general longstreet at the battle of the * made a * march that * his soldiers to their * * to get there in time and when he * on the field he found the southern line was being * back by * * and * his troops into line and with his * * * the federal line * back and * the day and gave the southern army the * at the * in this * he was * * and the * * of south * at the same time was * * said that general lee * * that but for the * of longstreet at * that battle would have been a * for the southern army how did he know that lee * with that * did general lee ever tell any one so if so whom it is one * to make an * but * a * * to * it i have seen men in my day look * * in * when called on to * some * they had said on the * in * i * to say that while we all * and were * when general longstreet * the * * that * * not to have * * * to have * us to * and * and * any * upon his * or * * upon his long and * * as a soldier he was a soldier by * and * to his own * he never * a * in * life * to the confederate war he and
