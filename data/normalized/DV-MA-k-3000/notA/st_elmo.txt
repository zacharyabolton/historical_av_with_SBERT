******** announced mr ****** arrival and as she led the way to the parlor mrs murray hastily fastened a ******** ***** of ***** ******* in ednas hair before tea was ended other visitors came in and the orphan found relief from her confusion in the general conversation while dr ****** the family physician was talking to her about some *********** of ********* concerning which she was very curious mr leigh ********* mrs murrays attention and for some time their conversation was exceedingly earnest then the latter rose and approached the sofa where edna sat saying ******* edna give me this seat i want to have a little **** with the doctor and by the way my dear i believe mr leigh is waiting for you to show him some book you promised to find for him go into the ************ is a good fire

they ******** it together ******** out the words and turning frequently to a ********** which lay near neither knew much about the language now and then they ******** in the ************** and more

******** a ****** she lifted the heavy ****** and slowly approached the ***** of rooms which she was now in the habit of visiting almost daily earlier in the day she had ****** the door but left the key in the **** ********* to bring the ****** back as soon as she had shown mr leigh the ************ passage now as she crossed the ******* an unexpected sound as of a chair ******* on the marble

leaning on his ******** looked up at ******* heart of the ***** you are impressed by the ********* and the holy ****** of nature for here you look upon a ******** ********* built not by ****** hands

you mean that splendid description which you read to me from modern ******** how fond you are of that passage and how very often you think of it let me see whether i can remember it slowly but ********** he repeated the ******** ******* to mountain glory from the fourth volume of modern ******** felix you know that a celebrated english poet ***** has said a thing of beauty is a joy forever and as i can never hope to express my ideas in half such beautiful language as mr ****** **** it is an ******* of trouble to ***** his words some of his *********** are like certain songs which the

much more clearly to you than i was able to do yes miss earl i see it now the eye could travel up and up and on and on and never get out of the sky and it seems to me those birds yonder would *** entirely away out of sight through that air in the picture but miss earl do you really believe that the ********** in south america is as grand as mr ******* i do not because i have noticed that pictures are much ********* than the real things they stand for ***** carried me last spring to see some ********* of scenes on the ****** river and when we went ********** in the summer i saw the very spot where the ****** stood when he ******** the hills and the **** of the river and it was not half so pretty as the picture and yet i know god is the greatest ******* is it the ****** look that everything ***** when painted yes the ****** look as you call it is one cause of the effect you wish to understand and it has been rather more ********* expressed by campbell in the line *** distance ***** *********** to the view i have seen this fact *********** in a very singular manner at a house in georgia where i was once visiting from the front door i had a very fine ******** or view of

fact of *********** the **** of the various ******* by ********** the distance could ******* their ********** and i asked myself whether all ****** things were ********* than those close at hand in my ********** i went as usual to mr ****** ********* whether he had ever noticed the same thing and of course he had and has a noble passage about it in one of his books on ************ i will see if my

the ********* woman i ever knew sometimes when she is sitting by me in church i watch her calm cold white face and she makes me think of a snow ****** but if felix says anything to ****** her feelings and call out her affection she is a ******* it is very rarely that one ***** a beautiful woman distinguished by her genius ******* and ******* by the reading public ******** herself as she does to our

she is a true woman and if she **** at all in any direction it is the right one only a little too ******* followed i am frequently asked how she is ******* to me for people can not believe that she is

********* consisted in ******* a few flowers that grew in **** in her windows and in ***** of her gratitude she had made a ******* of ********** ******* and ******** leaves which she sent with her ********* letter in conclusion the child asked that the woman whom without having seen she yet loved would be so kind as to give her a list of such books as a little girl ought to study and to write her just a few lines that she could keep under her pillow to look at now and then as edna finished reading the note felix took it to examine the small ********** characters and said dear little thing dont you wish we knew her ***** ******** of course you will answer it edna yes immediately and tell her how grateful i am for her ********** in ******* me a portion of her pet flowers each word in her

carried her up the steps and into the grand solemn church where the soft holy ****** light from the ************ glass ******** over ****** ********** and ********** columns neither edna nor st elmo spoke as they walked down the ***** and in perfect silence both ***** before the shining altar and only god heard their prayers of gratitude after some moments mr murray put out his hand took ednas and holding it in his on the ********** he prayed aloud asking gods blessing on their marriage and ********* ********** all their future to his work the ****** ***** of the dying day was ********* on
