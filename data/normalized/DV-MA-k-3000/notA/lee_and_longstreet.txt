this ***** of ************** led him to take too many *********** dangerous ********** at gettysburg all the vast interests at ***** and the ************* of success would not ***** him in the

he is dead general longstreet has said that he heard both ***** he knew he was not dead but did not know how soon he might be he had just strength enough left to **** his hat for this purpose he

wept with a bitterness of regret that ordinary ******* can never understand soon after the war general longstreet visited washington and was invited to be the guest of a union officer he ********* against ********* the invitation saying that it was too soon after the fighting but the ********** was so cordial as to leave no excuse for ******* once under an officers roof it became his pleasant

********* in business the splendid ability that marked him as a soldier he was making ten thousand dollars a year at the time the celebrated difference of opinion came up as to the course the south

would have made still more and more as the years went on than he could make then or ever afterwards in ******** besides to me and to any one who ever knew the real man the idea of his ******** his *********** a ***** ******* for any sort of gain is too ********** for serious discussion the very head and front of his ********* consisted in his belief that it was better for the south to accept

****** which promised ********* to *********** authority it was a few years after this letter that president grant appointed him ******** of the port at new orleans he never asked for this appointment

******** for complete ************** with all his people not many months before he died an officer of the northern armies was calling on him at his hotel in washington and in ********** the civil war

the man and his generous feeling towards those who used him ******* finally became a wonder and is today a joy for me to remember i will here give an instance or two ********** ************ of this side of his character general **** hampton as ******* as ever a ***** was felt very bitterly against general longstreet because of his republican ******** he expressed his feelings freely both in public and private and was ********** to the extent that he refused to speak to general longstreet when general longstreet succeeded him as united states ************ of ********* he would not come to the office to turn it over to his ********* general longstreet went to the office took the oath alone and ********** as best he could to make himself ********** with the duties of the position when he came home that evening and told me with evident surprise that general hampton was still bitter against him i asked rather in the hope of getting a reply in ********* of general hampton what sort of a soldier was general hampton since he seems so *********** in civil life general longstreet replied without a moments ********** there was not a ***** ****** more gallant officer in the confederate service than **** hampton and when general hampton died i think the most splendid ******* paid him came from the pen of general longstreet years ago there were political *********** between general longstreet and judge ***** ***** now of the federal ***** of georgia then a member of congress from the old ****** ******** of georgia general longstreet felt that he had been ******* the summer before his death we were at ** **** georgia for a short time one day i saw judge ***** in the hotel where we were ******** and asked general longstreet how he was going to receive him if judge *****

i have forgotten what it was all about general john b gordon during ****** years did general longstreet ********* i know he caused him much pain at a time when general longstreet was suffering *********** eye had already been destroyed by the dreadful ******* he had long been **** and ********* from war service the wound in his throat was giving him ******** ****** this sad time general gordon ******* the old ********** story that he had ********* orders at gettysburg but when a ******** from one of the new york ******* called to interview him about general gordon and his charges he refused to say one word it was then that i said if you will not reply to general gordon i will and in the future so long as i shall live whenever your war record is attacked i will make answer and so it happened that the little story of gettysburg was written while general longstreet was ******* the grave during these last ********* days he had heard that general gordon was not in good health and he asked me with touching ******* about his condition i expected to tell general gordon of these *********** but i never saw him again the ****** gathered him in ten days after general longstreet answered the call general longstreet was a most ****** ********* in early life he was an ************ and he ********* attended that church in new orleans until the political *********** ********* between himself and his friends after that he noticed that even his church ********** ******* him they would not sit in the same *** with him cut to the quick by such ********* he began to wonder if there was any church broad enough to ********* *********** caused by political and sectional feeling he discovered that the ***** ******** ******* extended him the ********* he ****** for he began to

between general longstreet and many of the leaders of the south never extended to the soldiers who did any large amount of fighting for the south there was a confederate ******* in ******* in #### a camp of confederate veterans of ******* georgia made up of his old command sent general longstreet a special request to come down from his home in *********** and to wear his old uniform he replied that his uniform had been destroyed years ago in the fire which burned his home and *********** everything else he had but that he would gladly go down with what was left of *********** his old trunk

i said to him this is the south that i love because it loves you it is the magnificent generous loyal south that i love with every ******* of my heart these are my people i think he never forgot the

received ******** of letters from his old soldiers in every part of the country asking for the privilege of seeing service with him under the flag of the union one of them wrote if this country is

quarter of a century after that great battle i had longstreet invited here as the guest of the first corps of the army of the potomac he came to washington some two days in advance and was a member of my household during that time we occupied a room together at gettysburg and went over the whole field when he gave me a full description of the confederates movements he was never ******** to lee but he feared the pickett charge would not be as successful as ********** at ****** longstreet attempted to ******** lee not to order it but rather a retreat at night and take up a position on the south bank of **** creek where meade wanted to fight the battle if we could have chosen a point to meet our plans of ********* i do not think we could have found a better one than that upon which they are now ************* all we have to do is to throw our army around by their left and we shall ********* between the federal army and washington no said general lee the enemy is there and i am going to attack him there lee was a great military ******* he had before him ********* great victory at ****** when he ordered ********* with ******* thousand men to charge the enemys centre but few of that number were alive when success crowned that daring military movement if picketts charge had been successful it would have crowned the southern confederacy as one of the nations of the world for it would not only have had foreign *********** but valuable assistance upon every field except one lee had been successful and that was a drawn battle he had great confidence in himself and thought that it was impossible to defeat him with his southern ******* under his command longstreet ******** from him on that charge and i am truly glad for the sake of my country that lee did not listen to him they are both gone forever but it seems strange to me that any military mind cannot recognize the ********* of longstreet at gettysburg the ****** death of the gallant old ******** of the army of northern virginia general james longstreet has again ******* some of the ********** and ********* reports of his **** of duty ************** and ************ of orders at the battle of gettysburg i want to offer some thoughts in regard to this matter and the first thing i want to say is that general longstreet ******** the love and confidence of the soldiers of lees army up to the surrender at appomattox on the 9th of april 1865 his soldiers never for one moment ********** his ******* his courage or his patriotism if these late reports of his ******* of duty at gettysburg be true is it not passing strange that he ******** the love and confidence of general lee until the close of the war if longstreet had ********* lees orders at gettysburg thereby ******* the battle to fail of success to southern arms does any one ******* to believe that general lee would have continued to place faith and confidence in him his first lieutenant until the close of the war no man who has a proper ********** of the character of robert e lee as a soldier and as a great military commander will believe it another remarkable ************ in connection with these grave charges against general longstreet is that the men ********* the army of northern virginia never heard a word of them until long after the death of general lee who could and would have ******* or ********* them the fame and character of general lee as a great military ********* does not need that the fame and reputation of another great and gallant soldier of the confederate army shall be ********** another remarkable fact is these charges came from men that were only ***************** at the battle of gettysburg brigadiergeneral pendleton it seems first made this charge against general longstreet in a public speech at lexington virginia in #### in which he said that general lee told him that he had ordered longstreet to attack at sunrise on the 2d of july longstreet ************ denied that general lee ever gave him any such orders and colonel w h taylor colonel c s ******* colonel charles ******** and general a l long all of general lees staff ********* after this charge was made by pendleton that they never heard of any such orders colonel ******* ******** to general longstreet said i did not know of any order for an attack on the enemy at sunrise on the 2d of july nor can i believe any such order was issued by general lee about sunrise on the 2d i was sent by general lee to general ewell to ask him what he thought of the ********** of an attack on the enemy from his position i do not think that the ****** on which i was sent by the commanding general is ********** with the idea of an attack at sunrise by any portion of the army it seems clearly by the ********* of these ******* officers and soldiers who were at that time members of general lees official family and were active ************ in that supreme struggle of gettysburg that this charge by general pendleton was only a ********* of hot air i think the general view taken by the best authority upon the history of the fighting at gettysburg on july the 2d which was the second day of these battles that up to ## am general lee was ********* as to whether he would attack on the right or left no matter in what ******** words we may ****** our admiration for him as a soldier the soldiers of the army of northern virginia would regard all these ******** words of praise as ********** to express the admiration we feel for the brave deeds in war and the ********* and gallant service rendered the confederate army by this grand old hero general james longstreet general lee told general pickett and the army of northern virginia that the **** of their success at gettysburg was his fault this man of glorious and ******** fame as the greatest military leader of modern times realized that he himself had ********* the ability of his army and ********** the army of his enemy who had the advantage of numbers and of far better position general lee realized then as the world has since that he made a mistake in ********* the union army at gettysburg after general meade had secured and to some extent had ********* an almost *********** position grant made the same mistake when lee caught him on the *** in the wilderness at ************* and at cold harbor with this difference grant was ********* upon his superior numbers and ********* while lee was ********* upon the ****** and fighting qualities of his army and while the ****** and fighting qualities of lees army were never ******** in the history of modern ******* even they could not accomplish the impossible and the ********* of general longstreets ******** are ********* ********* of the fact that general longstreet at the battle of the wilderness made a forced march that ***** his soldiers to their ****** capacity to get there in time and when he arrived on the field he found the southern line was being driven back by superior numbers and throwing his troops into line and with his accustomed *********** drove the federal line rapidly back and saved the day and gave the southern army the victory at the wilderness in this fight he was severely wounded and the gallant jenkins of south carolina at the same time was killed pendleton said that general lee died ********* that but for the ************ of longstreet at gettysburg that battle would have been a victory for the southern army how did he know that lee died with that belief did general lee ever tell any one so if so whom it is one thing to make an assertion but quite a different thing to prove it i have seen men in my day look pretty ***** in court when called on to prove some things they had said on the streets in conclusion i want to say that while we all ********* and were ******* when general longstreet joined the republican party that fact ought not to have ******* ********* sufficient to have caused us to ****** and ******** and cast any ******** upon his character or ****** reflection upon his long and brilliant career as a soldier he was a soldier by ********** and according to his own ********* he never cast a ****** in civil life ***** to the confederate war he and general grant were warm personal friends they were *********** at west point comrades in the mexican and some ****** **** general grant clasped his hand and called him *** at the surrender at appomattox grant at appomattox was a ******** and a *********** and he went over to the republican party and was ******* president of the united states what influence general grant brought to bear upon general longstreet may have been very great for all the outside world knows be that as it may we do know that up to the close of the war he had taken no active part in ******** in any party we also have every reason to believe that if general longstreet had ******** the ********** party and become a strong ******** in that party we never would have heard a word of this ********* ******* at gettysburg the soldiers of longstreets corps do not believe he ********* general lees orders at gettysburg or at any other time we dont believe it now we
