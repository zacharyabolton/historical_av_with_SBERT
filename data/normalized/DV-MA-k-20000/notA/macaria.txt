the ********* was on the last stroke of twelve the solitary candle measured but two inches from its socket and as the summer wind rushed through the halfclosed shutters the melted tallow dripped slowly into the ***************** brazen candlestick the flickering light fell upon the pages of a ledger and flashed fitfully in the face of the ********** as he bent over his work sixteen years growth had given him unusual height and remarkable breadth of chest and it was difficult to realize that the stature of manhood had been attained by a mere boy in years a grey suit evidently homemade of rather coarse texture bespoke poverty and owing to the oppressive heat of the atmosphere the coat was thrown partially off he wore no vest and the *********** black ribbon suffered the snowy white collar to fall away from the throat and expose its ********** outline the head was large but *********** proportioned and the thick black hair cut short and clinging to the temples added to its *********** the lofty forehead white and smooth the somewhat heavy brows ******** the hue of the hair the straight ************ nose with its delicate but clearly defined nostril the full firm lips ******** by moustache combined to render the face one of uncommon beauty yet as he sat absorbed by his figures there was nothing ************* or winning in his appearance for though you could not **** at the moulding of his features you involuntarily shrank from the prematurely grave nay austere expression which seemed habitual to them he looked just what he was youthful in years but old in trials and labours and to one who ******** his countenance the conviction was inevitable that his will was gigantic his ambition unbounded his intellect wonderfully acute and powerful russell do you know it is midnight he frowned and answered without looking up yes how much longer will you sit up till i finish my work the speaker stood on the threshold leaning against the door facing and after waiting a few moments softly crossed the room and put her hand on the back of his chair she was two years his junior and though evidently the victim of recent and severe illness even in her feebleness she was singularly like him her presence seemed to annoy him for he turned round and said hastily electra go to bed i told you goodnight three hours ago she stood still but silent what do you want nothing he wrote on for some ten minutes longer then closed the ledger and put it aside the candle had burned low he took a fresh one from the drawer of the table and after lighting it drew a latin dictionary near to him opened a worn copy of horace and began to study quiet as his own shadow stood the fragile girl behind his chair but as she watched him a heavy sigh escaped her if i thought i should be weak and sickly all my life i would rather die at once and burden you and auntie no longer electra who told you that you burdened me oh russell dont i know how hard you have to work and how difficult it is for you to get even bread and clothes dont i see how auntie labours day after day and month after month you are good and kind but does that prevent my feeling the truth that you are working for me too if i could only help you in some way she knelt down by his chair and leaned her head on his knee holding his hands between both hers electra you do help me all day long when i am at the store your face haunts strengthens me i feel that i am striving to give you comforts and when at night you meet me at the gate i am repaid for all i have done you must put this idea out of your head little one it is altogether a mistake do you hear what i say get up and go to sleep like a good child or you will have another wretched headache tomorrow and cant bring me my lunch he lifted her from the floor and kissed her hastily she raised her arms as if to wind them about his neck but his grave face gave her no encouragement and turning away she retired to her room with hot tears rolling over her cheeks russell had scarcely read half a dozen lines after his cousins departure when a soft hand swept back the locks of hair on his forehead and wiped away the heavy drops that moistened them my son you promised me you would not sit up late tonight well mother i have almost finished remember the nights are very short now and twelve oclock comes early the better reason that you should not be up so late my son i am afraid you will ruin your health by this unremitting application ******* at me i am as strong as an athlete of old he shook his limbs and smiled proud of his great physical strength true russell but robust as you are you cannot stand such toil without detriment put up your books not yet i have more laid out and you know i invariably finish all i set apart to do but mother your hand is hot you are not well he raised the thin hand and pressed it to his lips a mere headache nothing more mr clark was here today he is very impatient about the rent i told him we were doing all we could and thought that by september we should be able to pay the whole he knew she watched him and answered with a forced smile yes he came to the store this morning i told him we had been very unfortunate this year that sickness had forced us to incur more expense than usual however i drew fifty dollars and paid him all i could true i anticipated my dues but mr watson gave me permission so for the present you need not worry about rent what is the amount of that grocery bill you would not let me see last week my dear mother do not trouble yourself with these little matters the grocery bill will very soon be paid i have arranged with mr hill to keep his books at night and therefore you may be easy trust all to me mother only take care of your dear self and i ask no more oh russell my son my dear son she had drawn a chair near him and now laid her head on his shoulder while tears dropped on his hand he had not seen her so unnerved for years and as he looked down on her ************ yet resigned face his countenance underwent a marvellous change and folding his arms about her he kissed her pale thin cheek repeatedly mother it is not like you to repine in this way you who have suffered and endured so much must not despond when after a long starless night the day begins to dawn i fear it dawns in clouds and ******* only storms for myself i care not but for you ********* pride my only hope my brave boy it is for you that i suffer i have been thinking tonight that this is a doomed place for you and that if we could only save money enough to go to california you might take the position you merit for there none would know of the blight which fell upon you none could look on your brow and dream it seemed ******* here you have such bitter prejudice to combat such gross injustice heaped upon you he lifted his mothers head from his bosom and rose with a haughty defiant smile on his lip not so i will stay here and live down their hate mark me mother i will live it down so surely as i am russell aubrey the despised son of a go to california not i not i in this state will i work and conquer here right here i will plant my feet upon the necks of those that now strive to grind me to the dust i swore it over my fathers coffin hush russell you must subdue your fierce temper you must you must remember it was this ungovernable rage which brought disgrace upon your young innocent head oh it grieves me my son to see how bitter you have grown once you were gentle and forgiving now scorn and defiance rule you i am not fierce i am not in a rage if i should meet the judge and jury who doomed my father to the gallows i think i would serve them if they needed aid but i am proud i inherited my nature i writhe yes mother writhe under the treatment i constantly receive we have trouble enough my son without dwelling upon what is past and irremediable so long as you seem cheerful i am content i know that god will not lay more on me than i can bear as my day so shall my strength be thy will be done oh my god there was a brief pause and russell aubrey passed his hand over his eyes and dashed off a tear his mother watched him and said cautiously have you noticed that my eyes are rapidly growing worse yes mother i have been anxious for some weeks you know it all then yes mother i shall not murmur i have become resigned at last though for many weeks i have wrestled for strength for patience it was so exceedingly bitter to know that the time drew near when i should see you no more to feel that i should stretch out my hands to you and lean on you and yet look no longer on the dear face of my child my boy my all but my prayers were heard the sting has passed away and i am resigned i am glad that we have spoken of it now my mind is calmer and i can sleep good night my son she pressed the customary good night kiss on his lips and left him he closed the dictionary leaned his elbow on the table and rested his head on his hand his piercing black eyes were fixed gloomily on the floor and now and then his broad chest heaved as dark and painful thoughts crowded up mrs aubrey was the only daughter of wealthy and ambitious parents who refused to sanction her marriage with the object of her choice and threatened to ********** her if she persisted in her obstinate course mr aubrey was poor but honest highly cultivated and in every sense of that much abused word a gentleman his poverty was not to be forgiven however and when the daughter left her fathers roof and wedded the man whom her parents detested she was banished for ever from a home of affluence and found that she had indeed forfeited her fortune for this she was prepared and bore it bravely but ere long ******* trials came upon her unfortunately her husbands temper was fierce and ungovernable and pecuniary embarrassments rarely have the effect of ********** such he removed to an inland town and embarked in mercantile pursuits but misfortune followed him and reverses came thick and fast one miserable day when from early morning everything had gone wrong an importunate ******** of wealth and great influence in the community chafed at mr aubreys ********* in ******** some trifling sum proceeded to taunt and insult him most unwisely stung to madness the wretched man resented the insults a struggle ensued and at its close mr aubrey stood over the corpse of the ******** there was no mode of escape and the arm of the law consigned him to prison during the tedious weeks that elapsed before the trial his devoted wife strove to cheer and encourage him russell was about eleven years of age and boy though he was realized most fully the horrors of his parents situation the days of his trial came at last but the accused had surrendered himself to the demon rage had taken the life of a fellow creature what could legal skill accomplish the affair produced great and continued excitement the murdered man had been exceedingly popular and the sympathies of the citizens were enlisted in behalf of his family although clearly a case of ************ only to the astonishment of the counsel on both sides the cry of blood for blood went out from that crowded courtroom and in defiance of precedent mr aubrey was unjustly sentenced to be hanged when the verdict was known russell placed his insensible mother on a couch from which it seemed probable she would never rise but there is an astonishing amount of endurance in even a feeble womans frame and after a time she went about her house once more doing her duty to her child and learning to suffer and grow strong fate had ordained however that russells father should not die upon the gallows and soon after the verdict was pronounced when all mrs aubreys efforts to procure a pardon had proved unavailing the proud and desperate man in the solitude of his cell with no eye but ******** to witness the awful deed took his own life with the aid of a ****** such was the legacy of shame which russell inherited was it any marvel that at sixteen that boy had lived ages of sorrow mrs aubrey found her husbands financial affairs so involved that she relinquished the hope of retaining the little she possessed and retired to a small cottage on the outskirts of the town where she endeavoured to support herself and the two dependent on her by taking in sewing electra grey was the orphan child of mr aubreys only sister who dying in poverty bequeathed the infant to her brother he had loved her as well as his own russell and his wife who cradled her in her arms and taught her to walk by clinging to her finger would almost as soon have parted with her son as the little electra for five years the widow had toiled by midnight lamps to feed these two now oppressed nature rebelled the long ********* eyes refused to perform their office filmy cataracts stole over them veiling their sadness and their unshed ************** was creeping on at his fathers death russell was forced to quit school and with some difficulty he succeeded in obtaining a situation in a large drygoods store where his labours were onerous in the extreme and his wages a mere ******** though russells employer mr watson shrank from committing a gross wrong and prided himself on his scrupulous honesty his narrow mind and ********* habits strangled every generous impulse and without being absolutely cruel or unprincipled he contrived to gall the boys proud spirit and render his position one of almost purgatorial severity his eldest son was just russells age had been sent to various schools from his infancy was indolent selfindulgent and thoroughly dissipated having been a second time expelled from school for most disgraceful ************* he ******* away his time about the store or passed it still more ************ with reckless companions the daily contrast presented by cecil and russell ********* the father and hence his settled dislike of the latter the faithful discharge of duty on the part of the clerk afforded no plausible occasion for invective he felt that he was narrowly watched and resolved to give no ground for faultfinding yet during the long summer days when the intense heat prevented ********* from thronging the store and there was nothing to be done when russell knowing that the books were written up and the counters free from goods took his latin grammar and improved every leisure halfhour he was not ignorant of the fact that an angry scowl darkened his ********* visage and understood why he was constantly interrupted to perform most unnecessary labours what the day denied him he reclaimed from night and succeeded in acquiring a tolerable knowledge of greek besides reading several latin books finding that his small salary was inadequate now that his mothers failing sight prevented her from accomplishing the usual amount of sewing he solicited and obtained permission to keep an additional set of books for the ****** who furnished his family with provisions though by this arrangement few hours remained for necessary sleep the protracted illness and death of an aged and faithful servant together with electras tedious sickness bringing the extra expense of medical aid had prevented the prompt payment of rent due for the *********** cottage and russell was compelled to ask for a portion of his salary in advance his mother little dreamed of the struggle which took place in his heart ere he could force himself to make the request and he carefully concealed from her the fact that at the moment of receiving the money he laid in mr watsons hands by way of **** the only article of any value which he ************ watch his father had always worn and which the ******* took from the vest pocket of the dead ******* with blood the gold chain had been sold long before and the son wore it attached to a simple black ribbon his employer received the watch locked it in the iron safe and russell fastened a small weight to the ribbon and kept it around his neck that his mother might not suspect the truth it chanced that cecil stood near at the time he saw the watch deposited in the safe whistled a tune fingered his own gold ******** and walked away such was russell aubreys history such his situation at the beginning of his seventeenth year irene your father will be displeased if he sees you in that plight pray what is wrong about me now you seem to glory in finding fault what is the matter with my plight as you call it you know very well your father cant bear to see you carrying your own satchel and basket to school he ordered martha to take them every morning and evening but she says you will not let her carry them it is just sheer obstinacy in you there it is again because i dont choose to be petted like a baby or made a wax doll of it is set down to obstinacy as if i had the temper of a heathen see here aunt margaret i am tired of having martha tramping eternally at my heels as though i were a ********** child there is no reason in her walking after me when i am strong enough to carry my own books and i dont intend she shall do it any longer irene huntingdon stood on the marble steps of her palatial home and talked with the maiden aunt who governed her fathers household the girl was about fourteen tall for her age straight ************ slender the broad straw hat shaded but by no means concealed her features and as she looked up at her aunt the sunshine fell upon a face of extraordinary beauty such as is rarely seen save in the ********* heads of the old masters her eyes were strangely marvellously beautiful they were larger than usual and of that rare shade of purplish blue which borders the white velvet petals of a clematis when the eyes were uplifted as on this occasion long curling lashes of the bronze hue of her hair rested against her brow save the scarlet lines which marked her lips her face was of that clear ************** which can be ******* only to the purest ivory though there was an utter absence of the rosy hue of health the ************ of the complexion seemed characteristic of her type and precluded all thought of disease miss margaret muttered something inaudible in reply to her last remark and irene walked on to school her fathers residence was about a mile from the town but the winding road rendered the walk somewhat longer and on one side of this road stood the small house occupied by mrs aubrey as irene approached it she saw electra grey coming from the opposite direction and at the cottage gate they met both paused irene held out her hand cordially good morning i have not seen you for a fortnight i thought you were coming to school again as soon as you were strong enough no i am not going back to school why because auntie cant afford to send me any longer you know her eyes are growing worse every day and she is not able to take in sewing as she used to do i am sorry but it cant be helped how do you know it cant be helped russell told me he thought she had cataracts on her eyes and they can be removed perhaps so if we had the means of consulting that celebrated physician in new orleans money removes a great many things irie but unfortunately we havent it the trip would not cost much suppose you speak to russell about it much or little it will require more than we can possibly spare everything is so high we can barely live as it is but i must go in my aunt is waiting for me they shook hands and irene walked on soon the brick walls of the academy rose grim and uninviting and taking her place at the desk she applied herself to her books when school was dismissed in the afternoon instead of returning home as usual she walked down the principal street entered mr watsons store and put her books on the counter it happened that the proprietor stood near the front door and he came forward instantly to wait upon her ah miss irene happy to see you what shall i have the pleasure of showing you russell aubrey if you please the merchant stared and she added i want some kid gauntlets but russell can get them for me the young clerk stood at the desk in the rear of the store with his back toward the counter and mr watson called out here aubrey some kid gauntlets for this young lady he laid down his pen and taking a box of gloves from the shelves placed it on the counter before her he had not noticed her particularly and when she pushed back her hat and looked up at him he started slightly good evening miss huntingdon what number do you wish perhaps it was from the heat of the day or from stooping over his desk or perhaps it was from something else but his cheek was flushed and gradually it grew pale again russell i want to speak to you about electra she ought to be at school you know yes but she says your mother cant afford the expense just now she cannot next year things will be better what is the tuition for her five dollars a month is that all he selected a delicate ************ pair of gloves and laid them before her while a faint smile passed over his face russell has anything happened what do you mean what is troubling you so nothing more than usual do those gloves suit you yes they will fit me i believe she looked at him very intently he met her gaze steadily and for an instant his face brightened then she said abruptly your mothers eyes are worse yes much worse have you consulted dr arnold about them he says he can do nothing for her how much would it cost to take her to new orleans and have that celebrated oculist examine them more than we can afford just now at least two hundred dollars oh russell that is not much would not mr watson lend you that little i shall not ask him not even to restore your mothers sight not to buy my own life besides the experiment is a doubtful one still it is worth making yes under different circumstances it certainly would be have you talked to mr campbell about it no because it is useless to discuss the matter it would be dangerous to go to new orleans now i suppose october or november would be better again she looked at him very earnestly then stretched out her little hand goodbye russell i wish i could do something to help you to make you less sorrowful he held the slight waxen fingers and his mouth trembled as he answered thank you miss huntingdon i am not sorrowful but my path in life is not quite so flowery as yours i wish you would not call me miss huntingdon in that stiff faroff way as if we were not friends or maybe it is a hint that you desire me to address you as mr aubrey it sounds strange unnatural to say anything but russell she gathered up her books took the gloves and went slowly homeward and russell returned to his desk with a light in his eyes which for the remainder of the day nothing could ****** as irene ascended the long hill on which mr huntingdons residence stood she saw her fathers buggy at the door and as she approached the steps he came out drawing on his gloves you are late irene what kept you i have been shopping a little are you going to ride take me with you going to dine at mr carters why the sun is almost down now what time will you come home i want to ask you something not till long after you are asleep the night passed very slowly irene looked at the clock again and again finally the house became quiet and at last the crush of wheels on the ********** announced her fathers return he came into the library for a cigar and without noticing her drew his chair to the open window she approached and put her hand on his shoulder irene what is the matter child nothing sir only i want to ask you something well queen what is it he drew her tenderly to his knee and passed his hand over her floating hair leonard huntingdon was forty years old tall spare with an erect and martial carriage he had been trained at west point and perhaps early education contributed somewhat to the air of unbending haughtiness which many found repulsive his black hair was slightly sprinkled with grey and his features were still decidedly handsome though the expression of mouth and eyes was ordinarily by no means winning irene was his only child her mother had died during her infancy and on this beautiful idol he lavished all the tenderness of which his nature was capable his tastes were cultivated his house was elegant and complete and furnished magnificently every luxury that money could yield him he possessed yet there were times when he seemed moody and cynical and no one could surmise the cause of his gloom the girl looked up at him fearing no denial father i wish please you would give me two hundred dollars what would you do with it queen i do not want it for myself i should like to have that much to enable a poor woman to recover her sight she has cataracts on her eyes and there is a physician in new orleans who can relieve her father wont you give me the money he took the cigar from his lips shook off the ashes and asked indifferently what is the womans name has she no husband to take care of her mrs aubrey she what the cigar fell from his fingers he put her from his knee and rose instantly his swarthy cheek glowed and she wondered at the expression of his eyes so different from anything she had ever seen there before who gave you permission to visit that house no permission was necessary i go there because i love her and electra and because i like russell why ******** i go there sir is poverty disgrace irene mark me you are to visit that house no more in future keep away from the whole family i will have no such association never let me hear their names again go to bed give me one good reason and i will obey you reason my will my command is sufficient reason what do you mean by *********** me in this way implicit obedience is your duty the calm holy eyes looked wonderingly into his and as he marked the startled expression of the girls pure face his own eyes drooped father has mrs aubrey ever injured you no answer if she has not you are very unjust to her if she has remember she is a woman bowed down with many sorrows and it is unmanly to hoard up old differences father please give me that money i will bury my last dollar in the red sea first now are you answered she put her hands over her eyes as if to shut out some painful vision and he saw the slight form shudder in perfect silence she took her books and went up to her room mr huntingdon ******** himself as the door closed behind her and the lamplight showed a sinister smile writhing over his dark features he sat there staring out into the starry night and seeing by the shimmer of the setting moon only the graceful form and lovely face of amy aubrey as she had appeared to him in other days could he forget the hour when she ******** her cold fingers from his clasp and in defiance of her fathers wishes vowed she would never be his wife no revenge was sweet very sweet his heart had swelled with exultation when the verdict of death upon the gallows was pronounced upon the husband of her choice and now her poverty her humiliation her blindness gave him deep unutterable joy the history of the past was a sealed volume to his daughter but she was now for the first time conscious that her father regarded the widow and her son with unconquerable hatred and with strange foreboding dread she looked into the future knowing that forgiveness was no part of his nature that insult or injury was never forgotten whether the general rule of implicit obedience to parental injunction admitted of no exceptions was a problem which irene readily solved and on saturday as soon as her father and cousin had started to the plantation twentyfive miles distant she put on her hat and walked to town wholly absorbed in philanthropic schemes she hurried along the sidewalk ran up a flight of steps and knocked at a door on which was written in large gilt letters dr arnold ah beauty come in sit down and tell me what brought you to town so early he was probably a man of fifty gruff in appearance and unmistakably a bachelor his thick hair was grizzled so was the heavy beard and the shaggy grey eyebrows slowly unbent as he took his visitors little hands and looked kindly down into her grave face from her infancy he had petted and fondled her and she stood as little in awe of him as of paragon doctor are you busy this morning i am never too busy to attend to you little one what is it of course you know that mrs aubrey is almost blind of course i do having been her physician those cataracts can be removed however perhaps they can and perhaps they cant but the probabilities are that a good oculist can relieve her i rather think so two hundred dollars would defray all the expenses of a trip to new orleans for this purpose but she is too poor to afford it decidedly too poor his grey eyes twinkled *********** but he would not anticipate her dr arnold dont you think you could spare that small sum without much inconvenience really is that what you trudged into town for yes i have not the necessary amount at my disposal just now and i came to ask you to lend it to me do you want the money now yes if you please but before you give it to me i ought to tell you that i want the matter kept secret no one is to know anything about ***** even my father she looked so ************* that for a moment he felt puzzled i knew mrs aubrey before her marriage he bent forward to watch the effect of his words but if she really knew or suspected aught of the past there was not the slightest intimation of it putting back her hair she looked up and answered that should increase your willingness to aid her in her misfortunes hold out your hand fifty one hundred a hundred and fifty two hundred there will that do thank you thank you you will not need it soon i hope not until you are ready to pay me dr arnold you have given me a great deal of ************ than i can express i dont try to express it queen you have given me infinitely more i assure you her splendid eyes were lifted toward him and with some sudden impulse she touched her lips to the hand he had placed on her shoulder something like a tremor crossed the doctors habitually stern mouth as he looked at the marvellous beauty of the girls countenance and he kissed her slender fingers as reverently as though he touched something consecrated irene shall i take you home in my buggy no thank you i would rather walk oh doctor i am so much obliged to you in answer to irenes knock electra opened the cottage door and ushered her into the small room which served as both kitchen and diningroom everything was scrupulously neat not a spot on the bare polished floor not a speck to dim the purity of the snowy ****** curtains and on the table in the centre stood a vase filled with fresh fragrant flowers in a low chair before the open window sat the widow knitting a blue and white ***** she glanced round as irene entered who is it electra miss irene aunt sit down miss irene how are you today mrs aubrey i am sorry to hear your eyes are no better thank you for your kind sympathy my sight grows more dim every day you shant suffer much longer these veils shall be taken off here is the money to enable you to go to new orleans and consult that physician as soon as the weather turns cooler you must start miss irene i cannot tax your generosity so heavily i have no claim on your goodness indeed i mrs aubrey dont you think it is your duty to recover your sight if possible yes if i could command the means you have the means you must employ them there i will not take back the money it is yours dont refuse it auntie you will wound irie pleaded electra there was silence for a few seconds then mrs aubrey took the hands from her face and ********* i will accept your generous offer if my sight is restored i can repay you some day if not i am not too proud to be under this great obligation to you oh irene i cant tell you how much i thank you my heart is too full for words she threw her arm round the girls waist and strained her to her bosom and the hot tears fell fast on the waves of golden hair a moment after irene threw a tiny envelope into electras lap and without another word glided out of the room the orphan broke the seal and as she opened a sheet of notepaper a tendollar bill slipped out electra come to school monday the enclosed will pay your tuition for two months longer please dont hesitate to accept it if you really love thinking of the group she had just left irene approached the gate and saw that russell stood holding it open for her to pass looking up she stopped for the expression of his face frightened and pained her russell what is the matter oh tell me i have been injured and insulted just now i doubt all people and all things even the justice and mercy of god russell shall not the righteous judge of all the earth do right shall the rich and the unprincipled eternally trample upon the poor and the unfortunate who has injured you a *********** man who passes for a christian who turns pale at the sound of a violin who ******* to missionary labours and talks often about widows and orphans such a man knowing the circumstances that surround me my poverty my mothers affliction on bare and most unwarrantable suspicion turns me out of my situation as clerk and ********** to brand my name with infamy today i stand disgraced in the eyes of the community thanks to the vile slanders of that pillar of the church jacob watson i could bear it myself but my mother my noble patient suffering mother i must go in and add a yet heavier burden to those already crushing out her life pleasant tidings these i bring her that her son is disgraced branded as a ***** there was no moisture in the keen eye no tremor in the metallic ring of his voice no relaxation of the curled lip cant you prove your innocence was it money no it was a watch which i gave up as security for drawing a portion of my salary in advance it was locked up in the iron safe this morning it was missing and they accuse me of having stolen it he took off his hat as if it oppressed him and tossed back his hair what will you do russell i dont know yet oh if i could only help you she clasped her hands over her heart and for the first time since her infancy tears rushed down her cheeks it was painful to see that quiet girl so moved and russell hastily took the folded hands in his and bent his face close to hers irene the only comfort i have is that you are my friend dont let them influence you against me no matter what you may hear believe in me oh irene irene believe in me always he held her hands in a clasp so tight that it pained her then suddenly dropped them and left her mrs aubrey recognized the step and looked round in surprise electra i certainly hear russell coming he drew near and touched her cheek with his lips saying tenderly how is my mother russell what brings you home so early that is rather a cold welcome mother but i am not astonished can you bear to hear something unpleasant here put your hands in mine now listen to me you know i drew fifty dollars of my salary in advance to pay clark at that time i gave my watch to mr watson by way of **** he seemed so reluctant to let me have the money you understand mother why i did not mention it at the time he locked it up in the iron safe to which no one has access except him and myself late yesterday i locked the safe as usual but do not remember whether the watch was still there or not this morning mr watson missed it we searched safe desk store could find it nowhere nor the ************ gold piece deposited at the same time no other money was missing though the safe contained nearly a thousand dollars the end of it all is that i am accused as the thief and expelled in disgrace for a low plaintive cry escaped the widows lips and her head sank heavily on the boys shoulder passing his arm fondly around her he kissed her white face and continued in the same hushed passionless tone like one speaking under his breath and ******** some devouring rage mother i need not assure you of my innocence you know that i never could be guilty of what is imputed to me but not having it in my power to prove my innocence i shall have to suffer the disgrace for a season only for a season i trust mother for in time the truth must be discovered i have been turned out of my situation and though they have no proof of my guilt they will try to brand me with the disgrace for a few moments deep silence reigned in the little kitchen and only the infinite eye pierced the heart of the ********* sufferer when she raised her head from the boys bosom the face though tearstained was serene and pressing her lips twice to his she said slowly beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you for whom the lord ****** he ********** and ********* every son whom he ********* i will wait patiently my son hoping for proofs which shall convince the world of your innocence i wish i could take the whole burden on my shoulders and relieve you my dear boy you have mother it ceases to crush me now that you are yourself once more he spoke with difficulty however as if something stifled him and rising hastily poured out and drank a glass of water and now russell sit down and let me tell you a little that is pleasant and sunshiny there is still a bright spot left to look upon stealing her hand into his the mother informed him of all that had occurred during irenes visit and concluded by laying the money in his palm electra sat opposite watching the change that came over the face she loved best on earth her large eager midnight eyes noted the quick flush and glad light which overspread his features the deep joy that kindled in his tortured soul and unconsciously she clutched her fingers till the nails grew purple as though striving to strangle some hideous object thrusting itself before her her breathing became laboured and painful her gaze more concentrated and searching and when her cousin exclaimed oh mother she is an angel i have always known it she is unlike everybody else electras heart seemed to stand still and from that moment a sombre curtain fell between the girls eyes and gods sunshine she rose and a silent yet terrible struggle took place in her passionate soul justice and jealousy wrestled briefly she would be just though every star fell from her sky and with a quick uncertain step she reached russell thrust irenes note into his fingers and fled into solitude an hour later russell knocked at the door of an office which bore on a square tin plate these words robert campbell attorney at law the door was partially closed and as he entered an elderly man looked up from a desk covered with loose papers and open volumes from which he was evidently making extracts the thin hair hung over his forehead as if restless fingers had ploughed carelessly through it and as he kept one finger on a ********** paragraph the cold blue eye said very plainly this is a busy time with me despatch your errand at once good morning mr campbell are you particularly engaged ******** aubrey i am generally engaged ************ busy this morning what do you want his pen resumed its work but he turned his head as if to listen i will call again when you are at leisure said russell turning away that will ****** ********* year in fine ********** your visit indefinitely sit ********************** those

irene had experienced a sensation of loneliness doubtless the loss of her mother enhanced this feeling but the peculiarity of her mental organization would have necessitated it even under happier auspices miss margaret considered her a strange little thing and rarely interfered with her plans in any respect while her father seemed to take it for granted that she required no looking after he knew that her beauty was extraordinary he was proud of the fact and having provided her with a good music master and sent her to the best school in the county he left her to employ her leisure as inclination prompted occasionally her will ********** with his and more than once he found it impossible to make her yield assent to his wishes to the outward *********** of obedience and respect she submitted but whenever these differences occurred he felt that in the end she was *********** inconsistent as it may appear though fretted for the time by her firmness he loved her the more for her ********** as he termed it and despotic and exacting though he certainly was in many respects he stood somewhat in awe of his *********** ******** child his ward and nephew hugh seymour had resided with him for several years and it was well known that mr huntingdon had pledged his daughters hand to his sisters son irene had never been officially apprised of her destiny but surmised very accurately the true state of the case between the two cousins there existed not the slightest ************ of taste or disposition not a sympathetic link save the tie of relationship on her part there was a moderate share of cousinly affection on his as much love and tenderness as his selfish nature was capable of feeling they rarely quarrelled as most children do for when as frequently happened he flew into a rage and tried to ********* she scorned to retort in any way and generally locked him out of the library what she thought of her fathers intentions concerning herself no one knew she never alluded to the subject and if in a frolicsome mood hugh ******** it she invariably cut the discussion short when he went to college in a distant state she felt infinitely relieved and during his vacations secluded herself as much as possible yet the girls heart was warm and clinging she loved her father devotedly and loved most intensely electra grey whom she had first met at school they were nearly the same age classmates and firm friends as totally different in character as appearance was electra grey rather smaller and much thinner than irene with shining purplish black hair large sad searching black eyes from which there was no escape a pale olive complexion and full crimson lips that rarely smiled electra was a dreamer richly gifted dissatisfied because she could never attain that unreal world which her busy brain kept constantly before her electras love of drawing had early displayed itself first in strange weird figures on her slate then in her ******** on every slip of paper which she could lay her hands upon and finally for want of more suitable material she scrawled all over the walls of the little bedroom to the great horror of her aunt who spread a coat of ********* over the childs ******* and begged her to be guilty of no such conduct in future as mr clark might with great justice sue for damages in utter humiliation electra retreated to the garden and here after a shower had left the sandy walks white and smooth she would ******* a bit of pine and draw figures and faces of all conceivable and inconceivable shapes chancing to find her thus engaged one sunday afternoon russell supplied her with a package of ************ and ******* so long as these lasted she was perfectly happy but ********* their ********** circumstances admitted of no such expenditure and before many weeks she was again without materials she would not tell russell that she had exhausted his package and passed sleepless nights trying to devise some method by which she could aid herself it was positive torture for her to sit in school and see the ************* go round giving lessons on this side and that skipping over her every time because her aunt could not afford the extra three dollars amid all these ********* and aspirations she turned constantly to russell with a worshipping love that knew no bounds she loved her meek affectionate aunt as well as most natures love their mothers and did all in her power to lighten her labours but her affection for russell bordered on adoration in a character so exacting and passionate as hers there is necessarily much of jealousy and thus it came to pass that on the day of irenes visit to the cottage the horrible suspicion took possession of her that he loved irene better than herself true she was very young but childish hearts feel as keenly as those of matured years and electra endured more agony during that day than in all her past life had irene been other than she was in every respect she would probably have hated her cordially as matters stood she buried the suspicion deep in her own heart and kept as much out of everybodys way as possible days and weeks passed very wearily she busied herself with her textbooks and when the lessons had been recited drew all over the *********** a hand there an entire arm now and then a face sadeyed as fate mrs aubreys eyes became so blurred that finally she could not leave the house without having some one to guide her and as cold weather had now arrived preparations were made for her journey mr hill who was going to new orleans kindly offered to take charge of her and the day of departure was fixed electra packed the little trunk saw it deposited on the top of the stage in the dawn of an october morning saw her aunt comfortably seated beside mr hill and in another moment all had vanished in the afternoon of that day on returning from school electra went to the bureau and unlocking a drawer took out a small paper box it contained a miniature of her father set in a handsome gold frame she knew it had been her mothers most valued ******* her aunt had carefully kept it for her and as often as the temptation assailed her she had resisted but now the longing for money triumphed over every other feeling having touched the spring she took a knife and cautiously removed the bit of ivory beneath the glass then deposited the two last in the box put the gold frame in her pocket and went out to a ********* store as several persons had preceded her she leaned against the counter and while waiting watched with some curiosity the movements of one of the goldsmiths who with a glass over one eye was engaged in repairing watches some had been taken from the cases others were untouched and as her eyes passed swiftly over the latter they were suddenly riveted to a massive gold one lying somewhat apart a halfsmothered exclamation caused the ******* to turn round and look at her but in an instant she calmed herself and thinking it a mere outbreak of impatience he resumed his employment just then one of the proprietors approached and said politely i am sorry we have kept you waiting miss what can i do for you what is this worth she laid the locket down on the counter and looked up with eyes that sparkled very joyously he thought he examined it a moment and said rather dryly well how do i know in the first place that it belongs to you ********* have to be very particular about what they buy she crimsoned and drew herself proudly away from the counter then smiled and held out her hand for the locket it is mine it held my fathers miniature but i took it out because i want a ******** and thought i could sell this case for enough to buy one it was my mothers once here are her initials on the back h ******** grey but of course you dont know whether i am telling the truth i will bring my cousin with me he can prove it sir are you so particular about everything you buy we try to be again her eyes sparkled she bowed and left the store once in the street she hurried to mr campbells office ran up the steps and rapped loudly at the door come in thundered the lawyer she stopped on the threshold glanced round and said timidly i want to see russell if you please russell is at the postoffice have you any particular spite at my door that you ******** it in that style or do you suppose i am as deaf as a ******** i beg your pardon i did not mean to startle you sir i was not thinking of either you or your door she sprang down the steps to wait on the sidewalk for her cousin and met him at the entrance oh russell i have found your watch a ray of light seemed to leap from his eyes as he seized her hand where at mr browns ********* store thank god he went up the stairway delivered the letters and came back accompanied by mr campbell this is my cousin electra grey mr campbell so i inferred from the ************* assault she made on my door just now however shake hands little lady it seems there is some reason for your haste lets hear about this precious watch business she simply told what she had seen presently russell said but how did you happen there electra your good angel sent me i suppose and she added in a whisper i will tell you some other time on ********** the store she walked at once to the ******** corner and pointed out the watch yes it is mine i would know it among a thousand how can you ******** it aubrey he immediately gave the number and name of the manufacturer and described the interior tracery not ******** the quantity of jewels mr campbell turned to the proprietor the same gentleman with whom electra had conversed and briefly ************* the circumstances which had occurred in connection with the watch mr brown listened attentively then requested russell to point out the particular one that resembled his he did so and on examination the number date name and all the marks corresponded so exactly that no doubt remained on the ********* mind young man this watch was sold for ninety dollars by a man named rufus turner who lives in new orleans no ### street i will write to him at once and find out if possible how it came into his possession i rather think he had some horses here for sale did he wear green glasses inquired russell of the young man who had purchased the watch yes and had one arm in a sling i saw such a man here about the time my watch was missing after some directions from mr campbell concerning the proper course to be pursued electra drew out her locket saying now russell is not this locket mine yes but where is the miniature what are you going to do with it the miniature is at home but i want to sell the frame and mr brown does not know but that it is another watch case if it is necessary i will swear that it belongs lawfully to you but what do you want to sell it for i should think you would prize it too highly to be willing to part with it i do prize the miniature and would not part with it for any consideration but i want something far more than a gold case to keep it in tell me what you want and i will get it for you whispered her cousin *** am going to sell this frame and i am going to buy it from you said the kindhearted merchant taking it from her hand and weighing it russell and mr campbell left the store and soon after mr brown paid electra several dollars for the locket in half an hour she had purchased a small box of paints a supply of ************ and ******* and returned home happier and prouder than many an empress whose jewels have equalled those of the ****** of **** she had cleared russells character and her hands were pressed over her heart to still its rapturous throbbing many days elapsed before mr turners answer arrived he stated that he had won the watch from cecil watson at a ********* where both were ******* and proved the correctness of his assertion by reference to several persons who were present and who resided in the town russell had suspected cecil from the moment of its disappearance and now provided with both letter and watch and accompanied by mr brown he repaired to mr watsons store russell had been insulted his nature was stern and now he exulted in the power of ********** the son of the man who had wronged him there was no flush on his face but a cold triumphant glitter in his eyes as he approached his former employer and laid watch and letter before him what business have you here growled the merchant trembling before the expression of the boys countenance my business is to clear my character which you have slandered and to fix the disgrace you intended for me on your own son i bring you the proofs of his not my villainy come into the ******** i will see brown another time said watson growing paler each moment no sir you were not so secret in your dealings with me here where you insulted me you shall hear the whole truth read that i suppose the ************ gold piece followed the watch the unfortunate father perused the letter slowly and smothered a groan russell watched him with a keen joy which he might have blushed to acknowledge had he ******** his feelings writhing under his ******** eye mr watson said have you applied to the witnesses referred to yes they are ready to swear that they saw cecil bet turner the watch you did not tell them the circumstances did you no there was an awkward silence broken by mr watson if i retract all that i have said against you and avow your innocence will it satisfy you will you be silent about cecil no rose peremptorily to russells lips but he checked it and the patient teaching of years his mothers precepts and his mothers prayers brought forth their first *********** charity you merit no forbearance at my hands and i came here intending to show you none but on reflection i will not follow your example clear my name before the public and i leave the whole affair with you good morning afraid to trust himself he turned away and joined mr campbell in the office in the afternoon of the same day came a letter from mr hill containing sad news the oculist had operated on mrs aubreys eyes but violent inflammation had ensued he had done all that scientific skill could prompt but feared she would be hopelessly blind at the close of the letter mr hill stated that he would bring her home the following week one november evening just before dark while russell was cutting wood for the *********** the stage stopped at the *********** and he hurried forward to receive his mother in his arms it was a melancholy reunion for a moment the poor sufferers fortitude forsook her and she wept but his caresses soothed her and she followed electra into the house while he brought in the trunk when shawl and bonnet had been removed and electra placed her in the rockingchair the light fell on face and figure and the cousins started at the change that had taken place she was so ghastly pale so very much reduced she told them all that had occurred during the tedious weeks of absence how much she regretted having gone since the trip proved so unsuccessful how much more she deplored the affliction on their account than her own and then from that hour no allusion was ever made to it weeks and months slipped away and total darkness came down on the widow she groped with some difficulty from room to room and electra was compelled to remain at home and watch over her russell had become a great favourite with his ****** employer and when the labours of the office were ended brought home such books as he needed and spent his evenings in study his powers of application and endurance were extraordinary and his progress was in the same ratio as he became more and more absorbed in these pursuits his reserve and *********** increased his employer was particularly impressed by the fact that he never volunteered a remark on any subject and rarely opened his lips except to ask some necessary information in connection with his business he comprehended russells character and quietly facilitated his progress there was no sycophancy on the part of the young man no patronage on that of the employer one afternoon irene tapped lightly at the *********** and entered the kitchen mrs aubrey sat in a low chair close to the fireplace engaged in knitting her smooth neat calico dress and spotless linen collar told that careful hands tended her and the soft auburn hair brushed over her temples showed broad bands of grey as the evening sun shone on it she turned her brown sightless eyes toward the door and asked in a low voice who is it it is only me mrs aubrey irene bent down laid her two hands on the widows and kissed her forehead i am glad to hear your voice irene it has been a long time since you were here yes a good many weeks i know but i could not come are you well your hands and face are cold yes thank you very well i am always cold i believe hugh says i am here are some flowers from the greenhouse i brought them because they are so fragrant and here too are a few oranges from the same place hush dont thank me if you please i wish i could come here oftener i always feel better after being with you mrs aubrey had finished her knitting and sat with her hands folded in her lap the meek face more than usually serene the sightless eyes directed toward her visitor sunshine reflected the bare boards under the window flashed on the tin vessels ranged on the shelves and lingered like a halo around irenes head electra had been drawing at the table in the middle of the room and now sat leaning on her hand watching the two at the fire presently irene approached and began to examine the drawings which were fragmentary except one or two heads and a sketch taken from the bank opposite the falls after some moments passed in looking over them irene addressed the quiet little figure have you been to mr cliftons studio no who is he an artist from new york his health is poor and he is spending the winter south havent you heard of him everybody is having portraits taken he is painting mine ********* would make me sit again though he has a likeness which was painted four years ago i am going down tomorrow for my last sitting and should like very much for you to go with me perhaps mr clifton can give you some valuable hints will you go with great pleasure then i will call for you a little before ten oclock here are some ******* i bought for you a week ago goodbye the following day miss margaret accompanied her to the studio as the carriage approached the *********** irene directed the driver to stop for what asked her aunt electra grey is going with me i promised to call for her she has an extraordinary talent for drawing and i want to introduce her to mr clifton open the door andrew irene are you deranged your father never would forgive you if he knew you associated with those people i cant think of allowing that girl to enter this carriage drive on i must really speak to leonard about your obstinacy in visiting at that stop andrew if you dont choose to ride with electra aunt margaret you may go on alone for either she shall ride or i will walk with her andrew opened the door and she was stepping out when electra appeared in the walk and immediately joined her miss margaret was thoroughly aroused and indignant but thought it best to submit for the time and when irene introduced her friend she took no notice of her whatever except by drawing herself up in one corner and lowering her veil the girls talked during the remainder of the ride and when they reached mr cliftons door ran up the steps together totally unmindful of the august ladys ill humour the artist was standing before an easel which held irenes unfinished portrait and as he turned to greet his visitors electra saw that though thin and pale his face was one of rare beauty and benevolence his brown curling hair hung loosely about his shoulders and an uncommonly long beard of the same silky texture descended almost to his waist he shook hands with irene and looked inquiringly at her companion mr clifton this is miss electra grey whose drawings i mentioned to you last week i wish if you please you would examine some of them when you have leisure electra looked for an instant into his large clear grey eyes as he took her drawings and said he would be glad to assist her and knew that henceforth the tangled path would be smoothed and widened she stood at the back of his chair during the hours sitting and with peculiar interest watched the strokes of his brush as the portrait grew under his practised hand when irene rose the orphan moved away and began to scrutinize the numerous pictures scattered about the room a great joy filled her heart and illumined her face and she waited for the words of encouragement that she felt assured would be spoken the artist looked over her sketches slowly carefully and his eye went back to her brilliant countenance as if to read there answers to ciphers which perplexed him but yet more baffling ************ met him in the deep flashing appealing eyes on the crimson quivering lips on the low full brow with its widely separated black arches evidently the face possessed far more attraction than the drawings and he made her sit down beside him and passed his hand over her head and temples as a professed ************ might preparatory to rendering a chart your sketches are very rough very crude but they also display great power of thought some of them singular beauty of conception and i see from your countenance that you are dissatisfied because the execution falls so far short of the conception let me talk to you candidly you have uncommon talent but the most exalted genius cannot dispense with laborious study think well of all this i have thought of it i am willing to work any number of years i have decided and i am not to be frightened from my purpose i am poor i can barely buy the necessary materials much less the books but i will be an artist yet i have decided sir it is no new whim it has been a bright dream to me all my life and i am determined to realize it amen so let it be then i shall remain here some weeks longer come to me every day at ten oclock and i will instruct you you shall have such books as you need and with perseverance you have nothing to fear he went into the adjoining room and returned with a small volume as he gave it to her with some directions concerning the contents she caught his hand to her lips saying hastily my guardian angel certainly brought you here to spend the winter oh sir i will prove my gratitude for your goodness by showing that i am not unworthy of it i thank you from the very depths of my glad heart as she released his hand and left the studio he found two bright drops on his fingers drops called forth by the most intense joy she had ever known having some commission from her aunt she did not reenter the carriage and after thanking irene for her kindness walked away the ride home was very silent miss margaret sat stiff and icy looking quite insulted while her niece was too much engrossed by other reflections to notice her the latter spent the remainder of the morning in writing to hugh and correcting her french exercises and when summoned to dinner she entered the room expecting a storm a glance sufficed to show her that miss margaret had not yet spoken to her father though it was evident from her countenance that she was about to make what she considered an important revelation the meal passed however without any allusion to the subject and knowing what she had to expect irene immediately withdrew to the library to give her aunt an opportunity of *********** her mind the struggle must come some time and she longed to have it over as soon as possible she threw up the sash seated herself on the broad cedar windowsill and began to work out a sum in ******* nearly a halfhour passed the slamming of the diningroom door was like the first line of foam curling and whitening the sea when the tempest sweeps forward her father stamped into the library and the storm broke over her irene didnt i positively order you to keep away from that aubrey family what do you mean by setting me at defiance in this way you wilful spoiled ********** piece do you suppose i intend to put up with your obstinacy all my life and let you walk ********* over me and my commands you have ******* it long enough my lady if i dont rein you up you will turn your aunt and me out of the house next and invite that precious aubrey crew to take possession your confounded stubbornness will ruin you yet you deserve a good whipping miss i can hardly keep my hands off of you he did not rough hands seized her shoulder jerked her from the windowsill and shook her violently down fell book slate and pencil with a crash down swept the heavy hair blinding her she put it back folded her hands behind her as if for support and looking up at him said in a low steady yet grieved tone i am very sorry you are angry with me father devilish sorry i dare say dont be hypocritical didnt i tell you to keep away from those people dont stand there like a block of stone answer me yes sir but i did not promise to do so i am not hypocritical father you did not promise indeed what do i care for promises it was your duty to obey me i dont think it was father when you refused to give me any reason for avoiding mrs aubrey or her family they are unfortunate but honourable people and being very poor and afflicted i felt sorry for them i cant see how my going there occasionally ***** you or me or anybody else i know very well that you dislike them but you never told me why and i cannot imagine any good reason for it father if i love them why should not i associate with them because i say you shant you tormenting headstrong little imp my father that is no reason reason i will put you where you will have no occasion for reasons oh i can match you you perverse little wretch i am going to send you to a boardingschool do you hear that send you where you will have no aubreys to **** your obstinacy and disobedience where that temper of yours can be ****** how will you relish getting up before day kindling your own fire if you have any making your own bed and living on bread and water i will take you to new york and keep you there till you are grown and learn common sense now get out of my sight with a stamp of rage he pointed to the door hitherto she had stood quite still but now an expression of anguish passed swiftly over her face and she put out her hands appealingly father my father dont send me away please let me stay at home not if i live long enough to take you just as certainly as the sun shines in heaven you will go as soon as your clothes can be made your aunt will have you ready in a week dont open your mouth to me i dont want to hear another word from you take yourself off she picked up her slate and book and left the room the week which succeeded was wretched to the girl for her fathers surveillance prevented her from visiting the cottage even to say adieu to its inmates and no alternative presented itself but to leave for them in the hands of nellie her devoted nurse a note containing a few parting words and assurances of ******** friendship and remembrance the day of departure dawned rainy gloomy and the wind sobbed and wailed down the avenue as irene stood at her window looking out on the lawn where her life had been passed the ************* summoned her away and a halfhour after she saw the lofty columns of the old house fade from view and knew that many months perhaps years must elapse before the ancestral trees of the long avenue would wave again over the head of their young mistress her father sat beside her moody and silent and when the brick wall and arched iron gate vanished from her sight she sank back in one corner and covering her face with her hands smothered a groan and fought desperately with her voiceless anguish day after day electra toiled over her work the rapidity of her progress astonished mr clifton he questioned her concerning the processes she employed in some of her curious combinations but the fragmentary abstracted nature of her conversation during the hours of instruction gave him little satisfactory information his interest in her increased until finally it became absorbing and he gave her all the time she could spare from home the eagerness with which she listened to his directions the facility with which she applied his rules fully repaid him and from day to day he postponed his return to the north reluctant to leave his indefatigable pupil now and then the time of departure was fixed but ere it arrived he wavered and ************** electra knew that his stay had been prolonged beyond his original intention and she dreaded the hour when she should be deprived of his aid and advice though their acquaintance had been so short a strangely strong feeling had grown up in her heart toward him a feeling of clinging tenderness blended with earnest and undying gratitude she knew that he understood her character and appreciated her struggles and it soothed her fierce proud heart in some degree to receive from him those tokens of constant remembrance which she so yearned to have from russell she felt too that she was not regarded as a stranger by the artist she could see his sad eyes brighten at her entrance and detect the tremor in his hand and voice when he spoke of going home his health had improved and the heat of summer had come why did he linger his evenings were often spent at the cottage and even mrs aubrey learned to smile at the sound of his step one morning as electra finished her lesson and rose to go he said slowly as if watching the effect of his words this is the last hour i can give you in two days i return to new york letters of importance came this morning i have waited here too long already are you in earnest this time i am it is absolutely necessary that i should return home mr clifton what shall i do without you suppose you had never seen me then i should not have had to lose you oh sir i need you very much electra child you will conquer your difficulties without assistance from anyone you have nothing to fear yes i know i shall conquer at last but the way would be so much easier if you were only with me i shall miss you more than i can tell you he passed his hand over his short shining hair and mused for a moment as if laying conflicting emotions in the balance she heard his deep laboured breathing and saw the working of the muscles in his pale face when he spoke his voice was husky you are right you need me and i want you always with me we must not be parted electra i say we shall not come to me put your hands in *********** me that you will be my child my pupil i will take you to my mother and we need never be separated you require aid such as cannot be had here in new york you shall have all that you want will you come with me he held her hands in a ******** grasp and looked pleadingly into her astonished countenance a mist gathered before her and she closed her eyes electra will you come she raised her bloodless face stamped with stern resolve and ere the words were pronounced he read his answer in the defiant gleam of her eyes in the hard curved lines of the mouth mr clifton i cannot go with you just now for at present i cannot ought not to leave my aunt helpless as she is it would be cruel ungrateful to desert her but things cannot continue this way much longer and i promise you that as soon as i can i will go to you i want to be with you i want somebody to care for me and i know you will be a kind friend to me always most gratefully will i accept your generous offer as soon as i feel that i can do so he stooped and touched her forehead with his lips my dear electra you are right to remain with her but when she needs you no more i shall expect you to come to me in new york meantime i shall write to you frequently and supply you with such books and materials as you require my pupil i long to have you in my own home remember no matter what happens you have promised yourself to me i shall not forget but he saw her shudder shall i speak to your aunt about this matter before i go no it would only distress her leave it all with me it is late and i must go goodbye sir he promised to see her again before his departure and she walked home with her head bowed and a sharp continual pain gnawing at her heart in the calm peaceful years of ordinary childhood the soul ******* slowly but a volcanic nature like electras subjected to galling trials rapidly hardens and answers every stroke with the metallic ring of age keen susceptibility to joy or pain taught her early that less impressive characters are years in learning and it was ********** true that while yet a mere girl she suffered as ******* as a woman russell knew that a change had come over his cousin but was too constantly engaged too entirely absorbed by his studies to ask or ******* the cause she never watched at the gate for him now never sprang with outstretched arms to meet him never hung over the back of his chair and caressed his hands as formerly when not waiting upon her aunt she was as intent upon her books as he and though invariably kind and unselfish in her conduct toward him she was evidently constrained in his presence as the summer wore on mrs aubreys health failed rapidly and she was confined to her couch one morning when mr campbell the pastor had spent some time in the sickroom praying with the sufferer and administering the sacrament of the lords supper electra followed him to the door leaving russell with his mother the gentle pastor took her hand kindly and looked at her with filling eyes you think my aunt is worse yes my child i think that very soon she will be with her god she will scarcely survive till night she turned abruptly from him and threw herself down across the foot of the bed burying her face in her arms russell sat with his mothers hands in his while she turned her brown eyes toward him and exhorted him to commit himself and his future to the hands of a merciful god electra was not forgotten she advised her to go to a cousin of her mother residing in virginia long before she had written to this lady informing her of her own feebleness and of the girls helpless condition and a kind answer had been returned cordially inviting the orphan to share her home to become an inmate of her house russell could take her to these relatives as soon as possible to all this no reply was made and a few moments later when russell kissed her tenderly and raised her pillow she said faintly if i could look upon your face once more my son it would not be hard to die let me see you in heaven my dear dear boy these were the last words and soon after a stupor fell upon her hour after hour passed mrs campbell came and sat beside the bed and the three remained silent now and then lifting bowed heads to look at the sleeper the autumn day died slowly as the widow and when the clock ****** out the sunset hour russell rose and putting back the window curtains stooped and laid his face close to his mothers no pulsation stirred the folds over the heart or the soft bands of hair on the blueveined temples the still mouth had breathed its last sigh and the meek brown eyes had opened in eternity the day bore her away on its wings and as russell touched the icy cheek a despairing cry rolled through the silent cottage oh mother my own precious dead mother falling on his knees he laid his head on her pillow and when kind friendly hands bore her into the adjoining room he knelt there still unconscious of what passed knowing only that the keenest of many blows had fallen that the last and bitterest vial of sorrows had been emptied at the window stood electra pressing her face against the frame looking out into the moaning struggling night striving to read the mystic characters dimly traced on the ******* hurrying clouds as the reckless winds parted their wan folds she shrank away from the window and approached her cousin oh russell say something to me or i shall die it was the last wail she ever suffered to escape her in his presence he raised his head and put his hand on her forehead but the trembling lips refused their office and as she looked up at him tears rolled slowly down and fell on her cheek she would have given worlds to mingle her tears with his but no moisture came to her burning eyes and there these two soon to separate passed the remaining hours of that long wretched night of watching the stormy day lifted her pale mournful face at last and with it came the dreary patter and sobbing of autumn rain making it doubly harrowing to commit the precious form to its long last restingplace electra stood up beside her cousin and folded her arms together russell i am not going to that cousin in virginia i could owe my bread and clothes to you but not to her she has children and i do not intend to live on her charity i know you and i must part the sooner the better i would not be willing to burden you a day longer i am going to fit myself to work profitably mr clifton offered me a home in his house said his mother was lonely and would be rejoiced to have me that letter which i received last week contained one from her also urging me to come and russell i am going to new york to study with him as long as i need instruction i did not tell aunt of this because i knew it would grieve her to think that i would be thrown with strangers and having fully determined to take this step thought it best not to distress her by any allusion to it you know it is my own affair and i can decide it better than anyone else so you prefer utter strangers to your relatives and friends ties of blood are not the strongest strangers step in to aid where relatives sometimes stand aloof and watch a fatal struggle remember irene who is nearer to you she or your grandfather such a friend mr clifton is to me and go to him i will at all hazards drop the subject if you please he looked at her an instant then turned once more to his mothers face and his cousin left them together the day was so inclement that only mr and mrs campbell and russells employer attended the funeral these few followed the gentle sleeper and laid her down to rest till the star of eternity dawns and the storm chanted a long thrilling requiem as the wet mound rose above the coffin the kindhearted pastor and his wife urged the orphans to remove to their house for a few days at least until the future could be mapped but they preferred to meet and battle at once with the spectre which they knew stood waiting in the desolate cottage at midnight a heavy sleep fell on russell who had thrown himself upon his mothers couch and softly spreading a shawl over him electra sat down by the dying fire on the kitchen hearth and looked her future in the face a few days sufficed to prepare for her journey and a gentleman from new york who had met her cousin in mr campbells office consented to take charge of her and commit her to mr cliftons hands the scanty furniture was sent to an *********** and a piece of board nailed to the ******** announced that the cottage was for rent russell decided to take his meals at a boardinghouse and occupy a small room over the office which mr campbell had placed at his disposal on the same day the cousins bade adieu to the only spot they had called home for many years and as russell locked the door and joined electra his melancholy face expressed far better than words could have done the pain it cost him to quit the house where his idolized mother had lived suffered and died mr ****** was waiting for electra at the hotel whither the stage had been driven for passengers and as she drew near and saw her trunk among others piled on top she stopped and grasped russells hand between both hers a livid ******** settled on her face while her wild black eyes fastened on his features she might never see him again he was far dearer to her than her life how could she bear to leave him to put hundreds of miles between that face and her own an icy hand clutched her heart as she gazed into his deep sad beautiful eyes his feeling for her was a steady serene affection such as brothers have for dear young sisters and to give her up now filled him with genuine earnest sorrow electra it is very hard to tell you goodbye you are all i have left and i shall be desolate indeed when you are away but the separation will not be long i trust in a few years we shall be able to have another home and where my home is yours must always be write to me often and believe that i shall do all that a brother could for you mr ****** is waiting goodbye darling he bent down to kiss her and the strained tortured look that greeted him he never forgot she put her arms around his neck and clung to him like a shivering weed driven by rough winds against a stone wall he removed her clasping arms and led her to mr ****** but as the latter offered to assist her into the stage she drew back that russell might perform that office while he almost lifted her to a seat her fingers refused to release his and he was forced to disengage them other passengers entered and the door was closed russell stood near the window and said gently pitying her suffering electra wont you say goodbye she leaned out till her cheek touched his and in a hoarse tone uttered the fluttering words oh russell russell goodbye may god have mercy on me as tall ********* weeds and rank ******* grass close over and crush out slender pure odorous ********* on a hillside so the defects of irenes character swiftly strengthened and developed in the new atmosphere in which she found herself the school was on an extensive scale thoroughly fashionable and thither pupils were sent from every section of the united states as regarded educational advantages the institution was *************** the professors were considered unsurpassed in their several departments and every provision was made for thorough tuition but what a ***** reigned outside of the recitation room one hundred and forty girls to spend their recesses in envy ridicule malice and detraction anxious to shake off the loneliness which so heavily oppressed her irene at first mingled freely among her companions but she soon became disgusted with the conduct and opinions of the majority and endeavoured to find quiet in her own room early in winter a new pupil a day scholar joined her class she resided in new york and very soon a strong friendship sprang up between them louisa young was about irenes age very pretty very gentle and winning in her manners she was the daughter of an affluent merchant and was blessed in the possession of parents who strove to rear their children as christian parents should louisas attachment was very warm and lasting and ere long she insisted that her friend should visit her weary of the school the latter gladly availed herself of the invitation and one friday afternoon she accompanied louisa home the mansion was almost palatial and as irene entered the ******************* parlours her own southern home rose vividly before her mother this is miss huntingdon mrs young received her cordially and as she held the gloved hand and kindly expressed her pleasure at meeting her daughters friend the girls heart gave a quick bound of joy come upstairs and put away your bonnet in louisas beautiful room the two sat talking of various things till the teabell rang mr youngs greeting was scarcely less friendly than his wifes and as they seated themselves at the table the stranger felt at home for the first time in new york where is brother asked louisa glancing at the vacant seat opposite her own he has not come home yet i wonder what keeps him there he is now in the hall answered the mother a moment after he entered and took his seat he was tall rather handsome and looked about thirty his sister presented her friend and with a hasty bow he fastened his eyes on her face probably he was unconscious of the steadiness of his gaze but irene became restless under his fixed earnest eye and perceiving her embarrassment mrs young said harvey where have you been dr melville called here for you at four oclock said you had made some engagement with him yes mother we have been visiting together this afternoon withdrawing his eyes he seemed to fall into a reverie and took no part in the conversation that ensued as the party adjourned to the sittingroom he paused on the rug and leaned his elbow on the mantel louisa lingered and drew near he passed his arm around her shoulders and looked affectionately down at her go to your friend and when you are at a loss for conversation bring her to my study to see those sketches of ******* and ******* he passed on to his work and she to the sittingroom he read industriously for some time occasionally pausing to ******** and once or twice he raised his head and listened a light tap at the door was followed by the entrance of the two girls irene came very reluctantly fearful of intruding but he rose and placed a chair for her close to his own assuring her that he was glad to see her there louisa found the portfolio and bringing it to the table began to exhibit its treasures the two leaned over it and as irene sat resting her cheek on her hand the beauty of her face and figure was clearly revealed harvey remained silent watching the changing expression of the visitors countenance and once he put out his hand to touch the hair floating over the back and arms of her chair gradually his still heart stirred his brow flushed and a new light burned in the deep clear eyes he told her of his visit to the old world of its mournful ruins its decaying glories of the lessons he learned there the sad but precious memories he brought back and as he talked time passed *********** forgot her embarrassment they were strangers no longer the clock struck ten louisa rose at once thank you harvey for giving us so much of your time father and mother will be waiting for you yes i will join you at once she led the way back to the sittingroom and a few moments after to irenes great surprise the student came in and sitting down before the table opened the bible and read a chapter then all knelt and he prayed there was a strange spell on the visitor in all this there was something so unexpected it was the first time she had ever knelt around the family altar and as she rose that sittingroom seemed suddenly converted into a temple of worship mutual good nights were exchanged and as irene turned toward the young minister he held out his hand she gave him hers and he pressed it gently saying i trust this is the first of many pleasant evenings which we shall spend together thank you sir i hope so too for i have not been so happy since i left home he smiled and she walked on louisa how came your brother to be a minister asked irene when they had reached their apartment when he was a boy he said he intended to preach and father never ********* him harvey is a singular ***** silent so equable so cold in his manner and yet he has a warm heart he has declined two calls since his ordination dr ********* health is very poor and harvey frequently fills his pulpit i know you will like him when you know him well everybody loves harvey the ********** of the weather confined the girls to the house the following day harvey was absent at breakfast and at dinner the chair opposite irenes was still vacant the afternoon wore away and at dusk louisa opened the piano and began to play ********* home sweet home somebody took a seat near irene and though the room was dim she knew the tall form and the touch of his hand good evening miss irene we have had a gloomy day how have you and louisa spent it not very profitably i dare say though it has not appeared at all gloomy to me have you been out in the snow yes my work has been sad i buried a mother and child this afternoon and have just come from a house of orphanage and grief it is a difficult matter to realize how many aching hearts there are in this great city our mahogany doors shut out the wail that hourly goes up to god from the thousand sufferers in our midst as he talked she lifted her beautiful eyes and looked steadily at him and he thought that of all the lovely things he had ever seen that face was the most peerless she drew closer to him and said earnestly you do not seem to me a very happy man there you mistake me i presume there are few happier persons countenance is not a faithful index then you look so exceedingly grave do you suppose that gravity of face is incompatible with sunshine in the heart he smiled ************* as he spoke and without a moments thought she laid her delicate hand in his mr young i want somebody to advise me very often i am at a loss about my duty and having no one to consult either do nothing at all or that which i should not if it will not trouble you too much i should like to bring my difficulties to you sometimes and get you to direct me if you will only talk frankly to me as you do to louisa oh i will be very grateful have you no brother i am an only child you would like a brother however yes sir above all things take care you express yourself strongly if you can fancy me for a brother consider me such when monday morning came and she was obliged to return to school irene reluctantly bade farewell to the new friends she knew that in conformity to the unalterable regulations of **** ******* she could only leave the institution once a month and the prospect of this long interval between her visits was by no means cheering harvey assisted her into the carriage i shall send some books in a day or two and if you are troubled about anything before i see you again write me a note by louisa i would call to see you occasionally if you were boarding anywhere else good morning miss irene do not forget that i am your brother so long as you stay in new york or need one the books were not forgotten they arrived the ensuing week and his selection satisfied her that he perfectly understood what kind of aid she required at the close of the next month instead of accompanying louisa home irene was suffering with severe cold and too much indisposed to quit the house this was a grievous disappointment but she bore it bravely and went on with her studies what a dreary isolation in the midst of numbers of her own age it was a ******** that galled her and more than once she implored her fathers permission to return home his replies were positive ******* and after a time she ceased to expect release until the prescribed course should be ended thus another month dragged itself away on friday morning louisa was absent irene felt anxious and distressed perhaps she was ill something must have happened as the day pupils were dismissed she started back to her own room heartsick because of this second disappointment a few minutes after a servant knocked at the door and informed her that a gentleman wished to see her in the parlour i am so glad to see you mr young louisa is not sick i hope i came for you in louisas place she is not well enough to quit her room did you suppose that i intended leaving you here for another month i was rather afraid you had forgotten me the prospect was gloomy ten minutes ago it seems a long time since i was with you she stood close to him looking gladly into his face unconscious of the effect of her words you sent me no note all this time why not i was afraid of troubling you and besides i would rather tell you what i want you to know miss irene the carriage is at the door i am a patient man and can wait half an hour if you have any preparation to make in much less time she joined him equipped for the ride and took her place beside him in the carriage as they reached his fathers door and he assisted her out she saw him look at her very searchingly it is time that you had a little fresh air you are not quite yourself louisa is in her room run up to her she found her friend suffering with sore throat and was startled at the appearance of her flushed cheeks mrs young sat beside her and after most cordial greetings the latter resigned her seat and left them ********* upon her daughter the necessity of remaining quiet mother was almost afraid for you to come but i teased and coaxed for permission told her that even if i had the scarlet fever you had already had it and would run no risk harvey says it is not scarlet fever at all and he persuaded mother to let him go after you he always has things his own way though he brings it about so quietly that nobody would even suspect him of being ********** harvey is a good friend of yours irene i am glad to hear it he is certainly very kind to me but recollect you are not to talk much let me talk to you the following morning found louisa much better and irene and the mother spent the day in her room late in the afternoon the minister came in and talked to his sister for some moments then turned to his mother mother i am going to take this visitor of yours down to the library louisa has monopolized her long enough come miss irene you shall join them again at tea he led the way and she followed very willingly placing her in a chair before the fire he drew another to the rug and seating himself said just as if speaking to louisa what have you been doing these two months what is it that clouds your face my little sister ah sir i am so weary of that school you dont know what a relief it is to come here it is rather natural that you should feel homesick it is a fierce ordeal for a child like you to be thrust so far from home i am not homesick now i believe i have in some degree become accustomed to the separation from my father but i am growing so different from what i used to be so different from what i expected it grieves me to know that i am changing for the worse but somehow i cant help it i make good resolutions in the morning before i leave my room and by noon i manage to break all of them the girls try me and i lose my patience when i am at home nothing of this kind ever troubles me miss irene yours is not a clinging dependent disposition if i have rightly understood your character you have never been accustomed to lean upon others after relying on yourself so long why yield to ******** now with years should grow the power the determination to do the work you find laid out for you it is precisely because i know how very poorly i have managed myself thus far that i have no confidence in my own powers for future emergencies either i have lived alone too long or else not long enough i rather think the last if they had only suffered me to act as i wished i should have been so much better at home oh sir i am not the girl i was eight months ago i knew how it would be when they sent me here some portentous cloud seems lowering over your future what is it you ought to be a gleeful girl full of happy hopes she sank farther back in her chair to escape his searching gaze and drooped her face lower yes yes i know i ought but people cant always shut their eyes shut their eyes to what various coming troubles mr young his lip curled slightly and replacing the book on the table he said as if speaking rather to himself than to her the heart ******* his own bitterness and a stranger doth not *********** with his joy you are not a stranger sir i see you are disposed to consider me such i thought i was your brother but no matter after a time all will be well she looked puzzled and as the teabell summoned them he merely added i do not wonder you are a shy child but you will soon learn to understand me you will come to me with all your sorrows during the remainder of this visit she saw him no more louisa recovered rapidly and when she asked for her brother on sabbath evening mrs young said he was to preach twice that day monday morning arrived and irene returned to school with a heavy heart fearing that she had wounded him but a few days after louisa brought her a book and brief note of kind words one saturday morning she sat quite alone in her small room the week had been specially painful and wearied in soul the girl laid her head down on her folded arms and thought of her home in the far south a loud rap startled her from this painful reverie and ere she could utter the stereotyped come in louisa sprang to her side i have come for you irene have obtained permission from dr for you to accompany us to the academy of design put on your bonnet harvey is waiting in the reception room we shall have a charming day ah louisa you are all very kind to recollect me so constantly it will give me great pleasure to go when they joined the minister irene fancied he received her coldly and as they walked on he took no part in the conversation the annual exhibition had just opened the rooms were thronged with visitors and the hushed tones swelled to a monotonous hum some stood in groups *********** eagerly on certain pictures others occupied the seats and leisurely scanned now the paintings now the crowd furnished with a catalogue the girls moved slowly on while mr young pointed out the prominent beauties or defects of the works exhibited they made the circuit of the room and began a second tour when their attention was attracted by a girl who stood in one corner with her hands clasped behind her she was gazing very intently on an ******** and though her face was turned toward the wall the posture bespoke most unusual interest irene looked at her an instant and held her breath she had seen only one other head which resembled ******* knew the purplish waving hair and gliding up to her she exclaimed electra electra grey the orphan turned and they were locked in a tight embrace oh irie i am so glad to see you i have been here so long and looked for you so often that i had almost ********* whenever i walk down broadway whenever i go out anywhere i look at every face peep into every bonnet hoping to find you oh i am so glad do come and see me ******** i must go **** promised where do you live i will go home with you now i am not going home immediately mr cliftons house is no ## west street come this afternoon with a long warm pressure of hands they parted and irene stood looking after the graceful figure till it glided out of sight in the name of wonder who is that you two have been the observed of all observers ejaculated the impulsive louisa that is my old schoolmate and friend of whom i once spoke to you i had no idea that she was in new york she is a poor orphan are you ready to return home this episode has evidently driven pictures out of your head for today said mr young who had endeavoured to screen her from observation yes quite ready to go though i have enjoyed the morning very much indeed thanks to your kindness soon after they reached home louisa was called into the parlour to see a young friend and as mrs young was absent irene found it rather lonely upstairs she thought of a new volume of travels which she had noticed on the ********* as they entered and started down to get it about halfway of the flight of steps she caught her foot in the ********* where one of the rods chanced to be loose and despite her efforts to grasp the railing fell to the floor of the hall crushing one arm under her the *********** was thrown open instantly and the minister came out she lay motionless and he bent over her irene where are you hurt speak to me he raised her in his arms and placed her on the sofa in the sittingroom the motion produced great pain and she groaned and shut her eyes a crystal vase containing some exquisite perfume stood on his mothers ********* and pouring a portion of its contents in his palm he bathed her forehead acute suffering distorted her features and his face grew pallid as her own while he watched her taking her hand he repeated irene my darling tell me how you are hurt she looked at him and said with some difficulty my ankle pains me very much and i believe my arm is broken i cant move it thank god you are not killed he kissed her then turned away and despatched a servant for a physician he summoned louisa and inquired *********** for his mother no one knew whither she had gone it would not do to wait for her he stood by the sofa and prepared the necessary bandages while his sister could only cry over and caress the sufferer when the physician came the white dimpled arm was bared and he discovered that the bone was broken the setting was extremely painful but she lay with closed eyes and firmly compressed lips uttering no sound giving no token of the torture save in the ********* of her forehead they bound the arm tightly and then the doctor said the ankle was badly strained and swollen but there was luckily no ******** he gave minute directions to the minister and withdrew praising the patients remarkable fortitude louisa would talk and her brother sent her off to prepare a room for her friend i think i had better go back to the institution mr young it will be a long time before i can walk again and i wish you would have me carried back dr will be uneasy and will prefer my returning as father left me in his charge she tried to rise but sank back on the pillow hush hush you will stay where you are little cripple i am only thankful you happened to be here he smoothed the folds of her hair from her temples and for the first time played with the curls he had so often before been tempted to touch she looked so slight so childish with her head nestled against the pillow that he forgot she was almost sixteen forgot everything but the beauty of her pale face and bent over her with an expression of the tenderest love she was suffering too much to notice his countenance and only felt that he was very kind and gentle mrs young came in very soon and heard with the deepest solicitude of what had occurred irene again requested to be taken to the school fearing that she would cause too much trouble during her long confinement to the house but mrs young stopped her arguments with kisses and would listen to no such arrangements she would trust to no one but herself to nurse the bruised southern lily having seen that all was in readiness she insisted on carrying her guest to the room adjoining louisas and opening into her own mr young had gone to boston the day before and turning to her son she said harvey as your father is away you must take irene upstairs i am not strong enough be careful that you do not hurt her she led the way and bending down he whispered my little sister put this uninjured arm around my neck ******** i shall carry you as easily as if you were in a cradle he held her firmly and as he bore her up the steps the white face lay on his bosom and the golden hair floated against his cheek if she had looked at him then she would have seen more than he intended that anyone should know for young and free from vanity though she was it was impossible to mistake the expression of the eyes riveted upon her mrs young wrote immediately to mr huntingdon and explained the circumstances which had made his daughter her guest for some weeks at least assuring him that he need indulge no apprehension whatever on her account as she would nurse her as tenderly as a mother could ********* by the ****** irene took little notice of what passed except when roused by the pain consequent upon dressing the ankle louisa went to school as usual but her mother rarely left their guest and after mr youngs return he treated her with all the affectionate consideration of a parent several days after the occurrence of the accident irene turned toward the minister who stood talking to his mother your constant kindness ********* me to ask a favour of you which i think you will scarcely deny me i am very anxious to see the friend whom i so unexpectedly met at the academy of design here is a card containing her address will you spare me the time to bring her here today i shall be very much obliged to you very well i will go after her as soon as i have fulfilled a previous engagement what is her name electra grey did you notice her face yes but why do you ask because i think she resembles your mother she resembles far more an old portrait hanging in my room i remarked it as soon as i saw her he seemed lost in thought and immediately after left the room an hour later irenes listening ear detected the opening and closing of the hall door there is electra on the steps i hear her voice will you please open the door mrs young laid down her work and rose to comply but harvey ushered the stranger in and then retired the lady of the house looked at the newcomer and a startled expression came instantly into her countenance she made a step forward and paused irresolute mrs young allow me to introduce my friend miss electra grey electra bowed and mrs young exclaimed grey grey electra grey and so like robert oh it must be so child who are you where are your parents she approached and put her hand on the girls shoulders while a hopeful light kindled in her eyes i am an orphan madam from the south my father died before my birth my mother immediately after was your fathers name robert where was he from his name was enoch r gray i dont know what his middle name was he came originally from pennsylvania i believe oh i knew that i could not be mistaken my brothers child roberts child she threw her arms around the astonished girl and strained her to her heart there must be some mistake madam i never heard that i had relatives in new york oh child call me aunt i am your fathers sister we called him by his middle name robert and for eighteen years have heard nothing of him sit down here and let me tell you the circumstances your father was the youngest of three children and in his youth gave us great distress by his ******** he ran away from college and went to sea after an absence of three years he returned almost a wreck of his former self my mother had died during his long voyage to the south sea islands and father who believed him to have been the remote cause of her death for her health failed soon after he left upbraided him most harshly and unwisely his reproaches drove poor robert to desperation and without giving us any clue he left home as suddenly as before whither he went we never knew father was so incensed that he entirely ************ him but at his death when the estate was divided my brother william and i decided that we would take only what we considered our proportion and we set apart onethird for robert we advertised for several years and could hear nothing of him and at the end of the fifth year william divided that remaining third oh my dear child i am so glad to find you out but where have you been all this time where did robert die she held the orphans hand and made no attempt to conceal the tears that rolled over her cheeks electra gave her a detailed account of her life from the time when she was taken to her uncle mr aubrey at the age of four months till the death of her aunt and her removal to new york and roberts child has been in want while we knew not of her existence oh electra you shall have no more sorrow that we can shield you from i loved your father very devotedly and i shall love his orphan quite as dearly come to me let me be your mother let me repair the wrong of bygone years she folded her arms around the graceful young form and sobbed aloud while irene found it difficult to repress her own tears of sympathy and joy that her friend had found such relatives of the three electra was ******* though glad to meet with her fathers family she knew better than they that this circumstance could make little alteration in her life and therefore when mrs young had left the room to acquaint her husband and son with the discovery she had made electra sat down beside her friends sofa just as she would have done two hours before i am so glad for your sake that you are to come and live here until you know them all as well as i do you cannot properly appreciate your good fortune said irene raising herself on her elbow yes i am very glad to meet my aunt returned electra ********* and then she added earnestly i dont know that i ought to talk about things that should have been buried before you were born but you probably know something of what happened we found out after you left why you were so suddenly sent off to boardingschool and you can have no idea how much my poor aunt was distressed at the thought of having caused your banishment irene your father hated her and of course you know it but do you know why no i never could imagine any adequate cause well i can tell you before aunt amys marriage your father loved her and to please her parents she accepted him she was miserable because she was very much attached to my uncle and asked mr huntingdon to release her from the engagement he declined and finding that her parents ***** with him she left home and married against their wishes they adopted a distant relative and never gave her a cent your father never forgave her he had great influence with the governor and she went to him and entreated him to aid her in procuring a pardon for her husband he repulsed her cruelly and used his influence against my uncle she afterwards saw a letter which he wrote to the governor urging him to withhold a pardon now you have the key to his hatred now you understand why he wrote you nothing concerning us not even aunt amys coffin could shut in his hate irene i must go home now for they will wonder what has become of me i will see you again soon she was detained by her aunt and presented to the remainder of the family and it was arranged that mr and mrs young should visit her the ensuing day while they talked over the teatable of the ********** harvey went slowly upstairs and knocked at irenes door louisa was chattering *********** about her cousin and sending her down to her tea he took her seat beside the sofa irene lay with her fingers over her eyes and he said gently you see that i am wiser than you irene i knew that it would do you no good to have company next time be advised it was not electra that harmed me then you admit that you have been harmed no i am lowspirited tonight i believe that is all he opened the ******* of which she was particularly fond and began to read for a while she listened and in her interest forgot her forebodings but after a time her long silky lashes swept her cheeks and she slept the minister laid down the volume and watched the pure girlish face noted all its witching loveliness and thought of the homage which it would win her in coming years he knew as he sat watching her slumber that he loved her above everything on earth that she wielded a power none had ever possessed ********** his heart was indissolubly linked with hers he had wrestled with this infatuation had stationed himself on the platform of common sense and railed at and ridiculed this piece of folly his clear cool reason gave solemn verdict against the ***************** heart but not one pulsation had been restrained as he sat looking down at her a mighty barrier rose between them his future had long been ************** called him to the rude huts of the far west thither pointed the finger of destiny and thither at all hazards he would go he thought that he had habituated himself to sacrifices but the spirit of selfabnegation was scarcely equal to this trial reason taught him that the **************** child of southern climes would never suit him for a companion in the pioneer life which he had marked out he folded his arms tightly over his chest and resolved to go promptly the gaslight flashed on irenes hair as it hung over the side of the sofa he stooped and pressed his lips to the floating curls and went down to the library smiling grimly at his own folly without delay he wrote two letters and was dating a third when his mother came in placing a chair for her he laid down his pen i am glad to see you mother i want to have a talk with you about what ******** anxious look settled on her face about my leaving you and going west i have decided to start next week oh my son how can you bring such grief upon me surely there is work enough for you to do here without your tearing yourself from us yes mother work enough but hands enough also without mine these are the sunny slopes of the vineyard and ********* crowd to till them but there are cold shadowy barren nooks and corners that equally demand cultivation there the lines have fallen to me and there i go to my work i have delayed my departure too long already oh harvey have you fully determined on this step yes my dear mother fully determined to go it is very hard for me to give up my only son i cant say that i will reconcile myself to this separation but you are old enough to decide your own future and i suppose i ought not to urge you for months i have opposed your resolution now i will not longer *********** oh harvey it makes my heart ache to part with you if you were married i should be better satisfied but to think of you in your loneliness she laid her head on his shoulder and wept the minister compressed his lips firmly an instant then replied i always told you that i should never marry i shall be too constantly occupied to sit down and feel lonely now mother i must finish my letters if you please for they should go by the earliest mail the artist stood at the window watching for his pupils return it was the late afternoon hour which they were wont to spend in reading and her absence annoyed him as he rested carelessly against the window his graceful form was displayed to great advantage and the long brown hair dropped about a classical face of almost feminine beauty the delicacy of his features was enhanced by the extreme pallor of his complexion and it was apparent that close application to his profession had made sad inroads on a constitution never very robust a certain listlessness of manner a sort of ********* seemed characteristic but when his pupil came in and laid aside her bonnet the expression of ennui vanished and he threw himself on a sofa looking infinitely relieved she drew near and without hesitation acquainted him with the discovery of her relatives in new york he listened in painful surprise and ere she had concluded sprang up i understand they will want to take you will urge you to share their home of wealth but electra you wont leave me surely you wont leave me he put his hands on her shoulders and she knew from his quick irregular breathing that the thought of separation greatly distressed him my aunt has not explicitly invited me to reside with her though i inferred from her manner that she confidently expected me to do so irene also spoke of it as a settled matter you will not allow me to persuade you oh child tell me at once you will never leave me mr clifton we must part some day i cannot always live here you know before very long i must go out and earn my bread never while i live when i offered you a home i expected it to be a permanent one i intended to adopt you here if you choose you may work and earn a reputation but away from me among strangers never electra you forget you gave yourself to me once she looked into his eyes and with a womans quick perception read all the truth in an instant her countenance changed painfully she stooped touched his hand with her lips and exclaimed thank you a thousand times my friend my father for your interest in and your unvarying unparalleled kindness to me all the gratitude and affection which a child could give to a parent i shall always cherish toward you since it annoys you we will say no more about the future let the years take care of themselves as they come will you promise me positively that you will not go to your aunt yes i have never seriously entertained the thought she escaped from his hands and lighting the gas applied herself to her books for the next hour if irene found the restraint of boardingschool irksome the separation from russell was wellnigh intolerable to electra at first she had seemed plunged in lethargy but after a time this mood gave place to restless unceasing activity like one trying to flee from something painful she rushed daily to her work and regretted when the hours of darkness consigned her to reflection mrs clifton was quite aged and though uniformly gentle and affectionate toward the orphan there was no common ground of ************ on which they could meet to a proud exacting nature like electras mr cliftons constant manifestations of love and sympathy were very soothing writhing under the consciousness of her cousins indifference she turned eagerly to receive the tokens of affection showered upon her she knew that his happiness centred in her and vainly fancied that she could feed her hungry heart with his adoration but by degrees she realized that these husks would not satisfy her and a singular sensation of mingled gratitude and impatience arose whenever he caressed her mrs clifton was a rigid roman catholic her son a *********** in the broadest significance of the term if one might judge from the selections that adorned his library shelves but deep in his soul was the *********** of a mystical creed which gradually unfolded itself to electra it was late at night when electra retired to her room and sat down to collect her thoughts after the unexpected occurrences of the day more than one discovery had been made since the sunrise which she awoke so early to study she had found relatives and an opportunity of living luxuriously but in the midst of this beautiful bouquet of surprises a serpents head peered out at her mr clifton loved her not as a teacher his pupil not as guardian loves ward not as parent loves child perhaps he had not intended that she should know it so soon but his eyes had betrayed the secret she saw perfectly how matters stood this then had prompted him from the first to render her assistance he had resolved to make her his wife nothing less would content him she twisted her white fingers in her hair and gazed vacantly down on the carpet and gradually the rich crimson blood sank out of her face she held his life in the hollow of her hand and this she well knew death hung over him like the sword of damocles she had been told that any violent agitation or grief would bring on the hemorrhage which he so much dreaded and although he seemed stronger and better than usual the ********* nature of his disease gave her little hope that he would ever be robust to ***** ignorance of his real feelings for her would prove but a temporary ********* the time must inevitably come before long when he would put aside this veil and set the truth before her how should she meet ***** should she evade him accept the home which mrs young would offer her and leave him to suffer briefly to sink swiftly into the tomb no her fathers family had cast him most unjustly off withholding his ********* and now she scorned to receive one cent of the money which his father was unwilling that he should enjoy beside who loved her as well as henry clifton she owed more to him than to any living being it would be the part of an ingrate to leave him it was cowardly to shrink from ******** the debt but the thought of being his wife froze her blood and heavy drops gathered on her brow as she endeavoured to reflect upon this possibility a feeling of unconquerable repulsion sprang up in her heart nerving ******** her against his affection with a strange instantaneous reaction she thought with loathing of his words of endearment how could she endure them in future yet how reject without wounding him one and only one path of escape presented ******* path of measureless joy she lifted her hands and murmured russell russell save me from this when mr and mrs young visited the studio the following day and urged the orphans removal to their house she gently but resolutely declined their generous offer expressing an affectionate gratitude toward her teacher and a determination not to leave him at least for the present mrs young was much distressed and adduced every argument of which she was mistress but her niece remained firm and finding their entreaties fruitless mr young said that he would immediately take the necessary steps to secure robert greys portion of the estate to his daughter electra sat with her hand nestled in her aunts but when this matter was alluded to she rose and said proudly no sir let the estate remain just as it is i will never accept one cent my grandfather on his deathbed excluded my father from any portion of it and since he willed it so even so it shall be i have no legal claim to a dollar and i will never receive one from your generosity it was the will of the dead that you and my uncle william should inherit the whole and as far as i am concerned have it you shall i am poor i know so were my parents poverty they bequeathed as my birthright and even as they lived without aid from my grandfather so will i it is very noble and generous in you after the expiration of nearly twenty years to be willing to divide with the orphan of the outcast but i will not cannot allow you to do so i fully appreciate and most cordially thank you both for your goodness but i am young and strong and i expect to earn my living mr clifton and his mother want me to remain in his house until i finish my studies and i gratefully accept his kind offer nay aunt dont let it trouble you so i shall visit you very frequently she has all of roberts fierce obstinacy i see it in her eyes hear it ringing in the tones of her voice take care child it ruined your father said mrs young sorrowfully you should remember electra that an orphan girl needs a protector such i would fain prove myself as mr young spoke he took one of her hands and drew her to him she turned quickly and laid the other on the artists arm i have one here sir a protector as true and kind as my own father could be she understood the flash of his eyes and his proud smile as he assured her relatives that he would guard her from harm and want so long as he lived or as she remained under his care she knew he regarded this as a tacit sealing of the old compact and she had no inclination to ********* him at this juncture urging her to visit them as often as possible and extending the invitation to mr clifton the youngs withdrew evidently much disappointed and as the door closed behind them electra felt that the circle of doom was ********* around her mr clifton approached her but averting her head she lifted the damask curtain that divided the parlour from the studio and effected her retreat dreading to meet his ************* off the evil day as long as ************** to trample the serpent that trailed after her from that hour you are better today mother tells me yes thank you my foot is much better you have not been up to see me for two days irene sat in an easy chair by the open window and the minister took a seat near her i have not forgotten you in the interim however as he spoke he laid a bouquet of choice flowers in her lap she bent over them with eager delight and held out one hand saying oh thank you how very kind you are these remind me of the greenhouse at home they are the most beautiful i have seen in new york irene you look sober today come cheer up i dont want to carry that grave expression away with me i want to remember your face as i first saw it ********** what do you mean are you going to leave home yes tomorrow i bid farewell to new york for a long time i am going to the west to take charge of a church oh mr young surely you are not in earnest you cannot intend to separate yourself from your family she dropped her flowers and leaned forward yes i have had it in contemplation for more than a year and recently i have decided to remove at once he saw the great sorrow written in her countenance the quick flutter of her lip the large drops that dimmed the violet eyes and gathered on the long golden lashes and far sweeter than the ****** harps was the broken voice what shall i do without you who will encourage and advise me when you go she leaned her forehead on her hands and a tear slid down and rested on her chin the sun was setting and the crimson light flooding the room bathed her with glory spreading a halo around her he held his breath and gazed upon the drooping figure and bewitching face and in after years when his dark hair had grown silvery grey he remembered the lovely sunlit vision that so entranced him leaving an indelible image on heart and brain he gently removed the hands and holding them in his said in the measured low tone so indicative of suppressed emotion irene my friend you attach too much importance to the aid which i might render you you know your duty and i feel assured will not require to be reminded of it henceforth our paths diverge widely i go to a distant section of our land there to do my fathers work and ere long having completed the prescribed course you will return to your southern home and take the position assigned you in society thus in all human probability we shall meet no more for oh sir dont say that you will come back to visit your family and then i shall see you that is scarcely probable but we will not discuss it now there is however a channel of communication for separated friends and of this we must avail ourselves i shall write to you from western wilds and letters from you will most pleasantly ripple the monotonous life i expect to lead cant you stay longer and talk to me said irene as he rose no i promised to address the street sabbathschool children tonight and must look over my notes before i go there was no ************ in his tone no trace of emotion as he stood up before her irene was deeply moved and when she essayed to thank him found it impossible to pronounce her words tears were gliding down her cheeks he put back the hair and taking the face softly in his palms looked long and earnestly at its fascinating beauty the great glistening blue eyes gazed into his and the silky lashes and rich scarlet lips trembled he felt the hot blood surging like a ******** in his veins and his heart rising in fierce rebellion at the stern interdict which he saw fit to lay upon it but no token of all this came to the cool calm surface goodbye irene may god bless you my dear little friend he drew the face close to his own as though he would have kissed her but forbore and merely raising her hands to his lips turned and left the room verily greater is he that ****** his own spirit than he that ****** a city he left before breakfast the ensuing morning bearing his secret with him having given no intimation by word or look of the struggle which his resolution cost him once his mother had fancied that he felt more than a friendly interest in their guest but the absolute repose of his countenance and grave serenity of his manner during the last week of his stay dispersed all her suspicions from a luxurious home fond friends and the girlish face he loved better than his life the minister went forth to his distant post offering in sacrifice to god upon the altar of duty his throbbing heart and hopes of earthly happiness a cloud of sadness settled on the household after his departure and scarcely less than louisas was irenes silent grief the confinement grew doubly irksome when his voice and step had passed from the threshold and she looked forward impatiently to her release the ****** proved more serious than she at first imagined and the summer vacation set in before she was able to walk with ease mr huntingdon had been apprised of her long absence from school and one day when she was cautiously trying her strength he arrived without having given premonition of his visit as he took her in his arms and marked the alteration in her thin face the listlessness of her manner the sorrowful gravity of her countenance his fears were fully aroused and holding her to his heart he exclaimed my daughter my beauty i must take you out of new york yes father take me home do take me home she clasped her arms round his neck and nestled her face close to his not yet queen we will go to the ******** to lake george to niagara a few weeks travel will invigorate you i have written to hugh to meet us at montreal he is with a gay party and you shall have a royal time a pretty piece of business truly that you cant amuse yourself in any other way than by breaking half the bones in your body thus the summer programme was determined without any reference to the wishes of the one most concerned and knowing her fathers disposition she silently acquiesced after much persuasion mr huntingdon prevailed on louisas parents to allow her to accompany them the mother consented very reluctantly and on the appointed day the party set off for saratoga the change was eminently beneficial and before they reached canada irene seemed perfectly restored but her father was not satisfied her unwonted *********** annoyed and puzzled him he knew that beneath the calm surface some strong undercurrent rolled swiftly and he racked his brain to discover what had rendered her so reserved louisas joyous elastic spirits probably heightened the effect of her companions gravity and the contrast daily presented could not fail to arrest mr huntingdons attention on arriving at montreal the girls were left for a few moments in the parlour of the hotel while mr huntingdon went to register their names irene and louisa stood by the window looking out into the street when a happy ringing voice exclaimed here you are at last irie i caught a glimpse of your curls as you passed the diningroom door she turned to meet her cousin and held out her hand does your majesty suppose i shall be satisfied with the tip of your fingers pshaw irie i will have my kiss he threw his arm round her shoulder drew down the shielding hands and kissed her twice oh hugh behave yourself miss louisa young my cousin hugh seymour he bowed and shook hands with the stranger then seized his cousins fingers and fixed his fine eyes affectionately upon her it seems an age since i saw you irie come sit down and let me look at you how stately you have grown to be sure more like a queen than ever absolutely two inches taller since you entered boardingschool irie i am so glad to see you again he snatched up a handful of curls and drew them across his lips careless of what louisa might think thank you hugh i am quite as glad to see you oh humbug i know better you would rather see paragon any day ten to one i will kill that dog yet and shoot erebus too see if i dont then maybe you can think of somebody else when you are glad you show it in your eyes and now they are as still as violets under icicles i think you might love me a little at least as much as a dog hush i do love you but i dont choose to tell it to everybody in montreal mr huntingdons entrance diverted the conversation and irene was glad to escape to her own room your cousin seems to be very fond of you observed louisa as she upbraided her hair he is very impulsive and demonstrative that is all how handsome he is do you think so really take care louisa i will tell him and by way of crushing his vanity add de ******** etc etc etc how old is he in his twentieth year from that time the cousins were thrown constantly together wherever they went hugh took charge of irene while mr huntingdon gave his attention to louisa but the eagle eye was upon his daughters movements he watched her countenance weighed her words tried to probe her heart week after week he found nothing tangible hugh was gay careless irene equable but reserved finally they turned their faces homeward and in october found themselves once more in new york mr huntingdon prepared to return south and hugh to sail for europe while irene remained at the hotel until the morning of her cousins departure a private parlour adjoined the room she occupied and here he came to say farewell she knew that he had already had a long conversation with her father and as he threw himself on the sofa and seized one of her hands she instinctively shrank from him irene here is my miniature i wanted you to ask for it but i see that you wont do it i know very well that you will not value it ************* part as much as i do your likeness here on my watchchain but perhaps it will remind you of me sometimes how i shall want to see you before i come home you know you belong to me uncle gave you to me and when i come back from europe we will be married we are both very young i know but it has been settled so long irie my beauty i wish you would love me more you are so cold wont you try he leaned down to kiss her but she turned her face hastily away and answered resolutely no i cant love you other than as my cousin i would not if i could i do not think it would be right and i wont promise to try father has no right to give me to you or to anybody else i tell you now i belong to myself and only i can give myself away hugh i dont consider this settled at all you might as well know the truth at once i have some voice in the matter mr huntingdon had evidently prepared him for something of this kind on her part and though his face flushed angrily he took no notice of the remonstrance i shall write to you frequently and i hope that you will be punctual in replying irie give me your left hand just a minute wear this ring till i come back to remind you that you have a cousin across the ocean he tried to force the flashing jewel on her slender finger but she resisted and rose struggling to withdraw her hand no no hugh i cant i wont i know very well what that ring means and i cannot accept it release my hand i tell you i wont wear it come hugh you have not a moment to spare the carriage is waiting mr huntingdon threw open the door having heard every word that had passed hugh dropped the ring in his ********** and rose well irie i suppose i must bid you farewell two or three years will change you my dearest little cousin goodbye think of me now and then and learn to love me by the time i come home she suffered him to take both her hands and kiss her tenderly for her father stood there and she could not refuse but the touch of his lips burned her long after he was gone she put on her bonnet and when her father returned from the steamer they entered the carriage which was to convey her to the dreary dreaded school as they rolled along broadway mr huntingdon coolly took her hand and placed hughs ring upon it saying *************** hugh told me you refused to accept his parting gift and seemed much hurt about it there is no reason why you should not wear it and in future i do not wish to see you without it remember this my daughter father it is wrong for me to wear it unless i expected to i understand the whole matter perfectly now irene let me hear no more about it i wish you would learn that it is a childs duty to obey her parent no more words if you please on the subject she felt that this was not the hour for resistance and wisely forbore but he saw rebellion written in the calm fixed eye and read it in the curved lines of the full upper lip she had entreated him to take her home and only the night before renewed her pleadings but his refusal was positive and now she went back to the hated school without a visible token of regret she saw her trunks consigned to the porter listened to a brief conversation between dr and her father and after a hasty embrace and halfdozen words watched the tall soldierly form reenter the carriage then she went slowly up the broad stairway to her ******** room and with dry eyes unpacked her clothes locked up the ring in her ************ and prepared to resume her studies it was late october a feeble flame flickered in the grate on the rug crouched an english ******* creeping closer as the heat died out and the waning light of day gradually receded leaving the room dusky save where a slanting line of yellow quivered down from the roof and gilt the folds of black silk at one of the windows stood electra half concealed by the heavy green and gold drapery one dimpled hand clinging to the curtains the other pressed against the ***** as she watched the forms hurrying along the street below for three weeks she had received no letter from russell he was remarkably punctual and this long ************* interval filled her at first with vague uneasiness which grew finally into horrible foreboding for ten days she had stood at this hour at the same window waiting for mr cliftons return from the postoffice ten times the words no letter had fallen like the voice of doom on her throbbing heart on this eleventh day suspense reached its **** and time seemed to have locked its wheels to lengthen her torture at last an omnibus stopped and mr clifton stepped out with a bundle of papers under his arm closer pressed the pallid face against the glass firmer grew the grasp of the icy fingers on the ******** she had no strength to meet him he closed the door hung up his hat and looked into the studio no fire in the grate no light in the ******************* cold and dark save the reflection on that front window electra i am here no letter she stood motionless a moment but the brick walls opposite the trees the ********* spun around like maple leaves in an autumn gale my ***** why dont you have a light and some fire he stumbled toward her and put his hand on her shoulder but she shrank away and lighting the gas rang for coal there is something terrible the matter russell is either ill or dead i must go to him just then the ******** rang sharply she supposed it was some ************* coming to spend an hour and turned to go wait a minute i want to he paused for at that instant she heard a voice which even amid the din of ****** would have been unmistakable to her and breaking from him she sprang to the threshold and met her cousin oh russell i thought you had forgotten me what put such a ridiculous thought into your head my last letter must have prepared you to expect me what letter i have had none for three weeks one in which i mentioned mr campbells foreign appointment and the position of secretary which he tendered me electra let me speak to mr clifton as he advanced and greeted the artist she heard a quick snapping sound and saw the beautiful bohemian glass *********** her guardian had been using lying shivered to ***** on the rug the fluted handle was crushed in his fingers and drops of blood oozed over the left hand ere she could allude to it he thrust his hand into his pocket and desired russell to be seated this is a pleasure totally unexpected what is the appointment of which you spoke mr campbell has been appointed minister to and sails next week i am surprised that you have not heard of it from the public journals many of them have spoken of it and warmly commended the selection i accompany him in the capacity of secretary and shall meanwhile prosecute my studies under his direction the grey glittering eyes of the artist sought those of his pupil and for an instant hers quailed but rallying she looked fully *********** at him resolved to play out the game scorning to bare her heart to his scrutiny she had fancied that russells affection had prompted this visit now it was apparent that he came to new york to take a ********** to see her to put the stormy atlantic between them new york certainly agrees with you electra you have grown and improved very much since you came north i never saw such colour in your cheeks before i can scarcely believe that you are the same fragile child i put into the stage one year ago this ********** me to having given you up to mr clifton he is a better guardian than i could have been but tell me something more about these new relatives you spoke of having found here mr clifton left the room and the two sat side by side for an hour talking of the gloomy past the flitting present the uncertain future leaning back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the grate russell said gravely there is now nothing to impede my successful career obstacles are rapidly melting away every day brings me nearer the goal i long since set before me in two years at farthest perhaps earlier i shall return and begin the practice of law once admitted i ask no more then and not till then i hope to save you from the necessity of labour in the interim mr clifton will prove a noble and generous friend and believe me my cousin the thought of leaving you so long is the only thing which will mar the pleasure of my european sojourn the words were kind enough but the tone was indifferent and the countenance showed her that their approaching separation disquieted him little she thought of the sleepless nights and wretched days she had passed waiting for a letter from that tall reserved cold cousin and her features relaxed in a derisive smile at the folly of her ************ love raising his eyes accidentally he caught the smile wondered what there was to call it forth in the plans which he had just laid before her and meeting his glance of surprise she said carelessly are you not going to see irene before you sail his cheek flushed as he rose straightened himself and answered a strange question truly from one who knows me as well as you do call to see a girl whose father sent her from home solely to prevent her from associating with my family through what sort of ************* do you suppose that i have passed that every spark of selfrespect has been crushed out of me her fathers tyranny and selfishness can never nullify her noble and affectionate remembrance of aunt amy in the hour of her need and when i am able to repay her every cent we owe her then and not till then i wish to see her things shall change mens ******** is est ******* and the day will come when mr huntingdon may not think it degrading for his daughter to acknowledge my acquaintance on the street a brief silence ensued russell drew on his gloves and finally said hesitatingly dr arnold told me she had suffered very much from a fall yes for a long time she was confined to her room has she recovered entirely entirely she grows more beautiful day by day perhaps he wished to hear more concerning her but she would not gratify him and soon after he took up his hat mr clifton has a spare room russell why cant you stay with us while you are in new york thank you but mr campbell will expect me at the hotel i shall be needed too as he has many letters to write i will see you tomorrow and indeed every day while i remain in the city then pay your visits in the morning for i want to take your portrait with my own hands give me a sitting as early as possible very well look for me tomorrow good night the week that followed was one of strangely mingled sorrows and joys in after years it served as a prominent landmark to which she looked back and dated sad changes in her heart irene remained ignorant of russells presence in the city and at last the day dawned on which the vessel was to sail at the breakfast table mr clifton noticed the ************** of his pupils face but kindly abstained from any allusion to it he saw that contrary to habit she drank a cup of coffee and arresting her arm as she requested his mother to give her a second he said gently my dear child where did you suddenly find such turkish tastes i thought you disliked coffee i take it now as medicine my head aches horribly then let me prescribe for you we will go down to the steamer with russell and afterward take a long drive to greenwood if you like he said he would call here at ten oclock to bid us farewell ******** the carriage will be ready and we will accompany him at the appointed hour they repaired to the vessel and looking at its huge sides electra coveted even a deck passage envied the meanest who hurried about making all things ready for departure the last bell rang people crowded down on the planks russell hastened back to the carriage and took the nerveless gloved hand i will write as early as possible dont be uneasy about me no accident has ever happened on this line i am glad i leave you with such a friend as mr clifton goodbye cousin it will not be very long before we meet again he kissed the passive lips shook hands with the artist and sprang on board just as the planks were withdrawn the vessel moved majestically on its way friends on shore waved handkerchiefs to friends departing and hands were kissed and hats lifted and then the crowd slowly ************ steamers sail every week and people become accustomed to the spectacle are you ready to go now asked mr clifton yes ready quite ******** greenwood she spoke in a tone which had lost its liquid music and with a wintry smile that fled over the ashy face lending the features no light no warmth he tried to divert her mind by calling attention to various things of interest but the utter exhaustion of her position and the ************ character of her replies soon discouraged him both felt relieved when the carriage stopped before the studio and as he led her up the steps he said affectionately i am afraid my prescription has not cured your head no sir but i thank you most sincerely for the kind effort you have made to relieve me i shall be better tomorrow goodbye till then stay my child come into the studio and let me read something light and pleasant to you not for the universe the sight of a book would give me brain fever i verily believe she tried unavailingly to shake off his hand why do you shrink from me my pupil because i am sick weary and you watch me so that i get restless and nervous do let me go i want to sleep an impatient stamp emphasized the words and as he relaxed his clasp of her fingers she hastened to her room and locked the door to prevent all intrusion taking off her bonnet she drew the heavy shawl closely around her shoulders and threw herself across the foot of the bed burying her face in her hands lest the bare walls should prove witnesses of her agony six hours later she lay there still with pale fingers pressed to burning dry eyelids once more the labours of a twelvemonth had been exhibited at the academy of ********** to be classed among things that were not born to die others to fall into nameless graves mr clifton was represented by an exquisite none and on the same wall in a massive oval frame hung the first finished production of his pupil for months after russells departure she sat before her easel slowly filling up the outline sketched while his eyes watched her application sometimes trenches so closely upon genius as to be mistaken for it in its results and where both are happily blended the bud of art expands in immortal perfection electra spared no toil and so it came to pass that the faultless head of her idol excited intense and universal admiration in the catalogue it was briefly mentioned as no ##* portrait first effort of a young female artist ************ who had committed themselves by extravagant praise sneered at the announcement of the catalogue and after a few inquiries blandly asserted that no tyro could have produced it that the master had wrought out its perfection and generously allowed the pupil to monopolize the encomiums in vain mr clifton disclaimed the merit and asserted that he had never touched the canvas that she had jealously refused to let him aid her incredulous smiles and unmistakable motions of the head were the sole results of his expostulation electra was indignant at the injustice meted out to her and as might have been expected rebelled against the verdict some weeks after the close of the exhibition the none was purchased and the portrait sent home electra placed it on the easel once more and stood before it in rapt contemplation coldness silence neglect all were forgotten when she looked into the deep beautiful eyes and upon the broad bold matchless brow she had not the faintest hope that he would ever cherish a tenderer feeling for her but love is a plant of strange growth a curious plant truly and one which will not bear ************* as many a luckless experiment has proved today as electra looked upon her labours the coils of time seemed to fall away the vista of eternity opened before her peopled with two forms which on earth walked widely separate paths and over her features stole a serene lifted expression as if after painful ******* she had risen above the *********** and caught the first rays of perpetual sunshine mr clifton had watched her for some moments with lowering brow and jealous hatred of the picture approaching he looked over her shoulder and said electra i must speak to you hear me you hug a phantom to your heart russell does not and will not love you other than as his cousin the blood deserted her face leaving a ******* pallor but the eyes sought his steadily and the rippling voice lost none of its rich cadence except as his cousin i do not expect russell to love me oh child you deceive yourself this is a hope that you cling to with mad tenacity she wrung her hand from his and drew her figure to its utmost height no you must hear me now i have a right to question youthe right of my long silent faithful love you may deny it but that matters little be still and listen did you suppose that i was simply a generous man when i offered to guard and aid ******* i took you to my house placed you in my mothers care and lavished affection upon you if so put away the hallucination consider me no longer your friend look at me as i am a jealous and selfishly exacting man who stands before you today and tells you he loves you oh electra from the morning when you first showed me your sketches you have been more than my life to me every hope i have centred in you i have not deceived myself i knew that you loved russell when he came here i saw that the old fascination still kept its hold upon you but i saw too what you saw quite as *********** in russell aubreys heart there is room for nothing but ambition i knew how you suffered and i believed it was the deathstruggle of your love but instead i find you day by day before that ************** of me of everything but the features you cling to so insanely do you wonder that i hate that portrait do you wonder that i am growing desperate if he loved you in return i could bear it better but as it is i am tortured beyond all endurance i have spent nearly three years in trying to gain your heart all other aims have faded before this one absorbing love today i lay it at your feet and ask if i have not earned some reward oh electra have you no gratitude a scarlet spot burned on his pale cheeks and the mild liquid grey eyes sparkled like stars he stretched out his hand but she drew back a step god forgive me but i have no such love for you a ghastly smile broke over his face and after a moment the snowy handkerchief he passed across his lips was stained with ruby streaks i know that and i know the reason but once more i ask you to give me your hand electra dearest do not i pray you refuse me this oh child give me your hand and in time you will learn to love me he seized her fingers and stooped his head till the silky brown beard mingled with her raven locks mr clifton to marry without love would be a grievous sin i dare not we would hate each other life would be a curse to both and death a welcome release could you endure a wife who accepted your hand from gratitude and pity oh such a relationship would be horrible beyond all degree i shudder at the thought but you would learn to love me but you cannot take russells place none can come between him and my heart electra grey you are unwomanly in your unsought love unwomanly if so made such by your *********** unwomanly were you more manly i had never shocked your maudlin sentiments of propriety and this is my reward for all the tenderness i have lavished on you when i stooped to beg your hand to be repulsed with scorn and loathing to spend three years in faithful effort to win your heart and reap contempt hatred staggering back he sank into his armchair and closed his eyes a moment then continued i would not have troubled you long electra it was because i knew that my life must be short at best that i urged you to gild the brief period with the light of your love i would not have bound you always to me and when i asked your hand a few minutes since i knew that death would soon sever the tie and set you free let this suffice to palliate my unmanly pleading i have but one request to make of you now and weak as it may seem i beg of you not to deny me you are preparing to leave my house this i know i see it in your face and the thought is harrowing to me electra remain under my roof while i live let me see you every day here in my house if not as my wife stay as my friend my pupil my child i little thought i could ever condescend to ask this of anyone but the dread of separation bows me down oh child i will not claim you long she stood up before him with the portrait in her arms resolved then and there to leave him for ever but the ghastly pallor of his face the scarlet thread ****** over his lips and ********** the handkerchief with which he strove to staunch it told her that the request was preferred on no idle pretext in swift review his kindness generosity and unwavering affection passed before her and the mingled accents of remorse and compassion whispered pay your debt of gratitude by sacrificing your heart if you can make him happy you owe it to him softly she took his hand and said in a low thrilling tone mr clifton i was passionate and hasty and said some unkind things which i would fain recall and for which i beg your pardon i thank you for the honour you would have conferred on me and for the unmerited love you offered me unless it were in my power to return that love it would be sinful to give you my hand but since you desire it so earnestly i will promise to stay by your side to do what i can to make you happy to prove by my devotion that i am not insensible to all your kindness that i am very grateful for the affection you have given me i come and offer you this as a poor return for all that i owe you it is the most my conscience will permit me to tender my friend my master will you accept it and forgive the pain and sorrow i have caused you he felt her tears falling on his fingers and for a moment neither spoke then he drew the hands to his lips and kissed them tenderly thank you electra i know it is a sacrifice on your part but i am selfish enough to accept it heaven bless you my pupil in future we will not allude to this day of ******** it be forgotten let the dead past bury its dead i will have no *********** phantoms and now sir you must not allow this slight hemorrhage to ******* you in a few days you will be stronger quite able to examine and find fault with my work shall i send a note to dr le roy asking him to call and see you this evening he has just left me say nothing of the hemorrhage to mother it would only distress her he released her hands and stooping over his pillow she smoothed the disordered hair and for the first time pressed her lips to his forehead thus she bowed her neck to the yoke and with a fixed unalterable will entered on the long dreary ministry to which she felt that duty called with the characteristic ********** of consumption mr clifton rallied and for a time seemed almost restored but at the approach of winter the cough increased and dangerous symptoms returned several months after the rejection of his suit to which no allusion had ever been made electra sat before her easel absorbed in work while the master slowly walked up and down the studio wrapped in a warm plaid shawl occasionally he paused and looked over her shoulder then resumed his pace offering no comment it was not an unusual occurrence for them to pass entire mornings together without exchanging a word and today the silence had lasted more than an hour a prolonged fit of coughing finally arrested her attention and glancing up she met his sad gaze this is ************ weather for you mr clifton yes this winter offers a dreary prospect resting her chin in her hands she raised her eyes and said why do you not follow the doctors advice a winter south might restore you he drew near and leaning his folded arms on the top of the easel looked down into her face there is only one condition upon which i could consent to go that is in your hands will you accompany me she understood it all in an instant saw the new form in which the trial presented itself and her soul sickened mr clifton if i were your sister or your child i would gladly go but as your pupil i cannot as electra grey certainly not but as electra clifton you could go electra grey will be carved on my tombstone then you decide my fate i remain and wait the slow approach of death no before just heaven i take no such responsibility nor shall you thrust it on me you are a man and must decide your destiny for yourself i am a poor girl having no claim upon no power over you it is your duty to preserve the life which god gave you in the way prescribed by your physician and i have no voice in the matter it is your duty to go south and it will be both weak and wicked to remain here under existing circumstances my life is centred in you it is worthless nay a burden separated from you your life should be centred in something nobler better in your duty in your profession it is suicidal to fold your hands listlessly and look to me as you do all these things have i tried and i am weary of the hollowness weary of life and the world so long as i have your face here i care not to cross my own threshold till friendly hands bear me out to my quiet restingplace under the willows of greenwood electra my darling think me weak if you will but bear with me a little longer and then this my shadow shall flit from your young heart leaving not even a memory to haunt you be patient i will soon pass away to another a more peaceful blessed sphere a melancholy smile lighted his fair waxen features as waning sickly sunshine in an autumn evening ******** over sculptured marble in a silent churchyard how she ************ his great weakness as he wiped away the moisture which even on that cold day glistened on his forehead oh i beseech you to go to cuba go and get strong once more nothing will ever help me now sunny skies and soft breezes bring no healing for me i want to die here in my home where your hands will be about me not among strangers in cuba or italy he turned to the fire and springing up she left the room the solemn silence of the house oppressed her she put on her thickest wrappings and took the street leading to the nearest park a ********* sky with ************** clouds looked down on her and the keen chilly wind wafted a fine ********** in her face as she pressed against it the trees were bare and the **** grass grew hoary as the first snowflakes of the season came down softly and ********** the walks were deserted save where a hurrying form crossed from street to street homeward bound and electra passed slowly along absorbed in thoughts colder than the ******** that gathered on shawl and bonnet the face and figure of the painter glided ********** before her at every step and a mighty temptation followed at its heels why not strangle her heart why not marry him and bear his name if thereby she could make his few remaining months of existence happy and by accompanying him south prolong his life even for a few weeks she shuddered at the suggestion it would be such a miserable lot faster fell the snowflakes ******** the waves of her hair like foam and setting her teeth firmly as if thereby locking the door against all *************** ************ electra left the park and turned into a *********** on which was situated an establishment where bouquets were kept for sale the assortment was meagre at that late hour but she selected a tiny bunch of delicate fragrant hothouse blossoms and shielding them with her shawl hastened home the studio was brilliant with ******** and warm with the breath of ********** but an aspect of dreariness silence and sorrow ************ on the edge of the low **************** mantel supported at each corner by ********** perched a large tame grey owl with clipped wings folded and wide solemn oracular eyes fastened on the countenance of its beloved master with swift noiseless steps electra came to the red grate and after a moment drew an ottoman close to the easy chair perhaps its occupant slept perchance he wandered with closed eyes far down among the sombre **** ****** of memory she laid her cool fingers on his hand and held the bouquet before him my dear sir here are your flowers they are not as pretty as usual but sweet enough to atone for lack of beauty he fingered them caressingly laid them against his hollow cheeks and hid his lips among their fragrant petals but the starry eyes were fixed on the features of the pupil it is bitter weather out did you brave it for these thank you but dont expose yourself so in future two invalids in a house are quite enough you are *********** little one do you know it the ******** gleams right royally on that black hair of yours nay child dont brush it off like all lovely things it fades rapidly melts away like the dreams that flutter around a boy in the

trembled as he placed it upon her head i know not what is to become of you oh electra if you would only be warned in time the warmth of the room had *********** her cheeks and the long black lashes failed to veil in any degree the flash of the eyes she raised to his face removing the hand from her head she took it in both hers and a cold dauntless smile wreathed her lips be easy on my account i

stood a moment on the rug looking into the red network of coals then turned to leave him saying i must go to your mother now and presently i will bring your tea you need not trouble i can go to the diningroom tonight it is no trouble it gives me great pleasure to do something for your comfort and i know you always enjoy your supper more when you have it here as she closed the door he pressed his face against the morocco lining and groaned unconsciously and large glittering tears creeping from beneath the trembling lashes hid themselves in the curling brown beard to see that mrs cliftons supper suited her and then to read aloud to her for half an hour from the worn family bible was part of the daily routine which electra permitted nothing to interrupt on this occasion she found the old lady seated as usual before the fire her crutches leaning against the chair and her favourite cat curled on the carpet at her feet most tenderly did the aged cripple love her sons protge and the wrinkled sallow face lighted up with a smile of pleasure at her entrance i thought it was about time for you to come to me sit down dear and touch the bell for kate how is harry no stronger i am afraid you know this is very bad weather for him yes when he came up today i thought he looked more feeble than i had ever seen him and as i sit here and listen to his hollow cough every sound seems a stab at my heart she rocked herself to and fro for a moment and added mournfully ah child it is so hard to see my youngest boy going down to the grave before me the last of five i hoped he would survive me but consumption is a terrible thing it took my husband first then in quick succession my other children and now harry my darling my youngest is the last prey anxious to divert her mind electra adroitly changed the conversation and when she rose to say good night some time after had the satisfaction of knowing that the old lady had fallen asleep in was in vain that she arranged several tempting dishes on the table beside the painter and coaxed him to partake of them he received but a cup of tea from her hand and motioned the remainder away as the servant removed the tray he looked up at his pupil and said please wheel the lounge nearer to the grate i am too tired to sit up tonight she complied at once shook up the pillow and as he laid his head upon it she spread his heavy plaid shawl over him now sir what shall i read this evening ****** ******* if you please she took up the volume and began at the place he designated and as she read on and on her rich flexible voice rose and fell upon the air like waves of melody one of her hands chanced to hang over the arm of the chair and as she sat near the lounge thin hot fingers twined about it drew it caressingly to the pillow and held it tightly her first impulse was to withdraw it and an expression of annoyance crossed her features but on second thought she suffered her fingers to rest ********* in his now and then as she turned a leaf she met his luminous eyes fastened upon her but after a time the quick breathing attracted her attention and looking down she saw that he too was sleeping she closed the book and remained quiet fearful of disturbing him and as she studied the weary fevered face noting the march of disease the sorrowful drooping of the mouth so indicative of grievous disappointment a new and holy tenderness awoke in her heart it was a feeling analogous to that of a mother for a suffering child who can be soothed only by her presence and ********** affection not unfrequently kindled in haughty natures by the entire dependence of a weaker one blended with this was a remorseful consciousness of the coldness with which she had persistently rejected repulsed every manifestation of his devoted love and winding her fingers through his long hair she vowed an atonement for the past in increased gentleness for the remainder of his waning life as she bent over him wearing her compassion in her face he opened his eyes and looked at her how long have i slept nearly an hour how do you feel since your nap he made no reply and she put her hand on his forehead the countenance lighted and he said slowly ah yes press your cool soft little palm on my brow it seems to still the throbbing of my temples it is late mr clifton and i must leave you william looked in a few minutes since to say that the fire burned in your room but i would not wake you i will send him to you good night she leaned down voluntarily and kissed him and with a quick movement he folded her to his heart an instant then released her murmuring huskily god bless you electra and reward you for your patient endurance good night my precious child she went to her room all unconscious of the burst of emotion which shook the feeble frame of the painter long after she had laid her head on her pillow in the sound slumber of healthful youth the year that ensued proved a valuable school of patience and taught the young artist a gentleness of tone and quietude of manner at variance with the natural impetuosity of her character irksome beyond degree was the discipline to which she subjected herself but with a ********* of purpose that knew no wavering she walked through the daily dreary routine keeping her eyes upon the end that slowly but unmistakably approached in midsummer mr clifton removed for a few weeks to the ******** and occasionally he rallied for a few hours with a tenacity of strength almost miraculous during the still sunny afternoons hosts of gay visitors summer tourists often paused in their excursions to watch the emaciated form of the painter leaning on the arm of his beautiful pupil or reclining on a ************** knoll while she sketched the surrounding scenery increased feebleness prevented mrs clifton from joining in these outdoor jaunts and early in september when it became apparent that her mind was rapidly sinking into imbecility they returned to the city memory seemed to have deserted its throne she knew neither her son nor electra and the last spark of intelligence manifested itself in a *************** of her favourite cat which sprang to welcome her back as friendly hands bore her to the chamber she was to quit no more till death released the crushed spirit a letter was found on the ******* mantel directed to electra in familiar characters which she had not seen for months very quietly she put it in her pocket and in the solitude of her room broke the seal found that russell had returned during her absence had spent a morning in the studio looking over her work and had gone south to establish himself in his native town ah the grievous grievous disappointment a bitter cry rolled from her lips and the hands wrung each other despairingly but an hour later she stood beside the artist with ********* brow and a serene mouth that bore no ************ of the sorrow gnawing at her heart winter came on earlier than usual with unwonted severity and week after week electra went continually from one sufferer to another striving to alleviate pain and to kindle a stray beam of sunshine in the darkened mansion ********** vigil set its pale infallible signet on her face but mr clifton either could not or would not see the painful alteration in her appearance and when mrs young remonstrated with her niece upon the ruinous effects of this tedious confinement to the house she only answered steadily i will nurse him so long as i have strength left to creep from one room to another during christmas week he grew alarmingly worse and dr le roy counted the waning life by hours but on new years eve he declared himself almost well and insisted on being carried to the studio the whim was ******** and wrapped in his silken robe de chambre he was seated in his large cushioned chair smiling to find himself once more in the midst of his treasures turning back the velvet **** from his attenuated wrist he lifted his flushed face toward the nurse and said eagerly uncover my easel make william draw it close to me i have been idle long enough give me my palette i want to ******* the forehead of my hero it needs a high light you are not strong enough to work wait till tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow you have told me that fifty times wheel up the easel i say the spell is upon me and work i will it was the ruling passion strong in death and electra acquiesced arranging the colours on the palette as he directed and selecting the brushes he required resting his feet upon the ********* he leaned forward and gazed earnestly upon his *********** the darling design which had haunted his brain for years ***** he called this piece of canvas which was a large square painting representing in the foreground the death of socrates the details of the picture were finished with ************* precision and ************* sweep and folds of drapery about the couch the emptied ******* ****** the central figure of the martyr lacked something and to these last touches mr clifton essayed to address himself slowly feebly the transparent hand wandered over the canvas and electra heard with alarm the laboured breath that came panting from his parted lips she saw the unnatural sparkle in his sunken eyes almost die out then leap up again like smouldering embers swept by a sudden gust and in the clear strong voice of other years he repeated to himself the very words of ****** **** for i have heard that it is right to die with good ***** be quiet therefore and bear up leaning back to note the effect of his touches a shiver ran through his frame the brush fell from his tremulous fingers and he lay motionless and exhausted folding his hands like a helpless tired child he raised his eyes to hers and said brokenly i ******** it to you finish my work you understand meyou know what is lacking finish my ***** and tell the world i died at work upon it oh for a fraction of my old strength one hour more to complete my socrates just one hour i would ask no more she gave him a powerful cordial which the physician had left and having arranged the pillows on the lounge drew it close to the easel and prevailed on him to lie down a servant was dispatched for dr le roy but returned to say that a dangerous case detained him elsewhere mr clifton would you like to have your mother brought downstairs and placed beside you for a while no i want nobody but you sit down here close to me and keep quiet she lowered the heavy curtains shaded the ******** and placing a bunch of sweet violets on his pillow sat down at his side his favourite ******* nestled at her feet and occasionally threw up his head and gazed wistfully at his master thus two hours passed and as she rose to administer the medicine he waved it off saying give me no more of it i wont be drugged in my last hours i wont have my intellect clouded by ******* throw it into the fire and let me rest oh sir can i do nothing for you sit still do not leave me i beg of you he drew her back to the seat and after a short silence said slowly electra are you afraid of death no sir do you know that i am dying i have seen you as ill several times before you are a brave ************* child glazed eyes and stiffened limbs will not frighten you i have but few hours to live put your hand in mine and promise me that you will sit here till my soul ***** its clay prison will you watch with me the death of the year are you afraid to stay with me and see me die she would not trust herself to speak but laid her hand in his and clasped it firmly he smiled and added will you promise to call no one i want no eyes but yours to watch me as i die let there be only you and me i promise for some moments he lay motionless but the intensity of his gaze made her restless and she shaded her face electra my darling your martyrdom draws to a close i have been merciless in my exactions i know you are worn to a shadow and your face is sharp and haggard but you will forgive me all when the willows of greenwood trail their boughs across my ********* you have been faithful and uncomplaining you have been to me a light a joy and a glory god bless you my pupil in my ********** is the key of my writingdesk there you will find my will take charge of it and put it in le **** hands as soon as possible give me some water she held the glass to his lips and as he sank back a bright smile played over his face ah child it is such a comfort to have you ******* are so inexpressibly dear to me she took his thin hands in hers and hot tears fell upon them an intolerable weight crushed her heart a *********** horrible dread and she asked falteringly are you willing to die is your soul at peace with god have you any fear of eternity none my child none would you like to have mr bailey come and pray for you i want no one now but you a long silence ensued broken only by the heavily drawn breath of the sufferer two hours elapsed and there by the couch sat the motionless watcher noting the indescribable but unmistakable change creeping on the feeble threadlike pulse fluttered irregularly but the breathing became easy and low as a babes and occasionally a gentle sigh heaved the chest she knew that the end was at hand and a strained frightened expression came into her large eyes as she glanced nervously round the room and met the solemn fascinating eyes of ***** the owl staring at her from the low mantel she caught her breath and the deep silence was broken by the metallic tongue that ****** out twelve the last stroke of the bronze hammer echoed drearily the old year lay stark and cold on its bier ***** flapped his dusky wings with a long sepulchral bloodcurdling hoot and the dying man opened his dim failing eyes and fixed them for the last time on his

eyes closed and a smile ******* itself on the parted lips a slight tremor shook the limbs a soft shuddering breath swept across the watchers face and the golden bowl was shivered the silver cord was

accurately as seemed desirable in common parlance her education was *********** was regularly and unmistakably out having lost her aunt two years before her return the duties of hostess devolved upon

to meet him holding out both hands with a warm bright smile oh dr arnold i am so glad to see you once more it was neither friendly nor hospitable to go off just as i came home after long years of absence i am very glad to see you he held her hands and gazed at her like one in a dream of mingled pain and pleasure and when he spoke his voice was unsteady you cannot possibly be as glad to see me as i am to have you back but i cant realize that this is indeed you my ****** irene i parted with rather more than four years ago oh child what a marvellous what a glorious beauty you have grown to be

you what has so changed that child i want to know what ails her nothing that i know of you know that she was always rather singular yes but it was a different sort of *********** she is too still and white and cold and stately i told you it was a wretched piece of business to send a nature like hers so different from everybody elses off among utter strangers to shut up that queer free *******

uneasily pondering the unpalatable advice you certainly dont mean to say that she has inherited he crushed back the words could he crush the apprehension too i mean to say that if she were my child i

heavily that the shaggy eyebrows met and partially concealed the ********* eyes then nodded to the master of the house and sought his buggy from that day irene was conscious of a keener and more constant scrutiny on her fathers ***** ceaseless surveillance silent but ********* soon grew intolerable no matter how she employed her time or whither she went he seemed thoroughly cognizant of the

differences she habitually abstained opinions which she knew to be disagreeable to him she carefully avoided giving expression to in his presence and while always studiously thoughtful of his comfort she preserved a respectful deportment allowing herself no hasty or defiant words fond of pomp and ceremony and imbued with certain aristocratic notions which an ample fortune had always permitted him to indulge mr huntingdon entertained company in princely style and whenever an opportunity offered his dinners suppers and *********** were known far and wide and huntingdon hall became proverbial for hospitality throughout the state strangers were fted and it was a rare occurrence for father and daughter to dine quietly together fortunately for irene the servants were admirably trained and though

father had been very anxious to provide her with a skilful housekeeper to relieve her of the care and tedious ****** of such matters but she refused to accept one ******* her belief that it was the imperative duty of every woman to superintend and inspect the management of her domestic affairs consequently from the first week of her return she made it a rule to spend an hour after breakfast in her diningroom pantry determining and arranging the details of the day the situation of the house commanded an extensive and beautiful prospect and the ancient trees that overshadowed it imparted a venerable and imposing aspect the building was of brick ******** to represent granite and along three sides ran a wide gallery supported by lofty circular pillars crowned with unusually heavy capitals

whom she foresaw that she would be thrown by her fathers wishes into intimate relationship and satisfied herself that among all these there was not one save dr arnold whose counsel assistance or

********* in all respects but **************** the girl who came to spend her life among these people was totally dissimilar in ******** of action thought and feeling to the stereotyped conventional

soon her sedate ************* temperament revolted from the irksome round and gradually she outlined and pursued a different course giving to her gay companions just what courtesy required no more hugh had prolonged his stay in europe beyond the period originally designated and instead of arriving in time to accompany his uncle and cousin home he did not sail for some months after their return at length however letters were received announcing his presence in new york and fixing the day when his relatives might expect him the carriage had been dispatched to the dept a servant stood at the end of the avenue waiting to throw open the gate mr huntingdon walked up and down the wide colonnade and irene sat before the fire in her own room holding in one palm the flashing betrothal ring which

seated beside him irene gazed with mingled emotions of pain and pleasure upon her mothers only brother he was about thirty but looked older from lifelong suffering had used crutches from the time he was five years of age having been hopelessly crippled by a fall during his infancy his features were sharp his cheeks wore the sallow hue of habitual ********* and his fine grey eyes were somewhat sunken resting his crutches against the sofa he leaned back and looked long and earnestly at his niece very dimly he remembered a fair ************ baby whom the nurse had held out to be kissed when he was sent to philadelphia to be treated for his lameness soon after he heard of his sisters death and then his tutor took him to europe to command the best medical advice of the old world from the faint recollection which i have of your mother i think you strongly resemble her he said at last in a fond gentle tone i dont know about that eric she is far more of a huntingdon than a mitchell she has many of the traits of your family but in appearance she certainly belongs to my side of the house she very often reminds me of hughs mother conversation turned upon the misfortune of the cripple he spoke freely of the unsuccessful experiments made by eminent physicians of the hopelessness of his case and irene was particularly impressed by the calmness and patience with which he seemed to have resigned himself to this great affliction she felt irresistibly drawn toward him careless of passing hours and of hughs illconcealed impatience of manner as they rose from the teatable her cousin said laughingly i protest against monopoly i have not been able to say three words to my ********** i yield the floor from necessity my long journey has unfitted me for this evening and i must bid you

noting the alteration in his appearance and for a moment his eyes drooped before hers she saw that the years had been spent not in study but in a giddy round of pleasure and dissipation yet the bright

remember that we have ceased to be children when you learn to regard me simply as your cousin and are satisfied with a cousins welcome then and not until then shall you receive it let childish whims pass with the years that have separated us rake up no ***** of contention to mar this first evening of your return be reasonable and now tell me how you have employed yourself since we parted what have you seen what have you gleaned insensibly he found himself drawn into a narration of his course of life she listened with apparent interest making occasional ************ comments and bringing him back to the subject whenever he attempted a ****** toward the topic so extremely distasteful to her the clock struck eleven she rose and said i beg your pardon hugh for keeping you up so late i ought to have known that you were fatigued by railroad travel and required sleep you know the way to your room it is the same you occupied before you went to college good night i hope you will rest well she held out her hand carelessly he took it eagerly and holding it up to the light said in a disappointed tone irene where is my ring why are you not wearing it it is in my ************ as i gave

down the fork with which he had been describing a series of *********** figures on the fine damask and said i met a young man in brussels who interested me extremely and in ********* with whom i venture the prediction that if he lives he will occupy a conspicuous position in the affairs of his country he is or was secretary of mr campbell our minister to and they were both on a visit to brussels when i met them his name is aubrey and he told me that he lived here his talents are of the first order his ambition unbounded i should judge and his patient laborious application certainly ********* anything i have ever seen it happened that a friend of mine from london was prosecuting certain researches among the ms archives at brussels and here immersed in study he says he found the secretary who completely ********* him in his investigations and then with unexpected generosity placed his notes at my friends disposal his industry is almost incredible conversing with campbell concerning him i learned that he was a protg of the minister who spoke of his future in singularly sanguine terms he left him some time since to embark in the practice of law do you know him huntingdon no sir but i know that his father was sentenced to the gallows and only saved himself from it by cutting his miserable throat and ******** the law the master of the house thrust back his chair violently crushing one of ******** innocent paws as he crouched on the carpet and *********** a glass which shivered into a dozen fragments at his feet looking at his watch he said as if wishing to cut the conversation short irene if you intend to go to church today it is time that you had your bonnet on hugh what will you do with yourself go with eric and your cousin no i rather think i shall stay at home with you after european ********** our american churches seem excessively plain irene went to her room pondering the conversation she thought it remarkable that as long as she had been at home she had never seen russell even on the street unlocking her writingdesk she took out a tiny note which had accompanied a check for two hundred dollars and had reached her a few months before she left boarding school the firm round manly hand ran as follows with gratitude beyond all expression for the favour conferred on my mother and myself some years since i now return to miss huntingdon the money which i have ever regarded as a friendly loan hoping that the future will afford me some opportunity of proving my appreciation of her great kindness she was conscious of a feeling of regret that the money had been returned it was pleasant to reflect on the fact that she had laid him under obligation now it all seemed cancelled she ******** the desk and drawing on her gloves joined her uncle at the carriage arriving at church later than was her wont she found the family pew occupied by strangers and crossed the aisle to share a friends but at that instant a tall form rose in mr campbells ********** pew stepped into the aisle and held open the door she drew back to suffer her uncle to limp in and lay aside his crutches saw him give his hand to the stranger and sweeping her veil aside as she entered she saw russell quietly resume his seat at the end of the pew startled beyond measure she looked at him intently and almost wondered that she recognized him he had changed so materially since the day on which she stood with him before his mothers gate meantime the service commenced she gave her ******** to her uncle and at the same moment russell found the place and handed her one of two which lay near him as she received it their eyes met and she held out her hand he took it she felt his fingers tremble as they dropped hers and then both faces bent over the books when they knelt side by side and the heavy folds of her elegant dress swept against him it seemed a feverish dream to her she could not realize that at last they had met again and her heart beat so fiercely that she pressed her hand upon it dreading lest he should hear its loud ********** the discourse was ended the ******** of the organ swelled through the lofty church priestly hands hovered like white doves over the congregation dismissing all with blessing once more irene swept back the rich lace veil fully exposing her face once more her eyes looked into those of the man who politely held the pew door open both bowed with stately grace and she walked down the aisle she heard russell talking to her uncle just behind her heard the inquiries concerning his health the expression of pleasure at meeting again the hope which eric uttered that he should see him frequently during his stay in w without even a glance over her shoulder she proceeded to the carriage where her uncle soon joined her she met his searching gaze calmly and as they now neared the house he forbore any further allusion to the subject which he ******** suspected engaged her thoughts quite as fully as his own surely uncle eric there is room enough in this large airy house of ours to accommodate my mothers brother i thought it was fully settled that you were to reside with us there is no good reason why you should not obviously we have a better claim upon you than anybody else why doom yourself to the loneliness of a separate household reconsider the matter irene i want a house of my own to which i can feel privileged to invite such guests such companions as i deem congenial irrespective of the ***** of wouldbe social ********* and the social ostracism of certain cliques she was silent a moment but met his keen look without the slightest embarrassment and yet when she spoke he knew from her eyes and voice that she fully comprehended his meaning of course it is a matter which you must determine for yourself you are the best judge of what ******** to your happiness but i am sorry very sorry uncle eric that in order to promote it you feel it necessary to remove from our domestic circle i shall miss you painfully he looked pained puzzled and irresolute but she smiled and swept her fingers over the bars of her ******** ****** with its ************** inmate have you any engagement for this morning none sir what can i do for you if you feel disposed i shall be glad to have you accompany me to town i want your assistance in selecting a set of china for my new home will you go a shadow drifted over the ********** tranquil face as she said sadly uncle eric is it utterly useless for me to attempt to persuade you to relinquish this project and remain with us utterly useless my dear child i will get my bonnet and join you at the carriage very near the cottage formerly occupied by mrs aubrey stood a small brick house partially concealed by poplar and ******** trees and surrounded by a neat ************ flowergarden this was the place selected and purchased by the cripple for his future home mr huntingdon had opposed the whole proceeding and invited his brotherinlaw to reside with him but beneath the cordial surface the guest felt that other sentiments rolled deep and strong he had little in common with his sisters husband and only a warm and increasing affection for his niece now induced him to settle in w some necessary repairs had been made some requisite arrangements completed regarding servants and today the finishing touches were given to the snug little bachelor establishment when it was apparent that no arguments would avail to alter the decision irene ceased to speak of it and busied herself in various ************ to promote her uncles comfort she made pretty white curtains for his library windows knitted ************** worsted ******** and hemmed and marked the contents of the *********** the diningroom pantry she took under her special charge and at the expiration of ten days when the master took formal possession she accompanied him and enjoyed the pleased surprise with which he received her donation of cakes preserves ******** pickles etc etc neatly stowed away on the spotless shelves what do those large square boxes in the hall contain books which i gathered in europe and selected in new york among them many rare old volumes which you have never seen come down next monday and help me to number and ****** them afterward we will read them together lay aside your bonnet and spend the evening with me no i must go back hugh sent me word that he would bring company to tea he took her hand and drew her close to his chair saying gently ah irene i wish i could keep you always you would be happier here in this little unpretending home of mine than presiding as mistress over that great palatial house on the hill yonder he kissed her fingers tenderly and taking her basket she left him alone in his new home a few weeks passed without incident hugh went to new orleans to visit friends and mr huntingdon was frequently absent at the plantation one day he expressed the desire that judge harriss family should dine with him and added several gentlemen to make the party merry irene promptly issued the invitations suppressing the reluctance which filled her heart for the young people were not ********** and she dreaded charlies set speeches and admiring glances not less than his mothers endless ************* on fashion and the pedigree of all the best families of wand its ******** grace had grown up very pretty highly accomplished ************ ************* but full of her mothers fashionable notions and withal rather weak and frivolous she and irene were constantly thrown into each

proved very tiresome the usual complement of music was contributed by grace the expected quantity of flattering nothings gracefully uttered by her brother the customary amount of ********* **** handed around the circle for patronage and irene gave the signal for dinner mr huntingdon prided himself on his fine wines and after the ********* had circulated freely the gentlemen grew garrulous as *********** irene was gravely discussing the tariff question with mr herbert blackwell whom mrs harris pronounced the most promising young lawyer of her acquaintance and politely listening to his stereotyped reasoning when a scrap of conversation at the opposite end of the table attracted her attention huntingdon my dear fellow i tell you i never made a mistake in my life when reading peoples minds and if aubrey has not the finest legal intellect in w i will throw up my ********* you have seen campbell i suppose he returned last week and by the way i ************ to meet him today well i was talking to him about aubrey and he laughed his droll chuckling laugh snapped his bony fingers in my face and said aye aye harris let him alone hands off and i will wager my new office against your old one that he steps into your honours shoes now you know perfectly well that campbell has no more enthusiasm than a brick wall or a roll of red tape but he is as proud of the young man as if he were his son do you know that he has taken him into partnership pshaw he will never commit such a **** pas but he has i read the notice in this mornings paper pass the madeira the fact is we must not allow our old prejudices to make us unjust i know aubrey has struggled hard he had much to contend with head slightly inclined and eyes fixed on mr ********** face irene had heard all that passed and as the gentleman paused in his harangue to drain his glass she rose and led the way to the parlours the gentlemen adjourned to the *********** and in a short time mrs harris ordered her carriage pleading an engagement with graces *********** as an excuse for leaving so early with a feeling of infinite relief the hostess accompanied them to the door saw the carriage descend the avenue and desiring one of the servants to have erebus saddled at once she went to her room and changed the rich *********** for her ridinghabit as she sprang into the saddle and gathered up the reins her father called from the open window whence issued curling wreaths of blue smoke where now irene i am going to ride it threatened rain this morning and i was afraid to venture he said something but without hearing she rode off and was soon out of sight leaving the town to the left and taking the rocky road leading up the hillside to the cemetery gate dismounting she fastened the reins to one of the iron spikes and gathering the folds of her habit over her arm carried her flowers to the family buryingground it was a large square lot enclosed by a handsome railing and tall gate bearing the name of huntingdon in silver letters as she approached she was surprised to find a low brick wall and beautiful new marble monument close to her fathers lot and occupying a space which had been filled with grass and weeds a few weeks previous as she passed the new lot the gate swung open and russell stood before her good evening miss huntingdon good evening mr aubrey the name sounded strange and harsh as she uttered it and involuntarily she paused and held out her hand he accepted it for an instant the cold fingers lay in his warm palm and as she withdrew them he said in the rich mellow voice which she had heard in the church allow me to show you my mothers monument he held the gate open and she entered and stood at his side the monument was beautiful in its severe *********** pure faultless shaft crowned with a delicately chiselled wreath of poppy leaves and bearing these words in gilt letters sacred to the memory of my mother amy aubrey just below in black characters ******** and underneath the whole on a finely fluted scroll the inscription of st ****** after a silence of some moments russell pointed to the singular and solemn words and said as if speaking rather to himself than to her i want to say always with paul ******** i will be strong and therefore i placed here the inscription which proved an ******* to him that when i come to my mothers grave i may be strengthened not melted by the thronging of bitter memories she looked up as he spoke and the melancholy ********* of the deep eyes stirred her heart as nothing had ever done before i have a few flowers left let me lay them as an affectionate tribute an in memoriam on your mothers ******* the olden time the cottage days are as fresh in my recollection as in yours she held out a woodland bouquet which she had previously gathered he took it and strewed the blossoms along the broad base of the shaft reserving only a small cluster of the rosy china cups both were silent but as she turned to go a sudden gust blew her hat from her head the loosened comb fell upon the grass and down came the heavy masses of hair she twisted them hastily into a coil fastened them securely and received her hat from him with a cool thank you sir when did you hear from electra they walked on to the cemetery gate and he answered i have heard nothing for some weeks have you any message i am going to new york in a few days to try to persuade her to return to w with me i doubt the success of your mission w has little to tempt an artist like your cousin be kind enough to tender her my love and best wishes for the realization of her artistic dreams they had reached the gate where erebus waited when russell took off his hat you have a long walk to town said irene as russell arranged her horses reins i shall not find it long it is a fine piece of road and the stars will be up to light it he held out his hand to assist her she sprang easily to the saddle then leaned toward him every ********** curve and moulding of her proud ivory face ******** themselves on his recollection as she spoke be so good as to hand me my glove i dropped it at your feet as i mounted thank you good evening mr aubrey take my best wishes on your journey and its mission goodbye miss huntingdon he raised his hat and as she wheeled off the magnetic handsome face followed haunted her erebus was impatient out of humour and flew up the next steep hill as if he too were haunted on through gathering gloom dashed horse and rider over the little gurgling stream through the gate up the dark ******* avenue to the doorstep the ************ was a blaze of light and the cheerful sound of mingled voices came out at the open window to tell that the gentlemen had not yet finished their game pausing in the hall irene listened an instant to distinguish the voices then ascended the long easy staircase the lamp threw a mellow radiance on the steps and as she reached the landing hugh caught her in his arms and kissed her warmly startled by his unexpected appearance she recoiled a step or two and asked rather haughtily when did you get home only a few moments after you left the house do change your dress quickly and come down i have a thousand things to say she waited to hear no more but disengaged herself and went to her room when she went down she met her father at the dining room door come queen we are waiting for you he looked at her fondly took her hand and drew her to the table and in after years she recalled this occasion with mournful pleasure as the last on which he had ever given her his pet name come out on the colonnade the air is delicious as he spoke hugh drew his cousins arm through his and led the way from the teatable irene how long do you intend to keep me in painful suspense i am not aware that i have in any degree kept you in suspense you shall not evade me i have been patient and the time has come when we must talk of our future irene dearest be generous and tell me when will you give me irrevocably this hand which has been promised to me from your infancy he took the hand and carried it to his lips but she forcibly withdrew it and disengaging her arm said emphatically never hugh never how can you trifle with me irene if you could realize how impatient i am for the happy day when i shall call you my wife you would be serious and fix an early period for our marriage hugh why will you affect to *********** my meaning i am serious i have pondered long and well a matter involving your lifelong happiness and mine and i tell you most solemnly that i will never be your wife oh irene your promise your sacred promise i never gave it on the contrary i have never failed to show you that my whole nature rebelled against the most unnatural relation forced upon me my dear irene have you then no love for me i have hoped and believed that you hid your love behind your cold mask of proud silence you must you do love me my beautiful cousin you do not believe your own words you are obliged to know better i love you as my cousin love you somewhat as i love uncle eric love you as the sole young relative left to me as the only companion of my lonely childhood but other love than this i never had never can have for you hugh my cousin look fearlessly at the *********** truth neither you nor i have one spark of that affection which alone can sanction marriage indeed you wrong me my worshipped cousin you are dearer to me than anything else on earth i have loved you and you only from my boyhood you have been a lovely idol from earliest recollection you are mistaken most entirely mistaken i am not to be deceived neither can you ******** yourself you like me you love me in the same quiet way that i love you you admire me perhaps more than anyone you chance to know just now you are partial to my beauty and from long habit have come to regard me as your property much in the same light as that in which you look upon your costly diamond buttons or your highspirited horses or rare imported pointers hugh i abhor sham and i tell you now that i never will be a party to that which others have arranged without my consent ah i see how matters stand having disposed of your heart and lavished your love elsewhere you shrink from fulfilling the sacred obligations that make you mine i little dreamed that you were so susceptible else i had not left you feeling so secure my uncle has not proved the faithful guardian i believed him when i entrusted my treasure my ********* bride to his care bitter disappointment flashed in his face and quivered in his voice rendering him reckless of consequences but though he gazed fiercely at her as he uttered the taunt it produced not the faintest visible effect confess who stands between your heart and mine i have a right to ask i will know you forget yourself my cousin your right is obviously a debatable question we will waive it if you please i have told you already and now i repeat it for the last time i will not go with you to the altar because neither of us has proper affection for the other to warrant such a union because it would be an infamous pecuniary contract revolting to every true soul hugh cherish no animosity against me i merit none because we cannot be more shall we be less than friends she turned to leave him but he caught her dress and exclaimed with more tenderness than he had ever manifested before oh irene do not reject me utterly i cannot relinquish you give me one more year to prove my ****** win yours if your proud heart is still your own may i not hope to obtain it by no hugh no as well hope to inspire affection in yonder mute marble guardians forgive me if i pain you but i must be candid at every hazard she pointed to the statues near the door and went through the greenhouse to the library thence to the observatory expecting ere long to be joined by her father gradually the house became quiet and oppressed with the painful sense of coming trouble she sought her own room just as the clock struck twelve pausing to count the strokes she saw a light gleaming through the keyhole of her fathers door opposite her own and heard the sound of low but earnest conversation mingled with the restless tramp of pacing feet she was powerfully tempted to cross the passage knock and have the ordeal ended then and there but second thought whispered tomorrow will soon be here be patient she entered her room and wearied by the events of the day fell asleep dreaming of the new lot in the cemetery and the lonely joyless man who haunted it as she adjusted her ridinghabit the following morning and suffered andrew to arrange her stirrup the latter said ************** so mas hugh got the start of you it isnt often he beats you what do you mean he started a while ago and if he drives as he generally does he will get to his plantation in time for dinner did father go too no maam only mas hugh in his own buggy returning from her ride she stood a moment on the front step looking down the avenue the bermuda terrace blazed in the sunlight like a jewelled ******* the ******* sea of foliage crested by dewy drops flashed and dripped as the soft air stirred the ancient trees the hedges were all alive with birds and butterflies the rich aroma of brilliant and countless flowers the graceful curl of smoke wreathing up from the valley beyond the measured musical tinkle of bells as the cows slowly descended the distant hills and over all like gods mantling mercy a summer sky involuntarily she stretched out her arms to the bending heavens and her lips moved but no sound escaped to tell what petition went forth to the ********* she went to her room changed her dress and joined her father at the breakfasttable ************* behind his paper he took no notice of her quiet good morning seeming absorbed in an editorial the silent meal ended he said as they left the table i want to see you in the library she followed him without comment he locked the door threw open the blinds and drew two chairs to the window seating himself immediately in front of her for a moment he eyed her earnestly as if measuring her strength and she saw the peculiar sparkle in his ****** eye which like the first lurid flash in a darkened sky betokened tempests irene i was very much astonished to learn the result of an interview between hugh and yourself i can scarcely believe that you were in earnest and feel disposed to attribute your foolish words to some trifling motive of girlish ******** or momentary pique you have long been perfectly well aware that you and your cousin were destined for each other that i solemnly promised the marriage should take place as soon as you were of age that all my plans and hopes for you centred in this one engagement i have not pressed the matter on your attention of late because i knew you had sense enough to appreciate your position and because i believed you would be guided by my wishes in this important affair you are no longer a child i treat you as a reasonable woman and now i tell you candidly it is the one wish of my heart to see you hughs wife father my happiness will not be promoted by this marriage and if you are actuated solely by this motive allow me to remain just as i am i should be most miserable as hughs wife most utterly miserable why so father my own feelings stand an everlasting barrier to our union i do not love hugh **** must tell you sir that i think it wrong for cousins to marry you talk like a silly child i thought you had more sense your objections i have listened to they are imaginary and trifling and i ask you as a father has a right to ask his child to waive these ridiculous notions and grant the only request i have ever made of you tell me my daughter that you will consent to accept your cousin and thereby make me happy he stooped and kissed her forehead watching her countenance eagerly oh father do not ask this of me anything else anything else answer me my darling child give me your promise his hold was painful and an angry pant mingled with the pleading tones she raised her head and said slowly my father i cannot he threw her hand from him and sprang up ingrate do you mean to say that you will not fulfil a sacred ************** you will break an oath given to the dead i do not hold myself bound by the oaths of another though he were twice my father i am responsible for no acts but my own i only can give myself away why should you wish to force this marriage on me father do you think that a woman has no voice in a matter involving her happiness for life oh i suspected that your cursed obstinacy would meet me here as well as elsewhere in your life you have been a source of trouble and sorrow from your birth but the time has come to end all this you know that i never menace idly and if you refuse to hear reason i will utterly ********** you though you are my only child ponder it well you have been raised in luxury and taught to believe yourself one of the wealthiest ********* in the state contrast your present position your elegant home your fastidious tastes gratified to the utmost contrast all this i say with ************** yourself left in the world without one cent think of it think of it my wealth is my own mark you and i will give it to whom i please irrespective of all claims of custom now the alternative is fully before you and on your own head be the consequences will you accede to my wishes as any ******* child should or will you deliberately incur my everlasting displeasure will you marry hugh father i will not marry hugh so help me god silence fell between them for several moments something in that fixed calm face of his child awed him but it was temporary and with a bitter laugh he exclaimed oh very well your poverty be upon your own head in coming years when the grave closes over me at my death every cent of my property passes to hugh and with it my name and between you and me as an impassable gulf lies my everlasting displeasure understand that though we live here in one house as father and child i do not and will not forgive you you have defied me now eat the bitter fruit of your disobedience i have no desire to question the disposition of your wealth if you prefer to give it to my cousin i am willing perfectly willing i enjoy wealth as well as most people do i suppose but poverty does not frighten me half so much as a loveless marriage give hugh your fortune if you wish but father father let there be no estrangement between you and me i can bear everything but your displeasure i dread nothing so much as the loss of your love oh father forgive a disappointment which my conscience would not permit me to avert forgive the pain which god knows i would not have caused you if i could have avoided it without ************ principle oh my father my father let not dollars and cents stand between you and your only child i ask nothing now but your love she drew nearer but he waved her off and said with a sneering laugh away with all such cant i gave you the choice and you made your selection with your eyes fully open accept poverty as your doom and with it my eternal displeasure i intend to make you suffer for your obstinacy you shall find to your sorrow that i am not to be trifled with or my name is not leonard huntingdon now go your own way and find what a thorny path you have made for yourself he pointed to the door as he had done years before when the boardingschool decree went forth and without remonstrance she left him and sat down on the steps of the greenhouse soon after the sound of his buggy wheels told her that he had gone to town and leaning her cheek on her hand she recalled the painful conversation from first to last that he meant all he had threatened and more she did not question for an instant and thinking of her future she felt sick at heart but with the shame and sorrow came also a thrill of joy she had burst the fetters she was free wounded affection bled freely but brain and conscience exulted in the result the patient work of twelve months drew to a close the study of years bore its first fruit the last delicate yet quivering touch was given electra threw down palette and brush and stepping back surveyed the canvas the exhibition would open within two days and this was to be her contribution a sadeyed cassandra with pallid prescient ********* ********** overmastering face wherein the flickering light of ********** struggled feebly with the human horror of the ****** whose hideous mysteries were known only to the royal prophetess in mute

exultation flashed in her beautiful eyes the door opened and russell came into the studio she was not expecting him his sudden appearance gave her no time to adjust the chilling mask of pride and all her ************ affection found eloquent language in the joyful face russell my own dear russell he drew his arm around her and kissed her flushed cheek and each looked at the other wondering at the changes which years had wrought electra you have certainly improved more than anyone i ever knew you look the ************* of perfect health it is needless to ask how you are and again his lips touched the beaming face pressed against his shoulder her arms stole tremblingly around his neck past indifference was forgotten in the joy of his presence sit down and let me look at you you have grown so tall and commanding that i am half afraid of my own cousin you are less like aunt amy than formerly allow me to look at your painting first for it will soon be too dark to examine it this is the cassandra of which you wrote me he stood before it for some moments in silence and she watched him with breathless ************ his opinion was of more value to her than that of all the ********** and ************ who would soon inspect it gradually his dark cold face kindled and she had her reward it is a masterly creation a thing of wonderful and imperishable beauty it is a great ********* such the world will receive itand hundreds will proclaim your triumph i am proud of it and doubly proud of you he held out his hand and as she put her fingers in his her head drooped and hot tears blinded her praise from the lips she loved best stirred her womanly heart as the applause of the public could never do come sit down electra and tell me something of your life since the death of your friend mr clifton did you receive my last letter giving an account of mrs cliftons death yes just as i stepped upon the platform of the cars it was handed to me i had heard nothing from you for so long that i thought it was time to look after you you had started then before you knew that i was going to europe yes he could not understand the instantaneous change which came over her ************** illumination followed as suddenly by a smile half compassionate half bitter she pressed one hand to her heart and said mrs clifton never seemed to realize her sons death though after paralysis took place and she became speechless i thought she recovered her memory in some degree she survived him just four months and doubtless was saved much grief by her unconsciousness of what had occurred poor old lady she suffered little for a year past and died i hope without pain i have the consolation of knowing that i did all that could be done to promote her comfort russell i would not live here for any consideration nothing but a sense of duty has detained me this long i promised him that i would not forsake his mother but you can have no adequate conception of the feeling of desolation which comes over me when i sit here during the long evenings he seems watching me from ************* and ********* his face his pleading patient wan face haunts me perpetually and yet i tried to make him happy god knows i did my duty she sprang up and paced the room for some moments with her hands behind her and tears glittering on her cheeks pausing at last on the rug she pointed to a large square object closely shrouded and added yonder stands his last picture unfinished the day he died he put a few feeble strokes upon it and bequeathed the completion of the task to me for several years he worked occasionally on it but much remains to be done it is the death of socrates i have not even looked at it since that night i do not intend to touch it until after i visit italy i doubt whether my hand will ever be steady enough to give the last strokes oh russell the olden time the cottage days seem far far off to me now leaning against the mantelpiece she dropped her head on

she raised her head and looked up at the powerful ***************** form the grand ****** face calm and ********** the large searching black eyes within whose baffling depths lay all the mysteries of

assigned me i have bought the cottage and intend to build a handsome house there some day where you and mr campbell and i can live peacefully you shall ***** your sthetic fancies all about it to make

kind and generous russell and for all that you have offered me i thank you from the depth of a full heart the consciousness of your continued interest and affection is inexpressibly precious but my

of the family nothing except that the lady who is an old friend of my aunt is threatened with consumption and has been advised to spend a year or two in florence aunt ruth took me to see her the other day she seems intelligent and agreeable and i ******* i shall find her kind and pleasant enough since such is the programme you have marked out i trust that no disappointments await you and that all

with you all that i possess you are ********* in an experiment which thousands have tried before you and wrecked happiness upon but i have no right to control your future and certainly no desire to discourage you at all events i hope our separation will be brief a short silence followed broken at last by electra who watched him keenly as she spoke tell me something about irene of course in a small town like w you must see her frequently by no means i think i have seen her but three times since her ************* riding with her father then accidentally at church and again a few evenings before i left at the graveyard where she was dressing a tombstone with flowers there we exchanged a few words for the first time and this reminds me that i am bearer of a message yet *********** she inquired after you and desired me to tender you her love and best wishes i have her here in ******* tell me what you think of the likeness she took down a portfolio and selected the head of her quondam playmate holding it under the gaslight and still scrutinizing her cousins countenance he took it and looked gravely earnestly at the lovely features it scarcely does her justice i doubt whether any portrait ever will beside the expression of her face has changed materially since this was sketched there is a harder outline now about her mouth less of ********** in the eyes more of cold hauteur in the whole face if you desire it i can in one line of tennyson photograph her proud beauty as i saw her mounted on her favourite horse the week that i left home he laid the drawing back in the open portfolio crossed the room and took up his hat where are you going russell cant you spend the evening with me at aunt ***** no thank you i must go there is to be a great political meeting at ******* hall tonight and i am particularly anxious to attend what are you too engaged in watching the ************ of the political *** yes i am most deeply interested no true lover of his country can fail to be so at this juncture how long will you be in new york since i cannot persuade you to return with me my stay here will be shortened one of our courts meets soon and though mr campbell will be there to attend to the cases i want if possible to be present i shall return day after tomorrow and now good night i will see you early in the morning the door closed behind him and she remained standing for some time just as he left her slowly the folded hands shrank from each other and dropped nerveless to her side the bright glow in her cheeks the dash of crimson on her lips faded from both the whole face relaxed into an expression of hopeless agony dont you know that even granite ********** finally grind themselves into ********** powder you give yourself no rest aubrey and human machinery wears rapidly simply for this reason i sent for you to come and take a cup of tea with me i have been too much engaged of late to spare an evening to merely social claims a man whose life rests at his feet to be lifted to some fitting pedestal has little leisure for the luxury of friendly visiting the two were in eric mitchells pleasant library russell sat in an armchair and the master of the house reclined on a lounge drawn near the hearth the mellow glow of the lamp the flash and crackle of the fire the careless lazy posture of the invalid all betokened quiet comfort save the dark fixed face and erect restless figure of the guest but aubrey you have not asked my opinion of your speech i was not aware that you heard it of course not but i read it and let me tell you it was a great speech a masterly argument that will make a lasting impression upon the people it has greatly changed the vote of this county already you mistake appearances the seed fell in good soil but party spirit came as fowls of the air and devoured it at any rate it produced a profound impression on public opinion and startled some of our political patriarchs no a mere transitory effect they have folded their arms and gone to sleep again i am of course gratified by your favourable appreciation of my effort but i differ with you as to its result the surging waves of northern faction and fanaticism already break ominously against our ************ constitutional ***** and if the south would strengthen her ******** there is no time to be slept or ******** away as he spoke russells eye fell upon a large oval vase on the mantelpiece filled with rare exotics whose graceful tendrils were ********** disposed into a perfumed fringe rising he looked carefully at the brilliant hues and said as he bent to ****** their fragrance where did you grow such flowers at this season irene brings them almost every day from the greenhouse on the hill she takes a peculiar pleasure in arranging them in my vases i think she stood a halfhour yesterday twining and bending those stems the way she wanted them to hang they are so brittle that i snap the blossoms off but in her hands they seem ******* enough russell withdrew the fingers which had wandered caressingly amid the delicate leaves and ********* himself took a book from his pocket he drew his chair nearer the lamp and began to read aloud nearly a halfhour passed thus when the library door was opened hastily and irene came in dressed magnificently in party costume she stood a moment irresolute and surprised with her eyes fixed on russells then both bowed silently and she came to the fire how are you uncle eric you look flushed feverish she laid her cold pearly hand on his forehead and stood at his side tolerably comfortable thanks to mr aubrey who has made me almost forget my headache you will be *********** late at the party tonight yes as usual but for a better reason than because i wish to be fashionable i wanted to know how you were and as father was not quite ready i came in advance and sent the carriage back for him and hugh i was not aware that you were in mr aubreys hands for the evening you were reading i believe pardon my intrusion and do not let me interrupt you she stood still a moment listening good night uncle eric the carriage is coming i believe i should know the tramp of those horses amid a regiment of cavalry why need you hurry off let your father come in i will spare him that trouble good night mr aubrey she turned to leave the room but in gathering her cloak around her dropped her fan russell stooped to pick it up and as he restored it their hands met his brow flushed but not even the pale pearly glow of a ******** crept to her cheek again she raised her eyes to his and a haughty dazzling smile flashed over her face as she inclined her head thank you sir there was a brief silence broken by eric when the sound of the carriage had died away irene is the only perfectly beautiful woman i ever saw and yet aubrey it makes me sad to watch her countenance whenever i see her i cannot avoid recalling an old scandinavian myth she realizes so fully my ideal ***** standing at the portals of ******** offering apples of immortality he returned at once to his book and read several pages occasionally pausing to call attention to some special passage finally he rose and took his hat it is early yet aubrey dont go thank you i must fulfil another engagement a word before you leave will you be a candidate for the legislature yes i was waited upon by a committee today and my name will be announced tomorrow good night slowly he walked back to town and once upon the main street took a new pair of gloves from his pocket fitted them carefully and directed his steps to the elegant residence whose approach was wellnigh blocked up with carriages this was the second time that he had been invited by the ********** and he had almost determined to decline as formerly but something in irenes chill manner changed his resolution he knew from various circumstances that the social edict against him was being revoked in fashionable circles that because he had risen without its permission aid or countenance and in defiance of its sneers the world was beginning to court him a gloomy scowl sat on his stern lips as he mounted the steps of the mansion from which his meek and suffering mother had borne bundles of plain work or delicate masses of embroidery for the mother and daughter who passed her in the street with a ************ stare ********* suddenly awoke to the recollection that after all mrs aubrey belonged to one of the wealthiest and first families in the state at first russell had proudly repelled all overtures but gradually he was possessed by a desire to rule in the very circle which had so long excluded his family most fully he appreciated his position and the motives which actuated the social ********* of w he was no longer the poor disgraced clerk but the talented young lawyer and prospective heir of mr campbells wealth bitterly bitterly came memories of early trial and now the haughtiness of irenes manner stung him as nothing else could possibly have done he was at a loss to comprehend this change in one who had dared so much in order to assist his family and proud defiance arose in his heart it was ten oclock the fte was at its height the sound of music the shimmer of jewels and rustle of costly silks mingled with the hum of conversation and the tread of dancing feet as russell deposited hat and overcoat in the dressingroom and entered the blazing parlours the ********* had just ended and gay groups chattered in the centre of the room among these maria henderson leaning on hughs arm and grace harris who had been dancing with louis henderson as russell crossed the floor to speak to the host and hostess all eyes turned upon him and a sudden hush fell on the merry ******* coaxed at last within the pale of civilization how did you contrive it louis asked maria oh he declined when i invited him but i believe father saw him afterward and renewed the request do observe him talking to mother he is as polished as if he had spent his life at court he is a man whom i never fancied but that two hours speech of his was certainly the finest effort i ever listened to csars ambition was moderate in comparison with aubreys and somehow even against my will i cant help admiring him he is so coolly independent said hugh eyeing him curiously i heard father say that the democrats intend to send him to the legislature next term and the opposition are bothered to match him fully by the way they speak of mr huntingdon for their candidate but here comes your hero miss maria as he spoke charlie harris drew back a few steps and suffered russell to speak to the young lady of the house irene stood not far off talking to the governor of the state who chanced to be on a brief visit to w and quite near her judge harris and her father were in earnest conversation astonished at the sudden apparition her eyes followed him as he bowed to the member of the central group and as she heard the deep rich voice above the **** of small talk she waited to see if he would notice her soon governor g gave her his arm for a promenade and she found herself ere long very near maria who was approaching with russell he was saying something at which she laughed *********** just then his eye fell on irene there was no token of recognition on the part of either but the governor in passing put out his hand to shake russells and asked for mr campbell again and again they met during the ensuing hour but no greeting was exchanged then he disappeared as irene leaned against the *********** in the crowded supperroom she heard charlie harris gaily ********* maria on the events of the evening what have you done with aubrey i will challenge him before tomorrow morning for cutting me out of my *********** with his ***** chat oh he left a halfhour ago excused himself to mother on the plea of starting off to court at daybreak he is perfectly fascinating dont you think so grace such eyes and lips and such a forehead once more in his own room at the quiet boardinghouse russell lighted the ********* over a small desk and sat down to a mass of papers the apartment was cold the fire had long since died out the hearth looked ashy and desolate the measured tones of the watchman on the ********* recalled him finally from his work he took off his watch and wound it up it wanted but three hours to dawn but he heeded it not the sight of the massive old watch brought vividly back the boyish days of sorrow and he sat thinking of that morning of shame when irene came close to him nestling her soft little hand in his and from some ********** dark chill chamber of memory leaped sweet silvery childish echoes oh russell if i could only help you since his return from europe he had accustomed himself to think of her as hughs wife but he found it daily more difficult to realize that she could willingly give her hand to her ******** selfindulgent cousin and now the alteration in her manner toward him perplexed and grieved him did she suspect the truth and fear that he might presume on her charity in bygone years to his proud spirit this was a suggestion singularly insulting and he had resolved to show her in future that he claimed not even a nod of recognition instead of avoiding her as formerly he would seek occasions to exhibit an indifference which he little thought that her womanly heart would rightly interpret he had found it more difficult than he supposed to keep his attention chained to marias and graces gay nonsense to prevent his eyes from wandering to the face whose image was enshrined in his lonely heart and now with complex feelings of tenderness and angry defiance he sought his pillow for a short respite before the journey that waited but for daylight for a few weeks all w was ***** with interest in the impending election newspaper columns ****** with caustic articles and huntingdon and aubrey clubs ******** each other with the usual acrimony of such occasions mr campbells influence was extensive but the huntingdon supporters were powerful and the result seemed doubtful until the week previous to the election when russell who had as yet taken no active part accepted the challenge of his opponent to a public discussion the meeting was held in front of the courthouse the massive stone steps serving as a temporary ******* the night was dark and cloudy but huge bonfires blazing barrels of pitch threw a lurid glare over the broad street now converted into a surging sea of human heads surrounded by a committee of select friends mr huntingdon sat confident of success and when the **** of ******* ceased he came forward and addressed the assembly in an hours speech as a warm and rather prominent politician he was habituated to the task and bursts of applause from his own party frequently attested the effect of his easy graceful style and pungent irony blinded by personal hate and hurried on by the excitement of the hour he neglected the cautious policy which had hitherto been observed and finally launched into a fierce ********* against his ***************** up for derision the melancholy fate of his father and sneeringly denouncing the audacious pretensions of a political ******** groans and ****** greeted this unexpected peroration and many of his own friends bit their lips and bent their brows in angry surprise as he took his seat amid an uproar which would have been respectable even in the days of the builders of ***** russell was sitting on the upper step with his head leaning on his hand and his eyes fixed on the mass of upturned eager faces listening patiently to the lengthy address expecting just what he was destined to hear at the mention of his family misfortunes he lifted his head rose and advancing a few steps took off his hat and stood confronting the speaker in full view of the excited crowd and there the red light flaring over his features showed a calm stern *********** man who felt that he had nothing to blush for in the past or to dread in future when the tirade ended when the tumult ceased and silence fell upon the audience he turned and fixed his deep glowing eyes full on the face of his opponent for one moment smiling haughtily then as mr huntingdon quailed before his withering gaze he crossed his arms over his chest and addressed the meeting he came he said to discuss questions of grave import to the state not the pedigree or antecedents of his antagonist with which he supposed the public had no concern briefly he stated the issues dividing the people of the state warned the opposition of the probable results of their policy if triumphant and with resistless eloquence pleaded for a firm maintenance of the principles of his own party he was he averred no ******** but he proclaimed that the people slept upon the thin heaving crust of a volcano which would inevitably soon burst forth and the period was rapidly approaching when the southern states unless united and on the alert would lie bound at the feet of an insolent and ********* northern faction he demanded that through the legislatures the states should appeal to congress for certain restrictions and guarantees which if denied would justify extreme measures on the part of the people the mans marvellous magnetism was never more triumphantly attested the mass who had listened in profound silence to every syllable which had passed his lips now ****** their enthusiasm in prolonged and vociferous applause as he descended the steps and disappeared amid the shouts of the crowd judge harris turned to mr huntingdon and said with illconcealed annoyance you have lost your election by your confounded imprudence the judge walked off pondering a heavy bet which he had relative to the result by sunrise on the day of the election the roads leading to town were crowded with voters making their way to the polls the *************** were full to overflowing the sidewalks thronged with reeling groups as the day advanced because the huntingdon side bribed freely the aubrey partisans felt that they must from necessity follow the disgraceful precedent not a lady showed her face upon the street drinking wrangling fighting was the order of the day windows were smashed buggies overturned and the police exercised to the utmost accompanied by a few friends mr huntingdon rode from **** to **** encouraging his supporters and drawing heavily upon his purse while russell remained quietly in his office well assured of the result at five oclock when the town polls closed russells votes showed a majority of two hundred and fortyfour couriers came in constantly from country precincts with equally favourable accounts and at ten oclock it was ascertained beyond doubt that he was elected irene and her uncle rode down to learn the truth and not knowing where to find mr huntingdon stopped the carriage at the corner of the main street and waited a few moments very soon a ****** whizzed through the air a band of music struck up before russells office and a number of his adherents insisted that he should show himself on the balcony a crowd immediately collected opposite cheering the successful candidate and calling for a speech he came out and in a few happy dignified words thanked them for the honour conferred and pledged himself to guard most faithfully the interests committed to his keeping after the noisy constituents had retired he stood talking to some friends when he chanced to recognize the fiery horses across the street the *********** was thrown back and by the neighbouring gaslight he saw irenes white face turned toward him then the horses sprang off mr campbell noticed without understanding the sudden start and bitter though triumphant smile that crossed his face in the midst of pleasant ************ go home andrew i know now what i came to learn irene sank back and folded her mantle closer around her dont you think irene that aubrey deserves to succeed yes her dreary tone disconcerted him and he offered no further comment little suspecting that her hands were pressed hard against her heart and that her voiceless sorrow was henceforth we must be still more estranged a wider gulf from this night divides us two years rolled on stained with the tears of many ringing with the songs and laughter of a fortunate few the witchery of southern spring again enveloped w and irene stood on the lawn surveying the greenery of the outdoor world that surrounded her in this womans sad but intensely calm countenance a joyless life found silent history she felt that her life was passing rapidly ********** and aimless she knew that her years instead of being fragrant with the mellow fruitage of good deeds were tedious and joyless and that the gaunt numbing hand of ennui was closing upon her the elasticity of spirits the ******** of youth had given place to a species of ******* mute apathy a mental and moral paralysis was stealing over her the slamming of the ponderous iron gate attracted her attention and she saw a carriage ascending the avenue as it reached a point opposite to the spot where she stood it halted the door was thrown open and a gentleman stepped out and approached her the form was not familiar and the straw hat partially veiled the features but he paused before her and said with a genial smile dont you know me oh harvey my brother my great guardian angel a glad light kindled in her face and she stretched out her hands with the eagerness of a delighted child time had pressed heavily upon him wrinkles were conspicuous about the corners of his eyes and mouth and the black hair had become a steely grey holding her hands he drew her nearer to him scrutinized her features and a look of keen sorrow crossed his own as he said almost inaudibly i feared as much i feared as much the shadow has spread you kept ***** faith with me sir you promised to write and failed i sent you one letter but it was never answered through no fault of mine irene i never received it believe me true i expected to write to you frequently when i parted with you but subsequently determined that it would be best not to do so attribute my silence however to every other cause than want of remembrance god only knows how i have wanted how i have needed you to guide and strengthen me she raised the two hands that still held hers and bowed her forehead upon them for some moments silence reigned then standing before him irene said with touching pathos my friend i am so desolate so lonely i am drifting down the current of life aimless hopeless useless what shall i do with my future i believe i am slowly ********** i neither suffer nor enjoy as formerly my feelings are ******** i am growing callous indifferent to everything i am fast losing sympathy for the sorrows of others swallowed up in self oblivious of the noble aspirations of promise once more i ask you what shall i do with my life give it to god ah there is neither grace nor virtue in necessity he will not accept the worthless thing thrown at his feet as a dernier ressort once it was my choice but the pure cleareyed faith of my childhood shook hands with me when you left me in new york for a short while he struggled with himself striving to overcome the unconquerable impulse which suddenly prompted him and his face grew pallid as hers as he walked hastily across the smooth grass and came back to her her countenance was lifted toward the neighbouring hill her thoughts evidently far away when he paused before her and said ********** irene my beloved give yourself to me go with me into gods vineyard let us work together and consecrate our lives to his service the mesmeric eyes gazed into his full of wonder and the rich ruby tint fled from her lips as she pondered his words in unfeigned astonishment and shaking her regal head answered slowly harvey i am not worthy i want your counsel not your pity pity you mistake me if you have been ignorant so long know now that i have loved you from the evening you first sat in my study looking over my foreign sketches you were then a child but i was a man and i knew all that you had so suddenly become to me because of this great disparity in years and because i dared not hope that one so tenderly nurtured could ever brave the hardships of my projected life i determined to quit new york earlier than i had anticipated and to bury a foolish memory in the ********* forests of the far west i ought to have known the fallacy of my expectation i have proved it since your face followed me your eyes met mine at every turn your glittering hair swept on every breeze that touched my cheek irene you are young and singularly beautiful and i am a ********** man much much older than yourself but if you live a thousand years you will never find such affection as i offer you now there is nothing on earth which would make me so happy as the possession of your love you are the only woman i have ever seen whom i even wish to call my ******* only woman who i felt could lend new charm to life and make my quiet hearth happier by her presence irene will you share my future can you give me what i ask the temptation was *********** future he held out ******** indeed the strong holy manly love the noble heart and head to guide her the firm tender hand to support her the constant congenial and delightful **************** this passed swiftly through her mind but crushing all in its grasp came the memory of one whom she rarely met but who held undisputed sway over her proud heart drawing close to the minister she laid her hands on his shoulder and looking reverently up into his fine face said in her peculiarly sweet clear voice the knowledge of your priceless unmerited love makes me proud beyond degree but i would not mock you by the miserable and only return i could make youthe affection of a devoted sister that i do not love you as you wish is my great misfortune for i appreciate most fully the noble privilege you have tendered me i trust that the pain i may give you now will soon pass away and that in time you will forget one who is utterly *********** of the honour you have conferred on her today oh harvey do not i beg of you let one thought of me ever disquiet your noble generous heart a shiver crept over her still face and she dropped her pale forehead she felt two tears fall upon her hair and in silence he bent down and kissed her softly tenderly as one kisses a sleeping babe oh harvey do not let it grieve you dear friend he smiled sadly as if not daring to trust himself in words then after a moment laying his hands upon her head in the baptism of a deathless love he gently and solemnly blessed her when his fingers were removed she raised her eyes but he had gone she saw only the retreating form through the green arches of the grand old avenue says ********* the industry of men is now so far exhausted in ********** for places that none is left for fulfilling the duties of them and the history of our government furnishes a melancholy parallel the regular *********** storm had swept over the nation ******** had been held and platforms fiercely fought for to be kicked away

said sometimes covers the location of the ************* ********* of ****** having taken an active and prominent part in the presidential campaign and made frequent speeches russell found himself again opposed by mr huntingdon who was equally indefatigable during the exciting contest the old feud received if possible additional acrimony and there were no bounds to the maledictions heaped upon the young and imperturbable ********** by his virulent antagonist many predicted a duel or a street encounter but weeks passed and though in casual meetings mr huntingdons glare of hate was always answered by a mocking smile of cold disdain the cloud floated off without breaking into bloody showers mr mitchells health had failed so rapidly as winter approached that dr arnold persuaded him to try the efficacy of a ********* and he had accordingly sailed from new orleans in a vessel bound for genoa irene begged the privilege of accompanying him but her father peremptorily refused and she saw her uncle depart and superintended the closing of his house with silent sorrow and the feeling of one who knows that the night is deepening around her late in the afternoon of christmas day irene went into the greenhouse to gather a bouquet for an invalid friend in town and had almost accomplished her errand when the crash and **** of wheels drew her to the window that looked out on the lawn her father had gone to the plantation early that morning and she had scarcely time to conjecture whom the visitor would prove when hughs loud voice rang through the house and soon after he came clattering in with the end of his pantaloons tucked into his boots and his whip trailing along in true boyish fashion as he threw down his hat scattering the petals of a snowy ******** and drew near his cousin she saw that his face was deeply flushed and his eyes somewhat bloodshot hugh what are you doing here father expected you to overtake him at crescent bend you said last night that you would start by five oclock merry christmas my beauty i have come for my christmas gift give it to me like the queen you are he stooped as if to kiss her but she shrank back instantly and said gravely you ought not to make promises which you have no idea of keeping father will be annoyed and wonder very much what has happened he was anxious that you should go with him oh confound the plantation i wish it would sink of all other days none but christmas will suit him to tramp down there through mud and mire the fact is i did not go to sleep till four oclock and nobody ought to be *********** enough to expect me to wake up in an hour you may be quiet though for i am on my way now to that paradise of black mud i only stopped to get a glimpse of you my ****** my ******* so dont ******** i pray you better wait till daylight hugh you know the state of the roads and condition of the bridges it will be safer and an economy of time to defer it till morning since you have made it so late no i must go tonight for i have an engagement to ride with maria henderson and i cant get back in time if i wait till tomorrow morning i want to start back day after tomorrow as for time wildfire will make it the better for the darkness he is as much afraid of night and shadows as if he had a conscience and had ********** it ********** i shall convince him that all *** ********* witches are in full pursuit and his matchless heels his only salvation a shade of apprehension settled on her face and placing the bouquet in a basket she turned to her cousin saying indeed you cannot be insane enough to drive that horse such a night as this weather threatens if go you will in the face of a coming rain leave wildfire here and drive one of the ************** instead i shall be uneasy if you start with that vicious unmanageable incarnation of lightning let me ring the bell and direct andrew to make the change she stepped into the parlour adjoining and laid her fingers on the ******** but he snatched up the hand and kissed it several times no ill be hanged if i dont drive my own pearl of arabia i can manage him well enough and beside what do you care whether he breaks my neck or not without *********** you broke my heart which is much the greater catastrophe come into the library you dont know what you are saying she drew him into the room where a warm fire burned cheerfully and made him sit down where did you go last night when you left here tell me to harry ***** a party of us were invited there to drink eggnog and of course found something stronger afterward then we had a game or so of ***** and the grand finale is that i have had a ****** headache all day ah my sweet saint how shocked you are to be sure now dont lecture or i shall be off like a flash without answering she rang the bell and quietly looped back the heavy crimson curtains what is that for have you sent for john or old nellie to carry me upstairs like other bad boys sent to bed in disgrace without even the cold comfort of supper hush hugh hush turning to john who opened the door and looked in she said tell william to make some strong coffee as soon as possible mas hugh has a headache and wants some before he leaves thank you my angel my unapproachable **** ugh how cold it is pardon me but i really must warm my feet he threw them carelessly on the fender of the grate shall i get you a pair of slippers could not afford the luxury positively have not the time to indulge myself with a prolonged **** he laid his head back and closed his eyes an expression of disgust was discernible in his companions countenance but it passed like the shadow of a summer cloud and she sat down at the opposite side of the fireplace with her eyes bent upon the hearth and the long silky lashes sweeping her cheeks a silence of some minutes ensued finally she exclaimed here comes your coffee put the waiter on the table john and tell andrew to take mas hughs buggy do nothing of the kind but send somebody to open that everlasting gate which would not have disgraced ancient ****** are you classical john be off and see about it i must start in five minutes hugh be reasonable for once in your life you are not in a proper condition to drive that horse for my sake at least be persuaded to wait till morning will you not remain to oblige me oh hang my condition i tell you i must and i will go if all the stars fall and judgment day overtakes me on the road what splendid coffee you always have the most fastidious of ******* could not find it in his ******* heart to complain he put on his hat buttoned his costly fur coat and flourishing his whip came close to his cousin goodbye beauty i hate to leave you upon my word i do but duty before pleasure my ************ ********* i have not had my christmas present yet and have it i will on one condition hugh that you drive cautiously and ********** instead of thundering down hills and over bridges like some express train behind time will you promise to be sure i will everything in the world and am ready to swear it if you are sceptical well then goodbye hugh and take care of yourself she allowed him to press his hot lips to hers and accompanying him to the door saw him jump into the frail ********** buggy wildfire plunged and sprang off in his usual style and with a crack of the whip and wave of his hat hugh was fairly started seven hours later irene sat alone at the library table absorbed in writing an article on ******** ******* theory for the scientific journal to which she occasionally contributed over the signature of ***** gradually her thoughts wandered from the completed task to other themes of scarcely less interest the week previous she had accompanied hugh to an ******** concert given by the ****** troupe and had been astonished to find russell seated on the bench in front of her he so rarely showed himself on such occasions that his appearance elicited some comment they had met frequently since the evening at mr mitchells but he pertinaciously avoided recognizing her and on this particular night though he came during an interlude to speak to grace harris who sat on the same row of seats with irene he never once directed his eyes toward the latter this studied neglect she felt assured was not the result of the bitter animosity existing between her father and himself and though it puzzled her for a while she began finally to suspect the true nature of his feelings and with womans rarely erring instincts laid her finger on the real motive which prompted him the report of his engagement to grace had reached her some days before and now it ******** to her mind like a haunting spectre she did not believe for an instant that he was attached to the pretty joyous girl whom rumour gave him but she was well aware that he was ambitious of high social position and feared that he might possibly from selfish ignoble reasons seek an alliance with judge harris only daughter knowing that the family was one of the wealthiest and most aristocratic in the state life had seemed dreary enough before but with this apprehension added it appeared insupportable and she was conscious of a degree of wretchedness never dreamed of or realized heretofore not even a sigh escaped her she was one of a few women who permit no external evidences of suffering but lock it securely in their own proud hearts the painful reverie might perhaps have lasted till the pallid dawn looked in with tearful eyes at the window but paragon who was sleeping on the rug at her feet started up and growled she raised her head and listened but only the ticking of the clock was audible and the wailing of the wind through the leafless poplars down paragon hush sir she patted his head ********** and he sank back a few seconds in quiet then sprang up with a loud bark this time she heard an indistinct sound of steps in the hall and thought nellie sees my light through the window and is coming to coax me upstairs something stumbled near the threshold a hand struck the knob as if in hunting for it the door opened softly and muffled in his heavy cloak holding his hat in one hand russell aubrey stood in the room neither spoke but he looked at her with such mournful earnestness such eager yet grieved compassion that she read some terrible disaster in his eyes the years of estrangement all that had passed since their childhood was forgotten studied conventionalities fell away at the sight of him standing there for the first time in her home she crossed the room with a quick uncertain step and put out her hands toward ******** horrible apprehension blanching the beautiful lips which asked *********** what is it russell what is it he took the cold little hands tremblingly in his and endeavoured to draw her back to the hearth but she repeated what has happened is it father or hugh your father is well i believe i passed him on the road yesterday sit down miss huntingdon you look pale and faint her fingers closed tightly over his he saw an ***** hue settle on her face and in an unnaturally calm low tone she asked is hugh dead oh my god why dont you speak russell he did not suffer much his death was too sudden her face had such a stony look that he would have passed his arm around her but could not disengage his hand she seemed to cling to it as if for strength wont you let me carry you to your room or call a servant you are not able to stand she neither heeded nor heard him was it that horse or how was it one of the bridges had been swept away by the freshet and in trying to cross he missed the ford the horse must have been frightened and unmanageable the buggy was overturned in the creek and your cousin stunned by the fall drowned instantly life was just extinct when i reached him something like a moan escaped her as she listened was anything done we tried every means of ************* but they were entirely ineffectual she relaxed her clasp of his fingers and moved toward the door where are you going miss huntingdon indeed you must sit down russell you have brought him home where is he without waiting for an answer she walked down the hall and paused suddenly at the sight of the still form resting on a grey ***************** with a lantern at its head and an elderly man a stranger sitting near keeping watch russell came to her side and drawing his arm around her made her lean upon him he felt the long long lingering shudder which shook the elegant queenly figure then she slipped down beside the rigid sleeper and smoothed back from the fair brow the dripping curling auburn hair hugh my cousin my playmate snatched away in an hour from the life you loved so well ah the curse of our house has fallen upon you it is but the beginning of the end only two of us are left and we too shall soon be caught up to join you she kissed the icy lips which a few hours ago had pressed hers so warmly and rising walked up and down the long hall russell once more approached her are you entirely alone yes except the servants oh russell how am i to break this to my father he loves that boy better than everything else infinitely better than he ever loved me how shall i tell him that hugh is ******** a messenger has already gone to inform him of what has happened and this distressing task will not be yours herbert blackwell and i were riding together on our return from t when we reached the ford where the disaster occurred finding that all our efforts to *********** were useless he turned back and went to your fathers plantation to break the sad intelligence to him his soothing tender tone touched some chord deep in her strange nature and unshed tears gathered for the first time in her eyes as you have no friend near enough to call upon at present i will if you desire it wake the servants remain and do all that is necessary until morning if you please russell i shall thank you very much as her glance fell upon her cousins gleaming face her lip fluttered and she turned away and sat down on one of the sofas in the parlour dropping her face in her hands a little while after the light of a candle streamed in and russell came with a cushion from the library lounge and his warm cloak he wrapped the latter carefully about the drooping form and would have placed her head on the silken pillow but she silently resisted without looking up and he left her it was a vigil which she never forgot the fire had died out entirely the curtains were drawn back to let in the day on the library table the startling glare of white linen showed the outlines of the cold young sleeper and russell slowly paced the floor his arms crossed as was their habit and his powerful form *********** erect she stood by the table ************** then folded down the sheet and exposed the handsome ********** face she studied it long and quietly and with no burst of emotion laid her flowers against his cheek and mouth and scattered the geraniums over his pulseless heart i begged him not to start yesterday and he answered that he would go if the stars fell and judgment day overtook him sometimes we are prophets unawares his star has ****** day has risen have mercy on his soul oh my god the voice was low and even but wonderfully sweet and in the solemn morning light her face showed itself grey and bloodless no stain of colour on the still lips only the blue cord standing out between the brow sure signs of a deep distress which found no vent russell felt a crushing weight lifted from his heart he saw that she had loved her cousin ********** more and his face flushed when she looked across the table at him with grateful but indescribably melancholy eyes which had never been closed during that night of horror i must now relieve you russell from your friendly watch few would have acted as you have done and for all your generous kindness to poor hugh i thank you most earnestly as well for my father as myself the day may come perhaps when i shall be able to prove my gratitude and the sincerity of my friendship which has never wavered since we were children together until that day farewell russell but believe that i rejoice to hear of your successes she held out her hand and as he took it in his which trembled violently he felt even then that there was no quiver in the ******** fingers and that his name rippled over her lips as calmly as that of the dead had done just before she endured his long searching gaze like any other ***** and he dropped the little pearly hand and quitted the room at ten oclock mr huntingdon returned and with his hat drawn over his eyes went straight to the library he kissed the face of the dead passionately and his sob and violent burst of sorrow told his child of his arrival she lifted her rigid face and extended her arms pleadingly father father here at least you will forgive me he turned from her sternly and answered with bitter emphasis i will not but for you he would have been different and this would never have happened father i have asked for love and pardon for the last time she bent down and kissed her cousin and with a hard bitter expression in her countenance went up to her own room locking out paragon and old nellie who followed cautiously at her heels had kindled her forest conflagration golden maples and ********* cherries crimson ******** and scarlet oaks shook out their ************ and waved their glowing boughs all dashed and speckled ******* and ****** with orange and blood ghastly green and tawny brown the ***** atmosphere which had hung all day in purple folds around the distant hills took a golden haze as the sun sank rapidly and to irenes gaze river and woodland hillside and valley were brimmed with that weird light which never was on sea or land her almost *********** love of nature had grown with her years but a holier element mingled with her adoration now she looked beyond the material veil of beauty and bowed reverently before the ********** spiritual presence since hughs death nearly a year before she had become a recluse availing herself of her mourning dress to decline all social engagements and during these months a narrow path opened before her feet she became a member of the church which she had attended from infancy and her hands closed firmly over her ******** sorrow and want hung out their signs among the poor of w and here silently but ************ she had become not a ministering angel certainly but a generous benefactress a noble sympathetic ******* counsellor whose strong good sense rendered her advice and guidance valuable indeed by a system of rigid economy she was enabled to set apart a small portion of money which she gave judiciously superintending its investment kind hopeful words she scattered like sunshine over every threshold and here and there where she detected smouldering aspiration or incipient appreciation of learning she fanned the spark with some suitable volume from her own library which in more than one instance became the germ the spring of joy for ever frequently her father threw obstacles in her way sneering all the while at her ************* freaks sometimes she affected not to notice the impediments sometimes frankly acknowledged their magnitude and climbed right over them on to her work among the factory operatives she found the greatest need of ************ touches of every kind *********** ********** in some cases almost ********** she occasionally found herself puzzled as to the proper plan to pursue but her womanly heart like the hidden jewelled ****** of a watch guided the womanly hands unerringly this evening as she approached the row of low whitewashed houses a crowd of children swarmed out as usual to stare at her she rode up to a doorstep where a boy of some fourteen years sat sunning himself with an open book on his knee and a pair of crutches beside him at sight of her a bright smile broke over his sickly face and he tried to rise good evening philip dont get up how are you today better i thank you maam but very stiff yet the stiffness will pass off gradually i hope i see you have not finished your book yet how do you like it oh i could bear to be a cripple always if i had plenty like it to read you need not be a cripple but there are plenty more just as good and better which you shall have in time do you think you could hold my horse for me a little while i cant find a suitable place to tie him he is gentle enough if you will only hold the reins certainly maam i shall be glad to hold him as long as you like she dismounted and passed into the adjoining house ********* where poverty stands grim and gaunt on the hearth are rarely ******** and to this dreary class belonged the room where ****** davis had suffered for months watching the sands of life run low and the shadow of death growing longer across the threshold day by day the dust and lint of the ********** had choked the springs of life and on her hollow cheeks glowed the autograph of consumption she stretched out her wasted hand and said ah miss irene i heard your voice outside and it was pleasant to my ears as the sound of the bell when ********* are over i am always glad to see your face but this evening i was longing for you hoping and praying that you would come i am in trouble about what mrs davis nothing serious i hope tell me i dont know how serious it is going to be johnnie is sick in the next room taken yesterday and about noon today susan had to knock off work and come home hester is the only one left and you know she is but a baby to work i dont like to complain of my lot god knows but it seems hard if we are all to be taken down i hope they will not be sick long what is the matter with johnnie dear knows i am sure i dont he complains of the headache and has fever and susan here seems ailing the same way she is as stupid as can ******** all the time my children have had measles and whoopingcough and ********** and scarlet fever and i cant imagine what they are trying to catch now i hear that there is a deal of sickness showing itself in the row have you sent for the doctor asked irene walking around to the other side of the bed and examining ****** pulse yes i sent hester but she said he told her he was too busy to come why did you not apply to some other physician because dr brandon has always attended me and as i sent for him first i didnt know whether any other doctor would like to come you know some of them have very curious notions about their dignity and sometimes while they pause to discuss etiquette humanity suffers susan let me see your tongue who else is sick in the row mrs davis three of tom browns children two of dick ******** and lucy hall and mary ******** miss irene will you be good enough to give me a drink of water hester has gone to try to find some wood and i cant reach the pitcher i brought you some jelly would you like a little now or shall i put it away in the closet thank you i will save it for my johnnie he is so fond of sweet things and poor child he sees em so seldom nowadays there is enough for you and johnnie too eat this while i look after him and see whether he ought to have any this evening she placed a saucer filled with the tempting ********* delicacy on the little pine table beside the bed and went into the next room the boy who looked about seven or eight years old lay on a pallet in one corner restless and fretful his cheeks burning and his large brown eyes sparkling with fever johnnie boy what is the matter tell me what hurts you my head aches so badly and tears came to the beautiful childish eyes it feels hot would you like to have it bathed in cold water if you please maam i have been calling ****** and she wont hear because she has gone out let me see if i cant do it just as well as ****** she hunted about the room for a cloth but finding nothing suitable took her cambric handkerchief and after ****** his forehead gently for ten or fifteen minutes laid the wet folds upon it and asked smilingly doesnt that feel pleasant ever so nice ****** i had some to drink she put the dripping gourd to his parched lips and after shaking up his pillow and ************* the covering of his pallet she promised to see him again soon and returned to his mother how does he appear to be miss irene i had him moved out of this room because he said my coughing hurt his head and his continual fretting worried me i am so weak now god help me and she covered her eyes with one hand he has some fever mrs davis but not more than susan i will ask dr arnold to come and see them this evening this change in the weather is very well calculated to make sickness are you entirely out of wood very nearly maam a few sticks left when hester comes keep her at home i will send you some wood and now how are you my cough is not quite so bad the ******** holds it a little in check but i had another hemorrhage last night and i am growing weaker every day oh miss irene what will become of my poor little children when i am gone that is such an agonizing thought she sobbed as she spoke do not let that grieve you now i promise you that your children shall be taken care of i will send a servant down to stay here tonight and perhaps some of the women in the row will be willing to come in occasionally and help hester till susan gets able to cook i left two loaves of bread in the closet and will send more in the morning which hester can toast i shall go by town and send dr arnold out i would rather have dr brandon if you please why i have always heard that dr arnold was so gruff and ********* that i am afraid of him i hate to be snapped up when i ask a question that is a great mistake mrs davis people do him injustice he has one of the kindest warmest hearts i ever knew though sometimes he is rather abrupt in his manner if you prefer it however i will see your doctor goodbye i will come again tomorrow as she took her bridle from philips hand the boy looked up at her with an expression bordering on adoration thank you philip how did he behave not very well but he is beautiful enough to make up for his ******** that is bad doctrine beauty never should excuse bad behaviour is your mother at home no maam when she comes ask her i say please to step in now and then and overlook things for mrs davis susan is sick philip if it is not asking too much of you johnnie would like to have you sit by him till his little sister comes home and wet that cloth which i left on his head will you indeed i will i am very glad you told me certainly i will i thought so dont talk to him let him sleep if he will goodbye she went first to a ******** on the river and left an order for a cord of wood to be sent immediately to no 13 factory row then took the street leading to doctor ******** office a servant sat on the step whistling merrily and in answer to her questions he informed her that his master had just left town to be absent two days she rode on for a few squares doubling her veil in the hope of shrouding her features and stopped once more in front of the door where stood dr arnolds buggy cyrus is the doctor in his office yes miss irene hold my horse for me she gathered the folds of her ridinghabit over her arm and went upstairs leaning far back in his chair with his feet on the fender of the grate sat dr arnold watching the blue smoke of his ********** curl lazily in faint wreaths over his head and as she entered a look of pleasant surprise came instantly into his cold clear eyes bless me irene i am glad to see you it is many a day since you have shown your face here sit down now then what is to pay you are in trouble of course you never think of me except when you are has old nellie treated herself to another spell of rheumatism or paragon broke his leg or smallpox broke out anywhere or worse than all have the hawks taken to catching your pigeons none of these ************ has overtaken me but i come as usual to ask a favour if you please i want you to go up to the factory row this evening mrs davis no 13 has two children very sick i am afraid i dont like the appearance of their tongues humph what do you know about tongues i should like to be informed how to use my own sir at least when there is a necessity for it they are what you medical ****** call typhoid tongues and from what i heard today i am afraid there will be a distressing amount of sickness among the operatives of course you will go sir how do you know that so well perhaps i will and perhaps i wont nobody ever looks after me or cares about the condition of my health i dont see why i must adopt the whole human race see here my child do not let me hear of you at the row again soon it is no place for you my lily ten to one it is some low miserable typhus fever showing itself and i will take care of your precious pets only on condition that you keep away so that i shall not be haunted with the dread of having you also on my hands if i lay eyes on you at the row i swear i will write to leonard to chain you up at home do you hear i shall come every day i promise you that oh you are ambitious of martyrdom but typhus fever is not the style queen there is neither clat nor glory in such a death a sad smile curved her mouth as she answered slowly that is problematical doctor but it is getting late and i wish if you please you would go at once to the row stop if any good is accomplished among those *********** up yonder who is to have the credit tell me that god shall have the thanks you all the credit as the worthy instrument and i as much of the gratification as i can steal from you are you satisfied with your wages my honoured ******* good night humph it is strange what a hold that queer motherless child took upon my heart in her babyhood and it ******** as she grows older he shook the ashes from his pipe put it away behind the clock and went down to his buggy before breakfast the following morning while irene was in the *********** feeding her chickens and pigeons pheasants and ******** she received a note from dr arnold containing these few ********* words if you do not feel quite ready for the day of judgment avoid the row as you would the ******* of egypt i found no less than six developed cases of rank typhus she put the note in her pocket and while the pigeons fluttered and perched on her shoulders and arms cooing and ******* at her fingers she stood ***************** the chances of contagion and death if she persisted raising her eyes to the calm blue sky the perplexed look passed from her countenance and fully decided regarding her course she went in to breakfast mr huntingdon was going to a neighbouring county with judge ******** to ******** some business connected with hughs estate and as the buggy came to the door he asked carelessly what did cyrus want he came to bring me a note from the doctor concerning some sick people whom i asked him to see oh john put my overcoat in the buggy come judge i am ready as he made no inquiry about the sick she volunteered no explanation and he bade her goodbye with manifest cold indifference she could not avoid congratulating herself that since he must take this journey soon he had selected the present occasion to be absent for she was well aware that he would violently oppose her wishes in the matter of the row when dr arnold met her late in the afternoon of the same day at little johnnies side his surprise and chagrin found vent first in a series of oaths then scowling at her like some ************ with the electricity expended he said do you consider me a stark idiot or a shallow ***** neither sir i assure you then if i know anything about my business i wrote you the truth this morning and you treat my advice with cool contempt you *** me beyond all endurance do you want to throw yourself into the jaws of death you forget doctor greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends she slipped her hand into his and looked up smiling and calm into his harsh swarthy face my child you made a mistake your life belongs to me for i saved it in your infancy i cradled you in my arms lest death should snatch you i have a better right to you than anybody else in this world i dont want to see you die i wish to go first i know what i owe you doctor but i am not going to die and you have scolded me enough for one time do make peace remember i warned you and you would not heed from that hour she kept faithful vigil in no 13 passing continually from one bedside to another ****** attack proved comparatively light and she was soon pronounced convalescent but little johnnie was desperately ill and for several nights irene sat at his pillow fearing that every hour would be his last while his delirium was at its height hester was taken violently and on the morning when irene felt that her labour was not in vain and that the boy would get well his little sister whom she had nursed quite as assiduously grew rapidly worse and died at noon as is frequently observed in such diseases this increased in virulence with every new case it spread with astonishing celerity through the row baffling the efforts of the best physicians in w and finally the day after ******* death as irene sat trying to comfort the poor mother a neighbour came in exclaiming oh miss irene philip martin is down too he caught the fever from his mother and his father says wont you please come over she went promptly though so wearied she could scarcely stand and took a seat by the bed where tossed the poor boy in whom she had taken such an interest you must go home miss huntingdon you are worn out his father can watch him till his mother gets stronger said dr brandon who was fully acquainted with the unremitting attendance at the next house no i must stay with philip perhaps he will know me when he wakes a hope doomed to disappointment for he raved for four days and nights calling frantically for the serene sad woman who sat at his pillow bending over him and laying her cold hand on his scorched brow on the fifth day being free from fever and utterly prostrated he seemed sinking rapidly but she kept her fingers on his pulse and without waiting for the doctors advice administered powerful stimulants so passed two hours of painful anxiety then philip opened his eyes ********* and looked at her philip do you know me ******* irene she sank back as if some strong supporting hand had suddenly been withdrawn from her and observing that she looked ghastly mr martin hastily brought her a glass of water just then dr brandon entered and examined his patient with evident surprise what have you done to him miss huntingdon since daylight i have been giving him ******* and brandy his pulse was so feeble and ******* i thought he needed it and was afraid to wait for you right and you saved his life by it i could not get here any earlier and if you had delayed it until i came it would probably have been too late you may call him your patient after this she waited no longer but staggered to the door and andrew seeing how faint she was came to meet her and led her to the carriage the ten days of watching had told upon her and when she reached home and nellie brought her wrapper and unlaced her shoes she fell back on her lounge in a heavy deathlike sleep mr huntingdon had been expected two days before but failed to arrive at the time designated and having her fears fully aroused nellie despatched a messenger for dr arnold do you see any change hiram none for the better mr huntingdon dropped his head upon his hand again and dr arnold resumed his slow walk up and down the carpet the blue damask curtains had been looped back from the western window and the broad band of yellow ******* in the sky threw a mellow light over the bed where lay the unconscious heiress of the grand old hill fever rouged the polished cheeks usually pure as alabaster and touched the parted lips with deeper scarlet lending a brilliant and almost unearthly beauty to the sculptured features her hair partially escaping from confinement straggled in crumpled rings and folds across the pillow a mass of golden netting and the sparkling eyes wandered from one object to another as if in anxious search the disease had assumed a different type and instead of raving paroxysms her illness was characterized by a silent wakeful unconsciousness while ******* produced only the effect of increasing her restlessness a week had passed thus during which time she had recognized no one and though numerous lady friends came to offer assistance all were refused permission to see her mr huntingdon was utterly ignorant of the duties of a nurse and though he haunted the room like an ********* shadow dr arnold and nellie took entire charge of the patient the former was unremitting in his care sitting beside the pillow through the long winter nights and snatching a few hours sleep during the day watching her now as he walked to and fro he noticed that her eyes followed him earnestly and he paused at the bedside and leaned over her irene what do you want does my walking annoy you no answer wont you shut your eyes my darling and try to sleep the deep brilliant eyes only looked into his with mocking intentness he put his fingers on the lids and pressed them gently down but she struggled and turned away her face her hands crept constantly along the snowy quilt as if seeking for something and taking them both he folded them in his and pressed them to his lips while tears which he did not attempt to restrain fell over them you dont think she is any worse do you asked the father huskily i dont know anything except that she cant lie this way much longer his harsh voice faltered and his stern mouth trembled he laid the hands back went to the window and stood there till the room grew dusky and the lamp was brought in as nellie closed the door after her the doctor came to the hearth and said sharply i would not be in your place for john jacob ****** fortune what do you mean by that i mean that if you have any conscience left you must suffer the pains of purgatory for the manner in which you have persecuted that child in all that i have ever done i have looked only to her good to her ultimate happiness i know that she hush leonard hush you are no more fit to be a father than i am to be a saint you have tyrannized and fretted her poor innocent soul nearly out of her ever since she was big enough to crawl why the dl could not you let the child have a little peace there are ********** chances to one that she has come to her rest at last you will feel pleasantly when you see her in her shroud his hard face worked painfully and tears glided down the wrinkled cheek and hid themselves in his grey beard mr huntingdon was much agitated but an angry flush crossed his brow as he answered hastily i am the best judge of my family matters you are unjust and severe of course i love my child better than anybody else heaven preserve her from such love as you have lavished on her she is very dear to me i understand her character you either cannot or will not she is the only thing in this world that i do really love my pet my ********** darling he shaded his face and swallowed a sob and for some moments neither spoke after a while the doctor buttoned up his coat and took his hat i am going down to my office to get a different prescription i will be back soon contrary to his phlegmatic habit the doctor had taken counsel of his fears until he was completely unnerved and he went home more than usually surly and ******** as he entered his office russell advanced to meet him from the window whence for nearly an hour he had been watching for his arrival good evening doctor what do you want how is miss huntingdon what is miss huntingdon to you she was one of my mothers best friends though only a little girl at the time and you love her for your mothers sake i suppose truly filial how is she tonight rumours are so unreliable that i came to you to find out the truth she is going to die i am afraid a sudden pallor overspread russells face but he sat erect and motionless and fastening his keen eyes upon him the doctor added she is about to be transplanted to a better world if there is such a place she is too good and pure for this cursed pestiferous earth is the case so utterly hopeless i cannot i will not believe it came indistinctly from the young mans bloodless lips i tell you i know better she stands on a hair stretched across her grave if i dont succeed tonight in making her sleep which i have been trying to accomplish for two days she cant possibly live and what is that whole confounded crew of factory savages in comparison with her precious life is it true that her illness is attributable to nursing those people yes dl take the row i wish the river would swallow it up if i could only see her exclaimed russell and an expression of such intense agony settled on his features usually so inflexible that his companion was startled and astonished the doctor regarded him a moment with perplexity and compassion mingled in his own face then light broke upon him and rising he laid his hand heavily on russells shoulder where are you going aubrey back to my office is there any message which you would like for me to deliver to her if she should recover consciousness you may trust me young man thank you i have no message to send i merely called to ask after her i trust she will yet recover good night he walked on rapidly till he reached the door of his office the gas was burning brightly over his desk and red tape and ******** beckoned him in but fathomless blue eyes calm as ******** looked up at him and without entering he turned and went through the cold and darkness to the cemetery to his mothers tomb she had been his comfort in boyish sorrows and habit was strong he went to her grave for it still when russell left him dr arnold carefully weighed out the powder and rode back to the hill he could perceive no change unless it were a *********** of the ******* on cheeks and lips and an increased twitching of the fingers which hunted so pertinaciously about the ********** that everlasting picking picking at everything is such an awful bad sign said poor nellie who was crying bitterly at the foot of the bed and she covered her face with her apron to shut out the sight you pick yourself off to bed nellie i dont want you ******** and groaning around day and night i am afraid to leave her a minute i am afraid when my poor baby shuts her eyes she will never open em again till she opens em in heaven oh go along to sleep you eternal old stupid i will wake you up i tell you if she gets worse he mixed one of the powders and stooped down ********** take this for me wont you dear she gave no intimation of having heard him till he placed the wineglass to her mouth and raised her head tenderly then she swallowed the contents mechanically at the expiration of an hour he repeated the dose and at ten oclock while he sat watching her intently he saw the eyelids begin to droop the long silky lashes quivered and touched her cheeks when he listened to her breathing and knew that at last she slept his grey head sank on his chest and he murmured inaudibly thank god patient as a woman he kept his place at her side fearing to move lest he should wake her the dreary hours of night wore away morning came gloriously bright and still she slept the flush had faded leaving her wan as death and the little hands were now at rest she looked like the figures which all have seen on ********* and anxiously and often the doctor felt the slow pulse that seemed weary of its mission he kept the room quiet and maintained his faithful watch refusing to leave her for a moment twelve oclock rolled round and it appeared indeed as if ******* *************** would prove true the sleeper was so motionless at three oclock the doctor counted the pulse and reassured threw his head back against the velvet lining of the chair and shut his aching eyes before five minutes had elapsed he heard a faint sweet voice say paragon springing to his feet he saw her put out her hand to pat the head of her favourite who could not be kept out of the room and howled so intolerably when they chained him that they were forced to set him free now he stood with his paws on the pillow and his face close to hers whining with delight tears of joy almost blinded the doctor as he pushed paragon aside and said eagerly irene one dog is as good as another you know paragon do you know me queen ********** know you doctor god bless you beauty you havent known me for a week i am so ************* give me some water he lifted her head and she drank eagerly till he checked her ******* havent all turned ************* since you were taken sick nellie i say nellie you witch of ***** bring some ******** here irene how do you feel child very tired and feeble sir my head is confused where is father here i am my daughter he bent down with trembling lips and kissed her for the first time since the day of their estrangement nearly three years before she put her arms feebly around his neck and as he held her to his heart she felt a tear drop on her forehead father have you forgiven me he either could not or would not answer but kissed her again warmly and as he disengaged her arms and left the room she felt assured that at last she had been forgiven she took the **** silently and after some moments said doctor have you been sitting by me a long time i rather think i ********** my sleep for nearly ten days you ************** young heathen have i been so ill as to require that i have a dim recollection of going on a long journey and of your being by my side all the way well i hope you travelled to your entire satisfaction and found what you ********* you were feeling about as if hunting for something the whole time oh i am so thankful that you know me once more child you have cost me a deal of sorrow now be quiet and go to sleep again at least dont talk to nellie or paragon i shall take a nap on the sofa in the library she regained her strength very slowly and many days elapsed before she was able to leave her room one bright sunny morning she sat before the open window looking down on the lawn where the pigeons flashed in and out of the hedges and now and then glancing at the bouquet of choice hothouse flowers in the vase beside her in her lap lay a letter just received from harvey ****** letter full of fond remembrance grave counsel and gentle **************** the unbent lines about her mouth showed that her mind was troubled the doctor came in and drew up a chair i should like to know who gave you leave to ride yesterday father thought that i was well enough and the carriage was close and warm i hope sir that i shall not be on your hands much longer what did i tell you next time dont be so ********** when you are advised by older and wiser persons i trust you are quite satisfied with the result of your ************ performances at the row far from it doctor i am fully ********** now and have nothing to fear in future i am very sorry sir that i caused you all so much trouble and anxiety i did not believe that i should take the fever if philip had not been so ill i should have come out safely but i suppose my uneasiness about him unnerved me in some ****** when i saw that he would get well all my strength left me in an instant how is he sir oh the young dog is as well as ever comes to my office every day to ask after his blessed lady bountiful leaning forward carelessly but so as to command a full view of her face he added you stirred up quite an excitement in town and introduced me generally to society people who never inflicted themselves on me before thought it was incumbent on them to hang around my door to make inquiries concerning my fair patient one night i found even that statue of bronze and steel russell aubrey waiting at my office to find out whether you really intended translation a change certainly passed swiftly over her countenance but it was inexplicable *************** anomalous lightening of the eye and darkening of the brow before he could ******* it her features resumed their wonted serenity and he found her voice *********** i was not aware that i had so many friends it is a pleasant discovery and almost *********** for the pain of illness take care doctor you are ******* my flowers out of their vase confound the flowers queen they are always in the way it is a great pity there is such ************* affection between your father and aubrey he has an amount of fine feeling hid away under that dark ********** noncommittal face of his he has not forgotten your interest in his mother and when i told him that i thought you had determined to take your departure from this world he seemed really hurt about it i always liked the boy but i think he is a ******* in politics the doctor had scarcely taken his departure when ******* turbaned head showed itself at the door that ********** philip is downstairs he brought back a book and wants to see you he seems in trouble but you dont feel like being bothered today do you did he ask to see me not exactly but showed very plainly he wanted to see you let him come up as he entered she rose and held out her hand good morning philip i am glad you are well enough to be out again he looked at her reverently and as he noticed the change her illness had wrought his lips quivered and his eyes filled oh miss irene i am so glad you are better i prayed for you all the time while you were so very ill thank you sit down and tell me about the sick they are all better i believe maam except mrs davis she was wishing yesterday that she could see you again i shall go there in a day or two you are walking pretty well without your crutches have you resumed your work i shall begin again tomorrow it need not interfere with your studies the nights are very long now and you can accomplish a great deal if you feel disposed to do so i think it possible i can obtain a situation for your father as carpenter on a plantation in the country if he will promise to abstain from drinking i have heard that he was a very good mechanic and in the country he would not meet with such constant temptation do you suppose that he will be willing to leave town oh yes maam i think so if you please miss irene i should be so glad if you would talk to him and persuade him to take the pledge before he starts i believe he would join the temperance society if you asked him to do it oh then i should have some heart to work you and your mother must try to influence him and in a few days i will talk to him in the meantime i will see about the situation which is a very desirable one brighter days will soon come i trust he took his cap from the carpet rose and looked at her with swimming eyes oh miss irene i wish i could tell you all i feel i thank you more than i can ever express and so does mother you have finished your book i see dont you want another nellie will show you the library and on the lower ********* on the righthand side of the door you will find a large volume in leather *************** take it with you and read it carefully goodbye i shall come down to the row tomorrow or next day well irene what is your decision about the party at mrs churchills tonight i will go with you father if it is a matter of so much interest to you though as i told you yesterday i should prefer declining the invitation as far as i am concerned it is full time for you to go into society again you have ***** at home long enough ***** is scarcely the right word father it matters little what you call it the fact is the same you have shut yourself in till you have grown to look like a totally different woman indeed irene i wont permit it any longer you must come out into the world once more i am sick of your black looks let me see you in colours tonight will not pure white content you father no i am tired of it wear something bright i have a favour to ask at your hands father will you give me that large beautiful vacant lot with the old willow tree on the corner of pine street and huntingdon avenue opposite the courthouse upon my word i must say you are very modest in your request what the deuce do you want with it i know that i am asking a good deal sir but i want it as a site for an orphan asylum will you give it to me no ill be hanged if i do are you going entirely deranged what business have you with asylums i should like to know put all of that ridiculous stuff out of your head here is something for which i sent to europe eric selected it in paris and it arrived yesterday wear it tonight he drew a velvet case from his pocket and laid it before her touching the spring the lid flew open and on the blue satin lining lay the blazing coils of a magnificent diamond necklace and bracelets how beautiful how splendidly beautiful she bent over the flashing mass in silent admiration for some time examining the delicate setting then looked up at her father what did they cost why do you want to know that i am pardonably curious on the subject well then i was silly enough to give seven thousand dollars for them and what was the value of that lot i asked for five thousand dollars father these diamonds are the finest i ever saw they are superbly beautiful a queen might be proud of them and i thank you most earnestly for such a gorgeous present but if you will not be offended i will be candid with **** would a thousand times rather have the lot than the jewels the expression of blank astonishment with which these words were received would have been ludicrous but for the ominous thickening of his brows she laid her fingers on his arm but he shook off the touch and scowling sullenly snatched the velvet case from her hand he went to town and she met him no more till she was ******* for the party standing before the mirror in her own room she arranged the flowers in her hair and when the leaves were disposed to suit her fastidious taste she took up a pearl set which he had given her years before intending to wear it but just then raising her eyes she saw her fathers image reflected in the glass without turning she put up her arms and laying her head back on his shoulder said eagerly my dear dear father do let us be reconciled clouds and moodiness melted from his handsome features as he bent over her an instant kissing her fondly then his hands passed swiftly over her neck an icy shower fell upon it and she was clothed with light my beautiful child wear your diamonds as a seal of peace i cant let you have the pine street **** want it for a different purpose but i will give you three acres on the edge of town near the dept for your asylum whim it is a better location every way for your project thank you father oh thank you more than words can express she turned her lips to one of the hands still lingering on her shoulder irene look at yourself ***** of ******* what a blaze

uttered such graceful fascinating nothings to salome several times in the course of the ********* russells hand clasped her but even then he avoided looking at her and seemed engrossed in conversation with his gay partner once irene looked up steadily and as she noted the expression with which he regarded his companion she wondered no longer at the rumour she had heard and acknowledged to herself that they were indeed a handsome couple the dance ended irene declined to dance again she looked about for dr arnold but he had disappeared her father was deep in a game of ****** and as she crossed

the report but irene was not deceived she had learned to understand his nature and knew that his bitterness of feeling and studied avoidance of herself betokened that the old affection had not been crushed struggling with the dictates of her heart and a sense of the respect due to her fathers feelings she passed a sleepless night in pacing the gallery of the observatory it was a vigil of almost

but heavy reinforcements pressed in and they returned reoccupying the old ground not a moment was to be lost general beauregard ordered forward his reserves for a second effort and with magnificent

with the long black plume of his hat drifting upon the wind as he led his admiring men as he pressed on with thin nostril dilated and eyes that burned like those of a tiger seizing his prey he saw just in his path leaning on his elbow covered with blood and ******* with dust the crushed withering form of his bitterest enemy his horses hoofs were almost upon him he reined him back an instant and

his master they carried him several yards farther and made him comfortable while orders were despatched for an ambulance a horrible ********** seized him at this moment and so intense was the agony that a groan burst through his set teeth and he struggled to rise russell knelt down and rested the haughty head against his shoulder wiping off the cold drops that beaded the pallid brow after a

forgive me all my hate you can afford to do so now i am not a brute i know magnanimity when i see it perhaps i was wrong to visit amys sins on you but i could not forgive her aubrey it was natural

so vigorously since her removal to florence and return to the south but the tide of travel set toward not from european shores and it was not until after repeated attempts to find some one ************* that she learned of eric mitchells presence in paris and his intention of soon returning to w she wrote at once requesting his permission to place herself under his care it was cordially accorded and bidding adieu to italy she joined him without delay despite the pleadings of mr mrs young and louisa who had recently arrived at florence and sincerely mourned a separation under such painful circumstances eric was detained in paris by a severe attack of the old disease but finally reached ************ having completed their arrangements they set off for southampton and took passage in the trent which was destined subsequently to play a prominent part in the tangled rle of diplomacy and to furnish the most utterly humiliating of many chapters of the ************* sycophancy and degradation of the federal government the voyage proved pleasant and prosperous and once at havana eric anxiously sought an opportunity of testing the vaunted efficiency of the blockade unfortunately two steamers had started the week previous one to new orleans the other to charleston only sailing vessels were to be found and about the movements of these impenetrable mystery seemed wrapped on the afternoon of the third day after their arrival eric wearied with the mornings fruitless inquiry was resting on the sofa at the hotel while electra watched the tide of passersby when willis erics servant came in quickly and walked up to the sofa master captain wright is here i asked him to come and see you and he is waiting downstairs captain wright yes sir the captain you liked so much at ********* one who gave you that pipe sir oh i remember ****** and he is here well show him up master from the way he watches the clouds i believe he is about to run out maybe he can take us willis is invaluable to you mr mitchell said electra as the negro left the room he is indeed he is eyes ears crutches everything to me and never forgets anything or anybody he has travelled over half the world with ******* desert me and be free at any moment he felt inclined to do ***** is as faithful now as the day on which i first left home with him ah captain this is an unexpected pleasure i am heartily glad to see you miss *********** wright take a seat the captain looked about thirty possibly older wore a grey suit and broad straw hat and when the latter was tossed on the floor showed a handsome frank beaming face with large clear smiling blue eyes whose steady light nothing human could dim his glossy ************ hair was thrust back from a forehead white and smooth as a womans but the lower portion of the face was effectually bronzed by exposure to the vicissitudes of climate and weather and electra noticed a peculiar nervous restlessness of manner as though he were habitually on the watch i am astonished to see you in havana mitchell where did you come from just from paris where bad health drove me after i bade you goodbye at smyrna have you a vessel here captain of course i have dont you suppose that i would be in the army if i could not serve my country better by carrying in arms and ammunition i have already made two successful trips with my *********** in despite the blockaders i am negotiating for a steamer but until i can get one ready i intend to sail on when did you arrive here last about ten days ago they chased me for nearly fifteen miles but i stole out of sight before morning when do you expect to leave here the captain darted a swift searching glance at electra rose and closed the door saying with a light laugh take care man you are not exactly *********** or ************ in a free country mind that and talk softly i am watched here the federal agents all know me and there are several federal vessels in port when do i expect to leave well tonight if the weather ******** up as i think it will and there is evident sign of a storm most sailors wait for fair weather we blockade ******* for foul oh captain do take us with you said electra eagerly what in a ******* schooner in the teeth of a gale besides miss i am taking a cargo of powder this trip and if i am hard pressed i shall blow up vessel and all rather than suffer it to fall into yankee clutches you would not relish going up to heaven after the fashion of a ****** would you i am willing sir to risk everything you threaten rather than wait here indefinitely cant you take us ********** grey willis and myself we are very impatient to get home but i have no accommodation for passengers but i suppose sir we could contrive to live a few days without eating at a regular table i will take some cheese and crackers and fruit along in a basket if that will ease your mind do waive your scruples and consent to take charge of us i add my prayers to hers wright do take us we shall not mind privations or inconvenience well then understand distinctly that if anything happens you are not to blame me if the young lady gets seasick or freckled or sunburnt or starved to death or blown up or drowned or worse than all if the yankee thieves by the wayside take her as a prize it will be no fault of mine whatever and i tell you now i shall not lay it on my conscience wright to what part are you bound ah that is more than i can tell you the winds must decide it i cant try the carolinas again this trip they are watching for me too closely there new orleans is rather a longer run than i care to make and i shall keep my eyes on ************ and mobile what object have you in starting tonight particularly in the face of a gale again the captains eyes swept round the room to guard against any doors that might be ajar as i told you before i am watched here the federals have a distinguished regard for me and i have to elude suspicion as well as run well when i do get out two hours ago a federal armed steamer which has been ******* here weighed anchor and has probably left the harbour to cruise between this place and key west as they passed one of the crew yelled out to me that they would wait outside and catch me certainly this time that i had made my last ***** to dixie etc i have carefully put out the impression that i need some repairs which cannot be finished this week and have told one or two confidentially that i could not leave until the arrival of a certain cargo from nassau which is due tomorrow that puritanical craft which started off at noon does not expect me for several days and tonight i shall rub my fingers and sail out right in her wake ha ha how they will howl what ******** of teeth there will be when they hear of me in a confederate port and now about your baggage have everything ready i will show willis the right wharf and at dark he must bring the trunks down i will be on the watch and send a boat ashore about sunset you and miss grey can come aboard as if for a mere visit i must go and make what little preparation i can for your comfort nothing occurred to ********* the plan eric and electra were cordially received and at dusk willis and the baggage arrived ********** the schooner was lying some distance from the wharf all sails down and apparently contemplating no movement with darkness came a brisk stiffening wind and clouds shutting out even dim starlight at ten oclock all things being in readiness the captain went on deck very soon after the glimmering lights of the city then the frowning walls of **** were left behind and the dixie took her way silently and swiftly seaward about two oclock being unable to sleep from the rocking of the vessel electra knowing that eric was still on deck crept up the steps in the darkness for the lights had been extinguished the captain was passing but paused saying in a whisper is that you miss grey come this way and i will show you something he grasped her hand led her to the bow where eric was sitting on a coil of rope and pointing straightforward added in the same suppressed tone look right ******** see a light the philistines are upon us look well and you will see a dark irregular moving mass that is the steamer of which i told you they have found out at last that there is going to be all sorts of a gale and as they cant ride it like my snug dainty little ******** they are putting back with all possible speed twenty minutes ago they were bearing down on me now you see that they will pass to our left what a pity they dont know their neighbours do you think that they will not see you certainly with sails down and lights out there is nothing to be seen on such a night as this there dont you hear her paddles no i hear nothing but the roar of the wind and water ah that is because your ears are not trained like mine great ******* how she labours already now be silent on came the steamer which electras untrained eyes almost blinded by spray could barely discern and her heart beat like a muffled drum as it drew nearer and nearer once she heard a low chuckling laugh of satisfaction escape the captain then with startling distinctness the ringing of a bell was borne from the steamers deck four ******** oclock how chagrined they will be tomorrow when they find out they passed me without paying their respects whispered the captain gradually the vessel receded the dark mass grew indistinct the light flickered and was soon lost to view and the sound of the labouring machinery was drowned in the roar of the waves before he went back on deck the captain made a comfortable place for her on the sofa in the little cabin the storm increased until it blew a perfect hurricane and the schooner rolled and creaked now and then shivering in every timber it was utterly impossible to sleep and eric who was suffering from a headache passed a miserable night in the white sickly dawn the captain looked in again and electra thought that no ray of sunshine could be more radiant or cheering than his joyous noble face about noon the fury of the gale subsided the sun looked out through ***** in the ******** clouds and toward night fields of quiet blue were once more visible by next morning the weather had cleared up with a brisk ******** wind but the sea still rolled heavily and eric unable to bear the motion kept below loth to trust himself on his feet electra strove to while away the tedious time by reading aloud to him but many a yearning look was cast toward the deck and finally she left him with a few books and ran up to the open air on the afternoon of the third day after leaving havana the captain said well miss grey i shall place you on confederate soil tomorrow god willing then you are going to mobile yes i shall try hard to get in there early in the morning you will know your fate before many hours do you regard this trial as particularly hazardous of course the blockading squadrons grow more efficient and expert every day and some danger necessarily attends every trial mobile ought to be pretty well guarded by this time the wind was favourable and the schooner ploughed its way swiftly through the autumn night the captain did not close his eyes and just about daylight electra and eric aroused by a sudden running to and fro rose and simultaneously made their appearance on deck what is the matter wright matter why look ahead my dear fellow and see where we are yonder is sand island lighthouse and a little to the right is fort morgan but the fleet to the left is hardly six miles off and it will be a tight race if i get in there was but a glimmering light ******* the east where two or three stars burned with indescribable brilliance and beauty and in the grey haze and wreaths of mist which curled over the *********** waves electra could distinguish nothing the air was chill and she said with a slight shiver i cant see any lighthouse there is of course no light there these ******** but you see that tall white tower dont you there look through my glass that low dark object yonder is the outline of the fort you will see it more distinctly after a little now look right where my finger points that is the flagstaff look up ********* have hoisted our flag and pretty soon it will be a target for those dogs ha mitchell hutchinson they see us there is some movement among them they are getting ready to cut us off this side of the ***** channel we shall see he had crowded on all sail and the little vessel dashed through the light fog as if conscious of her danger and resolved to sustain herself gallantly day broke fully sea and sky took the rich orange tint which only autumn mornings give and in this glow a federal frigate and sloop slipped from their moorings and bore down ************* on the graceful bounding schooner but for the fog which puzzled me about three oclock i should have run by unseen and they would never have known it till i was safe in navy **** we will beat them though as it is by about twenty minutes an hour ago i was afraid i should have to beach her are you getting frightened miss grey oh no i would not have missed this for any consideration how rapidly the federal vessels move they are gaining on us her curling hair damp with mist clustered around her forehead she had wrapped a scarlet crape shawl about her shoulders and stood with her red lips apart and trembling watched the exciting race look at the frigate there was a flash at her bow a curl of white smoke rolled up then a heavy roar and a thirtytwo ******* round

better go below miss grey they might **** one of your curls next time the vandals see you i dare say and your red flag ****** their yankee pride a little do you suppose they can distinguish me certainly through my glass i can see the gunners at work and of course they see you should not be surprised if they aimed specially at you that is the style of new england chivalry ******** both sloop and frigate were firing now in good earnest and one shell exploded a few yards from the side of the little vessel tossing the foam and water over the group on deck the boom of a ********* from the fort shook the air like thunder and gave to the blockaders the unmistakable assurance thus far and no farther the schooner strained on its way a few shot fell behind and soon under the frowning

in mobile bay amid the shouts of crew and garrison and welcomed by a salute of five guns immediately after her arrival in mobile electra prepared to forward her despatches by captain wright whose business called him to richmond before his return to cuba and an examination of them proved that the expedient resorted to was perfectly successful by ********** the edges of the ************ the tissue missive was drawn out uninjured and to erics surprise she removed the ***************** blue silk which lined the tops of her travelling gauntlets and extracted similar despatches all of which were at once transmitted to the seat of government while waiting for a boat they heard the painful tidings of major huntingdons death which increased erics impatience to reach w the remainder of the journey was sad and four days after leaving the gulf city the lights of w and roar of the falls simultaneously greeted the spent travellers having telegraphed of his safe arrival the carriage was waiting at the dept and andrew handed to electra a note from his mistress requesting her to come at once to her house instead of going to the hotel eric added earnest persuasion and with some reluctance the artist finally consented they were prepared for the silent solemn aspect of the house and for the mourning dress of the orphan but not for the profound calm the melancholy tearless composure with which she received them mental and physical suffering had sadly changed her the oval face was thinner and her form had lost its ********* but the countenance retained its singular loveliness and the mesmeric ********* of the large eyes seemed enhanced of her father she did not speak but gave her uncle a written statement of all the facts which she had been able to gather concerning the circumstances of his death and thus a tacit compact was formed to make no reference to the painful subject as she accompanied electra to the room prepared for her on the night of her arrival the latter asked with illconcealed emotion irene can you tell me anything about russell i am very anxious to hear something of him irene placed the silver lamp on the table and standing in its glow answered quietly he was wounded in the arm at manassa but retains command of his regiment and is doing very well dr arnold is the regimental surgeon and in one of his letters to me he mentioned that your cousins wound was not serious i am going to him immediately unfortunately you will not be allowed to do so the wounded were removed to richmond as promptly as possible but your cousin remained at manassa where ladies are not permitted then i will write to him to meet me in richmond irene made no reply and watching her all the while electra asked when did you see him last how did he look the day before he started to richmond he was very well i believe but looked harassed and paler than usual he is so robust however that i think you need entertain no apprehension concerning his health the inflexible features the low clear firm voice were puzzling and electras brow thickened and darkened as she thought her father is dead now there is no obstacle remaining she must love him and yet she gives no sign of interest two days later they sat together before one of the parlour windows electra was engaged in tearing off and rolling bandages while irene slowly scraped lint from a quantity of old linen which filled a basket at her side neither had spoken for some time the sadness of their occupation called up gloomy thoughts but finally electra laid down a roll of cloth and interlacing her slight fingers said irene the women of the south must exercise an important influence in determining our national destiny and because i felt this so fully i hurried home to share the perils and privations and trials of my countrywomen it is not my privilege to enter the army and wield a sword or musket but i am going to true womanly ******** the crowded hospitals to watch faithfully over sick and wounded i approve your plan think it your duty and wish that i could start to richmond with you *********** i believe that in this way we may save valuable lives you should as you have said go on at once you have nothing to keep you your work is waiting for you there but my position is different i have many things to arrange here before i can join you i want to see the looms at work on the plantation and am going down next week with uncle eric to consult with the overseer about several changes which i desire made concerning the negroes when all this is accomplished i too shall come into the hospitals about what time may i expect you not until you see me but at the earliest practicable day your uncle objects very strenuously to such a plan does he not he will

and without looking up from the lint which she was tying into small packages irene said electra my friend are you sure that you realize your personal responsibility your profession will give you vast influence in forming public taste and i hope much from its judicious use be careful that you select only the highest purest types to offer to your countrymen and women when peace enables us to turn our attention to the great work of building up a noble school of southern art we want no feeble sickly sentimentality nor yet the sombre ********* which seems to pervade your mind judging from the works you have shown me a slight quiver crossed the mobile features of the artist as she bit her full lip and asked what would you pronounce the distinguishing characteristic of my works i saw yesterday that you were not fully satisfied a morbid melancholy which you seem to have fostered tenderly instead of crushing vigorously a disposition to dwell upon the stern and gloomy aspects of the physical world and to intensify and reproduce abnormal and unhappy phases of character your ****** sunshiny joyous moods you have kept under lock and key while in your studio i admit the truth of your criticism and i have struggled against the spirit which hovers with ******** wings over all that i do but the shadow has not ********* knows whether it ever will you have finished your work come to my room for a few minutes they went upstairs together and as electra unlocked and bent over a large square trunk her companion noticed a peculiar curl about the lines of the mouth and a heavy scowl on the broad brow i want to show you the only bright shining face i ever painted she unwrapped an oval portrait placed it on the mantelpiece and stepping back fixed her gaze on irene she saw a tremor cross the quiet mouth and for some seconds the sad eyes dwelt upon the picture as if fascinated it must have been a magnificent portrait of your cousin years ago but he has changed materially since it was painted he looks much older sterner now irene i value this portrait above everything else save the original and as i may be called to pass through various perils i want you to take care of it for me until i come back to w it is a precious trust which i would be willing to leave in no hands but yours you forget that before long i too shall go to virginia then pack it away carefully among your old family pictures where it will be secure i left my large and best paintings in italy with aunt ruth who promised to preserve and send them to me as soon as the blockade should be raised what are mr youngs views concerning this war he utterly ****** the party who inaugurated it and the principles upon which it is waged says he will not return to america at least for the present and as soon as he can convert his property into money intends to move to the south he opposed and regretted secession until he saw the spirit of the lincoln dynasty and from that time he acknowledged that all hope of union or reconstruction was lost have you heard anything from harvey since the troubles began it is more than a year since i received a line from him he was then still in the west but made no allusion to the condition of the country irene i hope to see russell soon you were once dear friends have you any message for ****** word of kind remembrance one of irenes hands glided to her side but she answered ********** he knows that he always has my best wishes but will expect no message on the following day electra started to richmond taking with her a large supply of hospital stores which the ladies of w had contributed eric had proposed to his niece the expediency of selling the hill and becoming an inmate of his snug tasteful bachelor home but she firmly refused to consent to this plan said that she would spend her life in the house of her birth and it was finally arranged that her uncle should reserve such of the furniture as he valued particularly and offer the residue for sale with the pretty cottage to which he was warmly attached during the remainder of autumn irene was constantly engaged in superintending work for the soldiers in providing for several poor families in whom she was much interested and in frequent visits to the plantation where she found more than enough to occupy her mind and eric often wondered at the admirable system and punctuality she *********** the grave composure with which she discharged her daily duties and the invariable reticence she observed with regard to her past life did you ring mas eric yes has irene come home not yet sir bring some more wood owing to the scarcity of coal the grate had been removed and massive brass andirons substituted john piled them with oak wood swept the hearth and retired after a time the door opened and the mistress came in irene you must be nearly frozen what kept you out so late i had more than usual to attend to at the asylum this afternoon what was the matter we have a new matron and i was particularly anxious that she should start right in one or two respects i waited too in order to see the children at supper and satisfy myself about the cooking how many orphans are there in the asylum thirtyfour i admitted two this *************** of one of our soldiers who died from a wound received at leesburg poor little things i am afraid you will find numbers of similar instances before this war is at an end we will try to find room for all such cases the building will accommodate one hundred you must be very cold i will make john bring you a glass of wine no sir i do not need it my shawl was thick and warm irene she turned her head slightly and raised her eyes did you receive a letter which i sent to your room yes sir it was from dr arnold he has established himself in richmond yes sir his recent attack of rheumatism unfitted him for service in the field i had a letter from colonel aubrey today he wants to buy my house she made no comment and her eyes drooped again to the perusal of the strange shapes which danced and flickered on the burnished andirons what use do you suppose he had for it i cannot imagine unless he intends it as a home for electra what a witch you are at guessing that is exactly it he says in this letter that he may not survive the war and wishes to have the assurance that his cousin is comfortably provided for before he goes into another battle his offer is liberal and i shall accept it well i am glad she will own itfor i have often heard her speak of those old poplar trees in the front yard she has always admired the place at this juncture the teabell summoned them to the diningroom and she allowed her uncle no opportunity of renewing the conversation when the meal was concluded and they had returned to the library irene drew her table and basket near the lamp and resumed her knitting the invalid frowned and asked impatiently cant you buy as many of those coarse things as you want without toiling night and day in the first place i do not toil knitting is purely ********** very easy and i like it in the second place i cannot buy them and our men need them when they are standing on guard it is cold work holding a musket in the open air such weather as this he looked annoyed and dived deeper among his cushions dont you feel as well as usual this evening uncle eric oh i am well ********* i hate the everlasting motion of those steel needles she rolled up the glove put it in her basket and rose shall i read to you or how would you like a game of chess i do not expect you to humour my whims above all things my child i dread the thought of becoming troublesome to you you can never be that uncle eric and i shall always be glad if you will tell me how i can make your time pass more pleasantly i know this house must seem gloomy enough at best let us try a game of chess we have not played since you came from europe she brought the board and they sat down to the most quiet and absorbing of all games both played well and when eric was finally vanquished he was surprised to find from the hands of the clock that the game had lasted nearly two hours as she carefully replaced the ivory combatants in their box irene said uncle you know that i have long desired and intended to go to richmond but various circumstances combined to keep me at home i felt that i had duties here which must first be discharged now the time has come when i can accomplish my ************* plan dr arnold has taken charge of the hospital in richmond which was established with the money we sent from w for the relief of our regiments mrs campbell is about to be installed as matron and i have today decided to join them in his letter received this afternoon he orders me not to come but i know that he will give me a ward when he finds me at his elbow i am aware that you have always opposed this project but i hope sir that you will waive your objections and go on with me next week it is a strange and unreasonable freak which i must say i do not approve of there are plenty of nurses to be hired who have more experience and are every way far more suitable for such positions uncle the men in our armies are not hired to fight our battles and the least the women of the land can do is to nurse them when sick or wounded she laid her hand gently on his whitening hair and added pleadingly do not oppose me uncle eric i want your sanction in all that i do there are only two of us left go with me as my **************** i could not be happy if you were not with me his eyes filled instantly and drawing her close to him he exclaimed tremulously my dear irene there is nothing i would not do to make you happy happy i fear you never will be ah dont smile and contradict me i know the difference between happiness and resignation patience uncomplaining endurance never yet stole the garments of joy i will go with you to virginia or anywhere else that you wish thank you uncle eric i will try to make you forget the comforts of home and give you no reason to regret that you sacrificed your wishes and judgment to mine i must not keep you up any later the army of the potomac had fallen back to yorktown when irene reached richmond and the preparations which were being made for the reception of the wounded gave melancholy premonition of impending battles dr arnold had been entrusted with the supervision of several hospitals but gave special attention to one established with the funds contributed by the citizens of w and thither irene repaired on the day of her arrival in reply to her inquiries she was directed to a small room and found the physician seated at a table examining a bundle of papers he saw only a form darkening the doorway and without looking up called out gruffly well what is it what do you want a word of welcome he sprang to his feet instantly holding out both hands dear child queen god bless you how are you pale as a cloud and thin as a shadow sit down here by me where is eric he was much fatigued and i left him at the hotel you have been ill a long time irene and have kept it from me that was not right you should have been honest in your letters a pretty figure you will

lingered in their pressure of hers or understood the wistful tenderness of the eyes which dwelt so fondly on her face the icy wall of reserve had suddenly melted as if in the breath of an august noon and dripped silently down among things long past russells name was casually mentioned more than once and electra fell asleep that night wholly unconscious that the torn and crumpled pages of her heart had been thoroughly perused by the woman from whom she was most anxious to conceal the truth having engaged a suite of rooms near the hospital a few days sufficed for preliminary arrangements and irene was installed in a ward of the building to which she had requested dr arnold to appoint her thus by different by devious thorny paths two sorrowing women emerged upon the broad highway of duty and clasping hands pressed forward to the divinely appointed *********** usefulness only those who have faithfully ministered in a hospital can fully appreciate the onerous nature of the burdens thus

the peaceful happy past it was not wonderful that the homesick sufferers regarded them with emotions which trenched on adoration or that often when the pale thin faces lighted with a smile of joy at their approach irene and electra felt that they had a priceless reward it was a long low rather narrow room lined with rows of cots which stretched on either side to the door now left open to admit free circulation of air a muffled clock ****** on the mantelpiece two soldiers who had been permitted to visit their sick comrades slumbered heavily one with head drooped on his chest the other with

spring listen fairy belle we used to sing that in camp but nobody sings like jessie so sweet so sweet he set his teeth hard and shuddered violently and taking his fingers in hers she found them clenched andrew here i am miss irene go upstairs and ask the doctor to come here the surgeon came promptly i am afraid he is going into convulsions what shall i do for him yes just what i have been trying to guard against i fear nothing will do any good but you might try that mixture which acted like a charm on ******* here is the bottle how much shall i give a spoonful every halfhour while the convulsions last if he can swallow it it cant possibly do any harm and may ease his suffering poor fellow may the vengeance of a righteous god seek out his murderer i would stay here with you miss huntingdon if i could render any service as it is i am more needed upstairs the paroxysms were short but so severe that occasionally she required andrews assistance to hold the sufferer on his cot and as they grew less frequent she saw that his strength failed rapidly finally he fell into a troubled sleep with one hand clutching her arm nearly an hour passed thus and the nurse knelt softly beside her charge and prayed long and fervently that the soul of the young martyr might find its home with god and that his faroff mourning mother might be strengthened to bear this heavy burden of woe as she knelt with her face upturned a soft warm palm was laid upon her forehead and a low sweet manly voice pronounced in benediction may the lord bless you irene and abundantly answer all your prayers she rose quickly and put out her disengaged hand oh harvey dear friend thank god i have found you once more he lifted the candle and held it near her face scanning the sculptured features then stooped

in these dark days of trial which you have voluntarily chosen to share with a young brave struggling nation his eyes dwelt upon her face as she looked gladly at him and over her waving hair his hands

regret drift over her countenance and added i have many things to say to you and much to learn concerning your past but this is not the time or place for such interchange of thought and feeling tomorrow we will talk tonight i could not repress my impatience to see you though but for a few moments she drew a chair near young walton the wounded boy and seating herself continued when independence is obtained and whiterobed peace spreads her stainless hands in blessing over us let history proclaim and let our people reverently remember that to the uncomplaining fortitude and sublime devotion of the private soldiers of the confederacy not less than to the genius of our generals and the heroism of our subordinate officers we are indebted for freedom she laid her head close to the boys mouth to listen to his low breathing and the minister saw her tears fall on his pillow and gleam on his auburn locks the delirium seemed to have given place to the dreamless sleep of exhaustion and folding one of her hands around his fingers with the other she softly stroked the silky hair from his fair smooth forehead irene will my presence here aid or comfort you if so i will remain till morning no you can do no good it is midnight now and you must be wearied with your long ride you cannot help me here but tomorrow i shall want you to go with me to the cemetery i wish his

mentioned that colonel aubrey came up with him on some very important errand and had but a few hours to remain i will get my shawl and join you in five minutes electra you must stay at home and rest for a day or two you are feverish and worn out with constant watching it is a mercy that she is delirious otherwise her unavoidable excitement and anxiety would probably prove fatal she is very ill of

pressed a kiss on the drooped head and left her to resume her watch in the darkened room where electra had been ill with ************ for nearly three weeks it was thought that she contracted the

darkness to the south bank of the chickahominy saturday saw a temporary lull in the iron storm but the wounded continued to arrive and the devoted women of the city rose from their knees to minister to the needs of these numerous sufferers sunday found our troops feeling about the swamps for the retreating foe and once more late in the afternoon distant thunder resounded from the severely contested field of savages station whence the enemy again retreated on sabbath morning irene learned that russells command had joined in the pursuit and during that day and night as the conflict drifted farther southward and details became necessarily more meagre her anxiety increased continually her lips moved in prayer as she glided from electras silent room to aid in dressing the wounds of those who had been disabled for further participation in the strife and as monday passed without the receipt of tidings from dr arnold she indulged in the hope that russell would escape uninjured during tuesday morning electra seemed to have recovered her consciousness but in the afternoon she ******** into incoherent muttering of **** ********* ******* ***** and my best great picture left in

clutched it and she read come at once aubrey is badly wounded cyrus will show the way hiram arnold you are going to faint miss irene drink some of this cordial no tell andrew to go after the carriage as quick as possible and have it brought here immediately and ask uncle eric to come to my room at once irene went to her own apartment which adjoined electras put on her bonnet and veil and though the night was warm wrapped a shawl about her mr mitchell entered soon after and started at sight of his nieces face irene what does this mean where are you going at this hour to the ************* malvern hill colonel aubrey is mortally wounded and i must see him will you go with me oh uncle eric if you have any mercy in your soul ask me no questions now only go with me of course my dear child

entered the close carriage which she had ordered reserved for her and she called cyrus to the door did you see colonel aubrey after he was wounded i only had a glimpse of him as they brought him in miss irene he was shot in the breast you know the way ride outside and cyrus drive as fast as possible by the glimmer of the carriage lamps she could see the wagons going to and fro some filled with empty coffins some with mangled sufferers now and then weary spent soldiers sat on the roadside or struggled on toward the city which they had saved with their arms in ****** or hands bound up or bloody bandages across their stern faces after another hour when the increasing number of men showed proximity to the scene of danger cyrus turned away from the beaten track and soon the flash of lights and the hum of voices told that they were near the place of destination the carriage stopped and cyrus came to the door we are at the lines and i cant drive any nearer if you will wait i will go and find master the delay seemed intolerably long and for the first time an audible moan escaped irene just as cyrus came back accompanied by a muffled figure irene my child she leaned out till her face nearly touched dr arnolds only tell me that he is alive and i can bear all else he is alive and sleeping just now can you control yourself if i take you to him yes you need not fear that i will disturb him let me go to him he gave her his arm and led her through the drizzling rain for some **************** as much as possible the groups of wounded where surgeons were at their sad work finally before a small tent he paused and whispered nerve yourself dear child is there no hope she swept aside her long mourning veil and gazed imploringly into his face tears filled his eyes and hastily averting his head he raised the curtain of the tent and drew her inside a candle burned dimly in one corner and there on a pallet of straw over which a blanket had been thrown lay the powerful form of the dauntless leader whose deeds of desperate daring had so electrified his worshipping command but a few hours before the noble head was pillowed on a knapsack one hand pressed his heart while the other drooped nerveless at his side and the breast of his coat was saturated with blood which at intervals oozed through the bandages and dripped upon the straw the tent was silent as a cemetery and not a sound passed irenes white fixed lips as she bent down and looked upon the loved face strangely beautiful in its pallid repose the shadowy wings of the bitter bygone hovered no longer over the features darkening their chiselled perfection a tranquil halfsmile parted the lips and unbent the lines between the ************ black brows sinking softly on the floor of the tent irene rested her chin on her folded hands and calmly watched the deep sleep so passed threequarters of an hour then as dr arnold cautiously put his fingers on the pulse the sufferer opened his eyes irene was partially in the shade but as she leaned forward a sudden bewildered smile lighted his countenance he started up and extended one arm irene my darling do i dream or are you indeed with me i have come to nurse you russell but if you do not calm yourself the doctor will send me away she took the outstretched hand in both of hers and pressed her lips repeatedly upon it come close to me i am helpless now and cannot go to you she seated herself on the edge of the straw laid her shawl in her lap and lifting his head rested it on the soft ******* folds dr arnold removed the warm cloth soaked with blood placed a cold dripping towel on the gaping wound and after tightening the bandages to check the ********* passed out of the tent leaving the two alone oh irene this is a joy i never hoped for i went at night to the hospital in richmond just to get a glimpse of ***** feast my eyes with another sight of your dear dear face i watched you ministering like an angel to sick and wounded

as my wife and thus defy and cancel the past i was selfish in my love i wanted you in my home i longed for the soft touch of your fingers for your proud dazzling smile of welcome when the days work was ended for the privilege of drawing you to my heart and listening to your whispered words of encouragement and fond congratulation in my successes i knew that this could never be that your veneration for your fathers memory would separate us in future as in the past that my pleadings would not shake your unfortunate and erroneous resolution and it was hard to give up the dearest hope that ever brightened a lonely mans life now i know i feel that your love is strong deathless as my own though long locked deep in your heart i know it by the anguish in your face by the quiver of your

bible you gave me and dearest in praying for you i have learned to pray for myself through jesus i have a sure hope of happiness beyond the grave there though separated in life you and i shall be united by death oh irene but for your earnest piety this precious anticipation might never have been mine but for you i would have forgotten my mothers precepts and my mothers prayers through your influence i shall soon join her where the fierce waves of earthly trial can lash my proud soul no more thank god oh russell this takes away the intolerable bitterness of parting this will support me in coming years i can brave all things in future she saw that a paroxysm of pain had seized him his brow wrinkled and he bit his lips hard to suppress a groan just at this moment dr arnold reentered and immediately after gave him another potion of ******** aubrey you must be quiet if you would not shorten your life he silently endured his sufferings for some moments and raising his eyes again to

electra partially delirious still but the doctor thinks she will recover what shall i tell her for you that i loved and remembered her in my dying hour kiss her for me and tell her i fell where the

out on various errands of mercy occasionally anxious ************* soldiers softly lifted the curtain of the tent gazed sadly fondly on the prostrate figure of the beloved commander and turned away silently with tears trickling down their bronzed faces slowly the night waned and the shrill tones of reveille told that another day had risen before the murky sky brightened hundreds who had sprung up at that call twentyfour hours ago now lay stiffening in their gore sleeping their last sleep where neither the sound of fife and drum nor the battlecry of comrades would ever rouse them from their final rest before malvern ******** which winds wailed a requiem and trailing dripping clouds settled like a pall the bustle and stir of camp increased as preparations were made to follow the foe who had again taken up the line of retreat but within the tent unbroken silence reigned it was apparent that russell was sinking fast and at eight oclock he awoke looked uneasily around him and said feebly what is going on in front mcclellan has evacuated malvern hill and is in full retreat toward his gunboats answered the doctor then there will be no more fighting my shattered regiment will rest for a season poor fellows they did their duty nobly yesterday he lifted his eyes toward heaven and for some moments his lips moved inaudibly in prayer gradually a tranquil expression settled on his features and as his eyes closed again he murmured faintly ***************** me a little they lifted him and rested his head against her shoulder irene i am here russell my arms are around you she laid

burst of grief escaped her to tell of agony and despair electras speedy convalescence repaid the care bestowed upon her and one afternoon ten days after quiet had again settled around the confederate

and stroked back the artists shining hair i wish you would let me see the papers my eyes are strong enough now and i want to know exactly what has taken place everywhere during my sickness it seems to me impossible that general lees army can face mcclellans much longer without bringing on a battle and i am so anxious about russell if he should be hurt of course i must go to him it is very strange that he has not written are you sure no letters came for me there are no letters i am sure but i have a message for you i have seen him once since you were taken sick ah what is it he heard that i was ill and came to see me i suppose when was he here irene bent down and kissed her companion tremulously saying slowly he desired me to kiss you for him electra i have not told you before because i feared the effect upon you in your weak state but there have been desperate battles around richmond during your illness and the federals have been ************** back to james river was russell

violet eyes and looked through the window toward the cemetery where glittered a tall marble shaft which the citizens of w had erected over the last quiet restingplace of russell aubrey sands of time were drifting stealthily around the crumbling idols of the morning of life ********* and tenderly shrouding the past but sorrow left its softening shadow on the orphans countenance and laid its

hair and lingered like a benediction on the placid pure face of the lonely woman who had survived every earthly hope and who calmly fronting her altars of sacrifice here dedicated herself anew to the hallowed work of promoting the happiness and ********** the paths of all who journeyed with her down the ********* aisles of time
