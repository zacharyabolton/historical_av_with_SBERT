immediately after the surrender of the confederate armies engaged in the war between the states general lee undertook to write of the campaigns of the army of northern virginia while under his command and asked such assistance as i could give in supplying reports despatches and letters of his the originals of which had been lost or destroyed under the impression that they could not be put to better use such as were then in hand were packed and sent him he gave up the work and after a few years his death made it impossible that the world should ever receive the complete story of the confederate campaigns in virginia from the noble mind that projected and controlled them possibly had i not expected our commander to write the history of those campaigns i should have written it myself a decade or so earlier than i have done but personally i am not sorry that i write of the war thirty years after its close instead of ten or twenty while i am so constituted *************** that i could view then almost exactly as i do now the great struggle in which i bore a part i do not know that others in any considerable number might have so regarded it at the earlier periods to which i refer i believe that now more fully than then the public is ready to receive in the spirit in which it is written the story which i present it is not my purpose to ************ upon the war but i cannot refrain from expressing my profound thankfulness that providence has spared me to such time as i can see the ********** of the great conflict softened its passions entering upon the sleep of oblivion only its ******** less **************** springing into virile and vast life i believe there is today because of the war a broader and deeper patriotism in all americans that patriotism throbs the heart and pulses the being as ardently of the south carolinian as of the massachusetts puritan that the liberty bell even now as i write on its southern pilgrimage will be as reverently received and as devotedly loved in atlanta and charleston as in philadelphia and boston and to stimulate and evolve this noble sentiment all the more what we need is the resumption of fraternity the hearty restoration and cordial cultivation of ********** brotherly relations faith in jehovah and respect for each other and god grant that the happy vision that delighted the soul of the sweet singer of israel may rest like a benediction upon the north and the south upon the blue and the gray the spirit in which this work has been conceived and in which i have conscientiously labored to carry it out is one of sincerity and fairness as an actor in and an eyewitness of the events of 186165 i have endeavored to perform my humble share of duty in passing the materials of history to those who may give them place in the records of the ********* of the south nor of the ******** in the history of the united nation it is with such magnified view of the responsibility of saying the truth that i have written i yield to no one as a champion of the southern soldier wherever he may have fought and in whatever army and i do not think i shall be charged more now than in wartime with *************** the enemy honor to all if i speak with some ************* of the first corps of the army of northern virginia it must be ascribed in part to the affection of a commander and in part to my desire to relieve its brave officers and men in the ranks from unjust aspersions after general lees death various writers on the southern cause combined with one accord to hold the first corps and its commander responsible for all adversity that befell the army i being under the political ban and the political passions and prejudices of the times running high they had no difficulty in spreading their misrepresentations south and north until some people through their mere *********** came to accept them as facts i simply present the facts concerning the first corps in all fulness and fairness attested by indisputable authorities that the public may judge between it and its detractors in the accounts of battles and movements the official war records supply in a measure the place of lost

a little mays squadron was sent there and general taylor advanced the right of his line but night closed in before decisive work could be done the armies were near enough during the night to hear the

could be seen but when the sun rose to light the field it was found vacant a careful reconnoissance revealed that the enemy was in retreat and the dragoons reported them in march towards our comrades at fort brown general taylor remained on the field a few hours to have the killed and wounded of both sides cared for but sent the dragoons light infantry and ringgolds battery in pursuit the latter under lieutenant randolph ridgely the light infantry was of two battalions under captain george a mccall and captain c f smith the route of march was through a dense chaparral on both sides of the

separate command johnstons command should have been an outlying contingent but he had been assigned to the shenandoah valley when because threatened with immediate invasion it was of first importance beauregard was subsequently assigned to manassas junction which under later developments became the strategic point as johnston was his senior another delicate question arose that was not solved until the tramp of mcdowells army was heard on the warrenton turnpike the armies preparing for the first grand conflict were commanded by west point graduates both of the class of ####********** and mcdowell the latter had been assigned to command of the federal forces at washington south of the potomac in the latter part of may 1861 the former had assumed command of the confederates at manassas junction about the 1st of june mcdowell marched on the afternoon of the 16th of july at the head of an army of five divisions of infantry supplemented by nine field batteries of the regular service one of volunteers besides two guns operating separately and seven companies of regular cavalry in his infantry columns were eight companies of regulars and a battalion of marines an aggregate of thirtyfive thousand men beauregard stood behind bull run with seven brigades including holmes who joined on the 19th twentynine guns fourteen hundred ********* aggregate of twentyone thousand nine hundred men all volunteers to this should be added for the battle of the 21st reinforcements *********** eight thousand five hundred men under general johnston making the sum of the aggregate thirty thousand four hundred the line behind bull run was the best between washington and the rapidan for strategy tactics and army supplies general beauregard gave minute instructions to his brigade commanders of his position and general plan which in itself was admirable bonham was to retire from fairfax courthouse as the enemy advanced and take his place behind mitchells ford on the centreville and manassas junction road it was proposed that he should engage his rearguard so as to try to bring on the battle against him as he approached his crossing of bull run when the brigades along the run on his right should cross wheel to the left and attack on the enemys left and rear we had occasional glimpses behind the lines about washington through parties who managed to evade the eyes of guards and sentinels which told of mcdowells work since may and heard on the 10th of july that he was ready to march most of us knew him and of his attainments as well as of those of beauregard to the credit of the latter so that on that point we were quite satisfied but the backing of an organized government and an army led by the foremost american ******** that consummate strategist tactician and ********* general scott together with the splendid equipment of the field batteries and the presence of the force of regulars of infantry gave serious apprehension on the 16th of july notice came that the advance of mcdowells army was under definite orders for the next day my brigade was at once ordered into position at blackburns ford and all others were ordered on the alert cockes detachments were recalled from the fords between mitchells and stone bridge and evans was left to hold the bridge bonham withdrew from fairfax courthouse as mcdowell advanced he retired behind the run at mitchells ford his vedettes following after exchanging shots with the enemys advance on the 18th early that morning a section of the washington artillery was posted on a rear line behind blackburns ford and trailed across towards the left so as to flank fire against the direct advance upon bonham at mitchells ford at eight oclock am on the 18th mcdowells army concentrated about centreville his immediate objective being manassas junction from centreville the warrenton turnpike bears off a little south of west crossing bull run at stone bridge four miles the manassas junction road due south crosses at mitchells ford three miles other farm roads turned to the fords above and below mitchells his orders to general tyler commanding the advance division were to look well to the roads on the direct route to manassas junction and via the stone bridge to impress an advance upon the former but to have care not to bring on a general engagement at the same time he rode towards his left to know of the feasibility of a turning move around the confederates right there were three moves by which it was supposed he could destroy the ***************** by turning their right second by direct and forcible march to the junction third by turning their left mcdowells orders to his leading divisions indicated that he had settled down to a choice as to the two opposite flanking moves but to justify either he must first test the feasibility of the direct route the ride to his left disclosed rough ground rocky heights cut by ********** and covered by heavy forest tangle as formidable to military manuvres of raw troops as armed battlements according to preconceived plans this ********** the question of the flanking move by the confederate right under the instructions as general tyler construed them he followed the confederates to the heights of centreville overlooking the valley of bull run with a squadron of cavalry and two companies of infantry from the heights to the run a mile away the field was open and partially disclosed the confederate position on his right on the left the view was limited by a sparse growth of spreading pines on the right was mitchells ford on the left blackburns to have a better knowledge of the latter he called up a brigade of infantry under general richardson ayress battery of six ********* and two twentypound rifle guns under benjamin the artillery was brought into action by the twentypound rifle guns the first shot aimed at the section of the washington artillery sixpounders in rear of blackburns ford showing superior ************ the ball striking close beside the guns and throwing the dust over the caissons and gunners it was noticed that the enemy was far beyond our range his position commanding as well as his metal so i ordered the guns withdrawn to a place of safety till a fairer opportunity was offered them the guns were limbered and off before a second shot reached them artillery practice of thirty minutes was followed by an advance of infantry the march was made quite up to the bluff overlooking the ford when both sides opened fire the first *********** volleys were most startling to the new troops part of my line broke and started at a run to stop the alarm i rode with sabre in hand for the leading files determined to give them all that was in the sword and my horses heels or stop the break they seemed to see as much danger in their rear as in front and soon turned and marched back to their places to the evident surprise of the enemy heavy firing was renewed in ten or fifteen minutes when the federals retired after about twenty minutes a second advance was made to the top of the bluff when another rousing fusillade followed and continued about as long as the first with like result i reinforced the front line with part of my reserve and thinking to follow up my next success called for one of the regiments of the reserve brigade colonel hays of the seventh louisiana regiment was sent but was not in time for the next attack he was in position for the fourth and did his share in that fight after the fourth repulse i ordered the advance and called for the balance of the reserve brigade the fourth brigade in their ****** in evolution had not progressed as far as the passage of defiles the pass at the ford was narrow unused and ***** the lagoons above and below were deep so that the crossing was intricate and slow colonel early came in with his other regiments formed his line behind my front and was asked to hurry his troops to the front line lest the next attack should catch him behind us when his raw men would be sure to fire on the line in front of them he failed to comprehend however and delayed till the next attack when his men promptly returned fire at anything and everything before them i thought to stop the fire by riding in front of his line but found it necessary to dismount and lie under it till the loads were discharged with the federals on the bluff pouring down their fire and earlys tremendous fire in our rear soldiers and officers became mixed and a little confused part of my men got across the run and partially up the bluff of the enemys side a body of the union soldiers were met at the crest where shots were exchanged but passing the run encountering the enemy in front and receiving fire from our friends in rear were not reassuring even in handling veterans the recall was ordered as the few of the enemys most advanced parties joined issue with captain marye of my advance federal prisoners were brought in with marks of burnt powder on their faces and captain marye and some of his men of the seventeenth who brought them in had their faces and clothing soiled by like marks at the first moment of this confusion it seemed that a vigorous pressure by the enemy would force us back to the farther edge of the open field and to reach that stronger ground preparations were considered but with the aid of colonels garland and corse order was restored the federals were driven off and the troops better distributed this was the last effort on the part of the infantry and was followed by the federal batteries throwing shot and shell through the trees above our heads as we were under the bluff the fire was not annoying except occasionally when some of the branches of the trees were torn off and dropped among us one shot passed far over and dropped in the house in which general beauregard was about to sit down to his dinner the interruption so annoyed him that he sent us four ******** and three rifle guns of the washington artillery under captain ******** to return fire and avenge the loss of his dinner the guns had good cover under the bluff by pushing them as close up as would admit of effective fire over it but under tactical formation the limbers and caissons were so far in rear as to bring them under destructive fire the men thinking it ************* to flinch or complain of their exposure worked away very courageously till the limbers and caissons were ordered forward on the right and left of the guns to safer cover the combat lasted about an hour when the federals withdrew to their ground about centreville to the delight of the confederates after this lively affair the report came of a threatened advance off to our right general beauregard recalled earlys command to its position in that quarter he was ordered to march to the right under the bluff so that his men could not come within range of the batteries but he chose to march back on the road leading directly to the rear when the dust of his columns drew fire of a battery and several damaging shots were thrown among his troops the confederate losses were sixtyeight federal eightythree the effect of this little affair was encouraging to the confederates and as damaging to the federals by the double action of success and failure the confederate infantry felt themselves christened veterans the washington artillery was equally proud of its even combat against the famed batteries of united states regulars mcdowell was disposed to ignore this fight as unwarranted under his instructions and not a necessary adjunct of his plans his course and that of the officers about him reduced the aggressive spirit of the division commander to its minimum and had some influence upon the troops of the division for battle at this time mcdowell had ##### men and fortynine guns beauregard had ##### men and twentynine guns before treating of future operations i should note the situation of the confederate *********** in the shenandoah valley and at acquia creek the latter was ordered up to reinforce beauregard as soon as the advance from washington took definite shape and arrived as a supporting brigade to his right on the 19th of july at the same time orders were sent authorizing johnstons withdrawal from the valley to join with beauregard for the approaching conflict the use of these *********** was duly considered by both sides some days before the campaign was put on foot opposing johnston in the valley was general robert patterson of philadelphia a veteran of the war of 1812 and of the mexican war especially distinguished in the latter by the prestige of the former service johnston was a veteran of the mexican war who had won distinction by progressive service and was well equipped in the science of war beauregard and mcdowell were also veterans of the mexican war of staff service and distinguished for intelligent action and attainments both remarkable for physical as well as mental power between johnston and beauregard the blue ridge stretched out from the potomac southwest far below the southern line of virginia cut occasionally by narrow passes quite defensible by small bodies of infantry and artillery patterson was ordered to hold johnston in the valley while mcdowell should direct his strength against beauregard mcdowell seems to have accepted that order as not only possible but sure of success while the confederates viewed the question from the other side in a reverse light and as will presently appear with better judgment so far as it is possible to project a battle before reaching the field it seems that mcdowell had concluded upon the move finally made before setting out on his march from washington it was to give him an open field with superior numbers and appointments and when successful was to give him the approach to the base line of his adversary with fine prospects of cutting off retreat his ride to view the approaches of the confederate right on the morning of the 18th was made to confirm his preconceived plan the reconnoissance made by tyler on the same morning reinforced his judgment so that the strategic part of the campaign was concluded on that morning except as to the means to be adopted to secrete or ******* in his movement as long as possible leaving we may say the result to tactical operations but tactics is time and more decisive of results than strategy when wisely adjusted johnston was sixty miles away from beauregard but the delay of three days for mcdowells march via sudley springs so reduced the distance in time and space as to make the consolidation easy under ************* transportation facilities holmess brigade and sixgun battery were posted in rear of ewells brigade general mcdowells order for battle on the 21st of july was issued on the afternoon of the 20th directing his first division to march by the warrenton turnpike and make a diversion against the crossing of bull run at the stone bridge while the second and third divisions following on the turnpike were to file to the right along the farm road about halfway between centreville and the bridge cross bull run at sudley springs and bear down against the confederate rear and left the first division under tyler to march at two oclock in the morning to be closely followed by the others under hunter and heintzelman the turning divisions after crossing to march down clear the bridge and lift tyler over the run bringing the three into compact battle order general johnston came in from the shenandoah valley on the 20th with the brigades of bee bartow and jackson the brigades were assigned by beauregard the former two in reserve near the right of blackburns ford the latter near its left beauregards order for battle approved by general johnston was issued at five am on the ##***** brigades at union mills ford to cross and march by the road leading towards centreville and in rear of the federal reserve at that point the brigades at mcleans ford to follow the move of those on their right and march on a converging road towards centreville those at and near blackburns to march in cooperative action with the brigades on the right the reserve brigades and troops at mitchells ford to be used as emergency called but in the absence of special orders to seek the most active point of battle this order was only preliminary coupled with the condition that the troops were to be held ready to move but to wait for the special order for action the brigade at blackburns ford had been reinforced by the fifth north carolina and twentyfourth virginia regiments under lieutenantcolonel jones and colonel kemper i crossed the run under the five oclock order adjusted the regiments to position for favorable action and gave instructions for their movements on the opening of the battle while waiting for the order to attack a clever reconnoissance was made by colonels terry and lubbock texans on the brigade staff which disclosed the march of the heavy columns of the federals towards our left their report was sent promptly to headquarters and after a short delay the brigade was ordered back to its position behind the run tylers division moved early on the 21st towards the stone bridge the march was not rapid but timely his first shells went tearing through the elements over the heads of the confederates before six oclock the second and third divisions followed his column till its rear cleared the road leading up to the ford at sudley springs when they filed off on that route mcdowell was with them and saw them file off on their course and followed their march his fifth division and richardsons brigade of the first were left in reserve at centreville and the fourth division was left in a position rearward of them the march of the columns over the single track of the farm road leading up to sudley springs was not only fatiguing but so prolonged the diversion of tylers division at the bridge as to expose its real intent and cause his adversary to look elsewhere for the important work viewing the zone of operations as far as covered by the eye evans discovered a column of dust rising above the forest in the vicinity of sudley springs this with the busy delay of tyler in front of the bridge exposed the plans and told of another quarter for the approaching battle when evans leaving four companies of infantry and two pieces of artillery to defend the bridge moved with the rest of his command to meet the approaching columns off his left bearing in mind his care of the bridge it was necessary to occupy grounds north of the pike the position chosen was the plateau near the matthews house about a thousand yards north of the pike and about the same distance from bull run commanding the road by which the turning divisions of the enemy were to approach his artillery two ******** guns was posted to his right and left somewhat retired meanwhile tylers batteries maintained their position at and below the stone bridge as did those near the lower fords mcdowells column crossed at sudleys ford at nine oclock and approached evans a few minutes before ten the leading division under hunter finding evanss command across its route advanced the second rhode island regiment and battery of six guns of burnsides brigade to open the way evanss infantry and artillery met the advance and after a severe fight drove it back to the line of woodland when burnside reinforced by his other three regiments with them advanced eight guns this attack was much more formidable and pressed an hour or more before our forces retired to the woodland the fight though slackened continued while the brigade under porter advanced to burnsides support waiting some time to witness the opening of his aggressive fight towards centreville beauregard found at last that his battle order had miscarried while yet in doubt as to the cause of delay his attention was drawn to the fight opened by mcdowell against evans this affair increasing in volume drew him away from his original point and object of observation he ************ the order to attack at centreville and rode for the field just opening to severe work the brigades of bee and *************** by ****** jacksons had been drawn towards the left the former two near cockes position and jackson from the right to the left of mitchells ford they were to await orders but were instructed and intrusted in the absence of orders to seek the place where the fight was thickest about twelve oclock that splendid soldier bernard e bee under orders to find the point of danger construed it as calling him to evanss support and marched without other notice than the noise of increasing battle with his own and bartows brigades and imbodens battery the move against the enemys reserve at centreville suspended colonels terry and lubbock volunteer aides crossed the run to make another reconnoissance of the positions about centreville captain goree of texas and captain sorrel of georgia had also joined the brigade staff as bee approached evans he formed line upon the plateau at the henry house suggesting to evans to withdraw to that as a better field than the advance ground held by the latter but in deference to evanss care for the bridge which involved care for the turnpike bee yielded and ordered his troops to join evanss advance imbodens artillery however failed to respond remaining on the henry plateau leaving bee and evans with two ********** smoothbore guns to combat the enemys formidable batteries of eight to twelve guns of superior metal as well as the accumulating superior infantry forces imbodens battery making a show of practice with sixpounders at great range the infantry crossed youngs branch under severe fire and were posted on the line of evanss battle burnside was reinforced by porters brigade and afterwards by a part of heintzelmans division rickettss battery and subsequently the battery under ******* pressed their fight with renewed vigor the batteries particularly active and aggressive poured incessant fire upon the confederate ranks who had no artillery to engage against them except imbodens far off to the rear and the section of lathams howitzers the efforts of the federal infantry were ******** met and resisted but the havoc of those splendid batteries was too severe particularly griffins that had an oblique fire upon the confederates it was the fire of this battery that first disturbed our ranks on their left and the increasing pounding of that and rickettss eventually unsettled the line at this juncture two brigades of tylers division with general w t sherman and general keyes crossed the run at a ford some distance above the bridge and approached the confederate right making more unsettled their position at the same time the attacking artillery and infantry followed up their opportunity in admirable style pushed the confederates back and pursued down to the valley of youngs branch at one pm colonels terry and lubbock returned from their reconnoissance of the ground in front of centreville with a diagram showing points of the union lines and troops there posted i sent it up to headquarters suggesting that the brigades at the lower fords be put across the run and advance against the reserves as designed by the order of the morning colonel terry returned with the suggestion approved and we communicated the same to the brigades at mcleans and union mills fords commanded by officers of senior dates to myself the brigades were prepared however for concert of action bee bartow and evans made valorous efforts while withdrawing from their struggle on the matthews plateau to maintain the integrity of their lines and with some success when general wade hampton came with his brigade to their aid checked the progress of pursuit and helped to lift their broken ranks to the plateau at the henry house the fight assumed proportions which called for the care of both general johnston and general beauregard who with the movements of their right too late to relieve the pressure of the left found it necessary to draw their forces to the point at which the battle had been forced by the enemy at the same time the reserve brigades of their right were called to the left general thomas j jackson also moved to that quarter and reached the rear crest of the plateau at the henry house while yet bee bartow evans and hampton were climbing to the forward crest quick to note a proper ground jackson deployed on the crest at the height leaving the open of the plateau in front he was in time to secure the imboden battery before it got off the field and put it into action stanards battery pendletons and pelhams and part of the washington artillery were up in time to aid jackson in his new formation and relieve our discomfited troops rallying on his flank as they rose on the forward crest bee saw on the farther side jacksons line serene as if in repose affording a haven so promising of cover that he gave the christening of stonewall for the immortal jackson there said he is jackson standing like a stone wall general johnston and general beauregard reached the field and busied themselves in getting the troops together and in lines of defence other reinforcements were ordered from the right including the reserve brigades at mcleans and union mills fords and a number of batteries bee and evans reformed their lines upon jacksons after permitting burnsides brigade to retire for rest mcdowell pushed his battle by his strong artillery arm advancing against and turning the confederate left only giving some little time to select positions for his batteries to plunge more effective fire into the confederate ranks this time so necessary for mcdowells renewal was as important to the confederates in getting their reinforcements of infantry and artillery in position and proved of even greater value in lengthening out the fight so as to give kirby smith and elzey just off the train from the shenandoah valley time to appear at the last moment after arranging the new position of the troops about jackson general johnston rode back to the lewis house where he could better comprehend the entire field leaving beauregard in charge of the troops engaged on his left mcdowell gave especial care to preparing his batteries for renewal against the confederate left he massed rickettss and griffins batteries and made their practice grand so well executed was it that the confederate left was again in peril and seeing reinforcements approaching towards their rear general johnston sent orders to the brigades at the lower fords revoking authority given them to advance against centreville and ordering their return to the south side and the brigade at union mills was ordered to reinforce the confederate left the brigade at blackburns ford received the recall order in ample time but that at ****************** a little farther away became partially engaged before the recall reached it the brigades resumed their former position however without serious trouble with this order came a message to me saying that the federals were pressing severely on our left and to the limit of its tension that reinforcements were in sight approaching their right which might prove too heavy for our brave men and force us back for which emergency our brigades should be held ready to cover retreat these anxious moments were soon relieved by the approach of general kirby smiths command that had been mistaken as reinforcements for the enemy general smith was wounded but was succeeded in command by the gallant elzey who by a ********* attack approached the rear of the massed batteries at the same time a brave charge on the part of beauregard in cooperation with this fortunate attack of smith and elzey captured the greater part of the batteries and turned some of the guns upon the brave men who had handled them so well mcdowell made a gallant effort to recover his lost power riding with his troops and urging them to brave efforts but our convex line that he was just now pressing back upon itself was changed though attenuated it had become concave by reinforcement and in ********** curve was delivering a concentrated fire upon its adversary before the loss of his artillery he was the samson of the field now he was not only shorn of his power but some of his mighty strength was transferred to his adversary leaving him in desperate plight and exposed to blows increasing in force and effectiveness although his renewed efforts were brave his men seemed to have given confidence over to despair still a show of battle was made until general johnston directed the brigades of holmes and early to good positions for attack when fight was abandoned and flight ensued the regulars under sykes maintained order and with the regular cavalry covered the confused retreat the confederates in the field and approaching at the moment were ordered in pursuit at the same time another order was sent the brigades at the lower fords explaining that the reinforcements supposed to be federals proved to be confederates and that the former were not only forced back but were then in full retreat directing our brigades to cross again and strike the retreating line on the turnpike all of d r joness brigade that had crossed at mcleans ford under the former order had not yet returned to its position under the order to that effect and ewell had gone from union mills ford to the battle on the extreme left so that neither of them came in position ready to take part in the pursuit those at mitchells and blackburns fords advanced the former under general bonham with orders to strike at *** run the latter at centreville finding some obstruction to his march general bonham kept the centreville road and joined the brigade from blackburns taking the lead as the ranking officer through the abandoned camps of the federals we found their pots and kettles over the fire with food cooking quarters of beef hanging on the trees and wagons by the roadside loaded some with bread and general provisions others with ammunition when within artillery range of the retreating column passing through centreville the infantry was deployed on the sides of the road under cover of the forest so as to give room for the batteries ordered into action in the open bonhams brigade on the left the other on the right as the guns were about to open there came a message that the enemy instead of being in precipitate retreat was marching around to attack the confederate right with this report came orders or reports of orders for the brigades to return to their positions behind the run i denounced the report as absurd claimed to know a retreat such as was before me and ordered that the batteries open fire when major whiting of general johnstons staff rising in his stirrups said in the name of general johnston i order that the batteries shall not open i inquired did general johnston send you to communicate that order whiting replied no but i take the responsibility to give it i claimed the privilege of responsibility under the circumstances and when in the act of renewing the order to fire general bonham rode to my side and asked that the batteries should not open as the ranking officer present this settled the question by that time too it was near night colonel g w lay of johnstons staff supported my views notwithstanding the protest of major whiting soon there came an order for the brigades to withdraw and return to their positions behind the run general bonham marched his brigade back but thinking that there was a mistake somewhere i remained in position until the order was renewed about ten oclock my brigade crossed and recrossed the run six times during the day and night it was afterwards found that some excitable person seeing joness brigade recrossing the run from its advance under previous orders took them for federal troops crossing at mcleans ford and rushing to headquarters at the junction reported that the federals were crossing below and preparing for attack against our right and upon this report one of the staffofficers sent orders in the names of the confederate chiefs revoking the orders for pursuit from the effective service of the two guns of lathams battery at short range against the odds brought against them the inference seems fair that the imboden battery had it moved under bees orders could have so strengthened the position on the matthews plateau as to hold it and give time for them to retire and meet general jackson on the henry plateau glorious victory spread her generous wings alike over heroes and *********** the losses of the confederates in all arms were #### federal losses in all arms #### officers and soldiers twentyfive cannon on the 22d the cavalry troop of captain ********* was sent forward with colonel terry volunteer aide on a ride of observation they picked up a number of prisoners and colonel terry cut the ******** of the federal flag over the courthouse at fairfax by a shot from his ********** and sent the bunting to headquarters the plan of the union campaign was that their army in the valley of the shenandoah under general patterson should stand so surely against the confederates in that field under general johnston as to prevent the withdrawal of the latter through the blue ridge which goes to show that the concentration was considered and thought possible and that mcdowell was therefore under some pressure to act in time to gain his battle before johnston could have time for his swoop from the mountains at centreville on the 18th mcdowell was within five miles of his immediate ***************** ********** the route of tylers reconnoissance the sudley ford route involved a march of twenty miles and drew him nearer the reach of johnstons forces so if tylers reconnoissance proved the route by blackburns ford practicable it was imperative on mcdowell to adopt it if it was proved impracticable the route by sudleys ford was necessary and justified the delay but it has been claimed that the union commander did not intend to have the reconnoissance and that he could have made his move a success by that route if he had adopted it which if true would put him in a more awkward position than his defeat he was right in his conclusion that the confederates were prepared for him on that route but it would have been a grave error to leave the shorter more direct line for the circuitous route without first so testing the former as to know if it were practicable knowing as he did that the confederate left was in the air because of leaven looked for from over the blue ridge after the trial of general tyler on the 18th and finding the route closed against him he should have given credit to the division commander and his troops for their courageous work but instead he ********** their efforts and put them under criticism the experiment and subsequent events go to show that the route was not practicable except for seasoned troops mcdowells first mistake was his display and march for a grand military picnic the leading proverb impressed upon the minds of young soldiers of the line by old commanders is never despise your enemy so important a part of the soldiers creed is it that it is enjoined upon subalterns pursuing marauding parties of half a dozen of the aborigines his ************** led him to treat with levity the reconnoissance of general tyler on the 18th as not called for under his orders nor necessary to justify his plans although they involved a delay of three days and a circuitous march around the confederate left then he put upon his division commander the odium of error and *********** exposure of the troops this broke the confidence between them and worked more or less evil through the ranks in the ********* of the campaign had he recognized the importance of the service and encouraged the conduct of the division commander he would have drawn the hearts of his officers and soldiers towards him and ***** up the war spirit and morale of his men tyler was right in principle in the construction of duty under the orders and in his more comprehensive view of the military zodiac in no other way than by testing the strength along the direct route could mcdowell justify delay when time was power and a long march with raw troops in july weather was pending the delay gave beauregard greater confidence in his preconceived plan and brought out his order of the 21st for advance towards mcdowells reserve at centreville but this miscarried and turned to advantage for the plans of the latter had a prompt energetic general been in command when on the 20th his order of battle was settled upon the division under tyler would have been deployed in front of stone bridge as soon after nightfall as darkness could veil the march and the divisions under hunter and heintzelman following would have been stretched along the lateral road in bivouac so as to be prepared to cross sudleys ford and put in a good days work on the morrow had general tylers action of the 18th received proper recognition he would have been confident instead of doubting in his service mcdowells army posted as it should have been a march at daylight would have brought the columns to the henry house before seven oclock dislodged evans busied by tylers display at the bridge without a chance to fight and brought the three divisions reunited in gallant style along the turnpike with little burning of powder thus prepared and organized the compact *********** of twenty thousand men would have been a fearful array against beauregards fragmentary left and by the events as they passed would have assured mcdowell of victory hours before kirby smith and elzey of the army of the shenandoah came upon the field beauregards mistake was in failing to ride promptly after his ********** order and handling his columns while in action as events actually occurred he would have been in overwhelming numbers against mcdowells reserve and supply depot his adversary so taken by surprise his raw troops would not have been difficult to conquer as the experience of both commanders was limited to staff service it is not surprising that they failed to appreciate the importance of prompt and vigorous manuvre in the hour of battle beauregard gave indications of a comprehensive military mind and reserve powers that might with experience and thorough encouragement from the superior authorities have developed him into eminence as a fieldmarshal his adversary seemed untoward not adapted to military organization or combinations most of his men got back to washington under the sheltering wings of the small bands of regulars the mistake of supposing kirby smiths and ****** approaching troops to be union reinforcements for mcdowells right was caused by the resemblance at a distance of the original confederate flag to the colors of federal regiments this mishap caused the confederates to cast about for a new ensign brought out our battleflag led to its adoption by general beauregard and afterwards by higher authority as the union shield of the confederate national flag the supplies of subsistence ammunition and forage passed as we marched through the enemys camps towards centreville seemed ample to carry the confederate army on to washington had the fight been continued to that point the troops in their high hopes would have marched in terrible effectiveness against the demoralized federals gaining confidence and vigor in their march they could well have reached the capital with the ranks of mcdowells men the brigade at blackburns ford five regiments those at mcleans and mitchells fords all quite fresh could have been reinforced by all the cavalry and most of the artillery comparatively fresh and later by the brigades of holmes ewell and early this favorable aspect for fruitful results was all sacrificed through the assumed authority of staffofficers who upon false reports gave *********** to the orders of their chiefs on the 21st a regiment and battery were discharged from the union army reducing its aggregate to about ##### the confederates had ##### mcdowell crossed bull run with ##### of his men and engaged in battle ##### confederates there seem to be no data from which the precise figures can be had these estimates though not strictly accurate are justified by returns so far as they have been officially rendered after general mcdowell reached washington my brigade was thrown forward first to centreville then to fairfax courthouse and later still to falls church and munsons and masons hills the cavalry under colonel j e b stuart constituting part of the command we were provokingly near washington with orders not to attempt to advance even to alexandria wellchosen and fortified positions with soldiers to man them soon guarded all approaches to the capital we had frequent little brushes with parties pushed out to reconnoitre nevertheless we were neither so busy nor so hostile as to prevent the reception of a cordial invitation to a dinnerparty on the other side to be given to me at the headquarters of general richardson he was disappointed when i refused to accept this ******* and advised him to be more careful lest the politicians should have him arrested for giving aid and comfort to the enemy he was my singularly devoted friend and admirer before the war and had not ceased to be conscious of oldtime ties the service at falls church munsons and masons hills was first by my brigade of infantry a battery and stuarts cavalry during that service the infantry and batteries were relieved every few days but the cavalry was kept at the front with me as the authorities allowed me but one battery and that was needed from time to time to strike out at anything and everything that came outside the fortified lines we collected a number of old *********** and mounted on them ********** of different ******* till we had ***************** batteries some large enough of ******* to threaten alexandria and even the national capitol and executive mansion it is needless to add that munsons hill was so safe as not to disturb our profound slumbers this was before the federals began to realize all of their advantages by floating balloons above our heads one of the most conspicuous and successful of our affairs occurred on the 11th of september a brigade of the enemys infantry with eight pieces of artillery and a detachment of cavalry escorting a reconnoitring party advanced to *********** if they had secured and fortified a position there they would have greatly annoyed us colonel stuart who from the start had manifested those qualities of daring courage tempered by sagacity which so admirably fitted him for outpost service had his pickets so far to the front that he was promptly informed of the presence of the enemy he was ordered with about eight hundred infantry a section of rossers battery and captain ******** troop of cavalry to give battle and so adroitly approached the enemy as to surprise him and by a bold dash drove him off in confusion with some loss we had a number of small affairs which served to season the troops and teach the importance of discipline and vigilance it was while at falls church that majorgeneral g w smith reported for duty with the army of northern virginia and was associated with general johnston and general beauregard the three forming a council for the general direction of the operations of the army general mcclellan had by this time been appointed to superior command on the federal side despairing of receiving reinforcement to enable him to assume the offensive general johnston regarded it as hazardous to hold longer the advanced post of munsons and masons hills drew the troops back to and near fairfax courthouse and later about the 19th of october still farther to centreville and prepared for winter quarters by strengthening his positions and constructing huts the line extending to union mills on the right these points were regarded as stronger in themselves and less liable to be turned than the positions at and in advance of fairfax courthouse we expected that mcclellan would advance against us but were not disturbed i was promoted majorgeneral which relieved me of the outpost service to which colonel stuart was assigned the autumn and early winter were not permitted to pass without some stirring incidents in our front soon after the battle of july 21 colonel eppa hunton was ordered to ******** leesburg with his regiment the eighth virginia later the thirteenth seventeenth and eighteenth mississippi regiments were sent to the same vicinity and with the regiment already there and a battery constituted the seventh brigade brigadiergeneral n g evans commanding to cover a reconnoissance and an expedition to gather supplies made by general mccalls division to dranesville general mcclellan ordered general c p stone commanding at *********** maryland to make a demonstration in force against leesburg and if practicable to dislodge the confederates at that place early in the morning of the 21st of october four of general stones regiments crossed the potomac at edwardss ferry and about the same time five other regiments under the immediate command of colonel baker late united states senator from oregon crossed the river above at balls bluff leaving colonel barksdale with his thirteenth mississippi with six pieces of artillery as a reserve to hold in check the force that had crossed at edwardss ferry evans with his main force assailed the force under colonel baker and after a long and fierce struggle under a heavy fire of batteries on both sides of the river drove them down the bluff to the river many ************ others plunging into the river to recross ************ and sinking the boats that had brought them over some drowning in the potomac two months later december 20 there was an affair at dranesville which for us was by no means so satisfactory as evanss at leesburg and balls bluff it was known that food for men and horses could be found in the vicinity of dranesville all of the available wagons of the army were sent to gather and bring it in and colonel stuart with one hundred and fifty of his cavalry the sumter flying artillery captain a s cutts and four regiments of infantry detailed from different brigades was charged with the command of the foraging party the infantry regiments were the eleventh virginia colonel samuel garland tenth alabama colonel ****** sixth south carolina lieutenantcolonel ******* and first kentucky colonel thomas taylor the cavalry ransoms and ********* general mccall commanding the nearest union division happened just then to want those supplies or as seems more probable had information through a spy of stuarts expedition he took measures to gather the supplies or surprise and perhaps capture or destroy stuarts party however that may be when stuart reached the vicinity of dranesville he found himself in the presence of general ord who had under him his own brigade of five regiments of infantry ******* battery two *************** howitzers and two twelvepound guns and two squadrons of cavalry finding that he was anticipated and that his only way of saving the train was to order it back to centreville in all haste stuart decided to attack in order to give it time to get to a place of safety and despatched a detachment of cavalry on the turnpike towards leesburg to warn the wagons to hasten back to centreville the cavalry to march between them and the enemy he ordered his artillery and infantry to hasten to the front and as soon as they came up assailed the enemy vigorously continuing the engagement until he judged that his wagontrain had passed beyond danger then he extricated his infantry and artillery from the contest with a much heavier loss than he had inflicted on the enemy leaving the killed and some of the wounded it was the first success that had attended the union arms in that quarter and was magnified and enjoyed on that side this action advanced mcclellan considerably in popular estimation and led to the ******** upon him by some ********** of the sobriquet the young napoleon during the autumn and early winter the weather had been unusually fine the roads and fields in that section were generally firm and in fine condition for marching and ********* armies with the beginning of the new year winter set in with rain and snow alternate freezing and ******* until the roads and fields became seas of red mud as no effort of general advance was made during the season of firm roads we had little apprehension of trouble after the winter rains came to make them too heavy for artillery service apropos of the attack upon richmond apprehended in the winter of ###### it should be borne in mind that there were four routes supposed to be practicable for the advance of the enemy 1 the original route by manassas junction and the orange and alexandria railroad 2 by crossing the potomac near potomac creek thence by fredericksburg to richmond 3 by ******* ********** go down the potomac to the lower rappahannock landing at or near ****** and thence march for the confederate capital 4 by transports to fortress monroe thence by the peninsula between the james and york rivers general mcclellans long delay to march against general johnston when he was so near and accessible at centreville indicated that he had no serious thought of advancing by that route to prepare to meet him on either of the other routes a line behind the rapidan was the chosen position general beauregard had been relieved of duty in virginia and ordered west with general a s johnston the withdrawal from centreville was delayed some weeks waiting for roads that could be travelled but was started on the 9th of march 1862 and on the 11th the troops were south of the rappahannock general whitings command from ******** joined general holmes at fredericksburg generals ewell and early crossed by the railroad bridge and took positions near it general g w smiths division and mine marched by the turnpike to near culpeper courthouse general stuart with the cavalry remained on bull run until the 10th then withdrew to warrenton junction during the last week of march our scouts on the potomac reported a large number of steamers loaded with troops carrying it was estimated about one hundred and forty thousand men passing down and out of the potomac destined it was supposed for fortress monroe or possibly for the coast of north carolina we were not left long in doubt by the 4th of april mcclellan had concentrated three corps ***** between fortress monroe and newport news on the james river the confederate left crossed the rapidan and from orange courthouse made connection with the troops on the rappahannock at fredericksburg about the 1st of april generals johnston and g w smith were called to richmond for conference with the war department leaving me in command on the 3d i wrote general jackson in the shenandoah valley proposing to join him with sufficient reinforcements to strike the federal force in front of him a sudden severe blow and thus compel a change in the movements of mcclellans army i explained that the responsibility of the move could not be taken unless i was with the detachment to give it vigor and action to meet my views or give time to get back behind the rapidan in case the authorities discovered the move and ordered its recall i had been left in command on the rapidan but was not authorized to assume command of the valley district as the commander of the district did not care to have an officer there of higher rank the subject was discontinued general johnston assigned to the department of the peninsula and norfolk made an inspection of his new lines and on his return recommended that they should be abandoned meanwhile his army had been ordered to richmond he was invited to meet the president to discuss military affairs and asked general g w smith and myself to go with him the secretary of war and general r e lee were with the president when we met it was the first time that i had been called to such august presence to deliberate on momentous matters so i had nothing to say till called on the views intended to be offered were ******** by saying that i knew general mcclellan that he was a military engineer and would move his army by careful *********** and preparation that he would not be ready to advance before the 1st of may the president interrupted and spoke of mcclellans high attainments and capacity in a style indicating that he did not care to hear any one talk who did not have the same appreciation of our great adversary mcclellan had been a special favorite with mr davis when he was secretary of war in the pierce administration and he seemed to take such reflections upon his favorites as somewhat personal from the hasty interruption i concluded that my opinion had only been asked through polite recognition of my presence not that it was wanted and said no more my intention was to suggest that we leave magruder to look after mcclellan and march as proposed to jackson a few days before through the valley of virginia cross the potomac threaten washington and call mcclellan to his own capital at the time of mcclellans landing on the peninsula the confederate army on that line was commanded by majorgeneral j ******** magruder and consisted of eleven thousand men of all arms the defensive line was pitched behind the warwick river a sluggish stream that rises about a mile south of yorktown and flows south to its confluence with james river the warwick was ****** at different points thus flooding the intervening low lands as far as lees mills where the river spreads into marsh lands the dams were defended by batteries and rifletrenches the left rested at yorktown which was fortified by continuous earthworks strong water and land batteries and rifletrenches reaching to the right connecting with those behind the warwick yorktown is on the right bank of york river which narrows at that point with gloucester point on the opposite bank this point was also fortified and held by a strong garrison on the south side of the james general huger held norfolk near its mouth fortified and garrisoned by about ten thousand men while the james river floated the confederate vessels virginia merrimac yorktown jamestown and ****** mcclellans army embarked from alexandria and moved by transports to the vicinity of fortress monroe as first collected numbered one hundred and eight thousand of all arms including the garrison at fortress monroe magruder was speedily reinforced by a detachment from hugers army and afterwards by earlys brigade of johnstons army and after a few days by the balance of johnstons army the divisions of g w smith d h hill and longstreet with stuarts cavalry general johnston in command general mcclellan advanced towards the confederate line and made some efforts at the dams but it was generally understood that his plan was to break the position by regular approaches after allowing due time for the completion of his ********* arrangements johnston abandoned his line the night of may 3 and marched back towards richmond ordering a corresponding move by the troops at norfolk but the confederate authorities interfered in favor of norfolk giving that garrison time to withdraw its army supplies the divisions of g w smith and d h hill were ordered by the yorktown and williamsburg road magruders and longstreets by the hampton and lees mill road stuarts cavalry to cover both routes anticipating this move as the possible result of operations against his lower line general magruder had constructed a series of earthworks about two miles in front of williamsburg the main work fort magruder was a bastion on either side redoubts were thrown up reaching out towards the james and york rivers the peninsula is about eight miles wide at that point college creek on the right flows into james river and queens creek on the left into the york both giving some defensive strength except at ******** which were passable by vehicles the redoubts on the left of fort magruder commanded the dam in queens creek at sanderss pond but the dam in college creek was beyond protection from the redoubts the four redoubts on the right of fort magruder had commanding positions of the fort finding the entire line of intrenchments at yorktown empty on the morning of may 4 mcclellan ordered pursuit by his cavalry under its chief general stoneman with four batteries of horse artillery supported by hookers division on the yorktown road and w f smiths on the hampton road they were followed on the hampton road by general heintzelman kearnys division third corps and couchs and caseys divisions of keyess fourth corps sumners second corps on the yorktown road nearing williamsburg the roads converge and come together in range of field batteries at fort magruder about eight miles out from yorktown on the hampton road stuart hearing of severe cavalry fight by the part of his command on the yorktown road thought to ride across to the enemys rear and ******* his operations but presently found a part of the enemys cavalry and a battery under general emory marching in his rear by a crossroad from the yorktown road he formed and charged in column of fours gaining temporary success but fell upon the enemys battery and found ****** prompt in getting into action and in turn with dismounted troopers drove him back cutting his line of retreat and forcing him off to the beach road along the james river the march of ****** cavalry across to the hampton road misled hookers division to the same march and that division crowding the highway caused smiths division to diverge by a crossroad which led it over into the yorktown road these *********** delayed the advance on both roads emory followed stuart until the latter in turn came upon strong grounds where pursuit became isolated and hazardous the removal of the confederate cavalry from the hampton road left hookers march free of molestation but not advised of the opportunity he took the precautions usual on such occasions his early approach however hurried the movements of the confederate cavalry on the yorktown road and let the enemy in upon us on that road before we were advised of his approach general johnston rode near the rear of his army to receive despatches from his cavalry commander general stuart wrote and sent them but his couriers found the enemys cavalry in the way and returned to him the cavalry fight on the yorktown road was also damaging to the confederates and not reported to the commanding general about four pm general cooks cavalry and the horse artillery under gibson debouched from the woodlands on the yorktown road and began to examine the open ground in front of the confederate fieldworks general johnston who was at the rear hurried semmess brigade of mclawss division into the nearest redoubts and ordered mclaws to call back another brigade kershaw was ordered and ****** battery the battery had to go at a run to be sure of their cover in the redoubts another battery was ordered by mclaws who rode and took command when kershaw got to the fort part of his men were deployed in the wood beyond to his left meanwhile the federal cavalry was advancing gibsons horse artillery and ****** confederate battery were in severe combat the latter having the benefit of ******** parapets observing the approach of cavalry near his left mclaws ordered two of ****** guns into fort magruder which with the assistance of kershaws infantry drove off that column some cavalry riding near the left redoubt with little concern were first taken for confederates but the next moment were identified as federals when the artillery was turned upon them and with the confederate cavalry pushed them quite away when the left redoubt commanding the dam at sanderss pond was occupied by a part of kershaws men ********* battery came into action and with the assistance of others gave gibsons battery in the open serious trouble mclaws ordered an advance of part of semmess brigade led by colonel ******** this with the severe artillery fire from the redoubts and guns afield cleared the open leaving one of gibsons guns in the mud which was secured by ********* men as a trophy of the days work ten horses had been sent back to haul the piece off but the mud was too heavy for them stuart with the troopers of his immediate following and his section of horse artillery crossed college creek near james river and came in after the action at the redoubts emory abandoned the pursuit as not feasible and bivouacked on the route cavalry *********** of the day were reported in which both sides claimed success stuart reported lieutenantcolonel wickham and four men wounded of the other side cooke reported thirtyfive killed wounded and missing gibson reported one officer and four men wounded and one gun abandoned emory reported two killed and four wounded and sanders one officer wounded but most of the federal losses were in the encounters at the redoubts with the artillery and infantry the enemys cavalry reported the redoubt on the confederate left unoccupied and hancocks brigade smiths division was ordered forward to take it but the woods through which he marched were tangled and swampy and delayed him until night brought him to bivouac meanwhile the confederates who drove the cavalry from its reconnoissance had occupied the redoubt the corps commanders sumner heintzelman and keyes and the cavalry leader stoneman were together that night in conference the highways over flats but little above tidewater were saturated by the spring rains cut into deep ruts by the haul of heavy trains and ******* by the tramp of infantry and cavalry the wood and ****** lands were bogs with occasional quicksands adding severest labor to the usual toils of battle so no plans were formed further than to feel the way forward when there was light to see the enemy got some of our men who were worn out by the fatigue of the siege and the heavy march of the night and day before quitting his trenches at yorktown johnston anticipated a move of part of mcclellans army by transports to the head of york river to cut his line of march towards richmond and conceived it important to have a strong force at that point in time to meet and check the move to that end he ordered magruder to march at two am on the 5th of may with d r joness and mclawss divisions to be followed by the divisions of g w smith and d h hill longstreets division to cover the movement of his trains and defend stuarts cavalry in case of severe pressure late in the afternoon of the 4th i was ordered to send a brigade to the redoubts to relieve mclawss division the brigades being small i sent two r h andersons and pryors with ****** battery under lieutenant clopton two guns under captain ******* and two under captain ******** to report to general anderson the senior brigadier at the time it was thought that the army would be on the march by daylight in the morning and that the rearguard would closely follow but after nightfall a downpour of rain came flooding thoroughfares and byways woodlands and fields so that parts of our trains were stalled on the ground where they stood during the night it was dark when anderson joined mclaws who had drawn his men together in readiness to join the advance march anticipating an early march himself anderson occupied fort magruder and advanced his pickets so as to cover with their fire the junction of the yorktown and hampton roads heavy clouds and darkness settling down upon him he made no effort at a critical survey of the surroundings while the steady rain through the night gave signs of serious delay in the movements of the army but he little thought that by the delay he could be called into battle in the morning when time grew heavier he was advised to call in the brigades near him in case he should need them and instructions were sent them to answer his call at daylight he occupied the redoubts on the right of fort magruder and two of those on the left two others farther on the left were not seen through the rain and no one had been left to tell him of them or of the grounds the field in his front and far off on his right was open that in the immediate front had been opened by ******* trees on his left were woodland and the swampy creek general hookers division of the third corps came to the open on the hampton road at seven am of the 5th and engaged by ************ first massachusetts on his left preceded by a battalion of skirmishers the second new hampshire on the right in the same order hancocks brigade of w f smiths division of the fourth corps threatening on the yorktown road supported by part of davidsons brigade and artillery after the advance of his infantry in the ******* general hooker with the eleventh massachusetts and *********** pennsylvania regiments of ******* brigade cleared the way for communication with the troops on the yorktown road and ordered webbers sixgun battery into action towards the front of the fallen timber as it burst from the wood our infantry and every gun in reach opened upon it a fire so destructive that it was ******** before it came into practice volunteers to man the battery were called and with the assistance of men of ******* battery the guns were opened ********* battery was advanced and put into action on the right of webbers when the two poured an unceasing fire against our troops about the fort and redoubts it was not very destructive however and they thought to reserve their ammunition the fifth new jersey regiment of pattersons brigade was added to the guard of the batteries and the sixth seventh and eighth were deployed on the left in the woodland anderson called up wilcoxs brigade and ordered it to his right reinforced it by the men of pryors brigade not needed at the forts and presently called for the brigades of a p hill and pickett to further support his right from the swelling noise of battle i concluded that it would be well to ride to the front and ordered the remaining brigade colstons and the batteries of dearing and stribling to follow stuart sent his horse artillery under pelham into the action on the open field viewing the ground on the left i thought it not so well protected as anderson conceived and sent to d h hill who was but little advanced on his march for one of his brigades earlys was sent to whose brigade were temporarily attached the florida regiment and a mississippi battalion anderson had left the fort and was busy handling the brigades engaged in the woods on the right colstons was put in with the other brigades under anderson who afterwards called for another regiment the florida regiment and the mississippi battalion were sent early with his brigade was posted on the field in rear of our left when it became evident that the fight was for the day d h hill was asked to return with the balance of his division meanwhile hooker was bracing the fight on his left emory reported to him with his cavalry and light battery but as his fight was in the wood emory was asked to reconnoitre on his extreme left the fight growing in the wood ****** drew off part of his brigade to reinforce against it the ************* and seventeenth new york regiments of taylors brigade were also sent then the ************ and ************* new york regiments of the same brigade but the confederates gained ground gradually they were however getting short of ammunition while holding their line some of the regiments were permitted to retire a little to fill their cartridgeboxes from those of the fallen of the enemy and of their comrades this move was misconstrued into an order to withdraw and the line fell back a little but the mistake was rectified and the ground that had been abandoned was recovered hooker ordered the eleventh massachusetts and twentysixth pennsylvania regiments to the support of the batteries and the second new hampshire regiment to his left anderson drawing his troops together near the batteries made a concentrated move upon them and cleared them of the gunners securing four of webbers guns and forty horses just then he was reinforced by colstons brigade the florida regiment and the mississippi battalion general stuart taking it that the enemy was badly broken and in retreat rode up with his cavalry insisting upon a charge and pursuit as he did not recognize authority except of the commanderinchief he was only cautioned that the break was only of the enemys front that he would find reinforcements coming up and this he began to realize by the clearer ring of their muskets he speedily encountered them but in time to get away before meeting serious trouble about three oclock kearnys division arrived and only a few minutes later d h hills of the confederates on the approach of kearnys leading brigades one regiment was detached from berrys to reinforce ****** cavalry detachment on their left the other regiments were deployed the fifth michigan on the left of the road the

hookers relief anderson had established his advance line of skirmishers so as to cover with their fire webbers guns that were abandoned the federal reinforcing columns drove back his advance line when in turn he reinforced recovered the ground and met general peck who led the last reinforcing brigade this advance was so firm that general peck found it necessary to put in his last regiment the ************ pennsylvania but neither our force nor our condition of march could warrant further aggressive work of our right general couch left in command on the federal left posted his troops for the ************ ****** with the seventh massachusetts regiment and second rhode island general palmer with two and general **** with three other regiments supporting general peck general ***** ammunition being exhausted his brigade was relieved by six of the new regiments and reported that every preparation was made to resist a night attack on the confederate side general anderson reported his position safe to hold until the time to withdraw for the march about noon general hancock in command of his own and davidsons brigades in front of our left started with three of his own regiments and two of davidsons and the sixgun battery under lieutenant ****** in search of the unoccupied redoubts in that quarter he approached by the dam at sanderss pond passed the dam and occupied one of the redoubts leaving three companies to guard a road crossing on the right of his line of march he put three companies of infantry in the redoubt and advanced his regiments and battery to the field in front he then found another redoubt not occupied and posted three other companies in it he was reinforced by a ******* battery under captain wheeler which he posted in rear of his line of battle and awaited developments when the last engagement on our right had calmed down to exchange of desultory shots d h hills division was waiting to know if anderson would need further support meanwhile some of his officers had made a reconnoissance in front of his ground and reported a route by which favorable attack could be made upon the federals at the redoubt under hancock general johnston had arrived at my headquarters near fort magruder when general hill sent to report the reconnoissance and to ask that he be allowed to make a move against hancock by earlys brigade general johnston received the message and referred the officer to me i ordered that the move should not be made explaining that we were only fighting for time to draw off our trains that aggressive battle was necessary on our right in order to keep the enemy back in the woodland from the open where by his superior artillery and numbers he might deploy beyond our limits and turn us out of position that on our left there was no cause for apprehension of such action and we could not risk being drawn into serious delay by starting new work so late in the day very soon general hill rode over to report of the opportunity that he thought he could get through before night and would not be likely to involve delay of our night march general johnston referred him to me i said in a letter from general hill after the war he wrote of the fight by this brigade general hill was in advance of the brigade with the fifth and twentythird north carolina regiments general early in rear with the twentyfourth and thirtyeighth virginia regiments general hill ordered the advance regiments to halt after crossing a ********* and get under cover of the wood till the brigade could form but general early not waiting for orders or the brigade rode to the front of the twentyfourth virginia and with it made the attack the gallant mcrae of the fifth north carolina seeing the twentyfourth virginia hotly engaged dashed forward ****** ****** to its relief the other regiments seeing the confusion of movements and of orders failed to go forward part of my troops on earlys right seeing that a fight was open on that part of the field started without orders to go to his relief but found the fight lost before they were engaged after the brigade was collected on its first position general johnston rode to his headquarters at dark the confederates were withdrawn and took up the line of march the division of d h hill taking the rear of the column rainss brigade the rear of the division on his march general rains found in a brokendown *************** several loaded shells four of them with sensitive fuse ******* which he placed near some fallen trees cut down as obstructions he afterwards heard that some of them were tramped upon by the federal cavalry and exploded the pursuit was not active hardly annoying the roads were cut into deep mud by the trains and the sideways by troops far out on either side making ******* ankledeep in all directions so that the march was slow and trying but giving almost absolute safeconduct against pursuit and our men were allowed to spread their ranks in search of ground strong enough to bear them my estimate made on the field of the troops engaged was confederate 9000 union 12000 the casualties of the engagement were confederate #### aggregate federal #### aggregate general mcclellan was at yorktown during the greater part of the day to see franklins sedgwicks and richardsons divisions aboard the transports for his proposed flanking and rear move up york river but upon receiving reports that the engagement at williamsburg was growing serious and not satisfactory he rode to the battle and called the divisions of sedgwick and richardson to follow him the object of the battle was to gain time to haul our trains to places of safety the effect besides was to call two of the divisions from their flanking move to support the battle and this so crippled that expedition that it gave us no serious trouble the trophies of the battle were with the confederates and they claim the honor to inscribe williamsburg upon their battleflags the success of general hancock in holding his position in and about the forts with five regiments and two batteries against the assault of the fifth north carolina and twentyfourth virginia regiments was given heroic proportions by his chief who christened him the superb to relieve it is supposed by the picturesque figure on his right the discomfiture of his left but reading between the lines the highest compliment was for the two confederate regiments in his official account general johnston said franklins division was taken by transports to the mouth of pamunkey river and was supported by the navy on the 7th a brigade of sedgwicks division joined franklin on the same day johnstons army was collected near *********** general whiting with hoods brigade and part of hamptons engaged the advance of franklins command and forced it back this cleared our route of march towards richmond smiths and magruders divisions by the road to new kent courthouse hills and longstreets nearer the chickahominy general mcclellans plans were laid according to strict rules of strategy but he was not quick or forcible in handling his troops on the 9th of may the confederate army was halted its right near long bridge of the chickahominy river its left and cavalry extending towards the pamunkey through new kent courthouse on the 11th the commander of the confederate ram virginia merrimac finding the water of james river not sufficient to float her to the works near richmond scuttled and sank the ship where she lay on the 15th the federal navy attacked our works at chapins and drurys bluffs but found them too strong for water batteries that attack suggested to general johnston that he move nearer richmond to be in position to lend the batteries assistance in case of need he crossed the chickahominy his

latter withdrawing a mile and a half on the williamsburg road at the same time two other parties of federals were sent up the left bank one under general davidson of the cavalry with artillery and infantry supports as far as mechanicsville where he encountered and dislodged a confederate cavalry force under colonel b h robertson and occupied the position the third party under colonel woodbury the fourth michigan infantry and a squadron of the second united states cavalry moved up to new bridge where the fifth louisiana colonel hunt of semmess brigade was on picket finding the bridge well guarded a party conducted by lieutenant bowen topographical engineers marched up the river concealing their movements crossed to the west bank and passing down surprised the fifth louisiana threw it into disorder and gained position on the west side pleased at these successes general mcclellan sent a sensational despatch to the president his position thus masked rested his right upon beaver dam creek a stream that flows from the height between the chickahominy and pamunkey rivers south to its confluence with the former a few hundred yards below mechanicsville bridge its banks are ******* about six feet high and eight feet apart making a strong natural ditch for defensive works on commanding ground south of the creek admirably planned fieldworks were soon constructed which made that flank unassailable two miles out from the river the creek loses its value as a defensive line from beaver dam the line was extended down the river to new bridge where it crossed and reached its left out to white oak swamp and there found as defensible guard as the right at beaver dam creek the swamp is about a quarter of a mile wide at the left and down to the chickahominy studded with heavy

received information that general mcdowells corps was at fredericksburg and on the march to reinforce mcclellans right at mechanicsville he prepared to attack mcclellan before mcdowell could reach him to this end he withdrew smiths division from the williamsburg road relieving it by the division of d h hill withdrew longstreets division from its position and a p hills from ashland the fighting column was to be under general g w smith his next in rank and general whiting was assigned command of smiths *********** column to consist of a p hills whitings and d r joness divisions the latter was

river the march to be made during the night d h hill to post a brigade on his right on the charles city road to guard the field to be left by his division as well as the line left vacant by

magruder stuart and longstreet when we were assembled general johnston announced later information that mcdowells line of march had been *********** he was going north following the report of this information general smith proposed that the plan for battle should be given up in view of the very strong ground at beaver dam creek i urged that the plan laid against the concentrating columns was made stronger by the change of direction of mcdowells column and should suggest more prompt and vigorous prosecution in this magruder and stuart joined me the **** and **** were talked over till a late hour when at last general johnston weary of it walked aside to a separate seat i took the opportunity to draw near him and suggested that the federal position behind beaver dam creek so seriously objected to by general smith could be turned by marching to and along the high ground between the chickahominy and pamunkey rivers that the position of the enemy when turned would be abandoned without a severe struggle and give a fair field for battle that we should not lose the opportunity to await another possible one general johnston replied that he was aware of all that but found that he had selected the wrong officer for the work this ended the talk and i asked to be allowed to halt my columns as soon as possible the other movements were arrested except that of a p hills division which was ordered to continue its march cross the chickahominy at meadow bridge and take position between the meadow bridge road and the brooke turnpike the ************ ********** my command of the right wing including d h hills division on the williamsburg road and extending to the york river railroad before leaving the conference i announced that we would fight on the williamsburg road if we had to find the enemy through ****** the order to halt the columns found smiths division between the mechanicsville and meadow bridge roads longstreets near the city at the nine miles road d r jones had not moved on the 29th and 30th general d h hill sent out reconnoitring parties on the williamsburg and charles city roads on the 30th he received a fair report of caseys intrenched camp and the probable strength and extent of the line of his skirmishers reaching out his left front to white oak swamp on the 29th general johnston wrote general whiting commanding smiths division giving notice of a reconnoissance ordered by general hill cautioning the former that his division should be drawn towards the right to be in better position for support of a battle of his right and adding the report of general d h hills reconnoissance of the 30th was forwarded to headquarters i followed it and found general johnston ready to talk over plans for battle general huger had reported with three of his brigades and was in camp near the outskirts of richmond on gillis creek the plan settled upon was that the attack should be made by general d h hills division on the williamsburg road supported by longstreets division hugers division just out of garrison duty at norfolk was to march between hills right and the swamp against the enemys line of skirmishers and move abreast of the battle g w smiths division under whiting to march by the gaines road to old tavern and move abreast of the battle on its left the field before old tavern was not carefully covered by the enemys skirmishers north of fair oaks nor by parties in observation experience during the discussion of the battle ordered for the 28th caused me to doubt of effective work from the troops ordered for the left flank but the plan seemed so simple that it was thought impossible for any one to go dangerously wrong and general johnston stated that he would be on that road the better to receive from his troops along the crest of the chickahominy information of movements of the enemy on the farther side of the river and to look to the cooperation of the troops on the nine miles road to facilitate marches hugers division was to have the charles city road to the head of white oak swamp file across it and march down its northern margin d h hill to have the williamsburg road to the enemys front longstreets division to march by the nine miles road and a lateral road leading across the rear of general hill on the williamsburg road g w smith by the gaines road to old tavern on the nine miles road the tactical handling of the battle on the williamsburg road was left to my care as well as the general conduct of affairs south of the york river railroad the latter line being the left of the field to which i had been assigned the right wing while yet affairs were under consideration a terrific storm of vivid lightning thunderbolts and rain as severe as ever known to any climate burst upon us and continued through the night more or less severe in the first lull i rode from general johnstons to my headquarters and sent orders for early march for a more comprehensive view of affairs as ordered it may be well to explain that general johnston ordered smiths division by the gaines road so that in case of delay of its march mclawss division on that road and nearer the field of proposed action could be brought in to the left of the battle leaving the place of his division to be occupied by smiths when the latter reached mclawss vacated line there was therefore no reason why the orders for march should be misconstrued or ********** i was with general johnston all of the time that he was engaged in planning and ordering the battle heard every word and thought expressed by him of it and received his verbal orders generals huger and smith his written orders the nine miles road takes the name from the distance by that road from richmond to seven pines the williamsburg road to the same point was sometimes called the seven miles road because of the distance by that road to seven pines as expressed and repeated in his orders general johnstons wish was to have the battle pitched as early as practicable when his orders were issued he was under the impression that i would be the ranking officer on the right of the york railroad and would give detailed instructions to govern the later operations of hugers troops subsequent events seem to call for mention just here that general smith instead of moving the troops by the route assigned them marched back to the nine miles road near the city rode to johnstons headquarters about six in the morning and reported that he was with the division but not for the purpose of taking command from general whiting as general johnston did not care to order him back to his position as commander of the left wing he set himself to work to make trouble complained that my troops were on the nine miles road in the way of his march and presently complained that they had left that road and were over on the williamsburg road and induced general johnston to so far ****** the plans as to order three of my brigades down the nine miles road to the new bridge fork the order was sent by lieutenant washington of johnstons staff who unused to *********** failed to notice that he was not riding on my line of march and rode into the enemys lines this accident gave the enemy the first warning of approaching danger it was misleading however as it caused general keyes to look for the attack by the nine miles road the storms had flooded the flat lands and the waters as they fell seemed weary of the battle of the elements and inclined to have a good rest on the soft bed of sand which let them gently down to the ********** of clay or it may have been the purpose of kind providence to so ******** the upper and lower ****** as to interpose serious barriers to the passing of artillery and thus break up the battle of men my march by the nine miles and lateral roads leading across to the williamsburg road was interrupted by the flooded grounds about the head of gillis creek at the same time this creek was bank full where it found a channel for its flow into the james the delay of an hour to construct a bridge was preferred to the encounter of more serious obstacles along the narrow lateral road flooded by the storm as we were earlier at the creek it gave us precedence over hugers division which had to cross after us the division was prepared with cooked rations had wagons packed at six oclock and rested in the rear of general hills at nine am meanwhile general g w smiths division had marched by the nine miles road and was resting near the fork of the new bridge road at old tavern upon meeting general huger in the morning i gave him a ******** account of general johnstons plans and wishes after which he inquired as to the dates of our commissions which revealed that he was the ranking officer when i suggested that it was only necessary for him to take command and execute the orders this he declined then it was proposed that he should send two of his brigades across to join on the right of the column of attack while he could remain with his other brigade which was to relieve that of general hill on the charles city road though he expressed himself satisfied with this his manner was eloquent of discontent the better to ********* i proposed to reinforce his column by three of my brigades to be sent under general wilcox to lead or follow his division as he might order under this arrangement it seemed that concert of action was assured i gave especial orders to general wilcox to have care that the head of his column was abreast the battle when it opened and rode forward to join general hill my other three brigades advancing along the williamsburg road opposing and in the immediate front of general hill was the division of general casey of the fourth keyess corps the division stood in an intrenched camp across the williamsburg road with a ********** redoubt unfinished on the left of his line half a mile in rear of caseys division was that of couch of the same corps behind a second trenched line at its junction of the nine miles road part of couchs extending along the latter road to fair oaks station of the york river railroad and intrenched farther forward he had a guarded picket station between couch and casey a skirt of wood stretched from the swamp on their left across the williamsburg and nine miles roads and the railroad between the stretch of forest and couch was an open spreading across the roads and at caseys front was another open though more limited some abatis being arranged along their front lines these were the only cleared fields on the south side of the railroad within two miles of caseys picket line our line of march and attack general d h hill stood ready for battle at an early hour waiting for his brigade on the charles city road under the delay to relieve that brigade by one of hugers divisions i sent orders to general wilcox to pull off from column on that road and march for the position assigned him near the head of white oak swamp the detailed instructions for battle were that the advance should be made in columns of brigades two on each side the williamsburg road preceded by strong lines of skirmishers the advance approaching an open or abatis or trench line should reinforce the skirmish line to strong engagement while the lines of battle turned those obstacles by flank or oblique march when the general advance should be resumed as the wooded field was not convenient for artillery use we only held the batteries of ********* and carter ready for call at eleven oclock weary of delay general hill asked to let loose his ********* and engage but was ordered to wait for his absent brigade the reports of the hour of opening battle are more conflicting in this than in most battles owing possibly to the fact that many are fixed by the beginning of the hot battle about the trenched camp while others are based on the actual firing of the signalguns the weight of evidence seems conclusive of the former attack at one pm and this would place the firing of the signalguns back to noon or a little after as events occurred however the hour is not of especial interest as it is shown that the battle was in time for a finish before night if it had been promptly followed up i will say therefore that general hills second appeal to open the ********* was made a little before noon and that he stated in this appeal that his brigade from the charles city road was approaching and would be with him he was then authorized to march but to give instructions that the advance should be carefully conducted until all the troops were in place to give full force to his battle he had four brigades and was ordered to advance in columns of brigades two on each side of the road garlands and g b andersons brigades in columns preceded by skirmishers advanced on the left of the road at the sound of the guns and engaged after a short march from the starting as rodess brigade was not yet in position some little time elapsed before the columns on the right moved so that garlands column encountered more than its share of early fight but rodes supported by rainss brigade came promptly to his relief which steadied the advance the enemys front was reinforced and arrested progress of our skirmishers but a way was found by which the enemy was turned out of position and by and by the open before the intrenched camp was reached in the redoubt was a sixgun battery and on the right another section of two pieces general hill ordered ********** battery to the open into action and presently the battery of captain carter garland and g b anderson had severe contention at one oclock but by pushing front and flank movements got to the enemys strong line r h andersons brigade was pushed up in support of their left when a bold move gave us the section of artillery and that end of the line at the same time carters battery was in close practice with five guns within four hundred yards of the redoubt and the enemy was seriously disturbed but general hill was disposed to wait a little for huger thought to be between him and the swamp to get farther in then fearing that longer wait might be hazardous of his opportunity he ordered rainss brigade past the enemys left when rodes seized the moment rushed in and gained the redoubt and the battery the officers at the battery made a brave effort to ***** their guns but were killed in the act so rodes who had some artillerists acting as infantry turned them with some effect upon the troops as they retired when general hill reported that he must use rainss brigade to march around the redoubt other orders were sent general wilcox to leave general hugers column and march to his position on the right of general hills battle directing in case there were serious obstacles to his march by the charles city road to march over to and down the williamsburg road a slip of paper was sent general johnston reporting progress and asking cooperation on our left the battle moved bravely on r h andersons brigade was ordered to support its left at fair oaks and picketts on the railroad was drawn near hill met caseys troops rallying and reinforcements with them coming to recover the lost ground but they were forced back to the second intrenched line couchs where severe fighting ensued but the line was carried at two oclock cutting couch with four regiments and two companies of infantry and ****** sixgun battery off at fair oaks station finding that he could not cut his way back to his command couch stood back from the railroad and presently opened his battery fire across our advancing lines as he was standing directly in front of smiths division we thought that he would soon be attacked and driven off nevertheless it was not prudent to leave that point on our flank unguarded until we found smiths division in action the force was shut off from our view by the thick pine wood so that we could know nothing of its strength and only knew of its position from its artillery fire we could not attack it lest we should fall under the fire of the division in position for that attack andersons other regiments under the gallant colonel m jenkins were ordered into hills forward battle as his troops were worn jenkins soon found himself in the van and so swiftly led on that the discomfited troops found no opportunity to rally reinforcements from the third corps came but in the swampy wood jenkins was prompt enough to strike their heads as their retreating comrades passed right and left and front he applied his beautiful tactics and pushed his battle general kearny finding that he could not arrest the march put berrys brigade off to the swamp to flank and strike it and took part of ******** brigade to follow they got into the swamp and followed it up to the open near the couch intrenchment but jenkins knew that there was some one there to meet them and pushed his onward battle general hill ordered rainss brigade to turn this new force while rodes attacked but the latters men were worn and some of them were with the advance kempers brigade was sent to support the forward battle but general hill directed it to his right against ***** in front of rains and it seems that the heavy swampy ground so obstructed operations on both sides as to limit their work to infantry ********** until six oclock our battle on the williamsburg road was in a sack we were strong enough to guard our flanks and push straight on but the front was growing heavy it was time for wilcoxs brigades under his last order but nothing was heard of them i asked general stuart who had joined me if there were obstacles to wilcoxs march between the charles city and williamsburg roads he reported that there was nothing more than swamp lands hardly kneedeep he was asked for a guide who was sent with a courier bearing orders for them to remain with general wilcox until he reported at my headquarters again i reported the cramped condition of our work owing to the artillery practice from beyond the railroad and asked general johnston to have the division that was with him drive that force away and loose our left this note was ordered to be put into general johnstons hands he gave peremptory commands to that effect but the movements were so slow that he lost patience and rode with hoods leading brigade pulled it on and ordered communication opened with my left at one oclock general mcclellan at his headquarters beyond the river six miles away heard the noise of battle and ordered sumners second corps under arms to await orders general sumner ordered the command under arms marched the divisions to their separate bridges and put the columns on the bridges partly submerged to hold them to their moorings anxiously awaiting authority from his chief to march to the relief of his comrades the bridge where sedgwicks division stood was passable but richardsons was under water ********* and the flooding river rising richardson ***** one brigade through but thought that he could save time by marching up to the sedgwick bridge which so delayed him that he did not reach the field until after night as general johnston rode with hoods brigade he saw the detachment under general couch marching north to find at the adams house the road to grapevine bridge his open way of retreat directly he heard firing where couch was marching but thought that smiths other brigades were equal to work that could open up there and rode on ordering hood to find communication with my left smiths other brigades were whitings commanded by colonel law hamptons pettigrews and hattons whiting commanding the division smith commanding the left wing smith quotes colonel ****** who was with him at the ******* he received his orders at ### pm and marched with sedgwicks ************* *********** ****** battery and reached the ground of couchs work at 430 in less than an hour he had surveyed the ground and placed his troops to receive battle general smith attacked with hamptons pettigrews and hattons brigades it seems he made no use of artillery though on the field right and left the opportunity was fair the troops fought bravely as did all confederate soldiers we heard the steady rolling fire of musketry and the boom of cannon that told of deadly work as far as the williamsburg road but it did not last general ****** was killed general pettigrew wounded and a prisoner and general hampton wounded general smith was beaten general smith sent to call hoods brigade from his right and posted it about dark near fair oaks station at parting general hood said our people over yonder are whipped general wilcox filed his three brigades into the williamsburg road followed by two of hugers division at five oclock he was reminded of his orders to be abreast of the battle and that he was only four hours behind it but reported that while marching by the first order by the charles city road he received orders to try the williamsburg road that marching for that road he was called by orders to follow a guide who brought him back to the charles city road he confessed that his orders to march with the front of battle were plain and well understood but his marches did not quite agree with the comprehensive view of his orders two of his ************ eleventh alabama under colonel ******** moore and the nineteenth mississippi under major *********** ordered to join kemper turn the position of the enemy at that point and capture or dislodge them with the other regiments general wilcox was ordered by the williamsburg road to

ordered to put them in his position and move his other regiments to the front colonel moore hurried his leading companies into the turning move against berrys brigade before his regiment was up and before the mississippi regiment was in supporting distance and fell mortally wounded general kearny seeing the move and other troops marching towards it ordered his troops out and in retreat through the swamp he reported of it he states the hour as six pm birneys brigade of kearnys division was ordered along the north side of the railroad a little before night and had several encounters with parts of r h andersons brigade and some regiments of g b andersons jenkins nothing daunted pushed his brave battle forward until the shades of night settled about the wood and flashes of ************ began to creep through the pines in search of wounded friend and foe at seven oclock general johnston ordered his troops on the field to sleep on their lines and be ready to renew operations in the morning and ordered general smith to call up other troops of the left wing at half after seven he was hit by a ********* then a fragment of shell ******** him and he was borne from the field so severely wounded that he was for a considerable time ************* for duty the command devolved temporarily upon general g w smith general johnston was skilled in the art and science of war gifted in his quick penetrating mind and soldierly bearing genial and affectionate in nature honorable and winning in person and confiding in his love he drew the hearts of those about him so close that his comrades felt that they could die for him until his recovery the confederacy experienced a serious deprivation and when that occurred he was no longer commanderinchief for general lee was promptly called to the post of honor the brigades were so mixed up through the pines when the battle closed that there was some delay in getting the regiments to their proper commands getting up supplies and arranging for the morning d h hills was put in good order and in bivouac near the casey intrenchment those of longstreet between the williamsburg road and railroad wilcoxs brigade took position on the right in place of the detachment under jenkins pryors brigade next on the left kemper anderson and colston near the stage road williamsburg they made blazing fires of ********* to dry their clothing and blankets and these lighted reinforcing union troops to their lines behind the railroad the brigades of hugers division armisteads and mahones were near the left pickett was ordered to report to general hill at daylight also the batteries of ****** stribling and watson it was past eleven oclock when all things were made ready and the killed and wounded cared for then i rode to find the headquarters of our new commander majorgeneral g w smith was of the highest standing of the west point classes and like others of the engineers had a big name to help him in the position to which he had been suddenly called by the ************** of the confederate commander i found his headquarters at one oclock in the morning reported the work of the commands on the williamsburg road on the 31st and asked for part of the troops ordered up by general johnston that we might resume battle at daylight he was disturbed by reports of pontoon bridges said to be under construction for the use of other reinforcements to join the enemy from the east side and was anxious lest the enemy might march his two corps on the east side by the upper river and occupy richmond but after a time these notions gave way and he suggested that we could renew the battle on the williamsburg road provided we would send him one of our brigades to help hold his position and make the battle by a wheel on his right as a pivot as the commands stood smiths division on our left was at right angles to the york river railroad facing east his right near fair oaks station besides his division of ten thousand he had magruders and other commands of fresh troops near ********* thousand my left lay near smiths right the line extending parallel to the railroad for a mile facing north thence it broke to the rear and covered the ground from that point to the swamp the return front facing the enemys third intrenched line smiths part of the field was open and fine for artillery practice the field fronting on the railroad was so shut in by heavy pine forest and tangled swamp that we had no place for a single gun d h hills division was in reserve near the casey encampment the enemy stood sedgwicks division in front of smith richardsons division in column of three brigades parallel to the railroad and behind it prepared to attack my left on richardsons left was birneys brigade behind the railroad and under the enemys third intrenched line were the balance of the third and all of the fourth corps so the plan to wheel on smiths right as a pivot my right stepping out on the wheel would have left the third and fourth corps to attack our rear as soon as we moved besides it was evident that our new commander would do nothing and we must look to accident for such aid as might be drawn to us during the battle the plan proposed could only be considered under the hypothesis that magruder would come in as the pivotal point and upon having the enemys line fully exposed would find the field fine for his batteries and put them in practice without orders from his commander and breaking the enemys line by an enfilade fire from his artillery would come into battle and give it ******** power i left headquarters at three oclock and after an hours repose rode to the front to find general hill wilcoxs brigade was on my right on the return front pryors brigade on his left and r h anderson kemper colston armistead and mahone occupied the line between the williamsburg road and the railroad picketts brigade was ordered to be with general hill at daylight and ******* striblings and watsons batteries of picketts brigade to take position on the right of armisteads i found general hill before he had his breakfast enjoying the comforts of caseys camp pickett had passed and was in search of his position which was soon disclosed by a fusillade from the front of richardsons division a party of ******* from richmond had found their way into the camp at fair oaks and were getting such things as they could put their hands on they were taken in the gray of the morning for confederate troops and fired upon this made some confusion with our new troops and part of them opened fire in the wrong direction putting two or three bullets through general hills tent before he got out of it hoods brigade of smiths division the pivotal point came under this fire and was immediately withdrawn hood reported his position good but his orders were to retire our cavalry had established communication with headquarters and gave prompt notice of movements as they occurred the pivot was moving to the rear but battle on the williamsburg road steadily advanced with orders to develop the enemys battle front through its extent along the railroad not to make the fancied wheel but to expose his line to the practice of our batteries on the nine miles road our infantry moved steadily engaging frenchs brigade of richardsons division which was led by one of howards regiments french was supported by howards brigade and howard by meaghers and the firing extended along my line as far as the return front of my right but magruder was not on the field to seize the opportunity for his artillery he was nowhere near the ********* not been called general whiting however saw the opportunity so inviting and reported to his commander at half after six oclock general smith had parties posted along the heights of the chickahominy in close observation of the movements of the enemys forces on the east bank these parties reported from time to time that the enemy was moving his forces down the east bank and crossing them over to take part in the fight the accounts proved false but they continued to come to headquarters and were forwarded to my command on the williamsburg road and gave us some concern failing to receive approval of his chief general whiting reported at nine oclock the answer he received was to throw back his right and take position a little nearer to the new bridge fork of the nine miles road thus swinging the pivot farther back general smith complained that the enemy was getting into the interval between our lines but position between two fires was not the place the enemy wanted he could not know that smith wouldnt shoot under this long and severe infantry fight there was no point on my part of the field upon which we could post a single gun part of armisteads new troops gave way but the gallant brigadier maintained his ground and soon collected his other regiments before this i had reported ready and awaiting a guide the brigade that was to be sent over to the nine miles road at half after ten oclock general smith sent word that he had heard nothing of the brigade expected to come to his support and renewed his reports of the enemy crossing over and concentrating against us on the williamsburg road he repeated too his wish to have his cavalry keep close communication between the wings of the army this close communication had been established early in the morning and was maintained through the day and the reports of the enemys crossing were all false but our new commander seemed to forget at the same time he wrote me whitings position instead of being pivotal began its rearward move at the opening fire at daybreak and continued in that line of conduct until it reached a point of quiet general smith was informed that the brigade called for by him would not be sent over that his troops were doing nothing while all of mine were in severe battle except a single brigade and the enemy was massing his fighting force against me that the grounds were so flooded that it was difficult to keep up our supply of ammunition that with the aid of his troops the battle would be ours but just then he held a council with generals mclaws and whiting and chief engineer stevens and submitted the question must the troops be withdrawn or the attack continued all voted in favor of the former except mclaws in a letter since written he has said before general mclaws found me i wrote general smith general mclaws reported of his ride to my lines nothing was sent in reply to mclawss report but we soon learned that the left wing of the army was quiet and serene in defensive positions about the new bridge fork of the nine miles road at the first quiet of our battle after the left wing quit the field i ordered the brigades withdrawn to defensive position about the trenches at seven pines but before the order reached the front the fight was renewed by hookers division upon wilcox and pryor and reached out to our left near fair oaks in the heat of this general wilcox received the order to retire and in undue haste pulled his command out assumed authority over pryor and ordered him off pickett the true soldier knowing that the order was not intended for such emergency stood and resisted the attack colston was sent to his aid and the attack was repulsed immediately after this repulse was a quiet advance upon picketts right the commander asked what troops are these virginians dont fire he ordered we will capture the last one of these virginians just then the virginians rose and opened a fearful fire that drove him back to his bushy cover which ended the battle of seven pines pickett was withdrawn to position assigned for his brigade our line of skirmishers remaining near the enemys during the day and night general wilcox reported of his battle when he pulled off from it that he was doing as well as he could wish but general hooker reported pursuit was hopeless the failure of the enemy to push the opportunity made by the precipitate retreat of general wilcox and picketts successful resistance told that there was nothing in the reports of troops coming over from the east side to take part in the battle and we were convinced that the river was not passable i made an appeal for ten thousand men that we might renew our battle without regard to general smith and those about him it received no more consideration than the appeal made through general mclaws then general lee having been assigned to command came upon the field after noon by the nine miles road and with general smith came over to the williamsburg road a similar proposition was made general lee but general smith protested that the enemy was strongly fortified at the time the enemys main battle front was behind the railroad fronting against me but exposed to easy enfilade fire of batteries to be posted on his right flank on the nine miles road while his front against me was covered by the railway embankment it is needless to add that under the fire of batteries so posted his lines would have been broken to confusion in twenty minutes general holmes marched down the williamsburg road and rested in wait for general lee like general huger he held rank over me general lee ordered the troops back to their former lines those on the williamsburg road were drawn back during the night the rearguard picketts brigade passing the casey works at sunrise on the 2d unmolested part of richardsons division mistook the camp at fair oaks for the casey camp and claimed to have recovered it on the afternoon of the 1st but it was not until the morning of the 2d that the casey camp was abandoned the confederate losses in the two days fight were #### the union losses #### it seems from union accounts that all of our dead were not found and buried on the afternoon of the 1st it is possible as our battle was in the heavy forest and swamp tangles general smith has written a great deal about the battle of seven pines during the past twenty or thirty years in efforts to show that the failure of success was due to want of conduct on the part of the forces on the williamsburg road he claims that he was only out as a party of observation to prevent reinforcement of the enemy from the east side of the river and that he kept sumner off of us but he waited three hours after the enemys ranks and lines had been broken instead of moving with and finishing the battle thus giving sumner time to march from the east of the river and strike him and beat him to disorder and change the lost battle to success he shows that hills and longstreets divisions could have gained the battle ************ may be true enough but it would have been a fruitless success for the enemy got forces over to protect those of the west side whereas the stronger battle ordered by the four divisions could and would have made a complete success of it but for the balky conduct of the divisions ordered to guard the flanks instead of six hours hard work to reach the enemys third line we could have captured it in the second hour and had the field cleaned up before sumner crossed the river general keyes the commander of the fourth corps in his fifty years observations says general smith lay in wait three hours after the enemys positions were broken and carried giving ample time for the march of the succoring forces the hour of the attack was not so important as prompt and vigorous work if the battle had opened at sunrise smith would have made the same wait and sumners march would have been in time to beat him all elements of success were in the plan but balky troops will mar the strongest plans he tries to persuade himself that he intended to join our battle on the williamsburg road but there was no fight in his heart after his ********* encounter with sedgwicks division on the afternoon of the 31st the opportunity for enfilade fire of his artillery along the enemys battle front at the morning opening and all of the forenoon was waiting him while reports of the enemy crossing the river reinforcing against my single contest were demanding relief and aid he reported sick on the 2d and left the army when ready for duty he was assigned about richmond and the seaboard of north carolina he applied to be restored to command of his division in the field but the authorities thought his services could be used better elsewhere he resigned his commission in the confederate service went to georgia and joined joe browns militia where he found congenial service better suited to his ideas of vigorous warfare the assignment of general lee to command the army of northern virginia was far from *********** the troops to the loss of our beloved chief joseph e johnston with whom the army had been closely connected since its earliest active life all hearts had learned to lean upon him with confidence and to love him dearly general lees experience in active field work was limited to his west virginia campaign against general rosecrans which was not successful his services on our coast defences were known as able and those who knew him in mexico as one of the principal engineers of general scotts column marching for the capture of the capital of that great republic knew that as military engineer he was especially distinguished but officers of the line are not apt to look to the staff in choosing leaders of soldiers either in tactics or strategy there were therefore some misgivings as to the power and skill for field service of the new commander the change was accepted however as a happy relief from the existing halting policy of the late temporary commander during the first week of his authority he called his general officers to meet him on the nine miles road for a general talk this novelty was not reassuring as experience had told that secrecy in war was an essential element of success that public discussion and secrecy were incompatible as he disclosed nothing those of serious thought became hopeful and followed his wise example the brigadiers talked freely but only of the parts of the line occupied by their brigades and the meeting finally took a playful turn general toombss brigade was before some formidable works under construction by general franklin he suggested an elevation a few hundred yards in his rear as a better defensive line and more comfortable position for his men a very good military point this seemed strange in general toombs however as he was known to have frequent talks with his troops complaining of west point men holding the army from battle digging and throwing up lines of sand instead of showing lines of battle where all could have fair fight referring to his suggestion to retire and construct a new line general d h hill who behind the austere presence of a majorgeneral had a fund of dry humor said general whiting who was apprehensive of ****** and parallels complained of sickness in his command and asked a change of position from the unfair fair oaks though of brilliant highly cultivated mind the dark side of the picture was always more imposing with him several of the majorgenerals failed to join us till the conference was about to disperse all rode back to their camps little wiser than when they went except that they found general lees object was to learn of the temper of those of his officers whom he did not know and of the condition and tone among their troops he ordered his engineers over the line occupied by the army to ********* its defensive construction and to put working parties on all points needing reinforcing whitings division was broken up three of the brigades were ordered to a p hills division he was permitted to choose two brigades that were to constitute his own command besides his own he selected hoods brigade with these two he was ordered by way of lynchburg to report to general jackson in the valley district general lee was seen almost daily riding over his lines making suggestions to working parties and encouraging their efforts to put ********* between their persons and the enemys batteries and they were beginning to appreciate the value of such adjuncts above all they soon began to look eagerly for his daily rides his pleasing yet commanding presence and the energy he displayed in ******** their labors the day after the conference on the nine miles road availing myself of general lees invitation to free interchange of ideas i rode over to his headquarters and renewed my suggestion of a move against general mcclellans right flank which rested behind beaver dam creek the strength of the position was explained and mention made that in consequence of that strong ground a move somewhat similar ordered by general johnston for the 28th of may was abandoned at the same time he was assured that a march of an hour could turn the head of the creek and dislodge the force behind it he received me pleasantly and gave a patient hearing to the suggestions without indicating approval or disapproval a few days after he wrote general jackson the brigades under generals lawton and whiting were transported as above ordered as indicated in his letter to general jackson general lees plan was a simultaneous attack on general mcclellans army front and rear following his instructions for general jackson on the same day he ordered his cavalry under general stuart upon a forced reconnoissance around general mcclellans army to learn if the ground behind his army was open these plans and the promptness with which they were conceived and put in operation ought to be a sufficient refutation of the silly report that the confederacy had any idea of withdrawing from their ******** report which notwithstanding its unreasonable nature was given a degree of credence in some quarters upon nearing richmond after leaving yorktown general johnstons first thought had been to stand on the ********** between the pamunkey and the chickahominy rivers on the flank of mcclellans march for richmond and force him into battle he selected ground with that view and posted his army where it remained some eight days giving general and engineer officers opportunity to ride over and learn the topographical features of the surroundings a prominent point was beaver dam creek which was so noted by the officers when johnston proposed to recross the chickahominy and make battle on the 28th of may in anticipation of mcdowells approach the strong ground at beaver dam creek again came under discussion and was common talk between the generals so that the position and its approaches became a familiar subject then stuarts famous ride had *********** relation to the same and drew us to careful study of the grounds for the execution of his orders general stuart took twelve hundred cavalry and a section of stuarts horse artillery the command was composed of parts of the first fourth and ninth virginia cavalry the fourth having no field officer on duty with it was distributed for the expedition between the first colonel fitzhugh lee and the ninth colonel w h f lee commanding also two squadrons of the jeff davis legion lieutenantcolonel w t martin commanding the section of artillery was under first lieutenant james breathed on the night of the 12th of june he gathered his squadrons beyond the chickahominy and the next day marched by the road west of the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad towards louisa courthouse to produce the impression should the march be discovered that he was going to join general jackson after a march of fifteen miles he bivouacked in the pine forests of hanover near the south anna bridge without light or sound of bugle and throwing aside the cares of the day and thoughts of the morrow sunk to repose such as the soldier knows how to enjoy an hour before daylight he was up in readiness to move as soon as the first light of morning revealed the line of march up to that moment no one of the expedition except the commander knew the direction or the purpose of the march he called his principal officers about him and told of the object of the ride and impressed the necessity for secrecy prompt and intelligent attention to orders at the mute signal the twelve hundred men swung into their saddles and took the road leading to the right and rear of mcclellans army at hanover courthouse a small force of the enemys cavalry was discovered but they retired towards their camp out of the line of stuarts ride at ****** shop a picket was driven off and several vedettes captured they proved to be of the fifth united states cavalry general lees old regiment between ****** shop and old church the ************ well to the front reported the presence of the enemy apparently in some force the column pressed forward expecting a fierce encounter of southern volunteers with united states regulars but the latter was a single troop and retreated beyond ********** creek to old church where there was a camp of four companies of the fifth cavalry under captain royal which made a brave stand captain ****** led the first squadron and captain royal received the first shock and furiously the combat went on both leaders falling ****** dead and royal severely wounded the enemy fled and scattered through the woods a number of prisoners were taken including several officers and there were captured horses arms equipments and four ******* in the enemys camp near old church several officers and privates were captured a number of horses and arms taken and the stores and tents were burned here it became a question whether to attempt to return by way of hanover courthouse or to press on and try to make a circuit around the entire army and take the chance of fording or swimming the chickahominy beyond the enemys extreme left stuart decided that the bolder ride was the ************ of prudence arriving opposite ******** on the *********** of the enemys supply ********* squadron was sent out and burned two transports with army stores and a number of wagons near ********* station a wagontrain was discovered guarded by five companies of cavalry which manifested a determination to stand and defend it but they abandoned it and rode away leaving the train in possession of stuart who burned it and night coming on the country was brilliantly lighted up by its flames after resting a few hours at ************ the ride was resumed and the party reached the chickahominy at ****** bridge at daylight the stream was not fordable but by exercise of great energy and industry a rude ********** was laid that part of the command near it dismounted and walked over swimming their horses in a few hours the bridge was made strong and the artillery and other mounts were passed safely over to the richmond side and resumed the march for their old *********** this was one of the most graceful and daring rides known to military history and revealed valuable facts concerning the situation of the union forces their operations communications etc when congratulated upon his success general stuart replied with a lurking twinkle in his eye that he had left a general behind him asked as to the identity of the unfortunate person he said with his joyful laugh general consternation the day after stuarts return i rode over to general lees headquarters and suggested that general jackson be withdrawn from the valley to take position on our left to march against mcclellans right and was informed that the order for jackson was sent when whitings division was detached and sent to join him then it was that general lee revealed the plan indicated in his instructions of the 11th for general jackson to march down and attack mcclellans rear while he made a simultaneous attack upon his front the suggestion was offered that the enemy had probably destroyed the bridges and ******* on the pamunkey along the line of his rear which might leave jackson in perilous condition if the front attack should be delayed that that attack must be hazardous as the enemy was in ************* positions with four army corps after deliberation he changed the plan and accepted the suggestion in favor of combining his fighting columns on the north side of the chickahominy in echelon march against mcclellans right flank leaving troops in the trenches in front of mcclellan to defend in case of a move towards richmond at the first mention of this march before this conference a change of base was spoken of by general d h hill but with our troops to be left in the trenches so near the flank of such a move and our columns afield pressing close upon its rear it was thought impracticable general d h hill in view of the possibility preferred that our attack should be made against the enemys left by crossing white oak swamp below the enemys left jackson was called in advance of his command to meet the hills and myself at general lees headquarters for conference on the execution on the forenoon of the 23d of june we were advised of his approach and called to headquarters to meet him he was there before us having ridden fifty miles by ***** of horses since midnight we were together in a few minutes after his arrival in general lees private office the general explained the plan briefly jackson to march from ashland by heights between the chickahominy and pamunkey turning and dislodging the federal right thus clearing the way for the march of troops to move on his right a p hill to cross the upper chickahominy and march for mechanicsville in echelon to jackson the mechanicsville bridge being clear d h hills division and mine to cross the former to reinforce jacksons column the latter to file to the right and march down the river in right echelon to a p hills direct march through mechanicsville to gainess mill general lee then excused himself to attend to office business asking that we talk the matter over for our better comprehension turning to jackson i said he promptly responded i expressed doubt of his meeting that hour and suggested that it would be better to take a little more time as the movements of our columns could be readily adjusted to those of his he then appointed the morning of the 26th upon his return report was made general lee that the officers understood and would be prepared to execute the plans that general jackson had appointed the morning of the 26th when he would lead the march verbal instructions were given followed by written orders embodying in minute detail the plan already given in general the topographical features of the ground about beaver dam creek have been given in a former chapter behind it battery epaulements had been skilfully laid and constructed as well as rifletrenches these were occupied by the troops of the fifth corps commanded by general fitzjohn porter mccalls division had joined the army of the potomac and was assigned as part of the fifth corps with the divisions of sykes and morell two of mccalls brigades j f reynoldss and ******** with ****************** artillery were especially charged with the defences the third brigade meades in reserve the other divisions in supporting distance mccalls advanced brigades had guards at the bridges as far as meadow bridge and a strong outpost at mechanicsville under orders to retire when the strength of the enemys advance was so developed as to warrant their doing so three batteries two of six guns each and one of four manned the epaulements at the opening of the fight before sunrise on the 26th of june the division of a p hill was in position at meadow bridge his brigade under general branch and johnsons battery seven miles above at brook turnpike bridge my division and that of d h hill on the heights overlooking the mechanicsville ********* awaiting the approach of the initial column not anticipating delay the divisions had no special cause to conceal their presence nor did the lay of the ground offer good cover morning came and noon passed a few minutes after ten am general branch received a note informing him that at the hour of its writing general jacksons column was crossing the central railroad he assembled his command crossed the chickahominy and marched down along the route designated for his column without sending information to the division commander of his march he reported at three oclock general a p hill hearing nothing from jackson or his brigade under branch decided to cross the river and make his move without reference to jackson or branch he crossed and moved down against mechanicsville attacked by fields brigade anderson and archer on fields left pender and gregg on his right and six field batteries four guns each the outpost was driven in and hill prepared and attacked against the front at beaver dam creek meanwhile the mechanicsville bridge had been cleared and after a little delay repairing breaks d h hills and longstreets divisions crossed a p hills battle soon became firm but he waited a little for jackson before giving it full force jackson came up marched by the fight without giving attention and went into camp at hundleys corner half a mile in rear of the enemys position of contention a p hill put his force in severe battle and was repulsed as d h hill approached he was called into the fray by the commanding general then by the president he sent ripleys brigade and five batteries which made the battle strong and hot along the line the most determined efforts were against the enemys right where general mccall reinforced by ***** battery and griffins and *********** brigades morells division edwardss battery and the third regiment of meades brigade beat off the repeated and formidable efforts of a p hill when he essayed a column against the crossing at ********* mill which mccall reinforced by the seventh regiment of meades ******** battery and before night the fourth michigan twelfth new york and ******* sharpshooters came in to reinforce the line and relieve regiments exhausted of ammunition the battle was in close conflict till nine oclock at night when hill was obliged to give over till morning the federal reinforcements were not all engaged and some that were suffered but little none very severely mccall replenished ammunition and prepared to renew the fight the next morning the federal loss in the engagement was ### aggregate no especial account of the confederate loss was made in separate report but it could not have been less than two thousand and may have reached three thousand general d h hill reported of his *********** georgia regiment the lieutenantcolonel ***** j b wounded and others *********** ### killed and wounded of his first north carolina regiment colonel ****** major skinner six captains and the adjutant killed and ### privates killed and wounded during the night general mcclellan ordered his troops withdrawn they retired at daylight on the 27th leaving a line of skirmishers to cover their march the skirmishers were not seriously molested the confederates being satisfied that the direct assault had failed and the flanking march ************* early in the morning d h hill was ordered to march to the left to turn the position and was on the federal right before their lines were well out of their trenches he came up with jackson and led the march of that column from hundleys corner a p hill marched by the direct route to gainess mill and longstreet in reserve moved by the route nearer the river and dr gainess house d h hill marched by ******** church to old cold harbor he understood the plan of campaign and promptly engaged the new position along the chickahominy heights on the enemys right where he found a ********** battery of ten guns near swamp lands commanding the only road of approach he ordered ********** battery into action but the combat was unequal the latter was forced to retire and general jackson ordered the division back to selected ground parallel to a road over which he supposed that the federals would presently retreat as my division was in reserve it could only be used in the last extremity so the driving could only be made by the division of a p hill while jackson with his own ewells d h hills and whitings divisions had more than half of our moving column organized as our leading battle force held in ambush for the enemy the enemy was found strongly posted upon high ground over the grapevine bridge forming a semicircle his flanks near the river a deep and steep chasm in front of his left divided the height upon which he stood from an open plateau over which he must be attacked if at all on his left the side slope leading up to that position was covered by open forest obstructed and defended by fallen trees on the crest were felled trees occasional ******** piles of rails and knapsacks behind these lines were the divisions of sykes and morell with bristling artillery for the first defence with mccalls division of infantry and a tremendous array of artillery in reserve further strength was given to the position by a stream which cut in between the two heights with deep ******* banks his right was covered to some extent by swamp lands and forest tangles almost as formidable as the approach towards his left general fitzjohn porter was the commander on the field a p hill came upon a detachment at gainess mill forced his way across the creek and followed to the enemys strong position where he promptly engaged about the time of d h hills withdrawal he found himself fighting not only strong numbers but against a very strong defensive ground as general d h hill withdrew general porter prepared to follow but the fierce assaults of a p hill told him that he must hold his concentration it was a little after two pm when a p hill put all of his force into action and pressed his battle with great zeal and courage but he was alone jackson finding the fire of the enemy steady and accumulating against a p hill ordered his troops forward into action d h hill engaged again at the swamp land and found that he must capture the battery firing across his advance with the aid of some of ****** brigade he succeeded in this temporarily but sykes doubled on him recovered it and put it again into action parts of ewell and lawton of jacksons came in on d h hills right meanwhile a p hill had fought to exhaustion and found himself obliged to put his troops down to hold his line the enemy putting in his reserves ******* his thinned ranks with artillery and infantry and fought a desperate and very gallant battle calling for troops from across the river my division came up near a p hills rear being the reserve and awaited orders about five oclock a messenger came from general lee asking a diversion by part of my troops against the enemys left to draw off troops from his right so as to let our left in through his weakening lines three brigades were sent to open fire and threaten their left from the forest edge with orders not to cross the open these brigades engaged steadily and parts of them essayed to pass the field in front as their blood grew hot but were recalled with orders repeated to engage steadily only threatening assault the army all the while engaged in efforts to find a point that could be forced finally a little before sunset general lee sent to me to say that all other efforts had failed and unless i could do something the day was lost picketts brigade and part of r h andersons had been drawn up under the crest in rear of a p hills right and kempers brigade was near also under cover upon the receipt of the last message pickett and anderson were ordered into action as assaulting columns and kemper called up just as the brigades advanced general whiting burst through the woods with his own and hoods brigades reported to me that he had lost sight of his commander general jackson in the forest and asked me to put him into battle he was ordered to form for assault and to follow on the left of picketts and andersons columns then in motion as the columns of direction as my troops reached the crest under which they had rested they came under the full blaze of the battle but pickett and anderson were comparatively fresh and dashed through the open and down the slope before the fire had time to thin their ranks the steep descent of the hither slope from its crest soon took them below the fire of the batteries and a p hills severe fight had so thinned the enemys infantry lines of men and ammunition that their fire grew weaker whitings brigade sore under its recent disastrous effort in the battle of seven pines drifted from my left towards the woodland but hood with his fourth texas regiment and eighteenth georgia ******** to the right behind that brigade and closed the interval towards andersons left leaving his other regiments the first and fifth texas on whitings left hood clambered over the deep ravine with his two regiments and maintained position with the assaulting columns while the balance of whitings division followed in close echelon as the advanced lines of pickett anderson and hood reached and crowned the stronghold of the enemy anderson and pickett moved up in pursuit of the broken lines and were almost in possession of their massed reserve ************ it under easy musketry ********* a dash of cavalry admonished them that their ranks while in order for following the infantry lines were not in proper form to receive a charge of cavalry they concentrated well enough to pour a repelling fire into the troopers but the delay had made time for the retreating infantry to open the field for the reserve batteries and night growing apace they returned to the line of their trophies and used the captured guns against their late owners general whiting asked for another brigade of jacksons that had reported to me and turned his forces against the enemys line on our left the divisions of ewell and d h hill advancing at the same time the general break seemed almost simultaneous and was claimed by all the messages from general lee were so marked by their prompt and successful execution that in reporting of the battle it occurred to me that they could be better noted in his report than in mine but he adopted the claim of a general and simultaneous break along the line a letter from general porter written since the war assures the writer that his guns had become so foul from steady protracted fire that his men had difficulty in ******* their cartridges to the *********** and that in some instances it could only be accomplished by putting the ******* against trees and hammering them down the position was too strong to leave room to doubt that it was only the thinning fire as the battle progressed that made it assailable besides the repulse of a p hills repeated desperate assaults forcibly testified to the fact it was nevertheless a splendid charge by peerless soldiers when the cavalry came upon us our lines were just thin enough for a splendid charge upon artillery but too thin to venture against a formidable cavalry five thousand prisoners were turned over to general lees provostguard a number of batteries and many thousand smallarms to the ordnance department by my command the confederate commanders except a p hill claimed credit for the first breach in general porters lines but the solid ranks of prisoners delivered to the general provostguard and the several batteries captured and turned in to the ordnance department show the breach to have been made by the columns of anderson pickett and hoods two regiments the troops of the gallant a p hill that did as much and effective fighting as any received little of the credit properly due them it was their long and steady fight that thinned the federal ranks and caused them to so foul their guns that they were out of order when the final struggle came early on the 28th my advance reaching the river found the bridges destroyed and the enemy concentrating on the other side under the impression that the enemy must reopen connection with his base on the pamunkey general lee sent stuarts cavalry and part of jacksons command ewells to interpose on that line they cut the line at despatch station where ewells division was halted stuart following down towards the depot on the pamunkey till he approached the white house cut off a large detachment of cavalry and horse artillery under general stoneman that retreated down the peninsula at night stuart rested his command finding supplies of forage and provisions abandoned by the enemy at the same time fires were seen along the line of supplies and houses in flames on the 29th he followed towards the depot still in flames on the 28th major meade and lieutenant johnsons engineers were sent from my headquarters to learn of the enemys operations or movements early on the 29th they made their way across the chickahominy into the grounds and works of the enemy just left vacant and sent the first account of the enemys move on his change of base the ************** of the day before told of speedy change of position in some direction but this was the first information we had from a reliable source their report was sent to general lee while planning and ordering pursuit he received a similar report from general magruder coupled with the statement that he was preparing to attack one of the enemys forts general jackson was ordered to follow on the enemys rear with his column including the division of d h hill crossing the river at grapevine bridge magruder to join pursuit along the direct line of retreat huger to strike at the enemys flank meanwhile ransoms brigade had joined hugers division my division was to cross with a p hills at new bridge march back near richmond across to and down the ********* road to interpose between the enemy and james river stuart was directed to operate against the enemys left or rear or front as best he could all the commands being in waiting marched at the first moment of their orders jackson was long delayed repairing grapevine bridge he probably knew that the river was fordable at that season but preferred to pass his men over ******* general d h hill of that column reported on the 28th the seventh and eighth georgia regiments were sent out a little before night to ascertain the probable movements of the enemy and encountered part of w f smiths division sixth corps meeting the fortyninth pennsylvania and *********** new york regiments colonel lamar and lieutenantcolonel towers and adjutant ****** of the eighth georgia regiment fell into the enemys hands and twentynine others of the seventh and eighth regiments were taken prisoners just as this affair was well begun a recall of the regiments was ordered hence the number of casualties about the same hour a cavalry affair at despatch station occurred which resulted to the credit of the confederates at night general mcclellan called his corps commanders to headquarters and announced his plan for change of base to the james river the fourth corps had been ordered to prepare the route of crossing at white oak swamp and pass over to defend it the fifth and slocums division of the sixth were to follow at night of the 28th the second third and smiths division of the sixth corps were to defend the crossing against pursuit the fourth continuing its move was to stand at turkey bridge defending the approach from richmond by the river road the fifth to stand at malvern hill with mccalls division across the long bridge road and slocums across the charles city road defending the avenues of approach from richmond on the 29th magruder in pursuit came upon sumners second corps at allens farm and after a spirited affair found sumner too strong for him after his success sumner retired to savage station where he joined franklin with his division under smith the third corps heintzelmans under misconception of orders or misleading of staffofficers followed the marching corps across the swamp leaving the second and smiths division of the sixth as the only defending forces at savage station magruder came upon them and again joined battle but his force was not equal to the occasion the commander of his left d r jones realizing the importance of action and the necessity for additional troops called upon general jackson to cooperate on his left but jackson reported that he had other important duties to perform the affair therefore against odds was too strong for magruder so that he was forced back without important results for the confederates the federals making safe passage of the crossing and gaining position to defend against pursuit in that quarter on the 29th general holmes marched down the james river road to new market with part of colonel daniels brigade and two batteries and general j g walkers brigade and two batteries and was there reinforced by part of general wises brigade and two batteries in cooperative position to my division and that of a p hill on the ********* and long bridge roads on his night march along the long bridge road fitzjohn porter got on the wrong end and rubbed up against my outpost but recognized his adversary in time to recover his route and avert a night collision he posted mccalls division in front of charles city crossroads his divisions under morell and sykes at malvern hill and warrens brigade near the fourth corps on the river routes from richmond as the divisions of the third corps arrived they were ************ between the charles city and long bridge roads on mccalls right hooker in front of the quaker road on mccalls left sedgwicks division sumners corps behind mccall before noon of the 30th jacksons column encountered franklin defending the principal crossing of white oak swamp by the divisions of richardson and w f smith and ******* brigade about the same time my command marched down the long bridge road and encountered the main force of mcclellans army posted at the charles city crossroads fraysers farm or glendale my division was deployed across the long bridge road in front of the divisions of mccall and kearny holding the division of a p hill at rest in the rear except the brigade under branch which was posted off to my right and rear to guard against hookers division standing behind the quaker road in threatening position on my right flank the ground along the front of mccall and kearny was a dark forest with occasional heavy tangles as was the ground in front of hooker the front of slocum along the charles city road was something similar but offering some better opportunities for artillery practice and infantry tactics as jackson and franklin engaged in artillery combat my division advanced under desultory fire of skirmishers to close position for battle awaiting nearer approach of jackson and signal of approach of our troops on the charles city road in the wait the ************* were more or less active and an occasional shot came from one of the federal batteries during the combat between jackson and franklin sedgwicks brigades under dana and ***** were sent back to reinforce at the crossing but upon the opening of the engagement at fraysers farm they were brought back on the doublequick after a time reports of cannon fire came from the direction of charles city road signalling as we supposed the approach of hugers column to this i ordered one of our batteries to return salutation the senior brigadier of the division r h anderson was assigned to immediate supervision of my front line leaving his brigade under colonel m jenkins while awaiting the nearer approach of jackson or the swelling volume of hugers

flank a p hill and myself standing in front very soon we were disturbed by a few shells tearing and screaming through the forests over our heads and presently one or two burst in our midst wounding a courier and killing and wounding several horses the little opening was speedily cleared of the distinguished group that graced its meagre soil and it was left to more humble active combatants near the battery from which the shots came was r h andersons brigade in which colonel jenkins had a battalion of practised sharpshooters i sent orders for jenkins to silence the battery under the impression that our wait was understood and that the sharpshooters would be pushed forward till they could pick off the gunners thus ******* us of that annoyance but the gallant jenkins only too anxious for a dash at a battery charged and captured it thus precipitating battle the troops right and left going in in the same spirit mccalls fire and the forest tangle thinned our ranks as the lines neared each other and the battle staggered both sides but after a formidable struggle the confederates won the ground and ******* gallant battery sedgwicks division reinforced the front and crowded back the confederate right while kearnys reinforced by slocum pushed severely against my left and then part of hookers division came against my right thus the aggressive battle became defensive but we held most of the ground gained from mccall in his official account general heintzelman said general mccall reported his account is ********* in the estimate of numbers and the two divisions hill was not put in until a later hour and encountered the troops of kearny and slocum hills orders were to hold the line gained until jackson and huger approached to warrant more aggressive battle magruders march had been directed to succor holmes in his official account general holmes wrote of parts of his cavalry and artillery whose conduct was shameful in the extreme he reported his casualties in his account of the fight general kearny wrote a p hills division was held at rest several hours after the battle was pitched branchs brigade on guard on my right retired and greggs on my left under our plan that huger was to assault the federal right and jackson the rear the battle joined hill was to be put in fresh to crown it as night approached without indications of attack from either of those columns hill was advanced to relieve the pressure against my worn troops at the first dash he again grasped and held ******* battery that had been the source of contention from the first onset fields brigade pushed on through the enemys line and supported by penders and branchs drove back reinforcements coming to their succor from one of sedgwicks brigades pushed caldwells off to kearnys position where with the additional aid of part of slocums division kearny succeeded in recovering his own ground and in putting caldwells brigade into part of mccalls original right leaving the confederates holding part of mccalls first line fields brigade some little distance in advance of it archer and branch on fields right made strong that part of it greggs brigade on the left made little progress beyond holding most of the ground taken by the first assault the battle thus braced held its full and swelling volume on both sides my right thinned by the heavy fighting and tangled forest found a way around the left of the contention then *********** towards its centre in this effort hookers division came against its right flank by change of front a clever fight was made but branchs brigade ordered for service at that point had been withdrawn by general hill to support his centre so that hooker pushed us off into closed ranks along our line in rear and back but his gallant onset was checked and failed of progress general hooker claimed that he threw longstreet over on kearny but general mccall said that by a little stretch of the ********* he could have said that he threw longstreet over the moon to establish his centre hill sent in j r andersons brigade ******* the long bridge road which held the battle till the near approach of night when mccall in his last desperate effort to reinforce and recover his lost ground was caught in the dark of twilight and invited to ride to my headquarters friends near him discovered his dilemma in time to avert their own capture and aggressive battle ceased the artillery combat with occasional exchanges of shots held till an hour after the beat of tattoo it was the fortyseventh virginia regiment that caught and invited general mccall to quarter with the confederates although his gallant division had been forced from the fight the brave head and heart of the general were not fallen till he found himself on his lonely ride he was more tenacious of his battle than any one who came within my experience during the war if i except d h hill at sharpsburg in years gone by i had known him in pleasant army service part of the time as a brevet lieutenant of his company when the name was announced and as he dismounted i approached to offer my hand and such amenities as were ********** under the circumstances but he drew up with haughty mien which forbade nearer approach so that the courtesies were concluded by the offer of staffofficers to escort him to the city of richmond it was during this affair that general holmess division advanced against the federals at turkey bridge with a sixgun field battery and engaged and was met by the fire of thirty field guns and the gunboat batteries which drove him to confusion abandoning two guns earlier in the day magruders column had been ordered by a long dtour to support the fight at fraysers farm but the trouble encountered by holmess division seemed serious and caused the confederate commander to divert magruders march to support that point through which a resolute advance might endanger our rear at fraysers farm after night magruder was called to relieve the troops on the front of my line his march during the day was delayed by his mistaken guide the confederates claimed as trophies of the battle ten pieces of artillery some prisoners and most of the field from which mccalls division had been dislodged holmess division lost two guns in the affair at turkey bridge but other confederates secured and afterwards made better use of them during this eventful day the federals were anxiously pushing their trains to cover on the river and before noon of july 1 all except those of ammunition necessary for immediate use had safely passed the field selected for their malvern hill battle at malvern hill hardly a league away from fraysers now left to silence save for the moans of the unfortunate fallen and standing south of the line to turkey bridge was fitzjohn porter with the reserve artillery massed supported by the divisions of sykes and morell on the left and couchs on the right from the crew house to j w ******** the field had been carefully selected and as judiciously guarded by ********** commands holding the only way left which gave hope of successful passage to cover under the gunboats during the night of the 30th of june and early morn of the 1st of july this position was reinforced by the retreating ************* by the second and third corps mccalls division of the fifth and w f smiths of the sixth and later by other troops among the trains moving for the river was one of ten siege guns under colonel tyler these were dropped in porters rear and put in battery giving them a sweep of the avenues of approach and extensive rake of the woodlands and a great number of lighter batteries bristled upon the brow and down the slopes of the hill on either flank the plateau was somewhat guarded by ravines and tangled marsh lands while the front approach was over ascending slopes so broken as to make advancing artillery combat slow and hazardous early on the 1st the columns under huger jackson and magruder met at the charles city crossroads but the enemy had given up that position and marched away leaving to them the abandoned forest land the disappointment of the confederate commander in the failure of combination ordered for the 30th was noted by those who were near him while the composure with which it was borne indicated the grander elements of his character and drew those who knew his plans and purposes closer to him jackson was ordered to follow on the direct line of the enemys retreat huger and magruder marched to cooperate on his right longstreets and a p hills divisions were held in reserve general lee rode near jacksons column to view the army on that front feeling unwell and much fatigued he called me to temporary service near him as he rode to the left he ordered me with the columns of huger and magruder to make reconnoissance of the enemys new position in that quarter and to report of the feasibility of aggressive battle i found some difference between general lees maps and general magruders guides but my authority was only for a reconnoissance and posting the divisions an elevated point was found off the enemys left front as high as the plateau upon which his army stood from which a fair view was had of his position and down along his front and the open as far as jacksons field the latter just filing in by his batteries on much lower but open ground profound silence rested upon the field jacksons batteries yet a little beyond the point of range marched to their places as quietly as if taking positions for review porters field seemed as little concerned at the developments along his flank and front indicating that there was to be no waste of ammunition on that july day his guns could not be counted but ******** them off by batteries there seemed to be eighty on his front besides the siege battery in rear his guns were all trailed to jacksons front thus presenting a flank towards the high point upon which i stood from the crest at this little ridge the ground dropped off sharply some eighteen inches or two feet to a lower terrace forming a natural parapet and ********** for forty or sixty guns massed the spacious open along jacksons front appeared to offer a field for play of a hundred or more guns and although his lower ground was not inviting of combat even by a hundred guns it was yet judged that advancing combat by eighty or a hundred guns in combination with the ******** battery of position might justify assault and the tremendous game at issue called for adventure i thought it probable that porters batteries under the crossfire of the confederates thus posted on his left and front could be thrown into disorder and thus make way for combined assaults of the infantry i so reported and general lee ordered disposition accordingly sending the pioneer corps out to cut a road for the right batteries of position i suggested position to magruder for his division but he insisted that the quaker road was not correctly located on general lees maps so i left that part of the order to be looked after by general lees recognized staff general chilton chief of staff was then sent by general lee to assist general magruder in posting the troops and i was ordered back to ****** the batteries but eight guns came in proper time and were posted these general magruder proposed to supplement by thirty of his own under colonel s d lee to be reinforced by the others as they came up with this understanding i returned to headquarters made my report and was permitted to go back to my command proper the most convenient point for observing the effect of the artillery fire was occupied by general armisteads brigade that officer was designated by general lee to give notice if the combat was successful by advancing his brigade under the shouts of infantry charge as the signal for general assault the eight guns for the right battery were all that got into position on time and jackson failed to open fire by advancing all of the batteries along his front so that the practice from those quarters was not forcibly executed when the eight guns finally opened porter shifted his aim from his proper front which jackson failed to combat and put in the fire of forty guns against the ******** battery of our right the gunboat batteries also came into that practice but it was found that they damaged friends almost as much as the enemy and were ordered to discontinue jacksons crossfire feeble at best and at long range was finally drawn off by other batteries far on the enemys right so that the eight guns were soon piled a heterogeneous mass of caissons guns limbers and horses some other batteries got into action at the same point eight or ten at a time but suffered like disaster so the plan for battle and order of the day were given over by the confederate commander who sent for me to ride with him over to his left in search of a route by which the enemys right might be turned this seemed feasible under the hasty reconnoissance and he ordered the reserves on that move as we started on the march the noise of battle reached us and the march was arrested under the impression that his officers realized the failure and abandonment of his original plan general lee failed to issue orders specifically recalling the appointed battle it seems that just as the troops marched to the left under the last order information was received by some of the officers at the front that the enemy was getting away from us to ascertain as to this matter and anxious to atone for lost opportunities of the day before part of the troops near our right moved forward and soon encountered the enemys infantry as well as the formidable artillery this impact burst into the noise of battle and was taken as the signal for assault under the original order of the day from the right to the left as far as and including d h hills division the confederates attacked in splendid style making repeated brave charges but they were as firmly met by the enemy and their dead and wounded were mingled on the same lines the confederate ranks thinning rapidly magruder called on me for reinforcements and jackson was sent to reinforce d h hills left but night closed in upon us before the reinforcements could get into action as the order for battle had been given about noon and had been abandoned some hours before the opening upon receiving magruders call i supposed the conflict had been brought on by the enemy to force our right back and better clear the route of his retreat i ordered a p hill direct to magruder and my own division for support on our extreme right the result of the battle was a repulse of the confederates along the entire line and the sacrifice of several thousand brave officers and men though some of our troops held ground nearer the enemy than at the onset of the battle during the night the enemy resumed his march for the river leaving his dead some of his wounded and exhibiting other marks of the precipitate character of his retreat stuarts cavalry had been recalled from north of the chickahominy on the 30th to join us on the south side and reached jacksons left tuesday night after the battle the morning of the 2d opened heavy and oppressive the storm front of bursting cannon and bristling bayonets was changed to a wide sweep of heavy clouds that covered the dead that had grappled and fallen together on malvern hill the enemy was gone and reached his lodgement at harrisons landing on james river the old seat of that family which has given our country two presidents jackson stood on the direct route of the enemys retreat and was ordered to follow it magruders and hugers commands to follow jackson general lee rode with them d h hills division was left to care for the wounded and dead of malvern hill to obviate pressure upon a single track the reserve divisions were ordered by ****** store but the heavy clouds soon began to let down a pelting rain that became more severe and delayed all movements the reports of jackson and stuart of the operations of the 3d are conflicting the former claimed that he was near the landing on the morning of the 3d and advanced his line of skirmishers the latter reported that he found during the night of the 2d a fine position on ********* heights from which the enemy could be shelled out of his new position by artillery that he occupied and held that position by a squadron and ******** until driven from it by the enemy at two oclock in the afternoon of the 3d that he reported of that position to generals lee and jackson during the night of the 2d other accounts go with that of stuart it seems that the foot cavalry and the reserve divisions met at the landing late in the afternoon of the 3d the troops from the valley district had not been engaged in the battles of the march except that of gainess mill at daylight of the 4th i rode to the front and ordered general jackson to drive in the enemys skirmishers and prepare to attack d r joness division of magruders command coming up was ordered on jacksons left a p hills on his right my own division to support jacksons direct move for ********* heights after pushing the skirmish line back jackson reported his troops not in condition for the work and asked delay until the commanding general was up as general lee was reported near attack was delayed and a note was sent asking him to ride forward as soon as convenient he rode up in about half an hour and after mature deliberation decided that the attack should not be made he reinforced his cavalry and horse artillery by a number of his choicest field batteries and ordered general stuart to use them against the enemys transports on the lower james this expedition did some damage but the superior batteries of the gunboats ******* of the transports enabled them to maintain safeconduct along the line of supplies and reinforcements on the 8th he withdrew his army to points more convenient to supplies and towards the open highway to washington city passing in critical review the events of the campaign they fail to ******** a flaw as it was projected by the confederate chief it even opened up grander possibilities than came within his most hopeful anticipations at the period of projection the union commander left his fifth corps engaged at beaver dam creek while jacksons column marched by it as far as hundleys corner and went into camp the object and instructions of jacksons advanced echelon were to have him file in against any force that he might pass and attack it in flank and rear if instead of going into camp at hundleys corner on the afternoon of the 26th of june he had filed to his right behind the fifth corps he would have had it surrounded by fifty thousand men beyond the reach of succor he was troubled by conflicting orders the general order for the campaign and verbal instructions were intended to supersede all others but general lees letter of the 11th was not recalled so he marched with the two orders in his pocket which made not a little trouble before jacksons army was called from the valley it was reinforced and organized for our working column on the morning of the 27th of june it was further augmented by the division under d h hill and stuarts cavalry his line of march during the day led him around porters position near gainess mill to the enemys right the most favorable point for attack he partially engaged by d h hills division then withdrew it and posted his troops in a position selected to catch the federals in their flight from a p hills division finally when porters defence developed too much strength for a p hill he deployed into line of battle from left to right ************* the enemys entire front on the morning of the 28th of june general lee thought to draw mcclellan out from his works force him to defend his base on the pamunkey and to so cripple him on his retreat as to warrant strong detachments from his army in the direction of washington and thus force him to defend his own capital before marching to the opening of the campaign he ordered a detachment of cavalry to the south side of white oak swamp under careful watch for the enemys movements by vedettes even as far as chickahominy river so that on the night of the 27th he had a cordon of troops and vedettes extending completely around mcclellans army notwithstanding precautions so carefully laid mcclellan started to march for his new base on the night of the 27th continued his preparations and movements through the day and night of the 28th and the first reliable information of the move towards james river came from major meade and lieutenant johnson engineers the information though coming from a source least looked for was more than gratifying to general lee for he thought the enemy had essayed a move not practicable that general mcclellans army was in his power and must be our prize never to reach the new base just as he was ******* out orders of pursuit a staffofficer of general magruders came from the other side of the river to report the federal army in retreat and that general magruder was preparing to assault the fort in his immediate front general lee said uniformly military but courteous in his bearing it was very rare that he became ********* when on parade service but anticipations that general mcclellan was soon to be his prisoner excused the giving way to impulse born of this unexpected adventure within an hour his troops on the east side were on the march for their crossings of the chickahominy he then rode across gave orders to general magruder rode with him some distance and repeated the orders before leaving him following up the rearguard general magruder came upon it in force at savage station the second corps and franklins division under w f smith of the sixth under general sumner were posted there to cover the retreat magruder planned battling with his own six brigades against their front two brigades of hugers division to come on the enemys left down the williamsburg road jacksons twelve or fifteen brigades to attack their right but when magruder thought his arrangements complete he received a message from general huger that his brigades would be withdrawn then other information not anticipated came to ****** that general jones commanding on magruders left called for cooperation in that quarter general jackson sent word in reply that he had other important duty to perform referring to jacksons orders of the 29th general lee wrote general magruder sumner besides his greater force having some advantage from the earthworks previously constructed repulsed magruders attack and the affair of ************* failed of effect if jackson could have joined against the right of sumner with his brigades the latter could have been dislodged the confederates passing the swamp with him which would have marked the beginning of the end the occasion was especially propitious for heintzelmans corps that had been designated as part of the rearguard with sumner and franklin through some misconception had marched over the swamp to camp near charles city crossroads leaving easy work for jackson and magruder when on the forenoon of the 30th jackson found his way across the swamp blocked by franklin he had time to march to the head of and across it to the charles city road in season for the engagement contemplated at fraysers farm the distance being about four miles general wright of hugers division marched his brigade from the head of the swamp to jacksons line at the bridge and returned making several halts and crossings to reconnoitre but little remains to be said of the engagements at fraysers farm and malvern hill the former was a halting failure of combination of forces the latter an accident resulting from the armies standing close abreast many hours malvern hill left out the two armies would have mingled their lines between that and westover during the 3d and 4th of july the failure of concert of action by the confederates should not ******** the conduct of mcclellans masterly retreat in the emergency he showed himself well equipped in the science of war and prepared to cross swords with his able adversary at the opening of the campaign he had in hand one hundred and five thousand men general lees returns were not accurately made but a fair estimate puts his numbers between eighty and eightyfive thousand the losses of the campaign were on the union side ##### on the confederate side greater in the absence of complete returns it is fair to say that they were from ##### to ##### up to the time of malvern hill the casualties were about equally divided between the two armies but in that battle the confederates lost not far from 5000 men and the federals not more than onethird that number upon reaching the gunboats general mcclellans power was about doubled although fire from the gunboats was not very effective against a land battle the moral effect of fighting batteries that could not be reached was most powerful it was reported on the confederate side that general mcclellan on boarding one of the boats where he spent most of the day of battle said there should be a gunboat in every family some critics say that mcclellan should have taken richmond during the campaign the great napoleon would have done so after the disaster at malvern hill with his regularly organized army of veterans they say too that lee should have captured mcclellan and his army so thought general lee but some of his leaders were working at ************* and did not have that close attention that the times called for we may now consider the probable result of the plan mapped out and ordered by general lee in his letter of june 11th to general jackson had it been ********** jackson to march down the right bank of the pamunkey with his troops from the valley district and attack mcclellans rear east of the chickahominy while lee attacked from the richmond side with his army on the richmond side mcclellan had four army corps well fortified supported by his powerful artillery the battle

attack on that side if it had been made as ordered the battle of malvern hill from an open field may tell the result of an attack upon the four corps in their fortified position had the attack been

23d of july general h w halleck assumed command of the federal armies as generalinchief by order of the president of july 11 the quiet of general mcclellans army at harrisons landing assured general lee of his opportunity for attention to the movements of the army under general pope working towards richmond by the orange and alexandria railway on the 13th of july he ordered general jackson with his own and ewells division to gordonsville to have a watch upon the federal force operating in that quarter promising reinforcements as soon as occasion should call for them stuart was at hanover courthouse in observation towards fredericksburg and robertsons cavalry was ordered to jackson to reinforce his cavalry under colonel munford to engage attention pending these movements general d h hill in command on the south side of the james was ordered to have all of his artillery on that side available put in battery on the banks of the river against mcclellans camps on the north side and his transports on the water general pope immediately displayed bold front as a diversion seeking to draw general lee away from mcclellan so general lee sent general a p hill with his division to reinforce jackson with orders to the latter to strike out for the enemy in his front the threatening attitude of the confederates at gordonsville caused apprehension at washington and induced the authorities to consider the withdrawal of mcclellans army to reinforce the army under pope upon receipt of an intimation to that effect general mcclellan ordered a strong force under general hooker to advance in threatening move against general lee on the 4th of august hooker marched on the 5th and occupied the ground of the battle of malvern hill general lee ordered the divisions of mclaws d r jones that under ripley d h hills and my own to march against hooker it was night when our troops were posted and before daylight of the next morning hooker had marched back to his camp at harrisons landing just here as a digression from following the operations of the armies of lee and pope it should be remarked that the latter by injudicious and *********** attitude assumed at the ******** of his campaign intensely incensed the people of virginia and the south generally the confederate army to a man and probably to a considerable degree discomfited the most considerate and thoughtful of his own officers and the authorities behind him the exigencies of war did not demand some of the harsh measures that he *************** for instance as his notorious general orders no 11 and several

demoralizing in influence and more likely to aggravate and prolong war spirit than to open ways of order and amity besides such orders indicate a flaw in the armor of the author general scott set an example worthy of eternal emulation in his march through mexico he was as strict in the requirement of order and protection for noncombatants as he could have been in marching through his own civil

orange courthouse under colonel w e jones who encountered at that point a formidable cavalry guard of the enemy when a spirited affair occurred creditable alike to both sides this was followed up on the 8th by the advance of jacksons entire force his own division under winder leading ewells and a p hills following general popes outpost at cedar run held by cavalry and crawfords brigade of infantry had meantime been reinforced by the balance of the second corps under banks and rickettss division put in supporting position of the advance post on the 9th jackson advanced and found the enemy in strong position at cedar run his division under ewell was posted on the northeast slope of slaughter mountain his own division under winder formed to the left the engagement was pitched and soon became severe while yet posting his troops winder was mortally struck by a fragment of shell banks gaining confidence in his battle moved forward to closer and severe fight and held it an hour at

to call to his aid the greater part of the army in west virginia under general cox after reaching gordonsville and learning something of the position of the armies and more of the features of the

was expressed to general lee he joined us on the 15th and the brigades including those under hood were advanced to position for a general march he thought it better to strike in between general popes left and the reinforcements that could join him from fredericksburg than to adopt the proposition to move his army by the upper fords of the rapidan and strike down upon the enemys right and decided

to camp on the plankroad opposite raccoon ford on the 17th general stuart rode on the cars to general lees headquarters received his orders and rode out on the plankroad to join his command under

was sacrificed to give them rest as if this were not sufficient misfortune captain fitzhugh general j e b stuarts adjutant was captured and as a crowning disaster the despatch of the confederate commander giving instructions for the march of his army as ordered for the 18th was lost the despatch was taken to general pope who thus advised by accident immediately set about retiring from culpeper to the east bank of the rappahannock general pope reported that thus on that day pope put his army in retreat by the several crossings of the rappahannock to its strong camps of the north side leaving his cavalry in observation as fitzhugh lees cavalry failed to get to position on my right on the 17th i ordered two regiments of infantry to be posted as guard on the road to raccoon ford

view of many points and the ********* as they opened their folds to the fitful breezes seemed to mark places of rest changing our glasses to the right and left and rear the white tops of army wagons were seen moving half an hours close watch revealed that the move was for the rappahannock river changing the field of view to the bivouacs they seemed serenely quiet under cover from the noonday august sun as we were there to learn from personal observation our vigilance was prolonged until the wagons rolled down the *********** of the rappahannock then turning again to view the bivouacs a stir was seen at all points little clouds of dust arose which marked the tramp of soldiers and these presently began to swell into dense columns along the rearward lines watching without comment till the clouds grew thinner and thinner as they approached the river and melted into the bright haze of the afternoon sun general lee finally put away his glasses and with a *********** breath expressive at once of disappointment and resignation said general we little thought that the enemy would turn his back upon us thus early in the campaign under the retrograde of the union army general lee so modified his order of march as to meet the new conditions on the 20th of august the march was made the right wing to the vicinity of kellys ford on the rappahannock river the left to the railroad bridge and fords above at kellys ford it seemed possible to force a crossing as we were preparing for it an order came reporting the upper crossings too well defended and calling for the right wing to march to that point while the left marched up in search of more favorable points as we were leaving kellys the enemy made a dash to cross and engaged some of the brigades in a sharp fight intending to delay our movements but the main column marched on while this affair was still in progress by mutual consent the fight subsided both parties joined their proper commands and proceeded on their upward march each on its own side of the stream at beverleys ford stuarts cavalry under rosser crossed and made a lodgement on the east bank but the near approach of the enemys column threatening before the infantry could get up in support made necessary the abandonment of the ground and the left wing continued to feel along higher up for a crossing passing up trimbles brigade was left at beverleys as guard to jacksons rear the enemy ********** an opportunity crossed at ******** ford and attacked trimble meanwhile a detachment had been called for from the right wing hood with his own and whitings brigade was ordered and was in time to join in trimbles fight which ended in repulse of the adventurous force the east banks of the rappahannock lifted quite above those occupied by the confederates giving advantageous position to the union artillery fire and offering no point above kellys ford to force a crossing when the left wing marched from rappahannock bridge the enemy crossed a considerable force to the west bank and covered it with a number of superior batteries well posted on the east side to dislodge that force i put a number of batteries into action including the washington artillery and later part of the reserved battalion under colonel s d lee the combat consumed much of the day of the 23d when the enemy withdrew from that bank and burned some of the dwellings as he left riding along the line of batteries during the combat we passed a ********** weeping over his brother who had just been killed just then a shell came screaming by exploded and

h hill mclaws the half division under j g walker and hamptons cavalry from richmond andersons division was marching from orange courthouse as our reserve force on the 22d munfords cavalry reported the warrenton road open as far as the vicinity of general popes headquarters general stuart was ordered over with parts of his brigades to investigate and make trouble in the enemys rear he crossed at waterloo and hunts mill with fifteen hundred troopers and pelhams horse artillery and rode to warrenton passing through he directed his ride towards catletts station to first burn the bridge over cedar creek before reaching catletts a severe storm burst upon him ******* the roads and flooding the streams behind him the heavy roads delayed his artillery so that it was after night when he approached catletts he caught a picketguard and got into a camp about general popes headquarters took a number of prisoners some camp property and meeting an old acquaintance and friend in a colored man who conducted him to general popes tents he found one of the generals uniform coats a hat a number of official despatches a large amount of united states currency much of the generals personal equipments and one of the members of his staff major ******** he made several attempts to fire the bridge near catletts but the heavy rains put out all fires that could be started when he sought axes to cut it away by this time the troops about the camps rallied and opened severe fire against him but with little damage the heavy rainfall admonished him to forego further operations and return to the army while yet there was a chance to cross cedar creek and the rappahannock before the tides came down on the night of the 23d he reached sulphur springs where he met general jacksons troops trying to make comfortable lodgement on the east bank passed over and resumed position outside general lees left the ************ of general pope gave information of his troops and his anxiety for reinforcements besides mention of those that had joined him but general stuarts especial pleasure and pride were manifested over the possession of the uniform coat and hat of general pope stuart rode along the line showing them and proclaiming that he was satisfied with the exchange that made even his loss at verdierville before the march but the despatch lost at verdierville was the tremendous blow that could not be overestimated all of the 23d was spent in severe artillery combat general jackson had gained the east bank at warrenton sulphur springs crossing and there seemed a fair prospect of making a permanent lodgement but the tides from the severe storm of the day and night previous were coming down in torrents threatening floods at all of the fords on the 22d pope had formed a plan of concentrating his forces to cross and attack lees right by the lower fords but the freshet had shut him off in that quarter so he turned to the detachment of jackson on the east side just cut off from support marching up the river bank jackson succeeded in so reinforcing his detachment as to defend it to an upper crossing till it found safe footing on the west bank the high water cut off all operations by direct moves on the 24th meanwhile general pope had received the divisions of kearny and reynolds from mcclellans army fortyfive hundred and twentyfive hundred respectively about this time a letter came to headquarters of the right wing from general toombs expressing regret at his unfortunate mistake in relieving his troops from picket service and asking to be released from arrest that he might have the opportunity to show in the approaching conflicts his deep interest in the cause the adjutantgeneral was instructed to say in reply that the chief of corps was pleased to know that the ************ was from want of experience not intentional breach of authority and that he would be more than welcome back by the general and the troops of his brigade on the 25th jackson was ordered to pull away from our main force with the left wing march by the crossings of the upper *********** through thoroughfare gap and strike the railway in the enemys rear at manassas junction his supply depot stuarts cavalry was ordered to follow during the night by a rapid march jackson crossed the fords of the upper streams and made his bivouac near salem forcing his march on the 26th he passed thoroughfare gap to gainesville where stuart joined him with all of his cavalry from gainesville he inclined to the right for bristoe station the cavalry holding the curtain between his column and popes a little after sunset he reached the orange and alexandria railroad a march of thirty miles approaching the station trains were heard on the rails general ewell divided his force and took two points on the rails so as to cut off the trains munfords cavalry assisted in the job two trains and a number of prisoners were taken the greater part of the detachment at the station making safe retreat his plans against general lees right cut off by the high water general pope extended his right under sigel banks and reno in search of jackson up the river who meanwhile had spirited himself away looking towards popes rear i was left on the river bank in front the reserve infantry r h andersons division and artillery near at hand although the night of the 26th was very dark and his troops were severely worn to be sure of his opportunity jackson sent a detachment to manassas junction seven miles the gallant trimble with five hundred of his men volunteered for the service and set out at once on the march stuart was afterwards ordered to join trimble with his cavalry and as ranking officer to command the operations of the entire force the infantry advanced and attacked the enemy as soon as it could be formed for work captured three hundred prisoners an ******** battery complete and immense quantities of army supplies feeling the main force of his adversary in his front awaiting opportunity general pope became anxious about his left and rear and was further hampered by instructions from the washington authorities to hold his fredericksburg connections and fight like the devil it may have been fortunate for the confederates that he was not instructed to fight like jackson on the 23d he was informed of strong reinforcements to reach him at warrenton junction on the next day and that larger forces would be shipped him on the 24th to join him on the 25th nevertheless he began to realize as he felt jacksons march to his right that he must abandon the line of the rappahannock and attend on the movements of that command gone astray by the mountains he concentrated the army of virginia to which reynoldss division had been assigned at and near warrenton under mcdowell reno east of warrenton about three miles on the turnpike porters fifth corps near ******* ordered to join reno and heintzelmans third corps ten thousand strong at warrenton junction the sixth franklins corps ten thousand strong army of the potomac was at alexandria awaiting transportation as were the divisions of sturgis ten thousand and cox seven *********** latter from west virginia general pope asked to have franklins corps march by the warrenton turnpike to join him and sent instructions to different parties to see that the guards in his rear were strengthened that at manassas junction by a division under assurances from washington of the prompt arrival of forces from that quarter he looked for the approach of franklin as far as gainesville marching by the warrenton turnpike and a division to reinforce the command at manassas junction so that when jackson cut in on his rear and captured the detachment at the junction he was not a little surprised he was in position for grand tactics however midway between the right and left wings of his adversarys forces that in his rear worn by severe marches and some fighting that in his front behind a river the crossings of which were difficult and the lines of march to bring the distant wings to cooperation over routes that could be defended by small commands communication with washington being severed the forces at and near alexandria were thrown in the dark to move by rail they were liable to run into the wrong camps and the rapid change by water to the new position left them short of land

regiment came in threatening attack and was driven off by colonel ******* regiment a field battery came from the direction of centreville and tried to make trouble at long range but was driven off by superior numbers then a brigade of infantry under general taylor of new jersey just landed from the cars from alexandria advanced and made a desperate effort to recover the lost position and equipage at manassas junction fields archers penders and thomass brigades moving towards the railroad bridge met taylors command and engaged it at the same time moving towards its rear threatening to cut off its retreat it was driven back after a fierce struggle general taylor commanding mortally wounded part of the kanawha division under general scammon was ordered to its support but was only in time to assist in its retreat reporting this affair general jackson said the spoils were then quietly divided such as could be consumed or hauled off and the balance given to the torch i marched from the rappahannock following on jacksons trail and camped at white plains the march during the day was delayed about an hour by a large force of cavalry which showed itself on my right front as i had no cavalry a little time was spent in learning of its import and following general pope ordered mcdowell with his own corps including reynoldss division and sigels corps to march so as to be at gainesville at nightfall renos corps and kearnys division of the third to ********* to support mcdowell he rode with hookers division of the third along the route by the railroad for bristoe station ordered porters fifth corps to remain at warrenton junction till relieved by bankss corps then to push on towards gainesville banks to follow by the railroad route in the afternoon hooker encountered ewell at bristoe station where the divisions engaged in a severe fight which was handsomely maintained till after night ewell under his orders withdrew to join jackson the conduct of the affair was about equally creditable to the commands after this affair general pope so far modified his order of the day as to call porter to him by direct route to march at one am and join him at daylight kearnys division was ordered for bristoe station renos corps for manassas junction and mcdowell from gainesville was ordered to swing around to his right and march guided by the manassas gap railroad to manassas junction ewell made his way along the railroad to jackson in time to refresh his men on the good things of the captures and for several hours of sleep fitzhugh lee with three regiments of cavalry was ordered on to fairfax courthouse and along the railroad towards alexandria to cut off rail connection general mcclellan reached alexandria virginia on the 27th on the 28th jackson was first to move at #### am he applied the torch to the stores of provisions and marched with his division under taliaferro by the new market sudley springs road across the warrenton turnpike and pitched bivouac on a line from near groveton towards sudley mills on the field of first manassas at daylight at one am a p hill marched from manassas junction crossed bull run and halted at centreville ewell followed at daylight towards centreville crossed bull run marched up some distance recrossed and joined jackson forming on taliaferros left after the morning fires of the bivouac burned out jacksons position could not be seen except upon near approach he was hid away under the cuts and *********** of an unfinished railroad the road upon which porter marched was crowded during the night so that he and his officers thought that they would make better time and be in better condition by marching at three am he reached bristoe at ten am kearny at eight and reno in due season but it was late in the morning when mcdowell was ready to march and later in the day when his left swung out on the march to the junction at twelve oclock general pope reached manassas junction misled by the movements of a p hill and ewell he ordered renos corps and kearnys and hookers divisions of the third to centreville in search of jackson while the latter was little more than a league from him resting quietly in his hidingplace and his detached divisions had doubled on their courses and were marching to join him mcdowell having information of my approach delayed his march ********* rickettss division to hold me in check at thoroughfare gap the first passage at arms of the day was between part of stuarts cavalry supported by b t johnsons infantry and meades brigade of mcdowells command as the latter swung around for his march to the junction the brigade approached jacksons right a detachment was pushed out against meade and some artillery practice followed the confederates retired but reported no loss under the impression that the force encountered was some cavalry rearguard or reconnoitring party mcdowell resumed his march as soon as the killed and wounded were cared for the noise made by this affair caused sigel to ************ his corps and otherwise delayed the march of mcdowells entire forces while it gave no inconvenience to the confederates further than a change of front of part of jacksons command to receive battle not intended by his adversary jackson changed his front but finding the direction of the enemy changed so as to march away from him he took the move for a general retreat made report of it to a p hill who was yet north of bull run and ordered him to intercept the retreat by manning the lower fords of bull run the order was received at ten am but general hill had intercepted despatches of general pope giving notice of his preparation for battle at manassas the next day and thought it better to march on and join jackson he filed into line on jacksons left about noon general jackson was right if general hill had moved as ordered he would have met detachments ordered by general pope to centreville and held them back to the south side until jackson could join him to hold the line the natural sequence of confederate operations was position to intercept general popes return to washington the scenes were shifting and inviting of adventure and the marches should have followed them general hill was justified by the circumstances that influenced his march when general pope reached the junction with heintzelmans and renos corps the game was on other fields as the last of the confederate columns had **** away towards centreville he ordered thither those corps and called up the fifth to join him he then changed the orders of mcdowells column directing it towards centreville to mass his cavalry and find jackson and presently at two pm so far modified these as to direct mcdowell to use his own judgment and give him the benefit of his views as he knew the country better but ordered that he should not go farther towards manassas junction these instructions were urgent with assurances that mcdowells moves should be supported by other columns had these been promptly executed mcdowells entire force should have encountered jackson before four oclock but mcdowell did not find jackson as his division under king marched along the turnpike a little before night jackson saw and engaged it in battle as we shall see the head of my column reached thoroughfare gap early in the afternoon reports from general jackson were that he was resting quietly on the flank of the enemy and between him and washington parties from the gap reported it clear and the confederate commander called a rest for the night but d r joness division was ordered on to occupy the gap as we approached it officers riding to the front returned reporting the enemy coming in heavy columns on the other side jones was ordered to halt his division till he could advance his skirmishers the ninth georgia regiment g t andersons brigade was sent and followed at proper distance by the division the skirmishers met the enemys pickets in the gap drove them off and followed till they in turn were met by a strong force and pushed back the enemys leading brigade reached the plateau running along the eastern side of the mountain which with his batteries and infantry gave him command at that end anderson reinforced his ninth by the first then by his other regiments on the mountainside to the left of the gap and advanced till arrested by the impenetrable tangle of the mountain undergrowth the gap is a pass cut through bull run mountain for the flow of a ********* through ******** creek to the waters of the potomac its mean width is eighty yards its faces of ******** rock rise in vertical ascent from one hundred to three hundred feet relieved hither and thither by wild ivy creeping through their ******** and from the tops of boulders in picturesque drapery it was in the midst of this bold and beautiful scenery in this narrow gorge where the indians had doubtless often contested ages ago that the seasoned soldiers of our civilized armies now battled for right of way finding his passage over the mountain by the left side of the gap blocked by the mountain tangle jones called up toombss brigade under command of colonel benning and ordered it over the mountain obstacle by the south side ******** brigade was held in rear by the time the troops were so disposed rickettss division was well deployed along the plateau on the east benning put major ******* with the twentieth georgia on the mountainside as skirmishers and strengthened it by another under colonel holmes in double time to gain the crest on that side the twentieth gained the crest while the federals were yet about eighty yards below on their side the georgians knew how to maintain their advantage and their fire arrested farther advance of the enemy when after a spirited fusillade reinforcements joined them in good season and extended the line and held it driving back the second assaulting force and following down the eastern slope as soon as the fire of the federal batteries opened hood was ordered with his two brigades to cross the mountain on the north side of the gap away by a *********** and three other brigades were despatched under general wilcox to hopewell pass about three miles north of thoroughfare gap advancing his men selected for their longrange rifles benning drove off a battery seeking position to play upon the mountain slope and eastern end of the gorge and moved forward under cover of a ravine until he gained a flank fire upon the enemys batteries this with the march of wilcox through hopewell pass and the crossing of one of hoods brigades gave the confederates commanding position and ricketts withdrew in time to escape disaster about six oclock mcdowell put his troops on the ************ sigels corps and reynoldss division back by the new market road for its crossing of the warrenton turnpike and kings division of his own corps down the turnpike a p hills and ewells divisions returning from the north of bull run hardly had time for rest when the march of kings division was reported about the same time the divisions that had been ordered by pope to centreville reached that point driving off some confederate cavalry loitering along the way as kings division was marching by jackson thought to come out from his ************ to learn the meaning of the march the direction of the move again impressed him that pope was retreating and that his escape to the north side of bull run would put his army in a position of safety before general lee could join him it was late the sun had set but jackson was moved to prompt action as the only means of arresting and holding pope for general lees arrival he was in plain view of the white smoke of the rifles of my infantry as they climbed over bull run mountain seven miles away and in hearing of our artillery as the boom of the big guns resounding along the ********* cliffs gathered volume to offer salutations and greetings for the union of comrades and commands he changed the front of his right division and noting the movement of sigels troops along the new market road called out ewell with his brigades under lawton and trimble and in addition to the artillery of these commands used the horse artillery under pelham as formed this new line was broadside against the turnpike his left a little way from groveton the ground upon which the action occurred had been passed an hour before by the division commander general hatch who saw no indication of the presence of a foe as the division marched the column was made up of the brigades of hatch gibbon doubleday and patrick the action fell against the brigade commanded by general gibbon who taking it for a cavalry annoyance to cover retreat opened against it and essayed aggressive fight till he found himself engaged against a formidable force of infantry and artillery he was assisted by part of doubledays brigade and asked for other assistance which failed to reach him till night came and ended the contest his fight was desperate and courageous against odds but he held it and his line till dark his loss was seven hundred and fiftyone including colonel ******* and major may mortally wounded with many other officers with lighter hurts general doubleday joined the fight with his brigade and reported his loss nearly half of the troops engaged general gibbon called it a surprise and well he might after his division commander had just passed over the route and failed to find any indication of the lurking foe general jackson reported the conflict here was firm and sanguinary he fails to give his number lost but ************ his severe loss in the division commanders general ewell losing a leg and taliaferro severely wounded during the night the federal commander reported to his subordinates that mcdowell had intercepted the retreat of jackson and ordered concentration of the army against him whereas it was of course jackson who had intercepted mcdowells march he seems to have been under the impression that he was about to capture jackson and inclined to lead his subordinates to the same opinion of the time major edward *** reported after night gibbon held his front by a line of skirmishers and withdrew his command to a place of rest at one am the division was withdrawn and marched back to manassas ricketts finding himself in isolated position at gainesville left at daylight and marched to bristoe jackson moved his forces at daylight and reestablished his line behind the unfinished railroad his own division under general stark ewells under general lawton with a p hill on his left general popes orders for the night directed the march of kearnys division from centreville by the turnpike at one am to reinforce the troops against jackson the other division of heintzelmans corps hookers to march by the same route at daylight and to be followed by the corps under reno these orders were urgent and directed that the commands should move promptly leaving fragments behind if all could not be got together in time kearny to attack at daylight to be supported by hooker mcdowells operations of the afternoon left sigels corps and reynoldss division in the vicinity of the field of kings fight general popes orders were given under the impression that kings division was still occupying the ground of the late conflict and that rickettss division was not far away but these divisions had been removed to points before mentioned though special instructions had been sent mcdowell and king to hold the position at all hazards to prevent the retreat of jackson with assurances that at daylight in the morning the entire force from centreville and manassas junction should be up and in prompt cooperation but mcdowell had probably learned that jackson had no thought of retreating and king had found that his ground was not ******* the order intended for king failed to reach him before he was advised of the withdrawal of kings division general pope sent orders to general porter directing movements for the 29th informing him of the orders of kearny and hooker and directing porter to move at daylight towards centreville for position in cooperation of the projected battle and ordering reno to march for the battle by the warrenton turnpike under the orders porter marched towards centreville and reno towards the field for battle kearny deferred his march till daylight and was followed by hookers division at convenient marching distance renos column followed the march of the latter as soon as advised of the withdrawal of kings division from the ground of the 28th general pope sent as substitutes for his orders of the early morning that general porter should push forward with his corps and kings division of mcdowells command to gainesville to cooperate with his movements along the warrenton turnpike this order was received by porter at ### am but general mcdowell joined this column and as ranking officer objected to the transfer of his division under king to other authority which brought out the joint order to mcdowell and porter to have their joint commands execute the move towards gainesville general pope at daylight sent orders to general sigels corps with reynoldss division to attack as soon as it was light enough to see and bring the enemy to a stand if possible at the same time orders were sent heintzelman and reno for their corps to hurry along the turnpike and join on the right of sigel the batteries opened in an irregular combat on the left centre and right a little after eight oclock and drew from jackson a monotonous but resolute response and thus early upon the 29th of august was begun the second battle upon this classic and fateful field i marched at daylight and filed to the left at gainesville at nine oclock as the head of the column approached gainesville the fire of artillery became more lively and its volume swelled to proportions indicating near approach to battle the men involuntarily quickened step filed down the turnpike and in twenty minutes came upon the battle as it began to press upon jacksons right their left battery partially turning his right his battle as before stated stood upon its original line of the unfinished railroad as my columns approached the batteries of the leading brigades were thrown forward to ground of superior sweep this display and the deploy of the infantry were so threatening to the enemys left batteries that he thought prudent to change the front of that end of his line more to his left and rear hoods two brigades were deployed across the turnpike at right angles supported by the brigade under evans a battery advanced on their right to good position and put in some clever work which caused the enemy to rectify all that end of his line kemper deployed two of his brigades supported by the third on the right of hood the three brigades under wilcox were posted in rear of hood and evans and in close supporting distance on hoods left and near jacksons right was open field of commanding position this was selected by colonel walton of the washington artillery for his battalion and he brought it bounding into position as soon as called the division under d r jones was deployed in the order of the others but was broken off to the rear across the manassas gap railroad to guard against forces of the enemy reported in the direction of manassas junction and bristoe as formed my line made an obtuse angle forward of jacksons till it approached manassas gap railroad where d r joness division was broken in echelon to the rear at twelve oclock we were formed for battle about eleven oclock hookers division filed to the right from the turnpike to reinforce the federal right under kearny who with sigels corps and reynoldss division were engaged in a desultory affair against jacksons left chiefly of artillery r h andersons division marched at daylight along the warrenton turnpike for gainesville when i reported my troops in order for battle general lee was inclined to engage as soon as practicable but did not order all troops that he could hope to have were up except r h andersons division which was near enough to come in when the battle was in progress i asked him to be allowed to make a reconnoissance of the enemys ground and along his left after an hours work mounted and afoot under the august sun i returned and reported ********* as to attack especially in view of the easy approach of the troops reported at manassas against my right in the event of severe contention we knew of rickettss division in that quarter and of a considerable force at manassas junction which indicated one corps at two oclock kearny made an earnest opening against jacksons left but no information of battle reached us on the right he made severe battle by his division and with some success but was checked by jacksons movements to meet him general stevens supported his battle but his numbers were not equal to the occasion general sigel joined in the affair and part of general hookers division making a gallant fight but little progress general ******* brigade made a gallant charge but a single brigade was a trifle and it met with only partial success and was obliged to retire with heavy loss of killed and *********** hundred and ********** at one time the enemy broke through the line cutting off the extreme left brigade and gained position on the railroad cut but jackson and a p hill reinforced against that attack and were in time to push it back and recover the lost ground their attacks were too much in detail to hold even the ground gained but they held firmly to the battle and their line until after night when they withdrew to await orders for the next day though this fight opened at two oclock and was fiercely contested till near night no account of it came from headquarters to my command nor did general jackson think to send word of it general lee not entirely satisfied with the report of my reconnoissance was thinking of sending some of the engineers for more critical survey of his right front when his chief of cavalry sent to inform him of the approach of a formidable column of infantry and artillery threatening his right wilcoxs division was changed to supporting position of our right under jones and i rode to look at this new force its strength and the ground of its approach it was the column of mcdowells and porters corps marching under the joint order porters corps in advance deployed morells division and ordered ************ brigade preceded by a regiment of skirmishers to advance on their right sykess division to support morell as this was in process of execution mcdowell whose corps was in rear rode to the front and objected to the plan and attack so far from the main force a few shots were exchanged when all became quiet again we saw nothing of mcdowells corps and our cavalry had not been able to get far enough towards their rear to know of its presence or force he afterwards drew off from porters column and marched by the sudley springs road to join the main force on the turnpike i rode back and reported to general lee that the column was hardly strong enough to mean aggressive work from that quarter and at the same time reported a dust along the new market road which seemed to indicate movement of other troops from manassas general stuart rode up making similar report and asked for orders as our chief was not ready with his orders at the moment stuart was asked to wait the latter threw himself on the grass put a large stone under his head asked the general to have him called when his orders were ready for him and went sound asleep our chief now returned to his first plan of attack by his right down the turnpike though more than anxious to meet his wishes and anticipating his orders i suggested as the day was far spent that a reconnoissance in force be made at nightfall to the immediate front of the enemy and if an opening was found for an entering wedge that we have all things in readiness at daylight for a good days work after a moments hesitation he assented and orders were given for the advance at early twilight this gave general stuart half an hour ****** when called he sprang to his feet received his orders swung into his saddle and at a **** singing if you want to have a good time jine the cavalry his *********** ****** on the jump behind him rode to his troopers wilcox was recalled and ordered to march in support of hood and evans when they advanced on the reconnoissance it so happened that our advance had been anticipated by an order to move from the enemys side against us they attacked along the turnpike by kings division about sunset to the confederates who had been searching for an opportunity during the greater part of the day and were about to march through the approaching darkness to find it this was an agreeable surprise relieved of that irksome toil and ready for work they jumped at the presence to welcome in ************* the enemys coming a fierce struggle of thirty minutes gave them advantage which they followed through the dark to the base of the high ground held by bayonets and batteries innumerable as compared with their limited ranks their task accomplished they were halted at nine oclock to await the morrow one cannon a number of flags and a few prisoners were taken generals wilcox and hood were ordered to carefully examine the position of the enemy and report of the feasibility of attack at daylight they came to corps headquarters a little before twelve oclock and made separate reports both against attack with minute items of their conclusions hood was ordered to have the carriage of the captured gun cut up and left and both were ordered to withdraw their commands to their first positions meanwhile general pope had sent orders to general porter dated 430 pm to attack upon my right flank but the order was not received until it was too late for battle and the force was not strong enough and a fight at that hour might have been more unfortunate than the fights by detail on their right if it had been sent to general mcdowell before he left the two corps if he could have been induced to go in might have given serious trouble the field on their left was favorable for tactics but on porters front it was rough and r h andersons division was in striking distance of their left if that effort had been made anderson marched in the dark as far as hoods front before reporting for position and was ordered back to gainesville the 430 order was issued under the impression that my troops or the greater part of them were still at thoroughfare gap and general pope said in his official report after night porters column marched by its right to follow the route of mcdowell the morning of the 30th broke fair and for the federal commander bright with anticipations for the day he wired the washington authorities of success that the enemy was retreating to the mountains and told of his preparations for pursuit it seems that he took my reconnoissance for a fight and my withdrawal for retreat also interpreting reports from the right as very favorable he reported he construed the operations of the night of the 29th and the reports of the morning of the 30th as indications of retreat of the confederates prisoners captured during the night paroled and returning to him so reported on the morning of the 30th and his general officers had impressions of the confederate left that confirmed the other accounts and convinced him that we were in retreat the forces threatening our right the day before having marched around towards the turnpike d r joness division was advanced to position near kempers right colonel s d lees artillery battalion was advanced to relieve the washington artillery making our line complete in battle front about one oclock in the afternoon general pope ordered attack against jacksons front by the corps under general porter supported by kings division heintzelman and reno to move forward and attack jacksons left to turn it and strike down against the flank rickettss division in support of it but ricketts was recalled and put near the turnpike to support that part of porters field during the early part of this severe battle not a gun was fired by my troops except occasional shots from s d lees batteries of reserve artillery and less frequent shots from one or two of my other batteries developments appearing unfavorable for a general engagement general lee had settled upon a move by sudley springs to cross bull run during the night and try to again reach popes rear this time with his army about three pm i rode to the front to prepare to make a diversion a little before dark to cover the plan proposed for our night march as i rode batteries resting on the sides of the turnpike thought that battle was at hand and called their officers and men to stand to their guns and horses passing by and beyond my lines a message came from general jackson reporting his lines heavily pressed and asking to be reinforced riding forward a few rods to an open which gave a view of jacksons field i came in sight of porters battle piling up against jacksons right centre and left at the same time an order came from general lee for a division to be sent general jackson porters masses were in almost direct line from the point at which i stood and in enfilade fire it was evident that they could not stand fifteen minutes under the fire of batteries planted at that point while a division marching back and across the field to aid jackson could not reach him in an hour more time probably than he could stand under the heavy ******* then bearing down upon him boldness was prudence prompt work by the wing and batteries could relieve the battle reinforcements might not be in time so i called for my nearest batteries ready anticipating call they sprang to their places and drove at speed saw the opportunity before it could be pointed out and went into action the first fire was by ******** battery followed in rolling practice by ****** and reillys almost immediately the wounded began to drop off from porters ranks the number seemed to increase with every shot the masses began to waver swinging back and forth showing signs of discomfiture along the left and left centre in ten or fifteen minutes it crumbled into disorder and turned towards the rear although the batteries seemed to hasten the movements of the discomfited the fire was less effective upon broken ranks which gave them courage and they made brave efforts to rally but as the new lines formed they had to breast against jacksons standing line and make a new and favorable target for the batteries which again drove them to disruption and retreat not satisfied they made a third effort to rally and fight the battle through but by that time they had fallen back far enough to open the field to the fire of s d lees artillery battalion as the line began to take shape this fearful fire was added to that under which they had tried so ineffectually to fight the combination tore the line to pieces and as it broke the third time the charge was ordered the heavy fumes of gunpowder hanging about our ranks as stimulating as sparkling wine charged the atmosphere with the light and splendor of battle time was culminating under a flowing tide the noble horses took the spirit of the riders sitting lightly in their saddles as orders were given the staff their limbs already closed to the horses flanks pressed their spurs but the electric current ********** their speedy strides and twentyfive thousand braves moved in line as by a single impulse my old horse appreciating the importance of corps headquarters envious of the spread of his comrades as they measured the green yet anxious to maintain his rle moved up and down his limited space in lofty bounds resolved to cover in the air the space allotted his more fortunate comrades on the plain leaving the broken ranks for jackson our fight was made against the lines near my front as the plain along hoods front was more favorable for the tread of soldiers he was ordered as the column of direction to push for the plateau at the henry house in order to cut off retreat at the crossings by youngs branch wilcox was called to support and cover hoods left but he lost sight of two of his ******************** and ********* only gave the aid of his single brigade kemper and jones were pushed on with hoods right evans in hoods direct support the batteries were advanced as rapidly as fields were opened to them striblings j b richardsons ********* and ******* having fairest field for progress at the first sound of the charge general lee sent to ****** his call in favor of jackson asked me to push the battle ordered r h andersons division up and rode himself to join me in the fulness of the battle general toombs rode up on his irongray under sweat and spur his hat off and asked for his command he was told that a courier was about to start with an order for the division commander and would guide him he asked to be the bearer of the order received it and with the guide rode to find his post in the battle the meeting of the brigade and its commander was more than joyful jackson failed to pull up even on the left which gave opportunity for some of the enemys batteries to turn their fire across the right wing in enfilade as we advanced and the enemy strongly reinforced against us from troops drawn from jacksons front but we being on the jump the fire of the batteries was not effective it was severely threatening upon general lee however who would ride under it notwithstanding appeals to avoid it until i thought to ride through a ravine and thus throw a traverse between him and the fire he sent orders to jackson to advance and drive off or capture the batteries standing in his front and firing across our line but it was not in season to relieve us hoods aggressive force was well spent when his troops approached the ***** house but r h anderson was up and put in to reinforce and relieve his battle general pope drew rickettss division from his right to brace his left then renos command to aid in checking our march but its progress furiously resisted was steady though much delayed ****** brigade was also put against us this made time for porter to gather his forces his regulars of sykess division particularly made desperate resistance that could only be overcome by our overreaching lines threatening their rear when the last guns were fired the thickening twilight concealed the lines of friend and foe so that the danger of friend firing against friend became imminent the hill of the henry house was reached in good time but darkness coming on earlier because of thickening clouds hovering over us and a gentle fall of rain closely following the plateau was shut off from view and its ascent only found by groping through the darkening rainfall as long as the enemy held the plateau he covered the line of retreat by the turnpike and the bridge at youngs branch as he retired heavy darkness gave safeconduct to such of his columns as could find their way through the weird mists captain william h powell of the fourth regular infantry wrote of his experience at six oclock general pope received report of the sixth corps that had marched from alexandria under general franklin to the vicinity of centreville and ordered the several commands to concentrate about that hamlet during the night the second corps from the army of the potomac under general sumner also joined him at centreville but for the dropping off of two of wilcoxs brigades from close connection with the right wing and the deflection of ******** brigade which was taken off by some unauthorized and unknown person from my right to the support of cavalry it is possible that my working column could have gained the plateau of the henry house before it was dark or if jackson had been fresh enough to pull up even with us he could have retained the commands under reno and sykess regulars in his front which could have given us safe sweep to the plateau an hour before sundown and in sight of great possibilities by morning of the 31st everything off the turnpike was nasty and soggy stuarts cavalry followed by pryors brigade were ordered across the run at stone bridge as a diversion while we were trying another move to reach the enemys rear the confederates had worked all of the winter before fortifying this new position just taken by pope at centreville direct pursuit by the turnpike against these fortifications would therefore be fruitless general jackson was called to headquarters early in the morning upon receiving general lees orders to cross bull run at sudleys and march by little river turnpike to intercept the enemys march he said good and away he went without another word or even a smile though the suggestion of a smile always hung about his features it was commonly said that it never fully developed with a single exception during his military career though some claim there were other occasions on which it ripened and those very near him say that he always smiled at the mention of the names of the federal leaders whom he was accustomed to encounter over in the valley behind the blue ridge standing he was a graceful figure five feet ten inches in height with brown **** hair full beard and regular features at first glance his gentle expression repelled the idea of his severe piety the full beard concealing the lower features which had they been revealed would have marked the character of the man who claimed his first duty to god and his next to jackson and general lee mounted his figure was not so imposing as that of the bold dragoon charley may on black tom he had a habit of raising his right hand riding or sitting which some of his followers were wont to construe into invocation for divine aid but they do not claim to know whether the prayers were for the slain or for the success of other fields the fact is he received a shot in that hand at the first bull run which left the hand under partial paralysis and the circulation through it imperfect to relieve the pressure and assist the circulation he sometimes raised his arm i was ordered to look after the dead and those whose misfortune it was to be wounded till jackson could have time to stretch out on his new march then to follow him leaving the work to details and to general d h hills division just coming in from richmond after giving orders for the day general lee rode out towards centreville for personal observation halted and dismounted at a point which seemed safe from danger or observation suddenly alarm was given of the enemys cavalry the group dispersed in hot haste to have the heels of their animals under them the rush and confusion frightened the generals horse so that he pulled him violently to the ground severely ********* his right wrist besides breaking some of the bones of the hand on reaching his headquarters jackson ordered the assembly sounded mounted his horse and marched for the sudley springs crossing he cleared the way in time for my column to reach that point at

******* on the north side if jackson had been followed by an enemy whose march he wished to baffle his guncarriages could not have made deeper cuts through the mud and quicksand stuart was ordered over to the little river turnpike and advanced to the vicinity of ox hill and fairfax courthouse he made some interesting captures and reports of movements by the enemy he slept near their lines north of the turnpike east of chantilly the little river and warrenton ********* converge and join as they near fairfax courthouse at vulnerable points on the latter general pope posted parts of his command

their march jackson reached ox hill late in the afternoon and deployed by ********** p hills division on his right ewells under lawton next his own under stuart on his left on the right of the road on the left of the road were stuarts cavalry and the artillery two of hills brigades were thrown out to find the enemy and were soon met by his advance in search of jackson which made a furious attack driving back the confederate brigades in some disorder stevens appreciating the crisis as momentous thought it necessary to follow the opportunity by aggressive battle in order to hold jackson away

he wheeled his horse and put spurs preferring the danger of musketballs to humiliating surrender several ********** called but not heeded were followed by the ring of half a dozen muskets when he fell

been abandoned as both federal division commanders fell the accounts fail to do justice to their fight stevens in his short career gave evidence of courage judgment skill and genius not far below his illustrious antagonist during the fight stuart had parties out seeking information and early on the second had his troopers in the saddle in pursuit the army ready to move awaited reports of the cavalry which came from time to time as they followed on the line of retreat from fairfax courthouse came the report that the enemys rear had passed in rapid retreat quite out of reach approaching the fortifications of alexandria and washington city arms were ordered stacked and a good rest was given the troops stuarts cavalry pursued and engaged the retreating army in the afternoon the first corps started on the march via dranesville for leesburg and the potomac river followed on the third by the second the results to the confederates of the several engagements about manassas plains were seven thousand prisoners two thousand of the enemys wounded thirty pieces of artillery many thousand smallarms picked up from the field and many colors besides the captures made at manassas junction by general jackson the figures are given in round numbers as the safest approximate estimate but the records now accessible give accurate details of losses in each command about the same as these and so it came to pass that from cedar run and bull run we had the term all run it is due to the gallant sumner and his brave corps however to say that they so covered the last as to save disgraceful retreat a ******* review of the campaign ******* the pleasure ride of general fitzhugh lee by louisa courthouse as most ************ he lost the fruits of our summers work and lost the southern cause proud troy was laid in ashes his orders were to meet his commander on the afternoon of the 17th on the plankroad near raccoon ford and upon this appointment was based general lees order of march for the 18th if the march had been made as appointed general lee would have encountered the army of general pope upon weak ground from robertson river to near raccoon ford of the rapidan and thus our march would have been so ********* that we could have reached alexandria and washington before the landing of the first detachment of the army of the potomac at alexandria on the 24th the artillery and infantry were called to amend the *********** by severe marches and battles it would have been possible to make good the lost time but the despatch lost in the stuart escapade was handed to general

rappahannock river where he held us in check five days referring to the solid move proposed before opening the campaign by the upper rapidan to strike popes right it may be said that it was not so dependent upon the cavalry that was marching behind us that used by jackson in his battle of the 9th was enough for immediate use jackson could have passed the upper rapidan on the 16th and followed by the right wing in time to strike popes right on the 17th in solid ******* when time was ******** than *********** after losing eight days between orange courthouse and the rappahannock we found at

rappahannock when the command should have been at washington city the conduct of general popes army after his receipt of the captured despatch was good especially his plans and orders for the 27th and 28th the error was his failure to ride with his working columns on the 28th to look after and conduct their operations he left them in the hands of the officer who lost the first battle of manassas his orders of the 28th for general mcdowell to change direction and march for centreville were received at ### pm had they been promptly executed the commands kings division sigels corps and reynoldss division should have found jackson by four oclock as it was only the brigades of gibbon and doubleday were found passing by jacksons position after sunset when he advanced against them in battle he reported it sanguinary with the entire division of king and that of reynolds with sigels corps it is possible that popes campaign would have brought other important results on the 29th he was still away from the active part of his field and in consequence failed to have correct advice of the time of my arrival and quite ignored the column under r h anderson approaching on the warrenton turnpike on the 30th he was misled by reports of his officers and others to believe that the confederates were in retreat and planned his movements upon false premises jacksons march to bristoe and manassas junction was hazardous or seemed so but in view of his peculiar talent for such work the captured despatch of general pope giving information of his affairs and lees skill it seemed the only way open for progressive manuvre the strength of the move lay in the time it gave us to make issue before all of the army of the potomac could unite with the army under general pope his game of *********** about bull *** centreville and manassas plains was grand but marred in completeness by the failure of general a p hill to meet his orders for the afternoon of the 28th as a leader he was fine as a

receiving his anxious expressions really as appeals for reinforcement of his *********** wish but warm to brave the venture i related my mexican war experiences with worths division marching around

the union armies had made a splendid fight at second manassas the stand at ox hill was severe severe till the march of retreat so that the army of northern virginia should have held in profound respect its formidable adversary seasoned by many bloody fields the policy of the richmond government was defensive rather than aggressive warfare but the situation called for action and there was but one ************* the potomac general lee decided to follow his success in its natural leading and so reported to the richmond authorities he was not so well equipped as an army of invasion should be but the many friends in maryland and the fields on the north side of the potomac were more inviting than those of virginia so freely ******* he knew from events of the past that his army was equal to the service to which he thought to call it and ripe for the adventure that he could march into maryland and remain until the season for the enemys return into virginia for autumn or winter work had passed improve his transportation supplies and the clothing of his army and do that if not more for relief of our southern fields and limited means besides giving his army and cause a moral influence of great effect at home and abroad he decided to make his march by the most direct route from chantilly where he had last fought to the potomac and so crossed by the fords near leesburg marching by this route he thought to cut off a formidable force of union troops at winchester at martinsburg and a strong garrison occupying the fortified position at harpers ferry to ********* the situation we were obliged to go into maryland or retreat to points more convenient to supplies and the protection of richmond at leesburg lee learned that the union troops in the valley had left winchester and sent back orders to have the crippled and feeble soldiers wending their way to the army march through the valley to join us in maryland trains of supplies were ordered to move by the same route on the 5th and 6th the columns crossed the potomac by the fords near leesburg stuarts cavalry coming up from the line near alexandria and the long bridge passed to front and right flank of the army general mclawss division general j g walker with two brigades of his division and general hamptons cavalry brigade including colonel bakers north carolina regiment joined us on the march on the 7th our infantry and artillery commands came together near frederick city riding together before we reached frederick the sound of artillery fire came from the direction of point of rocks and harpers ferry from which general lee inferred that the enemy was concentrating his forces from the valley for defence at harpers ferry and proposed to me to organize forces to surround and capture the works and the garrison i thought it a venture not worth the game and suggested as we were in the enemys country and presence that he would be advised of any move that we made in a few hours after it was set on foot that the union army though beaten was not disorganized that we knew a number of their officers who could put it in order and march against us if they found us exposed and make serious trouble before the capture could be accomplished that our men were worn by very severe and protracted service and in need of repose that as long as we had them in hand we were masters of the situation but dispersed into many fragments our strength must be greatly reduced as the subject was not continued i supposed that it was a mere expression of passing thought until the day after we reached frederick upon going over to headquarters i found the front of the generals tent closed and tied upon inquiring of a member of the staff i was told that he was inside with general jackson as i had not been called i turned to go away when general lee recognizing my voice called me in the plan had been arranged jackson with his three divisions was to recross the potomac by the fords above harpers ferry march via martinsburg to bolivar heights mclawss division by cramptons gap to maryland heights j g walkers division to recross at cheeks ford and occupy loudoun heights these heights overlooking the positions of the garrison of harpers ferry d h hills division to march by the national road over south mountain at turners gap and halt at the western base to guard trains intercept fugitives from harpers ferry and support the cavalry if needed the cavalry to face the enemy and embarrass his movements i was to march over the mountain by turners gap to hagerstown as their minds were settled firmly upon the enterprise i offered no opposition further than to ask that the order be so modified as to allow me to send r h andersons division with mclaws and to halt my own column near the point designated for bivouac of general d h hills command these suggestions were accepted and the order so framed was issued it may be well to ******* from my narrative for a moment just here to remark that general lees confidence in the strength of his army the situation of affairs and the value of the moral effect upon the country north and south was made fully manifest by the nature of the campaign he had just entered upon especially that portion of it directed against harpers ferry which as events were soon to prove weakened the effectiveness of his army in the main issue which happened to be antietam in another and a very different way and with even greater ********* his high estimate of opportunity and ******** condition of circumstances existing at the time was indicated to the authorities though of course not at that time made public this was his deliberate and urgent advice to president davis to join him and be prepared to make a proposal for peace and independence from the head of a

division was on detached service at the time of the order trying to cut the canal he marched however at the appointed time found cheeks ford under the severe fire of the enemys batteries and marched on up the left bank as far as the point of rocks where he crossed and rested on the 11th on the 12th he marched to and bivouacked at ********* on the 13th to the foot of the blue ridge and occupied

************ plans the copy of the order that was lost was sent by general jackson to general d h hill under the impression that hills division was part of his command but the division had not been so assigned and that copy of the order was not delivered at hills headquarters but had been put to other use the order sent to general hill from general headquarters was carefully preserved when the federals marched into frederick just left by the confederates general sumners column went into camp about noon and it was then that the despatch was found by colonel silas ******** who took it to division headquarters whence it was quickly sent to the federal commander general mcclellan reported to general halleck that the lost order had been handed him in the evening but it is evident that he had it at the time of his noonday despatch to the president from his reference to the facts it exposed it is possible that it was at first suspected as a ruse de guerre and that a little time was necessary to convince mcclellan of its genuineness which may account for the difference between the hinted information in his despatch to general halleck and the confident statement made at noonday to the president some of the confederates were a little surprised that a matter of such magnitude was intrusted to ********* despatches the copy sent me was carefully read then used as some persons use a little cut of tobacco to be assured that others could not have the benefit of its contents it has been in evidence that the copy that was lost had been used as a wrapper for three fragrant confederate cigars in the interim between its importance when issued by the confederate chief and its greater importance when found by the federals general halleck thought the capital in imminent peril before he heard from mcclellan on the 13th as shown on that day by a despatch to general mcclellan but later the lost despatch having turned up at headquarters of general mcclellan that commander apprised the authorities of the true condition of affairs in the following with the knowledge afforded by securing lees lost order the passes of the south mountain became important points if he could force them mcclellan might fall on the divided columns of the confederates and reach harpers ferry in time to save its garrison but lee received intelligence of his only moderate forward movement and without knowing then how it came to be made recalled a force to make resistance and so ************* or ************* by his rapid moves the federal commanders ******** saved his campaign from the disastrous failure that threatened it general mcclellan claimed to have been more vigorous in pursuit after he received the lost despatch but events do not support the claim he had time after the despatch was handed him to march his army to the foot of south mountain before night but gave no orders except his letter to general franklin calling for vigorous action which was afterwards tempered by caution to wait for developments at turners pass he gave no intimation of the despatch to his cavalry leader who should have been the first to be advised of the points in his possession general pleasonton had pushed the confederate cavalry back into the mountains long before night of the 13th under his instructions of the 12th had he been informed of the points known by his chief in the afternoon he would have occupied south mountain at turners pass before any of the confederate infantry was there or apprised of his approach general mcclellans orders for the 14th were dated he wrote general franklin at ### pm giving the substance of information of the despatch but not mentioning when or how he came by it and ordered him to march for the mountain pass at cramptons gap to seize the pass if it was not strongly guarded and march for rohrersville to cut off the command under mclaws about maryland heights capture it and relieve the garrison at harpers ferry and return to cooperate in capturing the balance of the confederate army north of the potomac but in case the gap was occupied by a strong force to await operations against it until he heard the engagement of the army moving upon turners pass he wrote general franklin that general pleasonton had cleared the field east of the mountain of confederate cavalry after relieving harpers ferry franklin was to destroy bridges and guard against crossing of the confederates to the north side his idea being to cut the confederate army in two and capture or break it up in detail his appeal was urgent for the best work that a general could exercise the division under general couch was ordered to general franklin without waiting for all of its forces to join this is the only order of the records that indicates unusual action on the part of the union commander and general franklins evidence before the committee on the conduct of the war shows that his orders of the 13th were so modified on the 14th as to direct his wait for couchs division to join him and the division joined him after nightfall the divisions of the ninth corps reached middletown on the 13th under the orders of the 12th issued before the lost despatch was found one of them supporting pleasontons cavalry but rodmans under misconception of orders marched back towards frederick south mountain range standing between the armies courses across maryland northeast

into the turnpike at the summit or mountain house on the north side of the turnpike a road leads off to the right called the old hagerstown road which winds its course through a valley between a spur and the mountain and courses back to the turnpike along the top a more rugged route than this opens a way to the *********** by a route nearer the pike general pleasonton not advised of the lost despatch did not push for a careful reconnoissance on the 13th at the same time general stuart forced back into the mountains finding his cavalry ************* advised general d h hill of severe

colonel rosser with another cavalry detachment and stuarts horse artillery to occupy the passes by the old sharpsburg road colquitts brigade of infantry reported to him under his call after posting it near the east base of the mountain to hold the pass he rode to join his other cavalry detachments down at cramptons pass he only knew of two brigades of infantry pressing him back and so reported his cavalry ordered around the union right under general fitzhugh lee for information of the force in his front had failed to make report general hill ordered two brigades garlands and colquitts into the pass to report to stuart and drew his other three near the foot of the mountain garlands brigade filed to the right after ascending the mountain and halted near the turnpike colquitts brigade took its position across the turnpike and down towards the base of the mountain lanes batteries at the summit it seems that up to the night of the 13th most of the confederates were looking with confidence to the surrender at harpers ferry on the 13th to be promptly followed by a move farther west not thinking it possible that a great struggle at and along the range of south mountain was impending that even on the 14th our cavalry leader thought to continue his retrograde that day general hills attention was given more to his instructions to prevent the escape of fugitives from harpers ferry than to trouble along his front as the instructions covered more especially that duty while information from the cavalry gave no indication of serious trouble from the front a little after dark of the 13th general lee received through a scout information of the advance of the union forces to the foot of south mountain in solid ranks later information confirmed this report giving the estimated strength at ninety thousand general lee still held to the thought that he had ample time he sent for me and i found him over his map he told of the reports and asked my views i thought it too late to march on the 14th and properly man the pass at turners and expressed preference for concentrating d h hills and my own force behind the antietam at sharpsburg where we could get together in season to make a strong defensive fight and at the same time check mcclellans march towards harpers ferry in case he thought to relieve the beleaguered garrison by that route forcing him to first remove the obstacle on his flank he preferred to make the stand at turners pass and ordered the troops to march next morning ordering a brigade left at hagerstown to guard the trains no warning was sent mclaws to prepare to defend his rear either by the commanding general or by the chief of cavalry the hallucination that mcclellan was not capable of serious work seemed to pervade our army even to this moment of dreadful threatening after retiring to my couch reflecting upon affairs my mind was so disturbed that i could not rest as i studied the perils seemed to grow till at last i made a light and wrote to tell general lee of my troubled thoughts and appealed again for immediate concentration at sharpsburg to this no answer came but it relieved my mind and gave me some rest at daylight in the morning the column marched eight brigades with the artillery leaving toombss brigade a regiment of g t andersons that had been on guard all night was not relieved in time to join the march and remained with toombs the day was hot and the roads dry and beaten into ********** powder that rose in clouds of dust from under our feet as we marched before sunrise of the 14th general hill rode to the top of the mountain to view the front to which his brigade had been called the day before as he rode he received a message from general stuart informing him that he had sent his main cavalry force to cramptons pass and was then en route to join it he found garlands brigade at the summit near the mountain house on the right of the road and colquitts well advanced down the east side he withdrew the latter to the summit and posted two regiments on the north side of the pike behind stone walls the others on the south side under cover of a woodland upon learning of the approaches to his position he ordered the brigade under g b anderson and one of ripleys regiments up leaving rodess brigade and the balance of ripleys to watch for refugees from harpers ferry while he was withdrawing and posting colquitts brigade general pleasonton was marching by the road threefourths of a mile south feeling his way towards **** gap with the brigade of infantry under colonel scammon *********** with this advance pleasonton used his cavalry along the turnpike his batteries were put in action near the foot of the mountain except one section of ********* under lieutenant ***** which advanced with the infantry the battle was thus opened by general pleasonton and general cox without orders and without information of the lost despatch the latter had the foresight to support this move with his brigade under colonel crook batteries of twentypound parrott guns were posted near the foot of the mountain in fine position to open upon the confederates at the summit after posting colquitts brigade general hill rode off to his right to examine the approach to **** gap near the point held by rossers cavalry and horse artillery as he passed near the gap he heard noise of troops working their way towards him and soon artillery opened fire across the gap over his head he hurried back and sent garlands brigade with ********** battery to meet the approaching enemy garland made connection with rossers detachment and engaged in severe skirmish arresting the progress of ******** brigade till the coming of crooks when cox gave new force to his fight and after a severe contest in which garland fell the division advanced in a gallant charge which broke the ranks of the brigade discomfited by the loss of its gallant leader part of it breaking in confusion down the mountain the left withdrawing towards the turnpike g b andersons brigade was in time to check this success and hold for reinforcements ripleys brigade called up later came but passed to the right and beyond the fight general hill had posted two batteries on the summit north of the turnpike which had a destructive cross fire on cox as he made his fight and part of colquitts right regiments were put in in aid of g b andersons men about two pm general cox was reinforced by the division under general wilcox and a little after three oclock by sturgiss division the corps commander general reno taking command with his last division under rodman as sturgiss division came into the fight the head of my column reached the top of the pass where the brigades of g t anderson and drayton under general d r jones filed to the right to meet the battle and soon after general hood with two brigades the last reinforcement braced the confederate fight to a successful stand and held it till after night in hot contest in which many brave

wounded on the union side the officers had their time to organize and place their battle and showed skill in their work the confederates had to meet the battle as it was called after its opening on rossers detachment the lamented garland equal to any emergency was quick enough to get his fine brigade in and made excellent battle till his men discouraged by the loss of their chief were overcome by the gallant assault under cox general reno on the union side an officer of high character and attainments was killed about seven oclock pm among the union wounded was colonel rutherford b hayes afterwards president of the united states the pass by the lower trail old sharpsburg road was opened by this fight but the confederates standing so close upon it made it necessary that they should be dislodged before it could be utilized the first corps marched from the monocacy at daylight and approached the mountain at one pm general hooker had three divisions under generals hatch ricketts and meade general hatch had four brigades generals ricketts and meade three each with full artillery appointments at two oclock general hooker was ordered north of the turnpike to make a diversion in favor of the troops operating on the south side under general reno meades division was marched followed by ****** and *************** on the right hatch on meades left ricketts in reserve meades division was deployed along the foothills a cavalry regiment under colonel williams first massachusetts was sent to the far right in observation meades advance was followed by hatch and ricketts general hills only available force to meet this formidable move was his brigade under general rodes he ordered rodes to his left to a prominent position about a mile off which commanded that part of the field ****** battalion of artillery had been posted on the left of the turnpike to cover by its fire the route just assigned for hookers march the weight of the attack fell upon rodess brigade and was handsomely received evanss brigade fortunately came up and was sent to general hill who ordered it out to connect with rodess right before making close connection it became engaged and operated near rodess right connecting with his fight and dropping back as the troops on his left were gradually forced from point to point as the brigades under generals kemper garnett and colonel walker jenkinss brigade approached the mountain a report reached general headquarters that the enemy was forcing his way down the mountain by the old sharpsburg road to meet this general lee ordered those brigades to the right and they marched a mile and more down a rugged way along the base of the mountain before the report was found to be erroneous when the brigades were ordered back to make their way to the pike and to the top of the mountain in double time general rodes had five regiments one of which he left to partially cover the wide opening between his position and the turnpike in view of the great force approaching to attack him his fight seemed almost hopeless but he handled his troops with skill and delayed the enemy with the little help that finally came till night breaking from time to time as he was forced nearer our centre at the turnpike gibbons brigade had been called from hookers corps and was ordered up the mountain by the direct route as the corps engaged in its fight farther off on the right a spur of the mountain ****** towards the east opening a valley between it and the mountain through this valley and over the rising ground meades division advanced and made successful attack as he encountered the confederates coopers battery marched and assisted in the several attacks as they were pushed up the mountain slope the ground was very rough and the confederates worked hard to make it too rough but the divisions with their strong lines of skirmishers made progress rodes made an effort to turn the right of the advancing divisions but hooker put out a brigade from ****** division which pushed off the feeble effort and rodes lost his first position it was near night when the brigades under generals kemper and garnett and colonel walker returned from their march down the foot of the mountain and reached the top they were put in as they arrived to try to cover the right of rodes and evans and fill the intervening space to the turnpike as they marched the men dropped along the road as rapidly as if under severe skirmish so manifest was it that nature was exhausted that no one urged them to get up and try to keep their ranks as the brigades were led to places along the line the divisions of hatch and ricketts were advancing the former in range caught the brigades under fire before their lines were formed at the same time meades division was forcing rodes and evans from their positions back towards the turnpike general mcclellan claimed fifteen hundred prisoners taken by his troops and that our loss in killed and wounded was greater than his own which was fifteen hundred he estimated the forces as about equal thirty thousand each general d h hill does not admit that the confederates had more than nine thousand several efforts have been made to correctly report the numerical strength of my column some erroneously including the brigades detached with r h andersons and others the brigade of general toombs and the regiment of g t andersons brigade that were left at hagerstown general hill ******** reluctantly that four thousand of my men came to his support in detachments but does not know how to estimate the loss considering the severe forced march the five brigades that made direct ascent of the mountain were in good order the three that marched south of the turnpike along a narrow mountain trail part of the way through woodlands and over boulders returning then up the mountain the last march at double time were thinned to skeletons of three or four hundred men to a brigade when they reached the mountain house that they succeeded in covering enough of the position to conceal our retreat after night is sufficient ******** of their valorous spirit at first sight of the situation as i rode up the mountainside it became evident that we were not in time nor in sufficient force to secure our holding at turners gap and a note was sent general lee to prepare his mind for disappointment and give time for arrangements for retreat after nightfall general hill and i rode down to headquarters to make report general lee inquired of the prospects for continuing the fight i called upon general hill to demonstrate the situation positions and forces he explained that the enemy was in great force with commanding positions on both flanks which would give a crossfire for his batteries in good range on our front making the cramped position of the confederates at the mountain house untenable his explanation was too forcible to admit of further deliberation general lee ordered withdrawal of the commands to keedysville and on the march changed the order making sharpsburg the point of assembly general hills troops were first withdrawn and when under way the other brigades followed and were relieved by general fitzhugh lees cavalry on the mountain at three oclock in the morning hoods two brigades with g t andersons as rearguard general fitzhugh lees cavalry was ordered to cover our march but pleasonton pushed upon him so severely with part of the eighth illinois cavalry and ******** battery that he was forced off from our line through boonsborough and found his way to the potomac off the rear of general lees left leaving his killed and wounded and losing two pieces of artillery otherwise our march was not disturbed in addition to his regular complement of artillery general d h hill had the battalion under lieutenantcolonel a s cutts the batteries were assigned positions near the ridge under the crest where they could best cover the fields on the farther side of the stream a few minutes after our lines were manned information came of the capitulation of harpers ferry and of the withdrawal of the troops to the virginia side of the potomac general toombss brigade joined us early on the 15th and was posted over the burnside bridge he was subsequently ordered to detach two regiments as guard for trains near williamsport as long as the armies were linked to harpers ferry the heights in front of sharpsburg offered a formidable defensive line and in view of possible operations from harpers ferry through the river pass east of south mountain formed a beautiful point of strategic diversion but when it transpired that harpers ferry was surrendered and the position was not to be utilized that the troops there were to join us by a march on the south side its charms were changed to perplexities the threatening attitude towards the enemys rear vanished his line of communication was open and free of further care and his army relieved of ************* was at liberty to cross the antietam by the upper fords and bridges and approach from vantageground general lees left at the same time the federal left was reasonably secured from aggression by cramped and rugged ground along the confederate right thus the altered circumstances changed all of the features of the position in favor of the federals approaching cramptons gap on the morning of the 14th hamptons cavalry encountered the enemys and made a dashing charge which opened his way to munfords both parties losing valuable officers and men when general stuart rode up he saw nothing seriously threatening and ordered hampton south to the river pass thinking that there might be something more important at that point he rode himself to maryland heights to see general mclaws and to witness the operations at harpers ferry posting colonel munford with two regiments of cavalry two regiments of mahones brigade under colonel ****** part of the tenth georgia infantry ***** battery of four guns and a section of navy howitzers to guard the pass the infantry regiments were posted behind stone walls at the base of the mountain the cavalry dismounted on the flanks acting as sharpshooters at noon general

but he judged that the wait might be more favorable to the other side slocum deployed his brigades ********* newtons and ******** from right to left posted ******** battery of six guns on his left and

brooks and colonel irwin of general smiths division were advanced to slocums left and joined in pursuit which was so rapid that the confederates were not able to rally a good line the entire mountain was abandoned to the federals and the pursuit ended some four hundred prisoners seven hundred stand of arms and one gun were their trophies in this affair general franklins total loss was five hundred and thirtythree general mclaws had ordered general cobbs brigade and the other regiments of mahones to reinforce the troops at the gap but they only came up as the federals were making their sweeping charge and were driven back with their discomfited comrades general semmess brigade at the brownsville pass a mile south with five or six guns attempted to relieve their comrades but the range was too great for effective work that mclaws was not prepared for the sudden onslaught is evident from the assurances made him by the cavalry commander his orders for cobb were severe enough but franklin was too prompt to allow cobb to get to work upon hearing the noise of battle he followed his orders riding with general stuart but the game was played before he could take part in it night came and gave him time to organize his forces for the next day had the defenders been posted at the crest of the mountain it is probable they could have delayed the assaulting forces until reinforced but cavalry commanders do not always post artillery and infantry to greatest advantage general cobb made worthy effort to arrest the retreat and reorganize the forces but was not able to fix a ************* till after the pass was lost and the troops were well out of fire of the pursuers general semmes came to his aid with his staff but could accomplish nothing until he drew two of his regiments from

bombardment at harpers ferry to that line during the night under cover of the night lieutenantcolonel h davis at the head of the union cavalry left harpers ferry crossed the potomac marched up the left bank through sharpsburg and made good his escape capturing some forty or fifty confederate wagons as they were moving south from hagerstown we left mclaws in possession of maryland heights on the 14th with his best guns planted against the garrison at harpers ferry the potomac river was between his and jacksons and walkers forces and the shenandoah divided jacksons and walkers commands walker posted his division to defend against the escape from harpers ferry and planted three parrott guns of captain frenchs battery and two rifle pieces of captain branchs on loudoun heights having effective fire along bolivar heights general jackson sent word to mclaws and walker that the batteries were not to open till all were ready but the latter hearing the engagement along south mountain drawing nearer and becoming impatient lest delay should prove fatal ordered his guns to open against the batteries along bolivar heights and silenced those under range general jackson ordered a p hills division along the left bank of the shenandoah to turn the enemys left the division under lawton down the turnpike in support of hill and his own division to threaten against the enemys right hills division did its work in good style securing eligible positions on the enemys left and left rear of bolivar heights and planted a number of batteries upon them during the night and jackson had some of his best guns passed over the shenandoah to commanding points near the base of loudoun heights at daylight lawtons command moved up close to the enemy at the same time the batteries of hills division opened fire and a little later all the batteries including those of mclaws and walker the signal ordered for the storming columns was to be the cessation of artillery fire in about one hour the enemys fire ceased when jackson commanded silence upon his side penders brigade started when the enemy opened again with his artillery the batteries of pegram and ******** dashed forward and

of relief to general lees forces but prudence would have gone with the bolder move of his entire command east of the mountain against mcclellans rear with a fair field for strategy and tactics this move would have disturbed mcclellans plans on the afternoon of the 15th while there seemed little hope that mcclellan would delay his attack until jackson could join us marching by the south side the field and extreme of conditions were more encouraging of results than was napoleons work at ****** general jackson judged it better to join us by the south side marched promptly with two of his

desultory fire of artillery continuing until night the morning of the 16th opened as the evening of the previous day closed except for the arrival of the remainder of the union troops the ninth corps took post at the lower bridge opposite the confederate right the first the other divisions of the second and the twelfth corps resting nearer keedysville the display of their finely appointed

of *********** dead angle so to speak the batteries on the field north and the longrange ********* battery of general doubleday were playing their fire down the pike taking their aim by the direction

seemed hazardous to call them off and leave an open way our line was throbbing at every point so that i dared not call on general lee for help sergeant ellis thought that he could bring up ammunition if he was authorized to order it he was authorized and rode for and brought it i held the horses of some of my staff who helped to man the guns as cannoneers as the attacking forces drew nearer colonel cooke reported his ammunition exhausted he was ordered to hold on with the bayonet and sent in return that he would hold till ice forms in regions where it was never known or words to that effect as richardson advanced through the corn he cut off the battery under boyce so that it was obliged to retire to save itself and as barlow came upon our centre the battery on our left was for a time thrown out of fire lest they might injure friend as much as foe barlow marched in steady good ranks and the remnants before him rose to the emergency they seemed to forget that they had known fatigue the guns were played with life and the brave spirits manning them claimed that they were there to hold or to go down with the guns as our shots rattled against the ******* ranks colonel

east crest there was a moment of amusement when general hill with about fifty men and a battleflag ran to gain a ************ for flank fire against richardsons left colonel ross observing the move and appreciating the opportunity charged with two regiments for the same and secured it general hill claimed and rightly that it had effect in giving the impression that there were other forces coming to support him another regiment came to the relief of the twentyseventh under cooke the movement of troops in that quarter was construed by the enemy as a threatened flank move against richardson which caused some little delay in his march though the confederates had but fragments here and there the enemy were kept busy and watchful lest they should come upon another surprise move the confederates were surprised but much relieved when they found this affair reduced to the defensive and assumed that every missile they sent must have found one or more victims but accounts of the other side make clear that the result was due to accidental artillery shots that cut down colonel barlow the aggressive spirit of richardsons right column and general richardson himself at his culminating moment barlow fell from a case or ************ as did richardson all the union accounts refer to a battery on their right throwing shell and the two brass guns in front throwing case and

before our move could be known that we would have but a few rods to march before we could mingle our ranks with those of the enemy that our columns massed and in goodly numbers pressing severely upon a single point would give the enemy much trouble and might cut him in two and break up his battle arrangements at the lower bridge but just then general jackson reported with authority from general

cavalry under fitzhugh lee was to follow relieving lines of picket guards and helping the feeble footmen the rear of the confederate column crossed into virginia at ten am unmolested as the pursuit was not threatening general lee ordered his army to continue the march to proper points of bivouac holding the artillery reserve under general pendleton and an infantry detail of the brigades of armistead and lawton commanded by colonels hodges and lamar as guard at the ford general pendleton posted some thirty guns in position for converging fire at the ford and put a line of skirmishers near it holding the infantry reserve and eleven guns at the rear about noon the union cavalry appeared on the other bank the batteries of gibson ******* and robertson were put in action but relieved about two oclock by artillery of the fifth corps after a severe combat the fourth michigan regiment and parts of the one hundred and eighteenth pennsylvania and eighteenth and ************ massachusetts were ordered over under general ******* they forced the passage under artillery and infantry fire scaled the heights and got possession of five guns of different batteries and a number of smallarms when night approaching the detachment was recalled general pendleton reported the result to general headquarters and general lee ordered general jackson to send his nearest division back to the ford early in the morning a p hills division was ordered he was fortunate in approaching the ford ******** before the federals had crossed all of their advancing column formed his brigades in two lines and advanced to attack general porter upon the report of this advance found that his troops could not get position on the south bank in time to meet this threatening ordered the troops withdrawn to cover about the canal and adjacent heights and succeeded in getting most of his men safely back general hill deployed the brigades of gregg thomas and pender as his front line under command of general gregg lanes branchs brigade archers and brockenbroughs brigades were of his second line commanded by general archer in this order the division advanced and engaged in a severe struggle finding the fight on his front heavy general pender called to general archer for support and the latter moving by his left brought his brigade on penders left when the advance was pushed to successful issue the one hundred and eighteenth pennsylvania regiment was thrown into confusion and suffered heavy loss one of the guns lost the day before was recovered and two hundred prisoners taken the losses were between two hundred and fifty and three hundred on each side the federals losing about twenty more than the confederates the confederate accounts of this affair were overdrawn but they were reassuring after the severe experience about south mountain and sharpsburg the army of northern virginia was then marched to the vicinity of martinsburg where it remained in repose for several days then retired to the vicinity of winchester the army of the potomac concentrated about harpers ferry ********* its supplies and transportation we may say of the battle of sharpsburg that

by the extreme right and left divided by a river gave us the benefit of interior lines and it was that that saved the confederate army for it became manifest early in the day that his reserves were held at the bridge no 2 which gave us freer use of our inner lines following is a condensed but accurate presentation of the organization of the contending armies in the battle of sharpsburg and the maryland campaign for conveying to the reader a comprehensive view of the military zodiac at the time we crossed the quiet potomac the 5th day of september 1862 and an understanding of the ******* sequence of the events following something should be added here to the plain narrative of occurrences and so i undertake a review of the maryland campaign the army of northern virginia was afield without a foe its once grand adversary discomfited under two commanders had crept into cover of the ******** about the national capital the commercial social and blood ties of maryland inclined her people to the southern cause a little way north of the potomac were inviting fields of food and supplies more plentiful than on the southern side and the fields for march and manuvre strategy and tactics were even more inviting than the broad fields of grain and comfortable ************ propitious also was the prospect of swelling our ranks by maryland recruits at the head of the army of sixty thousand men encouraged matured and disciplined by victory stood the confederate chief challenging on its own soil the army that had marched to conquer the southern capital on the 7th he pitched his bivouac about frederick city on the 8th he made his ********** to the people in these words at this very time the recently displaced commander general mcclellan ********** in command was marching for an opportunity to recover his good name and the union cavalry was active and aggressive in work against the confederates at *********** on the 9th the confederate commander organized his plans for the surrounding and capture of harpers ferry and put his army in motion on the 10th close upon the heels of the march followed the army of the potomac only twentyfive miles behind the rear of the confederate army with the cavalry of the armies in contact the march of the former was as cautious as that of the latter was venturesome on the 10th the union commander was informed of the march of j g walkers brigades up the river from cheeks ford on the 11th his signal service reported the camp across the river at point of rocks on the 12th at ****** he was informed of the combination against harpers ferry and the march towards the cumberland valley and ordered pressing pursuit to force the confederates to a stand under that order general pleasonton the federal cavalry leader hurried his troops and cleared the way to south mountain on the 13th from day to day the confederates marched their ********** columns from day to day the union columns ********* in easy cautious marches at noon of the 13th general lees order distributing his forces and a despatch from the governor of pennsylvania were handed general ************ former the celebrated lost despatch given on a previous ******* latter reading as follows this told of the change of march of my brigades from turners pass to hagerstown and with the lost despatch revealed that hills five brigades were the only troops at the former place the same afternoon general mcclellans signal service despatched him that the union signal station on maryland heights had gone down general lees signals failed to connect so that general mcclellan was better informed of the progress of the confederate movements than was the confederate commander that afternoon the union army was in hand for battle the confederates were dispersed and divided by rivers and drifting thirty and forty and fifty miles apart under similar circumstances general scott or general taylor or general worth would have put the columns at the base of south mountain before night and would have passed the unguarded gaps before the suns rays of next morning could have lighted their eastern slopes the union commander claims to have ordered more vigorous pursuit after the lost despatch was handed him but there is nothing to support the claim except his call on general franklin and in that he only ordered preparation at cramptons to await events at turners pass general pleasonton was at turners pass on the afternoon of the 13th and made a reconnoissance of the ways leading up the east side of the mountain he was not informed of the despatches received by his chief nor had he any information of confederate movements except such as he had gleaned in closely following their rear at daylight of the 14th he led general cox and the ninth corps to attack and in this manner the battle was opened his orders to call the confederates to a stand did not anticipate the provocation of a general engagement but a wait for his chief who rode up about one oclock he thought that he was battling against seventeen brigades while there were but five and had the battle been held in wait for mcclellan his wellknown habit of careful reconnoissance would have consumed the balance of the day his last orders for general franklin directed a wait for couchs division which joined him at eight oclock in the evening it is difficult to find that a quicker move was given the union army in consequence of the lost despatch but one may rather concede general hills claim that in consequence of that despatch the union army was so delayed as to give the confederates time to make their way back to the soil of old virginia without it the main column of the union forces could have marched through cramptons pass and relieved harpers ferry on the 14th but guided by it their commander found it important to first guard against the seventeen brigades that should be at turners pass on the right rear of a column moving against cramptons the ****** of the walls of jericho by encircling marches of priests and soldiers at the signal of longdrawn blasts of sacred horns and shouts of the multitude was scarcely a greater miracle than the transformation of the conquering army of the south into a horde of disordered fugitives before an army that two weeks earlier was flying to cover under its homeward ramparts providence helps those who can avail themselves of his tender care but permits those who will to turn from him to their own arrogance that his gracious hand was with the confederates in their struggles on the chickahominy and even through the errors of the bull run campaign cannot be questioned when however in ************** they lost sight of his helping hand and in contempt of the enemy dispersed the army they were given up to the reward of ********* that the disaster was not overwhelming they have to thank the plodding methods of the union commander with as much faith as captain joshua his success would have been as complete but for the proper solution of the campaign we must turn again to the condition of the confederate army when it crossed into maryland it was then all that its leaders could ask and its claim as master of the field was established but it was worn by severe marches and battles and in need of rest its record before and after shows that held in hand and refreshed by easy ********* and comfortable supplies it would have been prepared to maintain its supremacy the first necessity was a little time to refresh while the grand object was to draw the enemy from his intrenched lines to free and open battle these facts carefully observed the confederate army would have been assured of its claim and prestige in the confusion about washington incident to the bull run campaign general mcclellan was ordered to receive the retreating columns and post them to defend and hold their fortified lines he had not emerged from the clouds that hung about his untoward campaign in virginia but familiar with the provisions that had been made for defence he was most available for the service he had hardly posted the troops and arranged the garrison when he found that the confederates instead of moving against his fortifications had turned the head of their columns north and were marching to invade union territory he was quick to discover his opportunity and after posting guards for the works about the capital assumed command of the army and took the field lest another commander should be assigned his clouded fame and assumption of authority committed him to early aggressive work he had nothing to lose but the world to gain and that upon the field of battle all that the confederates had to do was to hold the army in hand and draw the enemy to a field wide enough for manuvre then call him to his battle it is possible that ragged affairs about the mountain passes might have given him safe retreat to his capital leaving the army of the south afield a free lance it had been arranged that the southern president should join the troops and from the head of his victorious army call for recognition maryland would have put out some of her resources and her gallant youth would have helped swell the southern ******** twenty thousand soldiers who had dropped from the confederate ranks during the severe marches of the summer would have been with us volunteers from all parts of the south would have come swimming the potomac to find their president and his fieldmarshal while union troops would have been called from kentucky and tennessee and would have left easy march for the confederate armies of the west to the ohio river even though the confederates were not successful the fall elections were against the federal administration with the southern armies victorious the results of the contest at the polls would have been so pronounced as to have called for recognition of the confederacy general mcclellan wrote general halleck of the effect in case of defeat of his army so much has been said and written about harpers ferry and the surrender of the garrison that it seems difficult to pass it without notice in more than one report general mcclellan mentioned it as a shameful surrender he had disapproved the position as false and asked if it could not be given up colonel miles the commander who gave his life in its defence was acting under the following order from the department ************ the simple truth is it was defended to the last extremity the nearer the approach of the succoring army the more imperative would have been the demand for action on the part of the confederate columns and had battle been forced it could not possibly have resulted in any save one ************** victory and an overwhelming one at that the position was denounced as a ******* and so it proved to colonel miles and his eleven thousand troops but it was in fact a far more formidable trap for the confederates who to seize it sacrificed the fruits of heavy ********** in the main battle of the *********** were forced to draw their crippled ranks to homeward defence general jackson wanted it till he got possession then gave it up general mcclellan wanted to give it up before it was taken after it had been taken and given up he reoccupied it it was left severely alone in the gettysburg ********** admission by both sides of its uselessness as a point ****** a word in closing about the chiefs opposed in this great campaign general lee and general mcclellan were both graduates of the united states military academy at west point the former took the second honor of the class of 1829 the latter the second honor of the class of 1846 their service in the united states army was as military engineers in 1854 they were both selected by secretary of war jefferson davis for promotion to the new cavalry regiments as lieutenantcolonel and captain respectively their early opportunities social and educational were superior they studiously improved them in youth and applied them with diligence in ********* aspirations leading to the higher walks of social and professional life seem to have been alike controlling forces in the character and career of each they were not unmindful that physical development was important in support of mental improvement in moral tone and habits they may be called ********* in his service general lees pride was duty to his government and to the army under his command he loved admiration of the outside world but these duties better general mcclellans ambition was not so limited in stature general lee stood five feet ten inches was of ************* muscular figure as trim as a youth and weighed one hundred and seventy pounds in features he was a model of manly beauty his teeth were of ivory whiteness his mouth handsome and expressive of frankness kindness and generosity his nose and chin were full regular strong and gave his face force and character twas seldom that he allowed his mind to wander to the days of his childhood and talk of his father and his early associates but when he did he was far more charming than he thought as a commander he was much of the wellington ********* style he found it hard the enemy in sight to withhold his blows with mcclellan it was more difficult to strike than to march for the enemy general mcclellan was of short stout figure but was of soldierly presence graceful and **************** in their mounts neither of the great commanders lost anything of his admirable presence both were masters of the science but not of the art of war lee was successful in virginia mcclellan in maryland unjust criticism has been passed upon the confederate soldiers in the maryland campaign based principally upon the great number of absentees to those who have spent their lives near the ranks of soldiers and learned from experience that there is a limit to physical endurance explanation is not called for to those who look upon the soldier as a machine not even needing oil to facilitate motive power i will say try to put yourselves in the soldiers places another point to be noted was that in the confederate ranks there were thousands of soldiers who had been wounded once twice and in some instances three times who in any other service would have been on the ************ at their comfortable homes sickness and weakness that creep into an army from irregular food collected in the stress of march were no trifling impediments to the maintenance of our ranks in vigorous form when in mature judgment the historian ****** monuments of words for the leaders of the campaign in maryland there will be flowers left for the private soldiers and for the private soldiers graves the full significance of sharpsburg to the federal authorities lay in the fact that they needed a victory on which to issue the emancipation proclamation which president lincoln had prepared two months before and had held in abeyance under advice of members of his cabinet until the union arms should win a success although this battle was by no means so complete a victory as the president wished and he was sorely vexed with general mcclellan for not pushing it to completion it was made the most of as a victory and his emancipation proclamation was issued on the 22d of september five days after the battle this was one of the decisive political events of the war and at once put the great struggle outwardly and openly upon the basis where it had before only rested by tacit and covert understanding if the southern army had been carefully held in hand refreshed by easy marches and comfortable supplies the proclamation could not have found its place in history on the other hand the southern president would have been in maryland at the head of his army with his ********* for peace and independence under an act not long before passed by the confederate congress authorizing the appointment of seven lieutenantgenerals the authorities at richmond about this time sent commissions to lieutenantgenerals longstreet polk holmes hardee e k smith jackson and pemberton and made appointments of a number of majorgenerals under these appointments general lee organized the army of northern virginia into corps substantially as it subsequently fought the battle of fredericksburg the confederate army rested along the lines between the potomac and winchester till late in october on the 8th general stuart was ordered across to ride around the union army then resting about sharpsburg and harpers ferry his ride caused some excitement among the union troops and he got safely to the south side with the loss of a few men slightly wounded on the 12th on the 26th general mcclellan marched south and crossed the potomac east of the blue ridge jackson was assigned the duty of guarding the passes i marched south corresponding with the march of the army of the potomac a division crossed at ashbys gap to upperville to look for the head of mcclellans army he bore farther eastward and marched for warrenton where he halted on the 5th of november the division was withdrawn from upperville and marched for culpeper courthouse arriving at that point at the same time as mcclellans at ********** h f lees cavalry the day before me soon after the return to culpeper courthouse evanss brigade was relieved of duty with the first corps and ordered south hood had a brush with a cavalry force at manassas gap and part of mclawss division a similar experience at the east end of chester gap i reached culpeper courthouse with the divisions of mclaws r h anderson and pickett hoods division was ordered behind robertson river and ransom to madison courthouse general jackson with the second corps remaining in the shenandoah valley except one division at chester gap of the blue ridge the washington authorities issued orders on the 5th of november relieving general mcclellan of and assigning general burnside to command of the army of the potomac on the 9th the army was put under general burnside in due form when informed of the change general lee expressed regret as he thought that mcclellan could be relied upon to conform to the strictest rules of science in the conduct of war he had been mcclellans ********* they had served together in the engineer corps and our chief thought that he thoroughly understood the displaced commander the change was a good lift for the south however mcclellan was growing was likely to exhibit far greater powers than he had yet shown and could not have given us opportunity to recover the morale lost at sharpsburg as did burnside and hooker general burnside soon after assuming command and while waiting at warrenton made a radical change in the organization of the army by ************* the corps into three grand divisions as follows at the time of the change of commanders the confederates were looking for a federal move north of culpeper courthouse and were surveying the ground behind robertson river for a point of concentration of the two wings to meet that move general burnside however promptly planned operations on other lines he submitted to president lincoln his proposition to display some force in the direction of gordonsville as a diversion while with his main army he would march south cross the rappahannock at fredericksburg and reach by a surprise march ground nearer richmond than the ******** of the confederates this was approved by the president with the suggestion that its success depended upon prompt execution on the 15th light began to break upon the confederates revealing a move south from warrenton but it was not regarded as a radical change from the orange and alexandria railroad line of advance a battery of artillery was sent with a regiment of infantry to reinforce the confederate outpost at fredericksburg under colonel ball on the 17th information came that the right grand division under general sumner had marched south leaving the railroad and general w h f lees cavalry was ordered to fredericksburg the next morning i marched with two divisions mclawss and ransoms the former for fredericksburg the latter towards the north anna the same day general lee ordered a forced reconnoissance by his cavalry to warrenton found that the union army was all on the march towards fredericksburg and ordered my other divisions to follow on the 19th at the first disclosure he was inclined to move for a position behind the north anna as at that time the position behind fredericksburg appeared a little awkward for the confederates but taking into careful consideration the position of the union army on the stafford side the former appeared the less faulty of the two defence behind the anna would have been stronger but the advantage of the enemys attack would also have been enhanced there then too anticipation of the effect of surprising the enemy in their intended surprise had some influence in favor of fredericksburg the burnside march was somewhat of the horace greeley ************ ************ style which if allowed to run on long enough sometimes gains headway that is troublesome general sumner reached falmouth on the 17th and proposed to cross but his advance was met and forced back by colonel balls command i rode with the leading division for fredericksburg and was on the heights on the 19th my headquarters were there when general sumner called upon the civil authorities to surrender the city by the following communication the officers who received the call by consent of general patrick who delivered it referred the paper to my headquarters i asked the civil authorities to reply that the city would not be used for the purposes complained of but that neither the town nor the south side of the river could be occupied by the union army except by force of arms general sumner ordered two batteries into position commanding the town but in a few hours received the following reply from the mayor to this general sumner responded the same day as the inference from the correspondence was that the shelling was only postponed the people were advised to move with their valuables to some place of safety as soon as possible without complaint those who could packed their precious effects and moved beyond reach of the threatened storm but many preferred to remain and encounter the dangers rather than to leave their homes and valuables the fortitude with which they bore their trials quickened the minds of the soldiers who were there to defend them one train leaving with women and children was fired upon making some confusion and dismay among them but the two or three shells did no other mischief and the firing ceased mclawss division of my corps was posted on the heights in rear of the city one brigade in the sunken road in front of the marye mansion the others extending across the telegraph road through the wood of lees hill as the other divisions of the corps came up they were posted r h anderson on taylors hill ransom in reserve near corps headquarters pickett in the wood in rear of mclawss right hood at hamiltons crossing the federal grand divisions under franklin and hooker marched on the 18th of november and on the 19th pitched their camps the former at stafford courthouse and the latter at ******** each about ten miles from falmouth a mile and a half above fredericksburg the rappahannock cuts through a range of hills which courses on the north side in a ************* direction nearly parallel and close to its margin this range stafford heights was occupied by the enemy for his batteries of position one hundred and fortyseven siege guns and longrange field batteries these heights not only command those of the west but the entire field and flats opened by the spreading out of the range on the west side at points however they stand so close beside the river that the guns on their crest could not be so depressed as to plunge their fire to the water the heights are cut at points by ********** and ravines leading into the river and level up gradually as they approach nearer to the potomac on its west slope and towards the sea on the south the city of fredericksburg nestles under those heights on the opposite bank mclaws had a brigade on picket service extending its guard up and down the banks of the river in connection with details from r h andersons division above and hoods below the latter meeting stuarts cavalry vedettes lower down at the west end of the ridge where the river cuts through is taylors hill the confederate left which stands at its highest on a level with stafford heights from that point the heights on the south side spread unfolding a valley about a mile in width affording a fine view of the city of the ****** fields and the heights as they recede to the vanishing limits of sight next below taylors is maryes hill rising to half the elevation of the neighboring heights and dropping back leaving a plateau of half a mile and then swelling to the usual ******** of the range on the plateau is the marye mansion along its base is a sunken road with retaining walls on either side that on the east is just ********** for a man and just the height convenient for infantry defence and fire from the top of the breastwork the ground ******* gradually till near the canal when it drops off three or four feet leaving space near the canal of a rod or two of level ground the north end of the sunken road cuts into the plank or gordonsville road which is an extension of hanover street from near the heart of the town at the south end it enters the telegraph road extending out from the town limits and up over the third or telegraph hill called in its bloody baptismal lees hill an unfinished railroad lies along the telegraph road as far as the highlands the fredericksburg and potomac railroad lies nearly parallel with the river four miles and then turns south through the highlands the old stage road from the city runs about halfway between the river and the railroad four miles when it turns southwest and crosses the railroad at hamiltons crossing the hamlet of falmouth on the north side of the river was in front of the right centre of the federal position half a mile from fredericksburg general jackson advised of general burnsides move to fredericksburg drew his corps east of the blue ridge as far as orange courthouse before the end of november it became evident that fredericksburg was to be our winter station and the scene of a severe battle before it could be relieved general lee advised the citizens who still remained in the place and some who had returned to remove their effects those who had friends found comfortable places of rest but many took the little that they could get away with and made their homes in the deep forest till the storm could pass still none complained of the severe ordeal which they were called upon to endure towards the latter part of the month general jackson was called down and assigned position on the right near hamiltons crossing and the massaponax he objected to the position preferring the north anna but general lee had already weighed the matter and had decided in favor of fredericksburg hoods division relieved at hamiltons crossing was drawn to my right and stretched across the valley of deep run a little to the rear of jacksons left and mclawss right batteries of position were assigned from the reserve artillery along the heights with orders to cover the guns by epaulements or ******* them the work was progressing while the guns were held under cover remote from the enemys better appointed artillery until the positions were covered by solid banks or good pits the small field pieces were removed for safety to convenient points for field service in case opportunity called for them the confederates had three hundred and six guns including two *********** parrotts of richmond make these were covered by epaulements on lees hill on the 1st of december the batteries of reserve artillery were relieved from the first corps by those of the washington and alexanders artillery orders were given to examine all lines of approach and to measure particularly the distance of the crossings of the canal on the plank and telegraph roads to inspect and improve the parapets and pits along the front and to traverse all batteries not securely covered against the batteries opposite taylors hill and others within range of our lines and mclaws was directed to open signal line with his brigade and guards along the river bank the day after jackson joined us several gunboats were reported in the lower river at port royal d h hills division was detached with several select batteries to watch and guard at that point against a crossing should it be attempted and to engage and try the metal of the gunboats after some little practice the boats drew off and dropped ********** but hills division was left near the point in observation with w h f lees cavalry the brigade of cavalry under general hampton kept careful watch of the fords of the upper rappahannock to guard against further encroachments of the gunboats a battery was intrenched on the river bank under direction of major t m r ****** of the general staff at the river sharpshooters by concealing themselves in the ravines and pits could escape artillery fire and lie in secure readiness to attack parties engaged in laying bridges after driving off working parties they were to seek cover till again needed by such practice they were to delay the bridgebuilders till the commands had time to assemble at their points of rendezvous the narrow deep bed of the stream a mile away from any point of the confederate lines where batteries could be planted and covered as it was by the guns of stafford heights prevented the thought of successful resistance to laying bridges at any point from falmouth to the extreme left of the federal line but the strong ground upon which the confederates were to accept battle offset the uncomfortable feeling in regard to the crossing of the river general burnside made some show of disposition to cross fourteen miles below at ******** neck but that was under guard of d h hills division and he saw that his purpose could not be effected the plan which he finally adopted was to span the river by bridges near the centre and lower limits of the city and two others a mile below the latter and just below the mouth of deep run the right grand division to cross by the upper and second bridges the left grand division by the lower bridges and the centre grand division to be in position near the others to reinforce their battle the stir and excitement about the enemys camps on the 10th of december as well as the reports of scouts gave notice that important movements were pending notice was given the commands and the batteries were ordered to have their animals in harness an hour before daylight of the next morning and to continue to ***** up daily at that hour until further orders at three oclock on the morning of the 11th the deep boom of a cannon aroused both armies and a second gun was recognized as the signal for battle in a few minutes the commands were on the march for their positions orders were sent to call d h hills division and all of the second corps to their ground along the woodland over hamiltons crossing barksdales brigade of mississippians was on picket duty in fredericksburg at the time the seventeenth and eighteenth regiments with the eighth florida of r h andersons division were on the river line the other regiments of the brigade and the third georgia of r h andersons in reserve the first noise made by the enemys bridgebuilders was understood by the picket guards as was all of their early work of construction but a heavy mist along the water concealed them from view until their work upon the bridge was well advanced as soon as the forms of the workmen could be discerned the skirmishers opened fire which was speedily answered from the other side in efforts to draw the fire from the bridgebuilders but the confederates limited their attention to the builders till they were driven off when they ceased firing another effort to lay the bridge met a like result then a third received the same stormy repulse when it seemed that all the cannon within a mile of the town turned their concentrating fire of shot and shell upon the buildings of the devoted city tearing crushing bursting burning their walls with angry desperation that must have been gratifying to spirits deep down below under the failures to lay the bridge general hunt suggested that the ************ be filled with *********** rushed across and landed on the other bank until

the confederate commander prepared to stand and receive battle in concluding this account of the confronting armies on the eve of battle let us glance at their relative strength as expressed in numbers the army of the potomac as reported by general burnside had on december 10 an aggregate present for duty of ###### officers and men not including cavalry the army of northern virginia was reported by general lee on the same date to have had an aggregate of ##### not including cavalry on the morning of the 13th of december the confronting armies which were destined that day to clash in one of the bloodiest conflicts of the war stood completely veiled from each others sight by an impenetrable mist the entire confederate army was now for the first time upon the field for general jackson had during the night brought up his scattered divisions from down the river before daylight i rode to view my line and troops from right to left hoods division on the right was found on the alert as was the enemy near that point the voices of the union officers as they gave their commands were carried to us with almost startling clearness by the heavy fog that covered the field and surroundings so heavy was this fog that nothing could be seen at a distance of ten or twelve rods and yet so distinctly were the voices of the officers brought to us that they seemed quite near at hand and general hood was looking for assaulting columns against his front he was told that such move would put the enemys column in a ******** and therefore his position was in no danger of attack that the attack would be aimed against jacksons front that in case it broke through there he should swing around to his right and take the attacking forces in reverse that picketts division would be ordered to a corresponding move on his left with the batteries of the two divisions in the plain off the left that my front would be attacked but it was safely posted and not likely to need other than the troops on that ground picketts command was under arms expecting orders they were given instructions similar to those just mentioned for hood the divisions of mclaws ransom and r h anderson were in readiness as were all the batteries but the fog nothing ****** hung so heavy that not a sight for a cannonshot was open till a late hour of the morning the front of the second corps was occupied by a p hills division the brigades of archer lane and pender on the first line those of thomas gregg and brockenbrough on the second a third line was occupied by taliaferros and earlys divisions d h hills division was off to the rear of the right lieutenantcolonel walker posted a *********** battery of the division artillery on a p hills right and two other field batteries on the plain on his left stuarts horse artillery and cavalry were on the plain on the right in the valley of the massaponax supporting the second corps about ### in the morning general hardie of burnsides staff reported to general franklin that his orders would reach him in a few minutes by the hands of an aidedecamp hardie was ordered to remain near general franklins headquarters at eight oclock the order came and at ### meades division moved towards the general direction of jacksons position at ten oclock the fog lifted and revealed meades lines six batteries on his left and four on his right gibbons division supporting the right and doubledays covering the left the order for the commander of the left grand division was to make the advance by at least one division the divisions of the first corps were thought to fully meet the terms of the order meades lines advanced in handsome solid ranks leaving heavy reserves of the sixth corps and two divisions of the third that had been called over from the centre grand division the fire of stuarts horse artillery against their left caused delay until some of the batteries of the left engaged and drove off the fire after half an hours delay the advance was resumed the batteries thrown to the front to shell the field in search of the confederate batteries the latter had been ordered for the most part to reserve their fire for infantry after an hours heavy artillery practice meades march was resumed and with great vigor the batteries ploughing the way for the infantry columns at the same time the *********** battery of a p hills right and his left batteries replied with equal spirit and practice though with unequal metal the view of the battle of the enemys left burst upon us at lees hill as the mist rolled away under the bright noonday sun we noted the thin pale smoke of infantry fire fading in the far away of their left the heavy clouds rising from the batteries on both sides of the river the bright ******* ranks and banners and our elevation seemed to draw them so close to us on their right that we thought to turn our best guns upon that part of the line and general lee authorized the test of their range only a few shots were sent when the troops that had been lying concealed in the streets of the city came flying out by both roads in ****** at double time and rushed towards us every gun that we had in range opened upon the advancing columns and ploughed their ranks by a fire that would test the nerves of the bravest soldiers but the battle of the federal left had the first opening and calls for first notice under a strong artillery combat meade marched forward with gibbons division in close support on his right and doubledays farther off on his left the line encountered lanes brigade front in a steady hard fight and developing against archers left broke through forcing the brigades back encountered thomass and greggs brigades threw the latter into confusion and killed general gregg brockenbroughs and penders brigades turned against the penetrating columns and were forced back under skilful handling the brigades finally brought the battle to steady work but meades impetuous onward march was bravely made and pressed until three brigades of earlys division were advanced and thrown into action commanded by colonels atkinson walker and hoke these with the combined fire of hills broken lines forced meade back two regiments of berrys brigade of the third corps came to the relief of meade and were driven back when gibbons division which followed was met and after severe battle was repulsed the confederates made a partial following of the success beyond the railroad and until they encountered the fire of the relieving divisions under birney and sickles and the reserve batteries doubledays division protected meades left as jacksons right under taliaferro partially engaged against them both encountered loss hood got one of his brigades in in time to follow the troops as they retired towards their reserve line at the first moment of the break on jacksons lines pickett rode to hood and urged that the opportunity anticipated was at hand but hood failed to see it in time for effective work about two pm the battle quieted into defensive practice of artillery and sharpshooters the opening against the confederate left before referred to was led by frenchs division of the second corps about #### the eighteenth and twentyfourth georgia regiments cobbs georgia legion and the twentyfourth north carolina regiment were in the sunken road the salient point on maryes hill back and above was the washington artillery with nine guns ransoms and cookes north carolina brigade in open field the guns under partial cover pitted other batteries on taylors and lees hills posted to this defence as many as twenty guns holding under range by direct and cross fire the avenues of approach and the open field along cobbs front frenchs division came in gallant style but somewhat hurried he gathered his ranks behind the swell of ground near the canal and moved to the assault an intervening plank fence gave the troops some trouble in crossing under fire so that his ranks were not firm after passing it to the attack hancock coming speedily with his division was better organized and in time to take up the fight as french was obliged to retire this advance was handsomely maintained but the galling fire they encountered forced them to open fire under this delay their ranks were cut up as rapidly as they had collected at the canal and when within a hundred yards of the stone wall they were so thinned that they could do nothing but surrender even if they could leap to the ******* but they turned and the fire naturally slackened as their hurried steps took them away to their partial cover the troops behind the stone wall were reinforced during this engagement by two of cookes regiments from the ******* ordered by general ransom and general mclaws ordered part of kershaws brigade in on their right after hancocks engagement some minutes passed before arrangements were made for the next howards division had been feeling for a way to get by cobbs left when he was called to the front attack and ordered over the same ground he arranged his forces with care and advanced in desperate fight under the severe fire of the confederates his troops were provoked to return fire and during the delay thus caused his ranks were so speedily ********* that they in turn were obliged to return to cover the confederate commander general cobb was killed general kershaw with the other regiments of his brigade was ordered to the front the washington artillery exhausted of ammunition was relieved by guns of alexanders battalion the change of batteries seemed to give new hope to the assaulting forces they cheered and put in their best practice of sharpshooters and artillery the greater part of alexanders loss occurred while galloping up to his position general ransom advanced the other regiments of his brigade to the crest of the hill at the suggestion of general lee the brigades of jenkins and kemper of picketts division were called up and assigned the former to general mclaws and the latter to general ransom a supply of ammunition was sent down to the troops in the road in time to meet the next attack by sturgiss division of the ninth corps which made the usual brave fight and encountered the same damaging results gettys division of the ninth corps came to his support on the left but did not engage fiercely losing less than eight hundred men carrolls brigade of ******** division third corps came in on sturgiss left but only to brace that part of the fight as the troops hurried forward from the streets of the city for the telegraph road they came at once under the fire of the longrange guns on lees hill the *********** parrotts were particularly effective in having the range and dropping their shells in the midst of the columns as they dashed forward frequently commands were broken up by this fire and that of other longrange guns and sought shelter as they thought in the railroad cut but that point was well marked and the shots were dropped in in enfilade fire with precision often making wide gaps in their ranks the siege guns of stafford heights gave their especial attention to our heavy guns and put their shots over the parapets very often one shell buried itself close under the parapet at general lees side as he sat among the officers of his staff but it failed to explode soon after this our big parrott gun burst into many fragments it was closely surrounded by general lee and staff officers of the first corps headquarters and officers and gunners of the battery but the explosion caused no other damage than the loss of the gun griffins division was next ordered to attack and made the usual desperate struggle the confederates meanwhile had accumulated such force in the road that a single division had it reached that point would have found its equal in numbers and of greater vigor with ransom at the top of the hill prepared to rush down and join in the mle at that hour we could have safely invited one division into our midst if assured it was to be the last the next attack was made by humphreyss division its commander was a man of superior attainments and accomplishments in the walks of civil as well as military life he measured justly the situation and arranged his battle in the only order by which success could have been made possible but he had only two brigades with which to take a position not assailable and held by more than three brigades of superior troops his troops were new so that he felt called to personal example as well as skilful handling he ordered the attack with empty muskets and led with his brigade commanders but halfway up towards the goal his men stopped to load and open fire which neither he nor his officers could prevent so they were driven back then he made a like effort with his other brigade under special orders from generals burnside and hooker that the point must be carried before ******** the dew was then falling just then our second big parrott gun went into fragments but without damage to the men the troops that had been driven back from previous attacks joined in trying to persuade humphreyss men not to go forward notwithstanding the discouraging surroundings he led his men on encountered the same terrific and deathdealing opposition and his men retired in greater confusion going beyond his control to the vicinity of the city before he could get them again in ranks his account of the last effort is interesting at that time there were three brigades behind the stone wall and one regiment of ransoms brigade the ranks were four or five ******* rear files loading and passing their guns to the front ranks so that the volleys by brigade were almost incessant ******** of solid sheets of lead two brigades of sykess division first and second regulars were sent to the front to guard the line it was some time after nightfall so that their line could only be distinguished by the blaze of their fire some of the batteries and infantry engaged against their fire till night was well advanced general jackson thought to advance against the enemys left late in the afternoon but found it so well posted and guarded that he concluded the venture would be too hazardous he lost his opportunity failing to follow close upon the repulse of meades and gibbons divisions his command was massed and well in hand with an open field for infantry and artillery he had including the divisions of hood and ************** to work with ******** fifty thousand men franklin had including troops of the centre grand division about equal force the charge of meades division has been compared with that of picketts pettigrews and trimbles at gettysburg giving credit of better conduct to the former the circumstances do not justify the comparison when the fog lifted over meades advance he was within *********** of a p hills division closely supported on his right by gibbons and guarded on his left by doubledays division on hills right was a *********** battery on his left eight guns meade broke through hills division and with the support of gibbon forced his way till he encountered part of ewells division when he was forced back in some confusion two fresh divisions of the third corps came to their relief and there were as many as fifty thousand men at hand who could have been thrown into the fight meades march to meet his adversary was half a ******* troops of both sides fresh and vigorous of the assaulting columns of pickett pettigrew and trimble only four thousand seven hundred under pickett were fresh the entire force of these divisions was only fifteen thousand strong they had a mile to march over open field before reaching the enemys line strengthened by fieldworks and manned by thrice their numbers the confederates at gettysburg had been fought to exhaustion of men and munitions they lost about sixty per cent of the assaulting *********** about forty the latter had fresh troops behind him and more than two hundred guns to cover his rallying lines the confederates had nothing behind them but field batteries almost exhausted of ammunition that meade made a brave good fight is beyond question but he had superior numbers and appointments at gettysburg the confederate assault was made against intrenched lines of artillery and infantry where stood fifty thousand men a series of braver more desperate charges than those hurled against the troops in the sunken road was never known and the piles and ********** of dead marked a field such as i never saw before or since between ### and ### of the afternoon several orders and messages were sent by general burnside calling on general franklin to renew the battle of the left before ### he received from general burnside through his aidedecamp captain ******* this despatch under ordinary circumstances this would be regarded as a strong order but franklin had gone far enough in his first battle to be convinced that an attack by his whole force the other end of the army hard pressed would be extremely hazardous if undertaken and proved disastrous he could have been made to shoulder the whole responsibility for a wish implies discretion it is not just to the subordinate to use such language if orders are intended to be imperative men bred as soldiers have no fancy for orders that carry want of faith on their face the losses at fredericksburg were as follows during the night before twelve oclock a ************** lost his way and was captured he had on his person a memorandum of the purpose of general burnside for renewing the battle against maryes hill in the morning the information was sent up to general headquarters and orders were sent general ransom to intrench his brigade along the crest of the hill orders were sent other parts of the line to improve defences and prepare for the next day in ammunition water and rations under conviction that the battle of next day if made as ordered would be the last of the army of the potomac morning came and passed without serious demonstrations on the part of the enemy orders were sent out however for renewed efforts to strengthen the position colonel alexander found a point at which he could pit a gun in enfilade position to the swell of ground behind which the enemy assembled his forces before advancing to the charge and lieutenantcolonel latrobe sunk a gun in similar position for fire across the field of their charges we were so well prepared that we became anxious before the night of the 14th lest general burnside would not come again in the night he drew back to the river and during the night of the 15th recrossed and sent his troops to their camps the stone wall was not thought before the battle a very important element we assumed that the formidable advance would be made against the troops of mclawss division at lees hill to turn the position at the sunken road dislodge my force stationed there then to occupy the sunken road and afterwards ascend to the plateau upon which the marye mansion stands that this would bring their forces under cross and direct fire of all of our ************** and longrange ****** such concentration as to beat them back in bad disorder general hoods failure to meet his orders to make counter to the anticipated attack upon jackson was reported in the official accounts as he was high in favor with the authorities it did not seem prudent to attempt to push the matter as called for under the ordinary usages of war *** ******* in ***** non ***** general lee went down to richmond soon after the battle to propose active operations and returned with information that gold had advanced to ### in new york that the war was over and peace would be announced in sixty days that it was useless to harass the troops by winter service as gold had gone well up on the southern side without bringing peace it was difficult for soldiers to see the bearing that it could have on the other side still we had some trust and hope in the judgment of superiors the forces available for battle at fredericksburg were federal according to general burnsides report ###### confederate ##### about fifty thousand of the union troops were put into battle and less than twenty thousand of the confederates were engaged the organization of the confederate army at this time was as follows before we were fully settled in our winter quarters and when just beginning to enjoy our camp theatricals we heard that general burnside was looking for another crossing by the lower rappahannock we were not greatly concerned about that however as we thought the quicksands along the flats made especially protective by the winter rains would so delay his march as to allow us ample time to prepare for him but the washington authorities having received reports of it through some of the superior officers of the army of the potomac the march was arrested by orders of the war department another move was set on foot a few weeks later at a time when general lee happened to be in richmond the information was forwarded to him and the army ordered under arms prepared to take the field a few weeks before general burnside had ordered material to be hauled to the point below which he had chosen when preparing for his crossing that had been arrested by the war department when we found that his army was in motion general jackson insisted that the crossing would be made below and proposed to march his corps down to meet it he was told that the neck of land between the potomac and the rappahannock was so interlaced with ********** streams and ravines that the route leading below was not practicable at that season that the quicksands on the flats of the west side were formidable obstacles to the march of an army that the only possible route for crossing the river was by the fords of the highlands and that he must hold his troops ready to move accordingly he was not satisfied with the refusal to accept his construction of the enemys purpose and demurred against authority less than general lees but found that the order must be obeyed not many hours after the report came the noise of the army working through the mud was distinctly heard by my picket guards along the upper river some of the guards called out derisively offering help to get the batteries through the mud if they could only be assured that the army would cross the ********** roads and severe weather broke up the campaign and the move back to camp was reported to me before the confederates marched from their camps this effort called by burnsides soldiers the mud march was followed by the assignment of general hooker to command of the army of the potomac long and close study of the field from the potomac to the james river and the experiences of former campaigns made it clear that the army of the potomac had been drawn into a false position and it became manifest that there were but two moves left open for its spring ************* by crossing the upper fords of the rappahannock secondly by ********* forces to the south side of the james and by that route moving against richmond to guard against the former i laid out lines for fieldworks and riflepits covering all approaches by the upper fords as far as the road leading from united states ford from that point the line broke to the rear crossing the plank road and extending back half a mile to command the road from chancellorsville to spottsylvania courthouse when the lines for these works were well marked i was ordered with the divisions of hood and pickett and dearings and henrys artillery battalions to the south side near petersburg to be in position to meet the latter move leaving the divisions of mclaws and r h anderson to finish the work on the lines of defence after passing to the south side of james river assigning the troops to points of observation near blackwater river and establishing headquarters at petersburg i learned that there was a goodly supply of produce along the east coast of virginia and north carolina inside the military lines of the federal forces to collect and transport this to accessible points for the confederates it was necessary to advance our divisions so as to cover the country and to hold the federal forces in and about their fortified positions while our trains were at work to that end i moved with the troops in virginia across the blackwater to close lines about the forts around suffolk and ordered the troops along our line in north carolina to a like advance the movements were executed without serious trouble and the work was prosecuted up to the time of my recall by general lee while lying near suffolk a couple of young men dressed as citizens entered my tent one night with letters from secretary of war seddon recommending them as trustworthy and efficient scouts they were sent off through the swamp to find their way to norfolk and southward to report of roads or routes for our troops in case we should wish to make a dtour for the capture of suffolk one of them harrison proved to be an active intelligent enterprising scout and was retained in service the accounts that we gained indicated that suffolk could be turned and captured with little loss but as we had given it up the year before as untenable and were liable to be called upon at any moment to give it up again it appeared that the cost of the whistle would be too high the only occurrence of serious moment while we had our forces about suffolk was the loss of captain striblings battery which had been inadvertently posted by the officer in charge of the artillery on a neck running out into a bend of the nansemond river the federal gunboats seeing the opportunity came into the river and took positions commanding the ground in rear of the battery so as to sweep the field against all succoring parties while a direct attack was made upon the battery resulting in its capture about this time the soldiers on both sides had considerable amusement over a federal signal station that was inside our lines as we had laid them the union troops had some time previously trimmed up a tall ******** and built near the top a platform for use as a signal station and coming upon this to gratify his curiosity a confederate soldier climbed to the ******* and seated himself for a leisurely view of the federal forces inside their works an *********** of the other side after allowing sufficient time to satisfy a reasonable curiosity trained one of his rifle guns upon the platform and sent a shell screaming and bursting too near for the comfort of the man up a tree as he did not care to be seen in precipitate retreat he thought to wait a little but a second shot admonished him that hurry if less graceful might be more wise than deliberate retreat acting under pressure of the situation his legs to the amusement of the men on both sides soon brought him to safe cover when night closed in over the belligerents this soldier went to work on a scheme by which he hoped to get even with the yankees he carefully constructed and equipped a ********* man dressed in a new suit of improved ********* drygoods and in due form christening him julius csar took him to the platform adjusted him to graceful position and made him secure to the ********* by strong cords a little after sunrise julius csar was discovered by some of the federal battery officers who prepared for the ******** inviting to skilful practice the new soldier sat under the hot fire with ********** indifference until the confederates not able to restrain their hilarity exposed the joke by calling for three cheers for julius csar the other side quickly recognized the situation and goodnaturedly added to ours their cheers for the old hero about the 28th day of april the army of the potomac under general hooker took up its march for the fords of the upper rappahannock to cross against general lee at fredericksburg at the same time general grant crossed the mississippi below vicksburg marched against general pembertons army in mississippi and was driving it back upon its fortifications about vicksburg when general hookers movements were so developed as to make sure of his purpose repeated calls came to me over the wires to pull away from suffolk and return to general lee with all speed these came from general lee and also from the richmond authorities in reply i despatched that our trains were at the front along the coast collecting supplies that they would be hurried to our rear and as soon as safe we would march the calls became so frequent and urgent however that i inquired if we should abandon our trains to this no answer came and i was left to the exercise of my own judgment as soon as the trains were safely back we drew off marched back to the blackwater and thence en route for richmond and fredericksburg before we reached the former place a telegram came announcing the great battle and victory of chancellorsville passing through richmond i called to report to secretary of war seddon who referred to affairs in mississippi stating that the department was trying to collect an army at jackson under general joseph e johnston sufficient to push grant away from his circling lines about vicksburg he spoke of the difficulty of feeding as well as collecting an army of that magnitude in mississippi and asked my views the union army under general rosecrans was then facing the confederate army under general bragg in tennessee at ************ and *********** i thought that general grant had better facilities for collecting supplies and reinforcements on his new lines and suggested that the only prospect of relieving vicksburg that occurred to me was to send general johnston and his troops about jackson to reinforce general braggs army at the same time the two divisions of my command then marching to join general lee to the same point that the commands moving on converging lines could have rapid transit and be thrown in overwhelming numbers on rosecrans before he could have help break up his army and march for cincinnati and the ohio river that grants was the only army that could be drawn to meet this move and that the move must therefore relieve vicksburg it was manifest before the war was accepted that the only way to ******** the contest was by skilful use of our interior lines and this was so impressed by two years experience that it seemed time to force it upon the richmond authorities but foreign intervention was the ruling idea with the president and he preferred that as the easiest solution of all problems the only objection offered by the secretary was that grant was such an obstinate fellow that he could only be induced to quit vicksburg by terribly hard knocks on the contrary i claimed that he was a soldier and would obey the calls of his government but was not lightly to be driven from his purpose my march was continued and we joined general lee at fredericksburg where i found him in sadness notwithstanding that he was contemplating his great achievement and brilliant victory of chancellorsville for he had met with great loss as well as great gains the battle had cost heavily of his army but his grief was over the severe wounding of his great lieutenant general thomas jonathan jackson the head of the second corps of the army of northern virginia cut off too at a moment so much needed to finish his work in the battle so handsomely begun with a brave heart however general lee was getting his ranks together and putting them in condition for other useful work at the time of the battle of chancellorsville the army of the potomac according to its return of a few days before consisted of officers and men actually available for line of battle ###### with ### pieces of artillery the return of casualties showed the enormous loss of ##### returns of the army of northern virginia for march 1863 showed an effective aggregate of ##### batteries in action about ### guns to this may possibly be added one thousand of troops returning during april in time for the battle the casualties reported by the medical director numbered ##### but reports of the commanders showed over 12000 not including artillery or cavalry or slightly wounded and missing which would probably add another thousand chancellorsville is usually accepted as general lees most brilliant achievement and considered as an independent affair it was certainly grand as i had no part in its active conduct it is only apropos to this writing to consider the plan of battle as projected some four months ********** to stand behind our intrenched lines and await the return of my troops from suffolk under that plan general lee would have had time to strengthen and improve his trenches while hooker was intrenching at chancellorsville he could have held his army solid behind his lines where his men would have done more work on the unfinished lines in a day than in months of idle camp life general hooker had split his army in two and was virtually in the condition which president lincoln afterwards so graphically described in his letter addressed to him june 5 ************ my impression was and is that general lee standing under his trenches would have been stronger against hooker than he was in december against burnside and that he would have grown stronger every hour of delay while hooker would have grown weaker in morale and in confidence of his plan and the confidence of his troops he had interior lines for defence while his adversary was divided by two crossings of the river which made lees sixty thousand for defence about equal to the one hundred and thirteen thousand under general hooker by the time that the divisions of pickett and hood could have joined general lee general hooker would have found that he must march to attack or make a retreat without battle it seems probable that under the original plan the battle would have given fruits worthy of a general engagement the confederates would then have had opportunity and have been in condition to so follow hooker as to have compelled his retirement to washington and that advantage might have drawn grant from vicksburg whereas general lee was actually so crippled by his victory that he was a full month restoring his army to condition to take the field in defensive warfare he was perfect when the hunt was up his ************* was overruling it was probably a mistake to draw mclaws away from his position at maryes hill where he and ransom had successfully held against six or seven severe attacks of the burnside battle with three brigades two of his own and one of ransoms general early was assigned to that position with five brigades he was attacked by about onefourth the number of mclawss assailants the position was carried and early was driven off in confusion losing besides large numbers as prisoners many pieces of artillery his especial assignment was to defend the plank road against the enemys march to attack general lees rear instead he retreated by the telegraph road leaving the plank road free for the enemy after driving early off the enemy marched by the plank road and early marched back to his late position at maryes hill so general lee was obliged to take mclaws and anderson from his battle at chancellorsville to drive back the force threatening his rear the battle as pitched and as an independent affair was brilliant and if the war was for glory could be called successful but besides putting the cause upon the hazard of a die it was crippling in resources and of future progress while the wait of a few days would have given time for concentration and opportunities against hooker more effective than we experienced with burnside at fredericksburg this was one of the occasions where success was not a just ********* after reporting to general lee i offered the suggestions made to secretary seddon in regard to the means that should be adopted for the relief of vicksburg i thought that honor interest duty and humanity called us to that service and asked the aid of his counsels with the war department and reinforcements from his army for the west to that end i suggested that general johnston instead of trying to collect an army against general grant should be sent to reinforce general bragg then standing against the union forces under general rosecrans in middle tennessee that at the same time he should send my divisions just up from suffolk to join johnstons reinforcements to braggs army that the combination once made should strike immediately in overwhelming force upon rosecrans and march for the ohio river and cincinnati he recognized the suggestion as of good combination and giving strong assurance of success but he was averse to having a part of his army so far beyond his reach he reflected over the matter one or two days and then fell upon the plan of invading the northern soil and so threatening washington as to bring about the same ******** result to that end he bent his energies his plan or wishes announced it became useless and improper to offer suggestions leading to a different course all that i could ask was that the policy of the campaign should be one of defensive tactics that we should work so as to force the enemy to attack us in such good position as we might find in his own country so well adapted to that ************ might assure us of a grand triumph to this he readily assented as an important and material adjunct to his general plan his confidence in making moves threatening washington and the invasion of maryland and pennsylvania grew out of the known anxiety of the washington authorities as to the safety of their capital and of quiet within the union lines in the midst of his work of preparation came the announcement that general jacksons trouble had taken an unfortunate turn that he was thought to be sinking and not many hours after that the news came that he had gone to rest but the full realization of all that this meant was delayed until at the railroad station the train that was to bear his remains to their final restingplace started upon its sad journey then officers and soldiers gathered to do last honors to their dead comrade and chieftain seemed suddenly to realize that they were to see stonewall jackson no more forever and fully to measure the great misfortune that had come upon them and as we turned away we seemed to face a future bereft of much of its hopefulness general jacksons death suggested to general lee a reorganization of his army into three corps and r s ewell and a p hill appointed lieutenantgenerals were assigned to the second and third respectively as the senior majorgeneral of the army and by reason of distinguished services and ability general ewell was entitled to the command of the second corps but there were other majorgenerals of rank next below ewell whose services were such as to give them claims next after ewells so that when they found themselves neglected there was no little discontent and the fact that both the new lieutenantgenerals were virginians made the trouble more grievous afterwards when early noted as the weakest general officer of the army of northern virginia was appointed lieutenantgeneral over those who held higher rank than he there was a more serious feeling of too much virginia longstreet and jackson had been assigned by general johnston in our anxious hours and hopeful anticipations the little quarrel was soon lost sight *********** by affairs of greater moment reaction began to show the effect of general lees strong hand and hard work hope and confidence impaired by the failure of the maryland campaign were restored and we prepared to abandon all uncomfortable thoughts with the graves of our fallen comrades as soon as affairs took such shape as to assure me that the advance northward was inevitable i sent a requisition down to richmond for gold coin for my scout harrison gave him what he thought he would need to get along in washington and sent him off with secret orders telling him that i did not care to see him till he could bring information of ************** he should be the judge of that he wanted to know where he would find us and was told that the headquarters of the first corps were large enough for any intelligent man to find with these orders he left us and after about three weeks was arrested in pennsylvania and brought under guard to my headquarters the absorbing study now was the projected campaign into maryland and *************** invasion of the enemys country the plan of defensive tactics gave some hope of success and in fact i assured general lee that the first corps would receive and defend the battle if he would guard its flanks leaving his other corps to gather the fruits of success the first corps was as solid as a ***** great rock it was not to be broken of good position by direct assault and was steady enough to work and wait for its chosen battle the valley of the shenandoah gave us firm broad roads for the march north curtained by the solid range of the blue ridge and south mountains there were some federal troops occupying points in the valley of virginia but not more than enough to give healthful employment to our leading columns as they advanced the army as reorganized in three corps had three divisions of each corps with four brigades to the division except r h andersons picketts and rodess each of which had five j e b stuarts cavalry consisted of the brigades of wade hampton fitzhugh lee w h f lee beverly robertson and w e jones the cavalry of jenkins and imboden operating in the valley and west virginia near our route was to move the former with ewell the latter on his left six batteries of horse artillery under major r f ******* were of stuarts command and to each army corps were attached five battalions of artillery of four guns to a battery and four batteries to a battalion making of the whole artillery organization including batteries of reserve and the thirty guns of horse artillery two hundred and eightyseven guns in the three army corps there were thirtynine brigades proper of infantry in the army of the potomac were fiftyone brigades of infantry eight brigades of cavalry and three hundred and seventy guns of artillery the artillery appointments were so superior that our officers sometimes felt humiliated when posted to unequal combat with their better metal and munitions in smallarms also the union troops had the most improved styles notwithstanding we were prepared to march forward and cheerfully accept the gage hoping to *********** these advantages through the morale afforded by brave hearts and the strategic skill to throw the **** of battle upon the enemy the plan of campaign as projected was by the march of the second corps through the valley of the shenandoah to drive off or capture the federal forces stationed along the valley and continue the march to pennsylvania until further orders meanwhile collecting supplies for the advance and for those who were to follow jenkinss brigade of cavalry working with the advance and imbodens on its left the first corps and main force of cavalry to march near the east base of the blue ridge threatening towards the rear line of the army of the potomac and occupy the blue ridge while the trains and other troops passed behind the mountains to follow the advance march stuarts cavalry brigades were to observe between the first corps and the union army when the third corps had passed behind the first the latter and the cavalry were to withdraw and follow the general march stuart whose movements were to correspond to those of the first corps was to follow its withdrawal and cross the potomac on our right flank at shepherdstown the brigades of generals m jenkins and m d corse of picketts division left in virginia near petersburg and hanover junction were to follow and join their division as will soon appear general beauregard was to be called from his post in the south with such brigades as could be pulled away temporarily from their southern service and thrown forward with the two brigades of picketts division jenkinss and corses and such others as could be got together along the orange and alexandria railroad in threatening attitude towards washington city and he was to suddenly forward picketts brigades through the valley to the division and at his pleasure march on or back towards richmond as the season of ****** along the coast of the carolinas was approaching general lee thought that active operations in the far south especially along the seaboard would be suspended that his move northward might draw most of them towards him and possibly troops operating in the southwest the latter being really a prominent part of the object of his northern march he thought that beauregards appearance in northern virginia would increase the known anxiety of the washington authorities and cause them to draw troops from the south when in the progress of events other similar movements might follow on both sides until important results could be developed north of the potomac his early experience with the richmond authorities taught him to deal cautiously with them in disclosing his views and to leave for them the privilege and credit of approving step by step his apparently ******** policy so that his plans were disclosed little at a time and finding them slow in approving them still slower in advancing the brigades of picketts division and utterly oblivious of the effect of a grand swing north on our interior lines he did not mention the part left open for beauregard until he had their approval of the march of the part of his command as he held it in hand the part assigned for beauregard became the subject for correspondence between the authorities and the officers who knew nothing of the general ideas and plans the latter failed to see any benefit to accrue by taking troops from their commands and naturally offered objections to their going the authorities not comprehending the vast strength to be gathered by ********* our interior lines failed to bring about their execution and the great possibility was not fully tested in pursuance of the plan for the northern campaign our march was taken up on wednesday the 3d of june mclawss division of the first corps marching on that date from fredericksburg and hoods from near orange courthouse on the 4th rodess division of the second corps followed and on the 5th johnsons and earlys of the second pickett of the first with three of his brigades followed the course of hoods division all were to assemble at culpeper courthouse near our cavalry headquarters the third corps general a p hill was left in observation of the enemy at fredericksburg when general hooker discovered the thinning of our camps in rear of fredericksburg he put a bridge across the rappahannock at deep run crossed a considerable force of artillery and infantry and constructed a line of riflepits along the river bank at the report of these movements general lee thought to delay the movements of the second corps though he hurried those of the first to draw off the federals from action against hill but holding the second ready to go back to him should there be need hill made a similar demonstration against hooker threatening on the river below though not so far as to cross it which caused the federals to draw their troops from the south side the second corps was then hurried on to culpeper courthouse the first and second corps waited at the courthouse to know if indications about fredericksburg were such as to warrant the onward march general hooker not convinced that general lee had left him ordered his cavalry under general pleasonton supported by two brigades of infantry to cross the rappahannock in search of stuarts cavalry and to secure information of the confederate plans pleasontons force including infantry was eleven thousand he divided his command sending one half by beverleys the other by kellys ford to march on converging roads to brandy station near fleetwood the latter point the headquarters of our cavalry chief five miles west of rappahannock bridge happily for the confederates the cavalry brigades had been drawn together on the 8th for review by general lee and rested that night not remote from cavalry headquarters on the 9th pleasontons columns made an unlookedfor advance and engaged the confederates before notice could be sent to the columns at their camps the march resulted in a very severe and strongly disputed cavalry fight ending in heavy losses on both sides general stuart called for infantry supports before the close of the conflict but succeeded in recovering his position before the infantry reached ****** however until some important despatches were taken by the enemy which gave the information they were seeking stuart reported ### officers and men lost pleasonton ### and three pieces of artillery on the 10th ewell took up his march for the valley by chester gap now general milroy had a division of nine thousand federals at winchester and sought to hold it contrary to his orders to retire to the command at harpers ferry he had a brigade on outpost at berryville under ********** general kelly had ten thousand men at harpers ferry with a strong detachment of infantry and a battery at martinsburg under colonel b f smith upon entering the valley general ewell detached rodess division and jenkinss cavalry to cut off and capture the force at berryville but ********** withdrew in time to join the forces at winchester this confederate column then marched for martinsburg and got possession there on the 14th the garrison marching out and joining the troops on maryland heights the artillery trying to escape north towards williamsport was followed so closely that they lost some three or four guns with his divisions under johnson and early general ewell marched to winchester and attacked and carried the outworks of milroys fortified position when the latter after calling a council decided to retreat leaving his artillery and wagontrains ewell had anticipated this and sent a part of johnsons division one brigade to intercept him on the martinsburg road the commands met about daylight and there ensued a severe engagement successful to the federals till reinforcements came to the confederates when milroys command was broken up part of his troops escaping to harpers ferry and part getting over the potomac at hancock the federals at harpers ferry abandoned their position in virginia seeking shelter on the heights on the maryland side on his march through the valley general ewell took 4000 prisoners and smallarms 25 cannon 11 standards ### wagons ### horses and large quantities of subsistence and quartermasters stores with a loss of ### of all arms he crossed the potomac on the 15th occupying hagerstown and sharpsburg on the maryland side and sent the cavalry brigade under jenkins north towards chambersburg by the plan of march from the valley of virginia the leading corps second was to divide and cross the potomac river at williamsport and shepherdstown the column through williamsport to march through hagerstown and chambersburg towards harrisburg collecting produce and supplies for the army imbodens cavalry on its left flank the eastern column was to march through sharpsburg emmitsburg and gettysburg towards the bridge over the susquehanna river at wrightsville jenkinss cavalry brigade working with the two columns the third corps passing behind the blue ridge was to cross at shepherdstown and follow the march of the eastern column the first corps was to draw back from the blue ridge and cross the potomac at williamsport to be followed by the cavalry which was to cross at shepherdstown and ride severely towards baltimore to force the enemy to eastern concentration the object of the march of the eastern columns besides opening a wide field for foraging was to draw the enemy from the route of travel of the supply trains and to press him off east to give opportunity for the western columns to file in between him and washington the reconnoissance and cavalry fight made against stuart at fleetwood gave general hooker conclusive evidence of the march of the army of northern virginia and he drew off from stafford heights on the 13th and marched towards the orange and alexandria railroad and the potomac river the first corps was ordered north along the east base of the blue ridge to guard our line of march and cover in a measure the confederate plans stuarts cavalry to ride between the first corps and the union army on the 19th the divisions of the first corps were posted along the blue ridge from ashbys gap on the right to ******** gap on the left mclaws at the former hood at the latter picketts three brigades between the others under the impression that the cavalry was to operate with the first corps in the general plan the commander was ordered to follow its withdrawal west of the blue ridge and cross the potomac on its right at shepherdstown and make his ride towards baltimore he claimed that general lee had given him authority to cross east of the blue ridge after the first corps was in position on the blue ridge and while the third was passing our rear down the valley it seems that general lee so far modified the plan of march north as to authorize his cavalry chief to cross the potomac with part of his command east of the blue ridge and to change the march of the third corps by hagerstown and chambersburg the point at which the cavalry force should cross the river was not determined between the confederate commander and his chief of cavalry there being doubt whether the crossing could better be made at point of rocks between the union army and the blue ridge or between that army and washington city that question was left open and i was ordered to choose between the two points named at the moment that my command took up its line of march the first corps was withdrawn from the blue ridge on the 20th forded the shenandoah and camped on its left bank on the 21st pleasonton came in full force supported by infantry against stuarts cavalry brigades the severe part of the fight came from upperville and succeeded in driving stuart back into ashbys gap part of mclawss division was sent back in time to support stuart and in the morning mclaws ordered woffords brigade down upon the plain but pleasonton had withdrawn the infantry was recalled after an exchange of a few shots at great range connected with the cavalry raid and orders authorizing it are matters of more than usual interest on the 22d the confederate commander sent unsealed instructions to his cavalry chief through headquarters of the first corps to be forwarded provided the cavalry could be spared from my front and could make the ride without disclosing our plans expressing his preference for the ride through hopewell gap east of the union army as previously stated i was to decide at the last moment between the two points that had been named as my front was changed to the rear for the march north the cavalry could be of no service there the extent of authority with me therefore was to decide whether the crossing should be made at the point of rocks or around through hopewell gap east of the union army the crossing at point of rocks was not only hazardous but more likely to indicate our plans than any move that could be made leaving the ride through hopewell gap the only route for the raiding party in my note to general stuart enclosing general lees instructions was this item this has been put in italics and published as evidence that the raid was made by my orders as well as by general lees in the postscript three points are indicated first the move along my rear to the crossing at point of rocks second my preferred march on my flank to the shepherdstown crossing third the route indicated by general lee all of which general stuart understood as well as i did especially did he know that my orders were that he should ride on the right of my column as originally designed to the shepherdstown crossing in the body of my note were orders that he should report to me of affairs along the cavalry line before leaving that he should assign general hampton to command of the cavalry to be left with us with orders to report at my headquarters these orders ********* properly from the commander of the rear column of the army should not have been questioned but they were treated with ********* he assigned general robertson to command the cavalry that was left on the mountain without orders to report at my headquarters and though left there to guard passes of the blue ridge he rode on a raid so that when the cavalry was most needed it was far away from the army the raid and the absence of the cavalry at the critical moment were severely criticised through the army and the country if general stuart could have claimed authority of my orders for his action he could not have failed to do so in his official account he offered no such excuse but claimed to act under the orders of his chief and reported that general lee gave consent to his application for leave to make the march so our plans adopted after deep study were suddenly given over to gratify the youthful *********** wish for a ******* ride about this time we entertained a

towards the potomac followed by those of the first the former crossing at shepherdstown the latter at williamsport the corps came together at hagerstown in maryland continued their march till the 27th and rested two days at chambersburg in pennsylvania the cavalry under general imboden ordered on general ewells left was due as far north as mcconnellsburg but had halted at hancock on the 28th general lee issued orders for the march upon harrisburg general ewell had marched his main column through chambersburg to carlisle his column intending to move east of the mountains through emmitsburg and gettysburg had marched parallel to the main column as far as greenwood when orders were renewed for it to march east through gettysburg general early commanding ordered gordons brigade and a detachment of cavalry through gettysburg but his other troops marched north through mummasburg the failure of the imboden cavalry on his left caused general ewell to send general george h ******* through mcconnellsburg as guard of that flank ******** command rejoined him at carlisle as general ewell marched he sent us three thousand head of beef cattle and information of five thousand barrels of flour he halted at carlisle on the 27th the municipal authorities of gettysburg and york surrendered to general gordon who took some prisoners of the state militia and marched to the bridge over the susquehanna at wrightsville where he had other prisoners but the bridge was burned before him his brigade returned to the vicinity of york where the division had marched and bivouacked on the night of the 28th the eve of the great battle was crowded with events movements for the concentration of the two vast armies went on in mighty force but with a silence in strong contrast to the *********** commotion of their shock in conflict it was the pent quiet of the gathering storm whose bursting was to shake the continent and suddenly command the startled attention of the world after due preparation for our march of the 29th all hands turned in early for a good nights rest my mind had hardly turned away from the cares and labors of the day when i was aroused by some one beating on the pole of my tent it proved to be assistant inspectorgeneral fairfax a young man had been arrested by our outlying pickets under suspicious circumstances he was looking for general longstreets headquarters but his comfortable apparel and welltodo though travelstained appearance caused doubt in the minds of the guards of his being a genuine confederate who could be trusted about headquarters so he was sent up under a file of men to be identified he proved to be harrison the valued scout he had walked through the lines of the union army during the night of the 27th and the 28th secured a mount at dark of the latter day to get in as soon as possible and brought information of the location of two corps of federals at night of the 27th and approximate positions of others general hooker had crossed the potomac on the 25th and 26th of june on the 27th he had posted two army corps at frederick and the scout reported another near them and two others near south mountain as he escaped their lines a little after dark of the 28th he was sent under care of colonel fairfax to make report of his information at general headquarters general lee declined however to see him though he asked colonel fairfax as to the information that he brought and on hearing it expressed want of faith in reports of scouts in which fairfax generally agreed but suggested that in this case the information was so near general longstreets ideas of the probable movements of the enemy that he gave credit to it i also sent up a note suggesting a change of direction of the head of our column east this i thought to be the first and necessary step towards bringing the two armies to such concentration east as would enable us to find a way to draw the enemy into battle in keeping with the general plan of campaign and at the same time draw him off from the travel of our trains there were seven corps of the army of the potomac afield we were informed on the 28th of the approximate positions of five of ********* near frederick and two near the base of south mountain the others of which we had no definite information we now know were the sixth sedgwicks south of frederick and east of the monocacy and the twelfth towards harpers ferry on the 26th general hooker thought to use the twelfth corps and the garrison of harpers ferry to strike the line of our communication but general halleck forbade the use of the troops of that post when general hooker asked to be relieved of the responsibility of command and was succeeded by general meade on the night of the 27th if general hooker had been granted the authority for which he applied he would have struck our trains exposed from chambersburg to the potomac without a cavalryman to ride and report the trouble general stuart was riding around hookers army general robertson was in virginia general imboden at hancock and jenkinss cavalry was at our front with general ewell by the report of the scout we found that the march of ewells east wing had failed of execution and of the effect designed and that heavy columns of the enemy were hovering along the east base of the mountain to remove this pressure towards our rear general lee concluded to make a more serious demonstration and force the enemy to look eastward with this view he changed direction of the proposed march north by ************* on the night of the 28th calling concentration east of the mountains at cashtown and his troops began their march under the last orders on the 29th it seems that general hill misconstrued the orders of the day or was confused by the change of orders and was under the impression that he was to march by york and cross the susquehanna towards philadelphia or harrisburg he ordered his leading division under heth to cashtown however and followed with penders division on the 30th leaving orders for the division of r h anderson to follow on the 1st the purpose of general lees march east was only ************ concentration about cashtown general ewell was ready to march for harrisburg on the 29th when orders reached him of the intended concentration at cashtown he was at carlisle with rodess and e johnsons divisions and the reserve artillery his other division under early was at york on the 30th rodes was at heidlersburg early near by and johnson with the reserve artillery near green village pettigrews brigade of heths division advancing towards gettysburg on the 30th encountered bufords cavalry and returned to cashtown on the 29th general meade wired general halleck as the change of orders made gettysburg prominent as the point of impact the positions of the commands relative thereto and their distances therefrom are items of importance in considering the *********** of events it should be borne in mind that the field of contention was south and east of gettysburg so that the union troops were from two to four miles nearer their formation for battle than were the confederates who had to march from two to four miles beyond the town referring to the map it may be seen that the confederate corps had two routes by which to march for **************** from heidlersburg to cashtown part of the second corps on the road from chambersburg the first third and part of the second corps with all of the trains of the latter with but a single track the ********************** turnpike some of their distances were greater than any of the columns of the enemy while the army of the potomac had almost as many routes of march as commands and was marching from day to day anticipating a general engagement which they were especially cautioned on the 30th was imminent general hill decided to go beyond cashtown on the 1st to ascertain as to the enemy reported at gettysburg he gave notice of his intentions to general ewell and sent back to the commanding general to have andersons division sent forward he was at cashtown with heths and penders divisions and their batteries his reserve artillery with andersons division at fayetteville the armies on the night of june 30 stood thus the confederate first corps two divisions at greenwood except one brigade detached under orders from headquarters at new guilford picketts three brigades at chambersburg left under orders from headquarters to guard trains the second corps two divisions near heidlersburg one near and north of chambersburg the third corps at cashtown and fayetteville cavalry not in sight or hearing except jenkinss brigade and a small detachment the union army the first corps on marsh run the second at ********* the third at bridgeport the

general meades headquarters and reserve artillery were at taneytown his army including cavalry in hand general lees orders called his troops on converging lines towards cashtown but he found that part of his infantry must be left at chambersburg to await the imboden cavalry not up and one of hoods brigades must be detached on his right at new guilford to guard on that side in place of robertsons cavalry in virginia so that as he advanced towards his adversary the eyes and ears of his army were turned afar off looking towards the homes of noncombatants it is ******** to this writing to ******* whence came this mishap there is no doubt it greatly disturbed general lees mind and he would have called a halt under ordinary circumstances but his orders did not contemplate immediate movements beyond cashtown in that he felt safe depending upon his cavalry coming up in time to meet him there he was in his usual cheerful spirits on the morning of the 1st and called me to ride with him my column was not well stretched on the road before it encountered the division of e johnson second corps cutting in on our front with all of ewells reserve and supply trains he ordered the first corps halted and directed that johnsons division and train should pass on to its corps the first to wait during the wait i dismounted to give hero a little respite the irish groom had christened my favorite horse haro after a little time general lee proposed that we should ride on and soon we heard reports of cannon the fire seemed to be beyond cashtown and as it increased he left me and rode faster for the front the brigades of gamble and ***** of bufords cavalry were the force that met pettigrews brigade on the afternoon of the 30th when the latter retired to the post of the divisions at cashtown from gettysburg roads diverge to the passes of the mountains the borders of the potomac and susquehanna and the cities of baltimore and washington so that it was something of a strategic point from the west side two broad roads run one northwest to chambersburg via cashtown the other southwest through fairfield to hagerstown they cross an elevated ridge a mile out north and south of the ******** seminary known to the confederates as seminary ridge covered by open forests at the northward about two miles from the town the ridge divides a lesser ridge putting out west and presently taking a parallel course with the greater this was known as mcphersons ridge and was about five hundred yards from the first where the road crosses it nearly parallel with the chambersburg pike and about two hundred yards distant was the cut of an unfinished railroad willoughbys run flows south in a course nearly parallel to and west of the ridge and is bordered by ******** lands north of gettysburg the grounds are open and in fair fields directly south of it a bold ridge rises with rough and steep slopes the prominent point of the south ridge is cemetery hill and east of this is culps hill from which the ridge turns sharply south half a mile and drops off into low grounds it was well wooded and its eastern ascent steep east of it and flowing south is rock creek from cemetery hill the ground is elevated the ridge sloping south to the cropping out of little round top devils den and the bolder round top the latter about three miles south of the town cemetery hill is nearly parallel to

confederate right in pushing to the front came in open space before merediths brigade which in turn made a gallant advance drove archer back followed across the run and captured general archer and one thousand of his men the other two brigades of penders division pettigrews and brockenbroughs were put in on the right of archers men during the severe engagement on his right the advance of the confederate infantry got in so close along the railroad cut that general reynolds in efforts to extricate his right was shot when the right still under severe pressure was forced to retire towards

troops of ewell cleared the field and followed on through the streets of gettysburg at four oclock the retreat began and continued in good order till they passed gettysburg when the ranks became so scattered that the final march was little better than ***** qui **** as the troops retreated through gettysburg general hancock rode upon the field and under special assignment assumed command at three oclock as the retreating troops arrived wadsworths division on the right the eleventh corps across the baltimore pike the balance of the first under doubleday on the left of the eleventh general howard and others assisted in forming the new line the total effectives of the first and eleventh corps according to the consolidated moving report of june 30 was ##### from the latest returns of general lees army an average estimate of his four divisions gave his total as ##### part of the reserve division of the eleventh corps was not engaged but buford had two brigades of cavalry and so the foregoing may be a fair estimate of the forces engaged less the reserve on cemetery hill at cashtown general lee found that general hill had halted his division under r h anderson and his reserve artillery he had general anderson called who subsequently wrote me of the interview as follows he ordered anderson forward and rode on to seminary ridge in time to view the closing operations of the engagement the union troops were in disorder climbing cemetery heights the confederates following through the streets of gettysburg two other divisions of confederates were up soon after e johnsons of the second and r h andersons of the third corps after a long wait i left orders for the troops to follow the trains of the second corps and rode to find general lee his headquarters were on seminary ridge at the crossing of the cashtown road andersons division was then filed off along the ridge resting johnsons had marched to report to the corps commander dismounting and passing the usual salutation i drew my glasses and made a studied view of the position upon which the enemy was rallying his forces and of the lay of the land surrounding general lee was engaged at the moment he had announced beforehand that he would not make aggressive battle in the enemys country after the survey and in consideration of his *********** movements of detachments of the enemy on the emmitsburg road the relative positions for manuvre the lofty perch of the enemy the rocky slopes from it all ******* the position clearly ********** said we could not call the enemy to position better suited to our plans all that we have to do is to file around his left and secure good ground between him and his capital this when said was thought to be the opinion of my commander as much as my own i was not a little surprised therefore at his impatience as striking the air with his closed hand he said if he is there tomorrow i will attack him in his official account general lee reported when he rode away from me in the forenoon he made no mention of his absent cavalry nor did he indicate that it was not within call so i was at a loss to understand his nervous condition and supported the suggestion so far as to say if he is there tomorrow it will be because he wants you to attack and ******* if that height has become the objective why not take it at once we have forty thousand men less the casualties of the day he cannot have more than twenty thousand then it was that i heard of the wanderings of the cavalry and the cause of his ****** temper so vexed was he at the halt of the imboden cavalry at hancock in the opening of the campaign that he was losing sight of picketts brigades as a known quantity for battle his manner suggested to me that a little reflection would be better than further discussion and right soon he suggested to the commander of the second corps to take cemetery hill if he thought it practicable but the subordinate did not care to take upon himself a fight that his chief would not venture to order the following circular orders were sent the commanders of columns of the first corps at #### of the afternoon of the 1st general halleck sent a cipher despatch to general meade approving his tactics but asking as to his strategy are you not too far east and may not lee attempt to turn your left and cut you off from frederick in this connection may be noted the plan that general meade had mapped in his own mind and given to some of his generals for battle to be formed behind pipe creek a position that would have met the views of general halleck as well as his own covering washington and baltimore under close lines that could not be turned at gettysburg the confederates had comparatively an open field reports coming in to headquarters about six oclock that the enemy was in some force off our right towards fairfield general lee ordered general anderson to put one of his brigades out on the right as picketguard wilcoxs brigade and ***** battery were marched and posted near black horse tavern nothing coming from the centre troops about cemetery hill general lee ordered the second corps after night from his left to his right for work in that direction but general ewell rode over and reported that another ********** ******* been found on his left which had commanding elevation over cemetery hill from which the troops on the latter could be dislodged by artillery and was under the impression that his troops were in possession there that was accredited as reported and approved and the corps commander returned and ordered the hill occupied if it had not been done but the officer in charge had waited for specific orders and when they were received he had made another reconnoissance it was then twelve oclock by the reconnoissance it was found that the enemy was there and it was thought that this should be reported and further orders waited general ewells troops and trains passed the junction of the roads at four oclock the train was fourteen miles long it was followed by the troops of the first corps that had been waiting all day after night the washington artillery and mclawss division camped at marsh run four miles from gettysburg here is hoods account of his march when i left general lee about seven oclock in the evening he had formed no plans beyond that of seizing culps hill as his point from which to engage nor given any orders for the next day though his desperate mood was painfully evident and gave rise to serious apprehensions he had heard nothing of the movements of the enemy since his crossing the potomac except the report of the scout his own force on the field was the second corps rodess earlys and e johnsons divisions from right to left through the streets of gettysburg around towards culps hill on rodess right penders division of the third on seminary ridge r h andersons division of the third except wilcoxs brigade at black horse tavern behind seminary ridge heths division of the third on the march between cashtown and greenwood the first corps the stars were shining brightly on the morning of the 2d when i reported at general lees headquarters and asked for orders after a time generals mclaws and hood with their staffs rode up and at sunrise their commands filed off the road to the right and rested the washington artillery was with them and about nine oclock after an ******** march alexanders batteries were up as far as willoughbys run where he parked and fed and rode to headquarters to report as indicated by these movements general lee was not ready with his plans he had not heard from his cavalry nor of the movements of the enemy further than the information from a despatch captured during the night that the fifth corps was in camp about five miles from gettysburg and the twelfth corps was reported near culps hill as soon as it was light enough to see however the enemy was found in position on his formidable heights awaiting us the result of efforts during the night and early morning to secure culps hill had not been reported and general lee sent colonel venable of his staff to confer with the commander of the second corps as to opportunity to make the battle by his left he was still in doubt whether it would be better to move to his faroff right about nine oclock he rode to his left to be assured of the position there and of the general temper of affairs in that quarter after viewing the field he held conference with the corps and division commanders they preferred to accept his judgment and orders except general early who claimed to have learned of the topographical features of the country during his march towards york and recommended the right of the line as the point at which strong battle should be made about ten oclock general lee returned to his headquarters but his engineer who had been sent to reconnoitre on his right had not come back to be at hand for orders i remained with the troops at his headquarters the infantry had arms stacked the artillery was at rest the enemy occupied the commanding heights of the city cemetery from which point in irregular grade the ridge slopes southward two miles and a half to a bold *********** height of three hundred feet called little round top and farther south half a mile ends in the greater elevation called round top the former is covered from base to top by formidable boulders from the cemetery to little round top was the long main front of general meades position at the cemetery his line turned to the northeast and east and southeast in an ********** curve with his right on culps hill at an early hour of the 2d the union army was posted the twelfth corps at culps hill extending its left to wadsworths division of the first on wadsworths left the eleventh corps on the left of the eleventh the other troops of the first on their left the second and left of that to little round top the third corps the fifth corps stood in reserve across the bend from the right of the twelfth to the left of the second corps thus there was formed a field of tremendous power upon a convex curve which gave the benefit of rapid concentration at any point or points the natural defences had been improved during the night and early morning the sixth corps was marching from manchester twentytwo miles from gettysburg its first order received near manchester before night of the 1st was to march for taneytown but after passing the baltimore pike the orders were changed directing a prompt march to gettysburg the march has been variously estimated from thirty to thirtyfive miles but the distance from manchester via taneytown to gettysburg is only twentynine miles and as the ground for which the corps marched was three miles east of gettysburg the march would have been only twentysix miles via taneytown as the corps marched back and took the baltimore pike some distance must have been saved it was on the field at three oclock of the ************ union cavalry under general pleasonton in reach the confederate left was covering the north and east curve of the enemys line johnsons division near culps hill earlys and rodess extending the line to the right through gettysburg penders division on the right of rodess the other divisions of the third corps resting on seminary ridge with mclawss division and hoods three brigades near general headquarters picketts brigades and laws of hoods division at chambersburg and new guilford twentytwo and twentyfour miles away law had received orders to join his division and was on the march the cavalry was not yet heard from the line so extended and twisted about the rough ground that concentration at any point was not possible it was some little time after general lees return from his ride to the left before he received the reports of the reconnoissance ordered from his centre to his right his mind previously settled to the purpose to fight where the enemy stood now accepted the explicit plan of making the opening on his right and to have the engagement general he ordered the commander of the third corps to extend the centre by andersons division mclawss and hoods divisions to extend the deployment to his right heths division of the third was drawn nearer the front and notice of his plans was sent the commander of the second corps at the intimation that the battle would be opened on the right by part of the first corps colonel alexander was asked to act as director of artillery and sent to view the field in time to assign the batteries as they were up it was eleven oclock when general lees order was issued but he had ordered laws brigade to its division and a wait of thirty minutes was necessary for it to get up law had received his orders at three in the morning and had marched twentythree miles the battleground was still five miles off by the route of march but law completed his march of twentyeight miles in eleven ******** best marching done in either army to reach the field of gettysburg the battle was to be opened on the right by two divisions of the first corps supported on their left by four of the brigades of andersons division the opening to be promptly followed on lees left by the second corps and continued to real attack if the opportunity occurred the third centre corps to move to severe threatening and take advantage of opportunity to attack the movements of the second and third corps to be prompt and in close severe cooperation so as to prevent concentration against the battle of the right the little cavalry that was with the army was kept on the extreme left not so much as one trooper was sent us general lee ordered his reconnoitring officer to lead the troops of the first corps and conduct them by a route concealed from view of the enemy as i was relieved for the time from the march i rode near the middle of the line general lee rode with me a mile or more general anderson marched by a route nearer the enemys line and was discovered by general sickles who commanded the third corps the left of the union line a little uncomfortable at his retired position and seeing that the battle was forming against him general sickles thought to put the third maine regiment and the ****** sharpshooters on outpost in a bold woodland cover to develop somewhat of the approaching battle and presently threw his corps forward as far as the peach orchard half a mile forward of the position assigned to it in the general line the tenth alabama regiment was sent against the outpost guard and reinforced by the eleventh regiment drove it back and andersons division found its place in proper line general birneys account of the affair at the outpost puts it at twelve oclock and the signal accounts the only papers dated on the field reported and presently there is no room for doubt of the accuracy of these reports which go to show that it was one oclock in the afternoon when the third corps upon which the first corps was to form was in position under the conduct of the reconnoitring officer our march seemed ********* were some halts and ************** to save time i ordered the rear division to double on the front and we were near the affair of andersons regiments with the outpost guard of sickles andersons division *************** ****** wrights ****** and mahones brigades from right to left general hood was

and ************** on the right of anderson hoods division on his right mclaws near the crest of the plateau in front of the peach orchard hood spreading and enveloping sickless left the former was readily adjusted to ground from which to advance or defend hoods front was very rugged with no field for artillery and very rough for advance of infantry as soon as he passed the emmitsburg road he sent to report of the great advantage of moving on by his right around to the enemys rear his scouting parties had reported that there was nothing between them and the enemys trains he was told that the move to the right had been proposed the day before and rejected that general lees orders were to guide my left by the emmitsburg road in our immediate front were the divisions of the third corps under generals humphreys and birney from right to left with orders for supports of the flanks by divisions of the second and fifth corps the ground on the left of birneys division was so broken and obstructed by boulders that his left was dropped off to the rear forming a broken line in rear of the enemy and between his lines and little round top was a very rough elevation of eighty feet formed by ********* that left open passage deep down devils den smiths battery was on birneys left winslows between the right and next brigade other batteries in position were clarks ***** randolphs ******* and ********* as mclawss division came up on line barksdales brigade was in front of a battery about six hundred yards off he appealed for permission to charge and capture it but was told to wait on

the batteries were with the ************* to the division one of g t andersons regiments was put on picket down the emmitsburg road general hood appealed again and again for the move to the right but to give more confidence to his attack he was reminded that the move to the right had been carefully considered by our chief and rejected in favor of his present orders the opportunity for our right was in the air general halleck saw it from washington general meade saw and was apprehensive of it even general pendleton refers to it in favorable mention in his official report failing to adopt it general lee should have gone with us to his right he had seen and carefully examined the left of his line and only gave us a guide to show the way to the right leaving the battle to be adjusted to formidable and difficult grounds without his assistance if he had been with us general hoods messengers could have been referred to general headquarters but to delay and send messengers five miles in favor of a move that he had rejected would have been ************ the opportunity was with the confederates from the assembling on cemetery hill it was inviting of their preconceived plans it was the object of and excuse for the invasion as a substitute for more direct efforts for the relief of vicksburg confederate writers and talkers claim that general meade could have escaped without making aggressive battle but that is equivalent to confession of the ******* that failed to grasp the opportunity beaten in the battle of the 1st dislodged of position and outgeneralled the union army would have felt the want of spirit and confidence important to aggressive battle but the call was in the hands of the confederates and these circumstances would have made their work more facile while the union commander would have felt the call to save his capital most imperative even as events passed it was thought helpful to the union side to give out the report that general mcclellan was at hand and would command the army four of the brigades of andersons division were ordered to advance in echelon in support of my left at three oclock the artillery was ordered to open practice general meade was then with general sickles discussing the feasibility of withdrawing his corps to the position to which it was originally assigned but the opening admonished him that it was too late he had just sent a cipher telegram to inform general halleck commanderinchief that in the event of his having no opportunity to attack and should he find the confederates moving to interpose between him and washington he would fall back on his supplies at westminster but my right division was then nearer to westminster and our scouting parties of infantry were within rifle range of the road leading to that point and to washington so it would have been convenient after holding our threatening attitude till night to march across his line at dark in time to draw other troops to close connection before the next morning prompt to the order the combat opened followed by artillery of the other corps and our artillerists measured up to the better metal of the enemy by vigilant work hoods lines were not yet ready after a little practice by the artillery he was properly adjusted and ordered to bear down upon the enemys left but he was not prompt and the order was repeated before he would strike down in his usual gallant style he led his troops through the rocky fastnesses against the strong lines of his earnest adversary and encountered battle that called for all of his power and skill the enemy was tenacious of his strong ground his **************** batteries swept through the passes between the rocks the more deadly fire of infantry concentrated as our men bore upon the angle of the enemys line and ******* the fiercest onset until it became necessary to shorten their work by a desperate charge this pressing struggle and the crossfire of our batteries broke in the salient angle but the thickening fire as the angle was pressed back hurt hoods left and held him in steady fight his right brigade was drawn towards round top by the heavy fire pouring from that quarter bennings brigade was pressed to the thickening line at the angle and g t andersons was put in support of the battle growing against hoods right i rode to mclaws found him ready for his opportunity and barksdale chafing in his wait for the order to seize the battery in his front kershaws brigade of his right first advanced and struck near the angle of the enemys line where his forces were gathering strength after additional caution to hold his ranks closed mclaws ordered barksdale in with glorious bearing he sprang to his work ********** obstacles and dangers without a pause to deliver a shot he had the battery kershaw joined by semmess brigade responded and hoods men feeling the ********* of relief resumed their bold fight and presently the enemys line was broken through its length but his ************ troops knew how to utilize the advantage of their grounds and put back their dreadful fires from rocks *********** and stone fences as they went for shelter about little round top that point had not been occupied by the enemy nor marked as an important feature of the field the broken ranks sought shelter under its rocks and defiles as birds fly to cover general hood fell seriously hurt and general law succeeded to command of the division but the ************ troops were not in need of a close guiding hand the battle was on and they knew how to press its hottest contention general warren chief engineer of the federal army was sent at the critical moment to little round top and found that it was the citadel of the field he called for troops to occupy it the fifth corps sykess was hurried to him and general hancock sent him caldwells division of the second corps at the brick house away from his right general sickles had a detachment that had been reinforced by general hancock this fire drew andersons brigade of direction wilcox a little off from support of barksdales left general humphreys seeing the opportunity rallied such of his troops as he could and reinforced by ***** division willards brigade of hancocks corps came against barksdales flank but the latter moved bravely on the guiding spirit of the battle wrights georgia and ****** florida brigades were drawn in behind wilcox and thrown against humphreys pushing him off and breaking him up the fighting had by this time become tremendous and brave men and officers were stricken by

relieved the brigades of andersons division moved on with barksdales passed the swale and moved up the slope caldwells division and presently those of ***** and barnes of the fifth corps met and held

wounded we gained the wheatfield and were so close upon the gorge that our artillery could no longer venture their fire into it we were on little round top ********* for the crowning point the brigade commanders there vincent and weed were killed also the battery commander ******* and others but their troops were holding to their work as firmly as the mighty boulders that helped them general meade thought that the confederate army was working on my part of the field he led some regiments of the twelfth corps and posted them against us called a division of newtons corps first from beyond hancocks and sent crawfords division the last of the fifth corps ********* through the gorge forming solid lines in places behind stone fences and making steady battle as veterans fresh in action know so well how to make while meades lines were growing my men were dropping we had no others to call to their aid and the weight against us was too heavy to carry the extreme left of our lines was only about a mile from us across the enemys ********** position which brought us within hearing of that battle if engaged and near enough to feel its swell but nothing was heard or felt but the clear ring of the enemys fresh metal as he came against us no other part of our army had engaged my seventeen thousand against the army of the potomac the sun was down and with it went down the severe battle i ordered recall of the troops to the line of plum run and devils den leaving picket lines near the foot of the round tops my loss was about six thousand meades between twelve and fourteen thousand but his loss in general and field officers was frightful when general humphreys who succeeded to barksdales brigade was called back to the new line he thought there was some mistake in the orders and only withdrew as far as a captured battery and when the order was repeated retired under protest general stuart came down from carlisle with his column of cavalry late in the afternoon of the 2d as he approached he met a cavalry force of the enemy moving towards the confederate left rear and was successful in arresting it he was posted with jenkinss three thousand cavalry on the confederate left notwithstanding the supreme order of the day for general battle and the reinforcement of the cavalry on our left the second and third corps remained idle during all of the severe battle of the confederate right except the artillery and the part of that on the extreme left was only in practice long enough to feel the superior metal of the enemy when it retired leaving a battery of four guns in position general early failed to even form his division in battle order leaving a brigade in position remote from the line and sending later another to be near stuarts cavalry the latter returned however before night at eight oclock in the evening the division on our extreme left e johnsons advanced the brigades were j m joness ********* ******** and walkers walkers was detached as they moved to look for a detachment of the enemy reported threatening the far away left when the three brigades crossed rock creek it was night the enemys line to be assaulted was occupied by greenes brigade of the twelfth corps it was reinforced by three regiments of wadsworths division and three from the eleventh corps after brave attack and defence part of the line was carried when the fight after a severe fusillade between the infantry lines quieted and walkers brigade returned to the division part of the enemys trenches east of the point attacked across a swale vacated when the corps moved over to the left general johnson failed to occupy before this general rodes discovered that the enemy in front of his division was drawing off his artillery and infantry to my battle of the right and suggested to general early that the moment had come for the divisions to attack and drew his forces from ************* about the streets to be ready after e johnsons fight on our extreme left general early ordered two brigades under general harry t hays to attack hays had with his louisiana brigade hokes north carolina brigade under colonel avery he made as gallant a fight as was ever made mounting to the top of the hill he captured a battery and pushed on in brave order taking some prisoners and colors until he discovered that his two brigades were advancing in a night affair against a grand army when he found that he was fortunate in having night to cover his weakness and withdrew the gallant colonel avery mortally wounded and dying wrote on a slip of paper tell father that i died with my face to the enemy when rodes was prepared hays had retired and the former did not see that it was part of the order for general engagement to put his division in night attack that could not be supported thus the general engagement of the day was dwarfed into the battle of the right at three oclock that on the left at eight by a single division and that nearer the centre at nine oclock by two brigades there was a man on the left of the line who did not care to make the battle win he knew where it was had viewed it from its earliest formation had orders for his part in it but so withheld part of his command from it as to make cooperative concert of action impracticable he had a ********* for the honors of the field of mars was eloquent before the fires of the bivouac and his chief of the glory of wars **** shield but when its envied laurels were dipping to the grasp when the heavy field called for bloody work he found the placid horizon far and away beyond the cavalry more lovely and inviting he wanted command of the second corps and succeeding to it held the honored position until general lee found at last that he must dismiss him from field service general lee ordered johnsons division of his left occupying part of the enemys trenches about culps hill to be reinforced during the night of the 2d by two brigades of rodess division and one of earlys division why the other brigades of those divisions were not sent does not appear but it does appear that there was a place for them on johnsons left in the trenches that were vacated by the federal twelfth corps when called over to reinforce the battle of meades left culps hill bore the same relations to the enemys right as little round top did to his left general fitzhugh lee quotes evidence from general meade that had culps hill been occupied in force by confederates it would have compelled the withdrawal of the federal troops general meade after the battle of his left ordered the divisions of his twelfth corps back to their trenches to recover the parts occupied by the confederate left it was night when the first division approached general ruger commanding thought to feel his way through the dark by a line of skirmishers he found the east end of his trenches across the swale unoccupied and took possession pressing his adventure he found the main line of his works occupied by the confederates in force and disposed his command to wait for daylight the second division came during the night when general williams commanding the corps posted it on the left of the first and the division commanders ordered batteries in proper positions during the night general meade held a council which decided to fight it out so it began to look as if the vicissitudes of the day had so worked as to call general meade from defensive to aggressive battle for culps hill but the confederates failed to see the opportunity and force the issue as it was presented in general meades evidence before the committee on the conduct of the war he puts his losses of the first and second days at twenty thousand and ******* twothirds of these to the battle of the 2d as the fighting against the three brigades of our left after night and two brigades later in the night from our centre could not have been very severe i claim that his loss in the battle of his left was from twelve to fourteen thousand as events of the battle of the 2d passed it seems fair to claim that with picketts brigades present at the moment of woffords advance for the gorge at little round top we could have had it before crawford was there under ordinary circumstances this account of the second day made from the records would be complete and conclusive but the battle of gettysburg which may be called the ******* of the war has been the subject of many *********** of words knights of the ***** have consumed many of their peaceful hours in publishing through books periodicals and newspapers their plans for the battle endeavoring to ********* the records and to find a scapegoat and their representations may be given though they do not deserve it a word of reply general w n pendleton led off when making a ********* tour through the south for a memorial church for general lee he claims that he made a reconnoissance on the afternoon of the 1st of july and that upon his reporting it general lee ordered general longstreet to attack at sunrise the next day he did not venture to charge that the second and third corps that were on the field and had had a good nights rest were part of the command ordered for the early battle for the commanders both virginians and not under the political ban could have brought confusing evidence against him nor did he intend to put general lee in the anomalous position ************* of ordering part of the first ********* should march through the night and all ******* make the battle alone the point of battle was east of the emmitsburg road to find it it was necessary to cross that road but general sickles was moving part of his corps over the road during that afternoon and rested there the latter part of the day and during the night so to make the reconnoissance general pendleton passed the union troops in confederate ********* was military in his ******** found the point of battle giving him credit for the moment for this delicate work and the ******** order let us find the end to which it would lead the only troops that could come under the order were mclawss division part of hoods and the ************** ten thousand men these after a hurried ********* march reached general lees headquarters about sunrise of the 2d and by continued forced march could have reached the point of battle about five miles away by seven oclock where they would have encountered a division of the third corps birneys presently the second and fifth corps under hancock and sykes then the first eleventh and twelfth under newton howard and slocum then the balance of the third coming in on our rear along the emmitsburg ********** sixty thousand men and more there was reason to be proud of the prowess of the troops of the first corps but to credit a part of it with success under the circumstances was not reasonable that the confederate second corps did not have orders for the alleged sunrise battle is evidenced by the report of its commander who ********** for his work about culps hill during the night of the 1st and morning of the 2d reported of the morning it was now daylight and too late meaning that it was too late for him to attack and carry that hill as general lee had authorized and expected him to do during the night before if he had been ordered to take part in the sunrise battle he would have been in the nick of time that the third corps was not to be in it is evidenced by the position of the greater part of it on seminary ridge until near noon of the 2d so general lee must have ordered a position carried at sunrise by ten thousand men after it had gathered strength all ****** position that he would not assault on the afternoon of the 1st with forty thousand men lest they should encounter overwhelming numbers as the other corps after receiving their orders for the afternoon battle of the 2d failed to engage until after nightfall it is not probable that they would have found the sunrise battle without orders general pendletons official report is in conflict with his memorial lecture in the former he makes no reference to the ************* order but mentions a route by which the left of the enemy could be turned letters from the active members of general lees staff and from his military secretary general a l long show that the sunrise battle was not ordered and a letter from colonel fairfax shows that the claim that it was so ordered was set up after general lees death in a published account general long mentions my suggestion on the afternoon of the 1st for the turning march around the enemys left which he says after consideration was rejected colonel taylor claims that the attack by the confederate right should have been sooner and should have met the enemy back on his first or original line and before little round top was occupied but little round top was not occupied in force until after my battle opened and general sickless advance to his forward lines was made in consequence of the confederate threatening and would have been sooner or later according as that threatening was made he calls the message of general lee to general ewell on the afternoon of the 1st an order general lee says it is the custom of military service to accept instructions of a commander as orders but when they are coupled with conditions that transfer the responsibility of battle and defeat to the subordinate they are not orders and general ewell was justifiable in not making attack that his commander would not order and the censure of his failure is unjust and very ungenerous the virginia writers have been so eager in their search for a flaw in the conduct of the battle of the first corps that they overlook the only point into which they could have thrust their pens at the opening of the fight general meade was with general sickles discussing the feasibility of moving the third corps back to the line originally assigned for it but the discussion was cut short by the opening of the confederate battle if that opening had been delayed thirty or forty minutes the corps would have been drawn back to the general line and my first deployment would have enveloped little round top and carried it before it could have been strongly manned and general meade would have drawn off to his line selected behind pipe creek the point should have been that the battle was opened too soon another point from which they seek comfort is that sedgwicks corps sixth was not up until a late hour of the 2d and would not have been on the field for an earlier battle but sedgwick was not engaged in the late battle and could have been back at manchester so far as the afternoon battle was concerned and they harp a little on the delay of thirty minutes for laws brigade to join its division but general lee called for the two divisions and had called for laws brigade to join his division it was therefore his order for the division that delayed the march to have gone without it would have justified censure as we were not strong enough for the work with that brigade it is not probable that we could have accomplished more without it colonel taylor says that general lee urged that the march of my troops should be hastened and was chafed at their ************* not one word did he utter to me of their march until he gave his orders at eleven oclock for the move to his right orders for the troops to hasten their march of the 1st were sent without even a suggestion from him but upon his announcement that he intended to fight the next day if the enemy was there that he was excited and off his balance was evident on the afternoon of the 1st and he labored under that oppression until enough blood was shed to appease him general lee has reported of arrangements for the day this is ************ he did not give or send me orders for the morning of the third day nor did he reinforce me by picketts brigades for morning attack as his headquarters were about four miles from the command i did not ride over but sent to report the work of the second day in the absence of orders i had scouting parties out during the night in search of a way by which we might strike the enemys left and push it down towards his centre i found a way that gave some promise of results and was about to move the command when he rode over after sunrise and gave his orders his plan was to assault the enemys left centre by a column to be composed of mclawss and hoods divisions reinforced by picketts brigades i thought that it would not do that the point had been fully tested the day before by more men when all were fresh that the enemy was there looking for us as we heard him during the night putting up his defences that the divisions of mclaws and hood were holding a mile along the right of my line against twenty thousand men who would follow their withdrawal strike the flank of the assaulting column crush it and get on our rear towards the potomac river that thirty thousand men was the minimum of force necessary for the work that even such force would need close cooperation on other parts of the line that the column as he proposed to organize it would have only about thirteen thousand men the divisions having lost a third of their numbers the day before that the column would have to march a mile under concentrating battery fire and a thousand yards under longrange musketry that the conditions were different from those in the days of napoleon when field batteries had a range of six hundred yards and musketry about sixty yards he said the distance was not more than fourteen hundred yards general meades estimate was a mile or a mile and a half captain long the guide of the field of gettysburg in #### stated that it was a trifle over a mile he then concluded that the divisions of mclaws and hood could remain on the defensive line that he would reinforce by divisions of the third corps and picketts brigades and stated the point to which the march should be directed i asked the strength of the column he stated fifteen thousand opinion was then expressed that the fifteen thousand men who could make successful assault over that field had never been arrayed for battle but he was impatient of listening and tired of talking and nothing was left but to proceed general alexander was ordered to arrange the batteries of the front of the first and third corps those of the second were supposed to be in position colonel walton was ordered to see that the batteries of the first were supplied with ammunition and to prepare to give the signalguns for the opening combat the infantry of the third corps to be assigned were heths and pettigrews divisions and wilcoxs brigade at the time of the conversation and arrangement of the assault by the confederate right artillery fire was heard on our extreme left it seems that general lee had sent orders to general ewell to renew his battle in the morning which was intended and directed as a cooperation of the attack he intended to order on his right but general ruger anticipating opened his batteries against ewell at daylight the union *************** and ********* on broken lines open towards the trenches held by the confederates so that assault by our line would expose the force to fire from the enemys other line ruger had occupied the trenches left vacant on his right and gary reached to his left under greene who held his line against the attack of the day before it seems that the confederates failed to bring artillery up to their trenches and must make their fight with infantry while on the union side there were some fifteen or twenty guns playing and many more at hand if needed as the union batteries opened johnson advanced and assaulted the enemys works on his right towards the centre and the adjacent front of the new line and held to that attack with resolution putting in fresh troops to help it from time to time ruger put two regiments forward to feel the way towards johnsons left they got into hot engagement and were repulsed johnson tried to follow but was in turn forced back he renewed his main attack again but unsuccessfully and finally drew back to the trenches ruger threw a regiment forward from his left which gained the stone wall his division was then advanced and it recovered the entire line of trenches while this contention was in progress the troops ordered for the column of assault were marching and finding positions under the crest of the ridge where they could be covered during the artillery combat alexander put a battery of nine guns under the ridge and out of the enemys fire to be used with the assaulting column general lee said that the attack of his right was not made as early as ************* he should not have said he knew that i did not believe that success was possible that care and time should be taken to give the troops the benefit of positions and the grounds and he should have put an officer in charge who had more confidence in his plan twothirds of the troops were of other commands and there was no reason for putting the assaulting forces under my charge he had confidence in general early who advised in favor of that end of the line for battle knowing my want of confidence he should have given the benefit of his presence and his assistance in getting the troops up posting them and arranging the batteries but he gave no orders or suggestions after his early designation of the point for which the column should march fitzhugh lee claims evidence that general lee did not even appear on that part of the field while the troops were being assigned to position as the commands reported pickett was assigned on the right kempers and garnetts brigades to be supported by armisteads wilcoxs brigade of the third corps in echelon and guarding picketts right pettigrews division on picketts left supported by the brigades of scales and lane under command of general trimble the brigades of pettigrews division were archers pettigrews brockenbroughs and daviss general archer having been taken prisoner on the 1st his brigade was under command of colonel fry general scales being wounded on the same day his brigade was commanded by colonel ******** the ridge upon which the commands were formed was not parallel to that upon which the enemy stood but bending west towards our left while the enemys line bore northwest towards his right so that the left of the assaulting column formed some little distance farther from the enemys line than the right to put the troops under the best cover during the artillery combat they were thus posted for the march but directed to spread their steps as soon as the march opened the field and to gain places of correct ********* meanwhile the enemys artillery on his extreme right was in practice more or less active but its meaning was not known or reported and the sharpshooters of the command on the right had a lively fusillade about eleven oclock in which some of the artillery took part the order was that the right was to make the signal of battle general lee reported that his left attacked before due notice to wait for the opening could be given which was a mistake inasmuch as the attack on his left was begun by the federals which called his left to their work general meade was not apprehensive of that part of the field and only used the two divisions of the twelfth corps ******* brigade of the sixth and six regiments of the first and eleventh corps in recovering the trenches of his right holding the other six corps for the battle of his centre and left he knew by the confederate troops on his right just where the strong battle was to be the director of artillery was asked to select a position on his line from which he could note the effect of his practice and to advise general pickett when the enemys fire was so disturbed as to call for the assault general picketts was the division of direction and he was ordered to have a staffofficer or courier with the artillery director to bear notice of the moment to advance the little affair between the skirmish lines quieted in a short time and also the noise on our extreme left the quiet filing of one or two of our batteries into position emphasized the profound silence that prevailed during our wait for final orders strong battle was in the air and the veterans of both sides swelled their breasts to gather nerve and strength to meet it division commanders were asked to go to the crest of the ridge and take a careful view of the field and to have their officers there to tell their men of it and to prepare them for the sight that was to burst upon them as they mounted the crest just then a squadron of union cavalry rode through detachments of infantry posted at intervals in rear of my right division it was called a charge but was probably a reconnoissance colonel black had reported with a hundred of the first south carolina cavalry not all mounted and a battery of horse artillery and was put across the emmitsburg road supported by infantry in front of merritts brigade of cavalry when satisfied that the work of preparation was all that it could be with the means at hand i wrote colonel walton of the washington artillery at the same time a note to alexander directed that pickett should not be called until the artillery practice indicated fair opportunity then i rode to a woodland hard by to lie down and study for some new thought that might aid the assaulting column in a few minutes report came from alexander that he would only be able to judge of the effect of his fire by the return of that of the enemy as his infantry was not exposed to view and the smoke of the batteries would soon cover the field he asked if there was an alternative that it be carefully considered before the batteries opened as there was not enough artillery ammunition for this and another trial if this should not prove favorable he was informed that there was no alternative that i could find no way out of it that general lee had considered and would listen to nothing else that orders had gone for the guns to give signal for the batteries that he should call the troops at the first opportunity or lull in the enemys fire the signalguns broke the silence the blaze of the second gun mingling in the smoke of the first and ******* rolled to the left and repeated themselves the enemys fine metal spreading its fire to the converging lines ploughing the trembling ground plunging through the line of batteries and ******** the heavy air the two or three hundred guns seemed proud of their undivided honors and organized confusion the confederates had the benefit of converging fire into the enemys massed position but the superior metal of the enemy *********** the advantage of position the brave and steady work progressed before this the confederates of the left were driven from their captured trenches and hope of their effective cooperation with the battle of the right was lost but no notice of it was sent to the right of the battle they made some further demonstrations but they were of little effect merritts brigade of cavalry was in rear of my right threatening on the emmitsburg road *********** brigade took position between merritts and close on my right rear infantry regiments and batteries were broken off from my front line and posted to guard on that flank and rear not informed of the failure of the confederates on the left and the loss of their vantageground we looked with confidence for them to follow the orders of battle general pickett rode to confer with alexander then to the ground upon which i was resting where he was soon handed a slip of paper after reading it he handed it to me it read pickett said general shall i advance the effort to speak the order failed and i could only indicate it by an affirmative bow he accepted the duty with seeming confidence of success leaped on his horse and rode gayly to his command i mounted and spurred for alexanders post he reported that the batteries he had reserved for the charge with the infantry had been spirited away by general lees chief of artillery that the ammunition of the batteries of position was so reduced that he could not use them in proper support of the infantry he was ordered to stop the march at once and fill up his **************** but alas there was no more ammunition to be had the order was imperative the confederate commander had fixed his heart upon the work just then a number of the enemys batteries hitched up and hauled off which gave a glimpse of unexpected hope encouraging messages were sent for the columns to hurry ***** they were then on elastic springing step the officers saluted as they passed their stern smiles expressing confidence general pickett a graceful horseman sat lightly in the saddle his brown locks flowing quite over his shoulders pettigrews division spread their steps and quickly rectified the ********* and the grand march moved bravely on as soon as the leading columns opened the way the supports sprang to their ********** general trimble mounted adjusting his seat and reins with an air and grace as if setting out on a pleasant afternoon ride when ******* to their places solid march was made down the slope and past our batteries of position confederate batteries put their fire over the heads of the men as they moved down the slope and continued to draw the fire of the enemy until the smoke lifted and drifted to the rear when every gun was turned upon the infantry columns the batteries that had been drawn off were replaced by others that were fresh soldiers and officers began to fall some to rise no more others to find their way to the hospital tents single files were cut here and there then the gaps increased and an occasional shot tore wider openings but closing the gaps as quickly as made the march moved on the divisions of mclaws and hood were ordered to move to closer lines for the enemy on their front to spring to the charge as soon as the breach at the centre could be made the enemys right overreached my left and gave serious trouble brockenbroughs brigade went down and daviss in impetuous charge the general order required further assistance from the third corps if needed but no support appeared general lee and the corps commander were there but failed to order help colonel latrobe was sent to general trimble to have his men fill the line of the broken brigades and bravely they repaired the damage the enemy moved out against the supporting brigade in picketts rear colonel sorrel was sent to have that move guarded and pickett was drawn back to that contention mclaws was ordered to press his left forward but the direct fire of infantry and crossfire of artillery was telling fearfully on the front colonel fremantle ran up to offer congratulations on the apparent success but the big gaps in the ranks grew until the lines were reduced to half their length i called his attention to the broken struggling ranks trimble mended the battle of the left in handsome style but on the right the massing of the enemy grew stronger and stronger brigadier garnett was killed kemper and trimble were desperately wounded generals hancock and gibbon were wounded general lane succeeded trimble and with pettigrew held the battle of the left in steady ranks picketts lines being nearer the impact was heaviest upon them most of the field officers were killed or wounded colonel whittle of armisteads brigade who had been shot through the right leg at williamsburg and lost his left arm at malvern hill was shot through the right arm then brought down by a shot through his left leg general armistead of the second line spread his steps to supply the places of fallen comrades his colors cut down with a volley against the bristling line of bayonets he put his cap on his sword to guide the storm the enemys massing enveloping numbers held the struggle until the noble armistead fell beside the wheels of the enemys battery pettigrew was wounded but held his command general pickett finding the battle broken while the enemy was still reinforcing called the troops off there was no indication of panic the broken files marched back in steady step the effort was nobly made and failed from blows that could not be ****** some of the files were cut off from retreat by fire that swept the field in their rear officers of my staff sent forward with orders came back with their saddles and bridles in their arms ******** horse was twice shot looking confidently for advance of the enemy through our open field i rode to the line of batteries resolved to hold it until the last gun was lost as i rode the shells screaming over my head and ploughing the ground under my horse an involuntary appeal went up that one of them might take me from scenes of such awful responsibility but the storm to be met left no time to think of ones self the battery officers were prepared to meet the ******** move had been made for leaving the field my old acquaintance of sharpsburg experience captain miller was walking up and down behind his guns smoking

of all cutting and slashing when he could get at the skirmishers or detachments he made a gallant ride along the rear of our right but was obliged to come under the infantry and artillery fire at several points he fell pierced it is said by five mortal wounds calls for him to surrender were made but the cavalry were not riding for that the command lost heavily but claimed captives equal to their loss kilpatricks mistake was in not putting ********** in on merritts left where he would have had an open ride and made more trouble than was ever made by a cavalry brigade had the ride been followed by prompt advance of the enemys infantry in line beyond our right and pushed with vigor they could have reached our line of retreat general meade ordered his left but delay in getting the orders and preparing to get through the rough grounds consumed time and the move was abandoned the fifth and sixth corps were in convenient position and would have had good ground for marching after getting out of the rocky fastnesses of round top as we had no cavalry on our right the union cavalry was held on their right to observe the confederates under stuart except kilpatricks division and custers brigade of that division was retained on their right a little while after the repulse of our infantry column stuarts cavalry advanced and was met by greggs and made one of the severest and most stubborn fights of cavalry on record general wade hampton was severely wounded the union forces held the field when affairs had quieted a little and apprehension of immediate counterattack had passed orders were sent the divisions of mclaws and hood to draw back and occupy the lines from which they had advanced to engage the battle of the second orders sent bennings brigade by the division staff were not understood and benning under the impression that he was to relieve part of mclawss division which he thought was to be sent on other service ordered the fifteenth georgia regiment to occupy that position when he received the second order he sent for his detached regiment meanwhile the enemy was feeling the way to his front and before colonel ****** received his second order the enemy was on his front and had passed his right and left flanks the moment he received the final order colonel ****** made a running fight and escaped with something more than half his men in regard to this as to other battles in which the first corps was concerned the knights of peaceful later days have been busy in search of points on which to lay charges or make ********** of want of conduct of that corps general early has been a picturesque figure in the combination ready to champion any reports that could throw a shadow over its record but the charge most pleasing to him was that of treason on the part of its commander the subject was lasting piquant and so consoling that one is almost inclined to envy the comfort it gave him in his latter days colonel taylor and members of the staff claim that general lee ordered that the divisions of mclaws and hood should be a part of the assaulting column of this general lee says colonel taylor says on this point i offer the evidence of general warren before the committee of investigation general hancocks evidence on that point is from which it is evident that the withdrawal of the divisions of my right to be put in the column of assault would have been followed by those corps swinging around and enveloping the assaulting columns and gaining lees line of retreat colonel venable thinks it a mistake to have put heths division in the assaulting column he says but to accept for the moment colonel taylors premises the two divisions referred to would have swelled the columns of assault to twentythree thousand men we were alone in the battle as on the day before the enemy had seventyfive thousand men on strong ground with *************** defences the confederates would have had to march a mile through the blaze of direct and cross fire and break up an army of seventyfive thousand ************ troops well defended by fieldworks a rough sketch of the positions of the forces about my right and rear will help to show if it was comparatively safe and not at all threatened general gibbons testimony in regard to the assaulting columns of the 3d had the column been augmented by the divisions of my right it is probable that its brave men would have penetrated far enough to reach johnsons island as prisoners hardly possible that it could have returned to general lee by any other route when engaged collecting the broken files after the repulse general lee said to an officer who was assisting it is all my fault a letter from colonel w m owen assures me that general lee repeated this remark at a roadside fire of the washington artillery on the 5th of july a letter from general lee during the winter of 186364 repeated it in substance and here is what colonel t j goree of texas has to say upon the subject further testimony to this effect comes from another source a contributor to ********** magazine reported it should be stated that kindest relations were maintained between general lee and myself until interrupted by politics in 1867 it is difficult to reconcile these facts with the reports put out after his death by members of his family and of his staff and ********** champions that indicate his later efforts to find points by which to so work up public opinion as to shift the disaster to my shoulders some of the statements of the members of the staff have been referred to general fitzhugh lee claims evidence that general lee said that he would have gained the battle if he had had general jackson with him but he had jackson in the sharpsburg campaign which was more blundering than that of gettysburg in another account fitzhugh lee wrote of general lee no assurances were made from officers of the first corps but rather objections the only assurances that have come to light to be identified are those of general early who advised the battle but from the other end of the line from his command which should have given warning that it did not come from the heart of a true soldier and this is the ******* of the confederate battle the army when it set out on the campaign was all that could be desired except that the arms were not all of the most approved pattern but it was despoiled of two of its finest brigades jenkinss and corses of picketts division and was fought out by detail the greatest number engaged at any one time was on the first day when twentysix thousand engaged twenty thousand of the first and part of the eleventh corps on the afternoon of the second day about seventeen thousand were engaged on the right and at night about seven thousand on the left then later at night about three thousand near the centre on the third day about twelve thousand were engaged at daylight and until near noon and in the afternoon fifteen *********** of the work of the second and third days against an army of seventy thousand and more of veteran troops in strong position defended by fieldworks general lee was on the field from about three oclock of the afternoon of the first day every order given the troops of the first corps on that field up to its march on the forenoon of the 2d was issued in his presence if the movements were not satisfactory in time and speed of moving it was his power duty and privilege to apply the remedy but it was not a part of a commanders duty or privilege to witness things that did not suit him fail to apply the remedy and go off and grumble with his staffofficers about it in their efforts to show culpable delay in the movements of the first corps on the 2d some of the virginia writers endeavor to show that general lee did not even give me a guide to lead the way to the field from which his battle was to be opened he certainly failed to go and look at it and assist in selecting the ground and preparing for action fitzhugh lee says of the second day longstreet was attacking the maryes hill of the position at fredericksburg general burnside attacked at maryes hill in six or more successive assaults with some twenty or thirty thousand against three brigades under mclaws and ransom and the artillery he had about four hundred yards to march from his covered ways about fredericksburg to maryes hill when his last attack was repulsed in the evening he arranged and gave his orders for the attack to be renewed in the morning giving notice that he would lead it with the ninth corps but upon reports of his officers abandoned it general lees assaulting columns of fifteen or twenty thousand had a march of a mile to attack double their numbers better defended than were the three brigades of confederates at maryes hill that drove back burnside the enemy on cemetery hill was in stronger position than the confederates at maryes hill fitzhugh lee writes in the volume already quoted call them ****** but their name is legion weird spirits keep midnight watch about the great boulders while unknown comrades stalk in ghostly ranks through the black fastnesses of devils den wailing the lament some one blundered at gettysburg woe is me whose duty was to die fitzhugh lee makes his plans orders and movements to suit his purpose and claims that they would have given gettysburg to the confederates but he is not likely to convince any one outside of his coterie that over the heights of gettysburg was to be found honor for the south general meade said that the suggestion to work towards his line of communication was sound military sense that utterance has been approved by subsequent fair judgment and it is that potent fact that draws the spiteful fire of latterday knights forty thousand men unsupported as we were could not have carried the position at gettysburg the enemy was there officers and men knew their advantage and were resolved to stay until the hills came down over them it is simply out of the question for a lesser force to march over broad open fields and carry a fortified front occupied by a greater force of seasoned troops referring to the proposed move around the union left to cut the line of communication a parallel in the ************ war is appropriate when the manuvres of the campaign had pushed marshal ********* army back to the road between paris and **** the

surrender outgeneralled and with a demoralized army he thought the latter his proper alternative the relative conditions of the armies were similar the union army beaten at fredericksburg and chancellorsville and drawn from its aggressive campaign to defensive work in pennsylvania had met disaster in its battle of the 1st if it had been outgeneralled and dislodged of position without further attack it would have been in poor condition to come in aggressive battle against its adversary in wellchosen defensive grounds again in our own war when the union army carried the confederate works west of petersburg on the 2d of april 1865 general meade got his army together and was about to march east to finish his work by the capture of petersburg general grant ************ the confederates would retreat during the night at petersburg he would be behind them in his then position he would be alongside of them and have an even start with better prospect to strike across their march and force them to general battle or surrender and he ordered arrangements for the march west at daylight even napoleon ********* the first in the science and greatest in the execution of the art of war finally lost grasp of his grandest thought in war men are nothing a man is everything the confederate chief at gettysburg looked something like napoleon at waterloo fitzhugh lee quotes evidence of governor carroll of maryland that general lee said longstreet is the hardest man to move in my army it does not look like generalship to lose a battle and a cause and then lay the responsibility upon others he held command and was supported by his government if his army did not suit him his word could have changed it in a minute if he failed to apply the remedy it was his fault some claim that his only fault as a general was his tender generous heart but a heart in the right place looks more to the cause intrusted to its care than for hidden ways by which to shift its responsibility to the shoulders of those whose lives hang upon his word when he set out on his first campaign chickahominy with the army the key of the campaign was intrusted to general jackson who named the hour for the opening and failed to meet his own appointment at the time he appointed a p hills d h hills and longstreets commands were in position waiting about eight hours after his time he was up but deliberately marched past the engagement and went into camp a mile or more behind the hot battle he remained in his camp next morning and permitted the enemy dislodged of his position of the day before to march by him to a strong position at gainess mill when his column reached that position his leading division d h hills engaged the enemys right without orders he called the division off and put his command in position to intercept the enemys retreat towards the pamunkey from which he was afterwards called to his part in the general engagement the next day he had the cavalry and part of his infantry in search of the enemys next move at my headquarters were two clever young engineers who were sent to find what the enemy was about they were the first to report the enemys retreat towards james river orders were given for jackson to follow on the direct line of retreat also magruder and huger my command was ordered around through the outskirts of richmond by the ********* road to interpose between mcclellans army and the james river about twenty miles the other troops marching by routes of about nine miles we were in position on the evening of the 29th of june and stood in front of the enemy all of the 30th fighting a severe battle in the afternoon magruder and huger got up after night and jackson on the morning of the 1st after the battle of the 1st jackson magruder and huger were ordered in direct pursuit along the route of retreat my command by the longer route of ****** store jacksons column and mine met on the evening of the 3d near westover the enemys new position at the second manassas my command relieved the pressure against jackson he called on me for relief by a route that would have taken an hour or an hour and a half a way was found by which he was relieved in about thirty minutes when relieved he left the battle on my hands i was at sharpsburg all day jackson only about two and a half hours at fredericksburg anticipating the move against him half of my command was ordered to swing off from my right and join in his battle but general lees assertion seems to refer to the operations at gettysburg after jackson had found his happy home let us see how far this assertion is supported by events general lee reported when on the forenoon of the 2d he decided upon his plan the second corps was deployed in the immediate front of the enemys line on our left except two brigades sent off by general early one division of the third was close on the right of the second all within thirty minutes march of the enemys lines two divisions of the third corps and two of the first were on seminary ridge when the order was announced the divisions on seminary ridge had to find their positions and deploy to the right by the route ordered for the march it was five or six miles to the point at which the battle was to be opened the troops of the third had a shorter route the march of the first was made in time for prompt deployment on the right of the third we were left to our own resources in finding ground upon which to organize for battle the enemy had changed position somewhat after the march was ordered but as we were not informed of his position before the march we could not know of the change the confederate commander did not care to ride near us to give information of a change to assist in preparing for attack nor to inquire if new and better combinations might be made four brigades of the right of the third corps were assigned as part of my command the engagement was to be general my artillery combat was opened at three pm followed in half an hour by the infantry and i made progressive battle until sundown a division of the second corps attacked on our left at nightfall and later two brigades other parts of the second and third corps did not move to the battle on the 3d i was ordered to organize the column of assault the other corps to cooperate and assist the battle there was an affair on the confederate left before the assaulting columns were organized brought on by attack of the enemy the assaulting force marched at one pm its work has been described but it is important to note that neither of the other corps took part in the battle while the southern chief stood in view of the attack and near the rear of those corps so it looks as if the commander of the first corps was easier to move than any one in his army rather than harder and his chief left him to fight the battles alone after the retreat and when resting on the south banks of the rapidan reading of the progress of the march of general rosecranss army towards georgia it seemed sinful to lie there idle while our comrades in the west were so in need of assistance and i wrote the secretary of war suggesting that a detachment should be sent west from the idle army general lee objected but the suggestion was ordered to be executed in this instance the subordinate was easier to move than his chief though the interests of the cause depended largely on the movement of the latter the forces engaged at gettysburg were ******************** to the latest official accounts the army of northern virginia on the 31st of may numbered

when the road was open for the march of the first and a later hour of the morning before the second could follow pursuit was made by the enemy led by cavalry and the sixth corps and the rearguard had to deploy near fairfield to check it rain was helping us before the enemy could get through the mud and push his batteries over the ***** fields our trains had reached the mountain gorge and the rearguard was on the march following direct pursuit of the solid ranks was changed to march down the east of the mountains but the firmer broad road gave the confederates easier march kilpatrick got his cavalry in on the wagontrains and destroyed a number but did not delay the march of the column on this retreat the army already crippled of its pride was met by the *********** news of another defeat at vicksburg which meant that the mississippi was free to the federals from its source to the gulf diverting incidents occurred but we were in poor mood for them as we approached hagerstown two grotesque figures stepped into the road about a hundred yards in front of ***** a negro of six feet and a hundred and eighty pounds the other a white man of about five feet seven the negro was dressed in full uniform of the union infantry the white man in travelstained ********* drygoods the negro had a musket on his shoulder riding up to them it was observed that the musket was at the ********* the negro was reminded that it was ************* to have the gun at a cock but said that he wanted to be ready to save and deliver his prisoner to the guard it was his proudest capture during the march and he wanted credit for it the man was a recruit lately from abroad and did not seem to care whether or not he was with his comrades however there were doubts if he understood a word that was said the uniform was a tight fit and the shoes were evidently painful but the black man said that he could exchange them he was probably the only man of the army who had a proud story to take home the union cavalry came severely upon our left flank at hagerstown forcing stuart to call for infantry support parts of semmess and g t andersons brigades were sent crossed the antietam and had uncomfortable experience with the horse artillery near ********* they had dire complaints to make of the way cavalrymen put them in columns of fours against batteries when they could have advanced more rapidly and effectively in line of battle and saved half of their men lost halting for rest near falling waters a sudden alarm was brought down the road by a cavalryman riding at speed who reported all of the enemys cavalry on a sweeping ride against us the troops were thrown together to wait but the cavalry charge proved to be a ************ of lady refugees some of the cavalry did get over upon the trains parked at williamsport but there were many wounded near there who could handle their muskets many infantry up from winchester and some of imbodens cavalry besides some batteries who held the ground and stuart eventually got up when the enemy drew off on the 6th and 7th the commands were up and deployed their lines from falling waters to cover the bridge and ford at williamsport but the river was full past fording at williamsport and a raiding party from harpers ferry had partially destroyed the bridge at falling waters infantry trenches were made along the lines batteries were put in position and we were ready in a day or two to receive our successful adversary he found some mud along his route and was not up until the 12th when he appeared and spread his lines along the confederate front but positions were ********* had the longer outer curve while the confederates were on the concentrating inner lines he made his fieldworks and other arrangements had some reinforcements since his battle and was well organized on the forenoon of the 13th general lee sent for me and announced that the river was fordable and the bridge repaired that the trains would be started at once and the troops would follow when night could conceal the move the first and third corps were to cross by the bridge the second by the ford as the lines were comfortable the roads heavy it occurred to me that the hurried move during a single night would be troublesome suggestion was offered that the trains and wounded should move over during the night and give us easy march the next night but the waters on the other side were high and only enough mills running to supply food from day to day and the weather treacherous so the general thought it better to hurry on the march by the williamsport crossing over the firm broad turnpike was made without trouble the route to the bridge was over a new road at the ends of the bridge were green willow poles to prevent the wheels cutting through the mud but the soil underneath was wet and soggy under the long season of rain and before night rain again began to fall general lee worn by the strain of the past two weeks asked me to remain at the bridge and look to the work of the night and such a night is seldom experienced even in the rough life of the soldier the rain fell in showers sometimes in blinding sheets during the entire night the wagons cut deep in the mud during the early hours and began to ***** going down the hill and one or two of the batteries were stalled before they reached the bridge the best standing points were ankledeep in mud and the roads halfway to the knee ******** and getting worse we could only keep three or four torches alight and those were dimmed at times when heavy rains came then to crown our troubles a load of the wounded came down missed the end of the bridge and plunged the wagon into the raging torrent right at the end of the bridge the water was three feet deep and the current swift and surging it did not seem possible that a man could be saved but every one who could get through the mud and water rushed to their relief and providence was there to bring tears of joy to the sufferers the wagon was ******* and on the bridge and rolled off to virginias banks the ground under the poles became so ******* before daylight that they would bend under the wheels and feet of the animals until they could bend no farther and then would occasionally slip to one side far enough to spring up and catch a horses foot and throw him broadside in the ******* mud under the trials and vexations every one was exhausted of patience the general and staff were ready for a family quarrel as the only relief for their pentup trouble when daylight came and with it general lee to relieve and give us opportunity for a little repose the division of the third corps under general pettigrew formed the rear of the infantry line which was to be covered by fitzhugh lees cavalry but the cavalry brigadier rode off and crossed the river leaving it is said a squadron for the duty and the squadron followed the example of the brigadier the consequence was that when kilpatricks cavalry rode up it was taken to be the confederates ordered for their rearguard instead of friends however general pettigrew found a foe he was surprised by a dashing cavalry charge was wounded and died after a few days some artillery three standards of the virginia infantry and a large number of prisoners were taken general meade claimed two thousand general lee thought to occupy the gaps of the blue ridge by his cavalry and rest his army in the valley of virginia in threatening lines against washington city but found the shenandoah river full and past fording and before the tide began to recede general meade crossed the potomac east of the blue ridge and began to occupy the gaps which called for a southern march of the confederates on the 19th my command was ordered to millwood to secure if possible ashbys gap but as the enemys cavalry was on the opposite bank and the waters were too high for us to get over we marched on to manassas then for chester gap as high up as front royal the river was found past fording but part of a pontoon bridge was at hand general corse who had joined us hurried and succeeded in getting his brigade over in time to occupy chester gap and putting his regiment under colonel arthur herbert in the west end of manassas gap the balance of picketts men crossed by putting the arms and ammunition in the boats the men swimming and sent reinforcements to general corse and colonel herbert when the enemys cavalry withdrew one bridge was laid and ******* and the march southward was resumed the next day another demonstration was made by the enemys cavalry at manassas gap but hoods division was there and mclawss was at the chester gap where another heavy body of cavalry approached an effort was made to get behind the latter by hidden lines of march but the plan of catching cavalry with infantry was not successful though general wofford thought for a time that his trap was well laid the march was continued and the head of the column reached culpeper courthouse on the 24th bennings brigade left on guard at gainess crossroads till the third corps could relieve him was attacked by a strong cavalry force on the approach of the third corps he thought to organize with general a p hill another plan to entrap the cavalry in a thick wood but the riders found little difficulty in getting away general ewell was detained a little and found upon approaching front royal that general wrights brigade left there to hold the gaps for him was engaged in skirmishing with the enemys infantry he reinforced the brigade held the enemy back then changed his march west crossed the blue ridge at ********* gap and ordered earlys division that was not yet up through the valley by strasburg he reached madison courthouse on the 29th general meade got his army together near warrenton on the 31st of july and ordered a detachment of artillery cavalry and infantry across the rappahannock at kellys ford and the railroad bridge the command drove our cavalry back till it was reinforced by infantry when the enemy was pushed back beyond brandy station general ewell was called down from madison courthouse behind the rapidan and the first and third corps were marched into position behind the river on the 3d of august leaving the cavalry at culpeper courthouse general lee suffered during the campaign from his old trouble ******** and as soon as he found rest for his army applied to the authorities for a change of commanders the president refused pleading that he had no one to take his place at the time he had two generals of his own choosing who were not in authority adequate to their ********** e johnston the foremost soldier of the south who had commanded the army from its organization until he was wounded at seven pines and g t beauregard the hero of sumter and the first bull run well equipped and qualified for high command but the president was jealous of johnston and nourished prejudice against beauregard while the army was lying idle on the south bank of the rapidan my mind reverted to affairs in the west and especially to the progressive work of the union army in tennessee towards the northern borders of georgia other armies of the south were apparently spectators viewing those tremendous threatenings without thought of turning minds or forces to arrest the march of rosecrans to me the emergency seemed so grave that i decided to write the honorable secretary of war excusing the informality under the privilege given in his request in may expressing my opinion of affairs in that military zone i said that the successful march of general rosecranss army through georgia would virtually be the finishing stroke of the war that in the fall of vicksburg and the free flow of the mississippi river the lungs of the confederacy were lost that the impending march would cut through the heart of the south and leave but little time for the dissolution that to my mind the remedy was to order the army of northern virginia to defensive work and send detachments to reinforce the army in tennessee to call detachments of other commands to the same service and strike a crushing blow against general rosecrans before he could receive reinforcing help that our interior lines gave the opportunity and it was only by the skilful use of them that we could reasonably hope to ******** our power to that of the ************** adversary that the subject had not been mentioned to my commander because like all others he was opposed to having important detachments of his army so far beyond his reach that all must realize that our affairs were *********** and that the only hope of reviving the waning cause was through the advantage of interior lines a few days after the letter was despatched the subject happened up while discussing affairs with general lee when i felt warranted in expressing my views and relieving my mind of the serious apprehensions that haunted me he inquired if i was willing to go west and take charge there to that i consented provided the change could be so arranged as to give me an opportunity by careful handling of the troops before accepting battle to gain their confidence providing at the same time that means could be arranged for further aggressive march in case of success at that time the railway passing our camps on the rapidan through virginia and east tennessee to chattanooga was open and in good working order general braggs army was near chattanooga general buckners in east tennessee near knoxville general samuel joness army or parts of an army in southwest virginia there was but one *********** cincinnati via louisville and nashville to chattanooga on that road general rosecrans was marching against general bragg on the direct route to east tennessee over the cumberland mountains general burnside was moving into east tennessee against general buckners forces a few days after the conversation with general lee he was called down to richmond in the course of a week he wrote viz general lee next wrote to inquire as to the time necessary for the movement of my corps into tennessee as there were but two divisions mclawss and hoods and alexanders batteries two days was supposed to be ample time the transportation was ordered by the quartermasters department at richmond and the divisions were made ready to board the trains as soon as they could reach us the success of the plan was thought from the first to depend upon its prompt and vigorous execution and it was under those conditions that general lee agreed to reinforce the army in tennessee together with the assurance that vigorous pursuit even to the ohio river should follow success the onward march was repeatedly urged not only in return for the use of part of the army but to relieve general lee of apprehension from the army in front of him but it was not until the 9th of september that the first train came to orange courthouse to start with its load of troops meanwhile general buckner had left his post in east tennessee and marched south to draw nearer the army under general bragg about chattanooga leaving nothing of his command in east tennessee except two thousand men at cumberland gap under general ****** partially fortified general burnside had crossed the mountains and was not only in east tennessee but on that very day general ****** surrendered to him his command at cumberland gap without a fight these facts were known to the richmond authorities at the time of our movements but not to general lee or myself until the move was so far advanced as to prevent recall so that we were obliged to make the circuit through the carolinas to augusta georgia and up by the railroad thence through atlanta to dalton and ringgold it was the only route of transit left us there were two routes between richmond and augusta one via wilmington the other through charlotte north carolina but only a single track from augusta to chattanooga the ****** of the roads were not uniform nor did the roads connect at the cities except by ***** and other such *********** the roads had not been heavily worked before the war so that their rolling stock was light and limited instead of two days of moving it was not until the 25th that our artillery joined us near chattanooga hoods division was first shipped and three brigades or the greater part of three were landed at the railroad station and joined general braggs army on the 18th and 19th of september but that army had been ******** and flanked out of chattanooga buckners out of east tennessee and both were together down below the borders of georgia as i left general lees tent after bidding him goodby he walked out with me to my horse as my foot was in the stirrup he said again now general you must beat those people out in the west withdrawing my foot to respectful position i promised if i live but i would not give a single man of my command for a fruitless victory he promised again that it should be so said that arrangements had been made that any success that we had would be followed that orders to that effect had been given that transportation was also ordered to be prepared and the orders would be repeated while the troops were in transit jenkinss south carolina brigade was transferred to hoods division so that we had two south carolina and four georgia brigades of the two divisions which gave us some little trouble in keeping our men on the cars passing by their homes the people crowded every station to give us their all in most acceptable rations and to cheer us with wishes for a happy issue the train upon which i rode reached ******* about two oclock of the afternoon of the 19th of september that upon which our horses were came up at four oclock only part of the staff of the corps was with me and general alexander was with his batteries far away in south carolina as soon as our horses could be saddled we started ****************** sorrel and manning and myself to find the headquarters of the commanding general we were told to follow the main road and did so though there were many men coming into that road from our right bearing the wounded of the days battle the firing was still heard off to the right and wagons were going and coming indicating our ******** to the field nothing else occurring to suggest a change of the directions given us we followed the main road it was a bright moonlight night and the woodlands on the sides of the broad highway were quite open so that we could see and be seen after a time we were challenged by an outlying guard who comes there we answered friends the answer was not altogether satisfying to the guard and after a very short parley we asked what troops they were when the answer gave the number of the brigade and of the division as southern brigades were called for their commanders more than by their numbers we concluded that these friends were the enemy there were too some suspicious obstructions across the road in front of us and altogether the situation did not look inviting the moon was so bright that it did not seem prudent to turn and ride back under the fire that we knew would be opened on us so i said loudly so that the guard could hear let us ride down a little way to find a better crossing riding a few rods brought us under cover and protection of large trees sufficiently shading our retreat to enable us to ride quietly to the rear and take the road over which we had seen so many men and vehicles passing while on our first ride we reached general braggs headquarters at eleven oclock reported and received orders which he had previously given other commanders for attack early in the morning our bivouac was made near the general headquarters and we rode at daylight to find the troops hoods brigades that had arrived before us had been at work with the left of the army which was assigned as my command lieutenantgeneral polk was commanding the right wing two brigades of mclawss division kershaws and humphreyss came in the afternoon and marched during the night and across the chickamauga river the army had forced its way across the chickamauga under severe skirmishes little less than a battle during the greater part of the 19th and some of the commands had been engaged on the 18th working on the same plan the written order giving the plan was issued on the 18th in general terms it was to cross the chickamauga strike the enemys left and roll it back on his right by a wheel to the left so as to come in between the enemy and chattanooga the work had been so persistent and ********* during part of the 18th and all of the 19th that general rosecrans came to understand the plan as well as his adversary and to arrange accordingly with my instructions for the 20th the commanding general gave me a map showing prominent topographical features of the grounds from the chickamauga river to mission ridge and beyond to the lookout mountain range at early dawn i found the left wing it was composed of buckners corps stewarts and prestons divisions a new division under general bushrod r johnson the division of general t c hindman and three of hoods brigades buckners corps had been cut in two his division on the right of the left wing was under general stewart while prestons division on the extreme left on the bank of the chickamauga was assigned by the order for battle as the pivot upon which the battle should wheel the commands stood stewarts johnsons hindmans and prestons divisions hoods brigades in rear of johnsons line general buckner reported his artillery as amounting to about thirty guns three batteries were reported of four guns each with hindmans division johnsons and hoods commands being without artillery the brigades of kershaw and humphreys were ordered with hoods to be used as a column of assault by brigades at a hundred paces interval as the battle was ordered for daylight it seemed too late to draw buckners divisions into ********** relations and we had yet to find the right wing as it was not in touch or sight general stewart was ordered to find it he marched about half a mile to his right and found that he was nearly half a mile in advance of the right wing his move made place for hoods column which was called to the line and general stewart broke his right to rear to guard that flank until the right wing could get to the front the divisions were formed in two lines two brigades on the front line others of the second line in support except hoods five brigades in column general mclaws and two of his brigades two of hoods and alexanders artillery were on the rails ******** for the battle as fast as steam could carry them but failed to reach it when organized for battle the left wing stood about three

the purpose of the commander in ordering the wheel on the left as pivot was to push in from the start between the enemy and his new base at chattanooga no chief of artillery for the command reported and a brief search failed to find one the field so far as it could be surveyed however was not a field proper but a heavy woodland not adapted to the practice of artillery the hour of battle was at hand but the right wing was not yet organized some of the troops were without rations their wagons having lost the lines of march through the woodlands failing to reach them until after daylight when

recover his lost ground and cut the enemys line of supplies the commanders of the armies were on the field early on the 20th the failure of the opening of the confederates at daylight gave opportunity

have it go in before answer came general stewart commanding my right division received a message from general bragg to go in and attack by his division and reported that the confederate commander had sent similar orders to all division commanders he advanced and by his severe battle caused the union reserve division under general ******* to be drawn to the support of that front and this attack with that of the divisions of our right against those of baird johnson palmer and reynolds so disturbed general thomas that other reinforcements were called to support his defence general stewart was in hot engagement before word reached me that the battle had been put in the hands of division commanders but my orders reached general hood in time to hold him and commanders on his left before he received notice from the commanding general and the brigades of kershaw and humphreys were ordered nearer the rear of his column the divisions of b r johnson and hindman were ordered to follow in

to take and pursue the assault the divisions of b r johnson and hindman were pressed hard on hoods left and the brigades of kershaw and humphreys closed to his support when a bold push gave us the first line of the enemy and a large number of his guns but general hood was fearfully wounded supposed to be fatally general benning of his rock brigade lost his horse and thought general hood was killed he cut a horse loose from a captured gun mounted and using part of a rope trace as his riding whip rode to meet me and report disaster he had lost his hat in the mle and the brigade disappeared under the steady crushing fire so quickly that he was a little surprised he reported general hood killed my horse killed my brigade torn to pieces and i havent a man left i asked if he didnt think he could find one man the question or the manner seemed to quiet somewhat his apprehensions and brought affirmative answer when he was told to collect his men and join us at the front that we had broken

on our right and the brigades of kershaw and humphreys then on the quick step would be with us in a minute and help restore the battle to good organization just then these two brigades burst through the brush in cheerful gallant march and brought him back to his usual courageous hopeful confidence as we approached a second line johnsons division happened to strike it while in the act of changing position of some of the troops charged upon and carried it capturing some artillery hoods and hindmans troops pressing in close connection this attack forced the parts of the twentieth and twentyfirst

buckners pivotal division under general preston but general buckner objected to having his left in the air presently a discouraging account came from general hindman that in the progress of his battle his left and rear had been struck by a formidable force of cavalry that ********** brigade was forced back in disorder and his other brigades exposed on their open left could not be handled i wrote him a note commending the brave work of his division and encouraging renewed efforts urged him to have his brigades in hand and bring them around to close connection on johnsons left on the most open parts of the confederate side of the field ones vision could not reach farther than the length of a brigade triggs brigade was ordered to the relief of ********** which had been forced back to the lafayette road and the balance of prestons division was ordered to follow if necessary to support that part of the field and our cavalry far away from my left was called to clean it up and pursue the retreating columns it seems that wilders brigade of mounted infantry had struck ********** left and put it back in disorder and a brigade or part of a brigade of cavalry coming against the rear increased the confusion and drove it back to the lafayette road when triggs brigade advanced to its relief the two put the attacking forces back until they found it necessary to retire beyond the ridge and cover the withdrawal of trains left exposed by the retreat of troops of the twentieth and twentyfirst corps general hindman gathered his forces and marched for the left of johnsons division and prestons brigade under general ***** was returned to the point of its first holding our front cleared of opposing forces was soon changed forward and formed at right angle to its first line to seek the enemys line standing against our right wing calls were repeated for the cavalry to ride in pursuit of the retreating forces and guard the gaps of the ridge behind the enemy standing in front of our right wing in the new position of the left wing its extreme left encountered the enemy rallying in strong position that was heavily manned by field batteries at the same time my left was approaching the line of fire of one of our batteries of the right wing general johnson thought that he had the key of the battle near snodgrass hill it was a key but a rough one he was ordered to reorganize his own brigades and those of hindmans division for renewed work to advance a line of skirmishers and give time to the troops for refreshment while i rode along the line to observe the enemy and find relations with our right wing it was after one oclock and the hot and dry and dusty day made work fatiguing my lunch was called up and ordered spread at some convenient point while i rode with general buckner and the staffs to view the changed conditions of the battle i could see but little of the enemys line and only knew of it by the occasional exchange of fire between the lines of skirmishers until we approached the angle of the lines i passed the right of our skirmishers and thinking i had passed the enemys rode forward to be accurately assured when i suddenly found myself under near fire of his sharpshooters concealed behind the trees and under the brush i saw enough however to mark the ground line of his fieldworks as they were spread along the front of the right wing and found that i was very fortunate in having the forest to cover the ride back until out of reach of their fire in the absence of a chief of artillery general buckner was asked to establish a ********* battery on my right to enfilade the enemys works and line standing before our right wing and then i rode away to enjoy my spread of nassau bacon and georgia sweet potatoes we were not accustomed to potatoes of any kind in virginia and thought we had a luxury but it was very dry as the river was a mile and more from us and other ******* were over the border then before we had half finished our pleasures were interrupted by a fragment of shell that came tearing through the woods passed through a book in the hands of a courier who sat on his horse hard by reading and struck down our chief of ordnance colonel p t manning gasping as was supposed in the struggles of death friends sprang forward to look for the wound and to give some aid and relief in his hurry to enjoy and finish his lunch he had just taken a large bite of sweet potato which seemed to be suffocating him i suggested that it would be well to first relieve him of the potato and give him a chance to breathe this done he revived his breath came freer and he was soon on his feet ready to be conveyed to the hospital in a few days he was again on duty after caring for and sending him off and before we were through with our lunch general bragg sent for me he was some little distance in rear of our new position the change of the order of battle was explained and the necessity under which it came to be made we had taken some thirty or more *********** and a large number of smallarms and thought that we had cut off and put to disorder the twentieth and twentyfirst corps that had retreated through the pass of the ridge by the dry valley road he was informed of orders given general johnson for my left and general buckner for a battery on the right i then offered as suggestion of the way to finish our work that he abandon the plan for battle by our right wing or hold it to defence draw off a force from that front that had rested since the left wing took up the battle join them with the left wing move swiftly down the dry valley road pursue the retreating forces occupy the gaps of the ridge behind the enemy standing before our right and call that force to its own relief he was disturbed by the failure of his plan and the severe repulse of his right wing and was little prepared to hear suggestions from subordinates for other moves or progressive work his words as i recall them were there is not a man in the right wing who has any fight in him from accounts of his former operations i was prepared for halting work but this when the battle was at its tide and in partial success was a little surprising his humor however was such that his subordinate was at a loss for a ********* of the discussion he did not wait nor did he express approval or disapproval of the operations of the left wing but rode for his headquarters at reeds bridge there was nothing for the left wing to do but work along as best it could the right wing ceased its active battle as the left forced the enemys right centre and the account of the commanding general was such as to give little hope of his active use of it in supporting us after his lunch general johnson was ordered to make ready his own and hindmans brigades to see that those of hoods were in just connection with his right and await the opening of our battery prestons division was pulled away from its ******* on the river bank to reinforce our worn battle the battery not opening as promptly as expected general johnson was finally ordered into strong steady battle he pushed through part of the woodland drove back an array of artillery and the supporting infantry and gained other elevated ground the sound of battle in his rear its fire drawing nearer had attracted the attention of general granger of the reserve corps and warned him that it was the opportunity for his command he marched without orders towards the noise and passed by the front of ******** cavalry and the front of our right wing but no report of his march was sent us day was on the **** night was advancing the sun dipped to the ********* of lookout mountain when lieutenantcolonel ********* reported that the cavalry was not riding in response to my calls he was asked to repeat the order in writing and despatched as follows then our ********** reported that there was nothing on the road taken by the enemys retreating columns but squads of footmen another written order for the cavalry was despatched at ### general preston reinforced us by his brigade under ****** pushed beyond our battle and gained a height and intervening dell before snodgrass hill but the enemys reserve was on the hill and full of fight even to the aggressive we were pushed back through the valley and up the slope until general preston succeeded in getting his brigade under ***** to the support our battery got up at last under major williams and opened its destructive fire from eleven guns which presently convinced general thomas that his position was no longer ******* he drew reynoldss division from its trenches near the angle for assignment as rearguard lieutenantcolonel sorrel of the staff reported this move and was sent with orders to general stewart to strike down against the enemys moving forces it seems that at the same time liddells division of the extreme right of our right wing was ordered against the march of the reserves stewart got into part of reynoldss line and took several hundred prisoners meanwhile reynolds was used in meeting the attack and driving back the division of general ******* that accomplished he was ordered to position to cover the retreat as no reports came to the left from the commanding general or from the right wing the repulse of liddells division was thought to indicate the strong holding of the enemy along his intrenched front line and i thought that we should wait to finish the battle on the morrow the direct road to chattanooga was practically closed mcfarland gap the only ****** was supposed to be occupied by the cavalry another blind road was at the base of the mountain on its east side during the artillery practice the fire of some of the guns of our battery was turned to the contest at snodgrass hill which disturbed part of our infantry fiercely struggling for that ground and they complained but the fire was effective as the woods were full of the enemy a shot would find a mark the intrenched line was crumbling faster than we supposed and their reserve was engaged in hot defensive battle to hold secure the gap while yet there were two hours of daylight had the four brigades of cheathams division that had not been in action gone in at the same time as liddells division it is hardly possible that the confederate commander could have failed to find the enemys empty lines along the front of his right wing and called both wings into a grand final sweep of the field to the capture of thomass command but he was not present and the condition of affairs was embarrassing to the subordinate commanders a reconnoissance made just before the first strokes of the morning engagement discovered an open way around the enemys left by turning his intrenched line in reverse which general hill thought to utilize by change of tactics but general bragg present and advised of the opportunity preferred his tactics and urged prompt execution at the later hour when liddells division was passed beyond the enemys intrenchments to strike at his reinforcing march under general granger the subordinate of the right wing could not see how he was to be justified in using a greater force in that direction affairs of the wing being similar to those of the opening while the relations of the right and left were in reverse of tactical orders but a vigilant chief present and caring for the weaker part of his battle advised that the enemy was on his last legs with his reserves could well have sprung the right wing into the opening beyond his right securing crushing results earlier in the afternoon he did send an order for renewed efforts of the right wing under his plan of parallel assault but the troops had tested the lines in their first battle and were not in condition for a third effort at parallel battle the contention by our left wing was maintained as a separate and independent battle the last of my reserve triggs brigade gave us new strength and preston gained snodgrass hill the trampled ground and bushy woods were left to those who were too much worn to escape the rapid strides of the heroic confederates the left wing swept forward and the right sprang to the broad chattanooga highway like magic the union army had melted away in our presence a few hundred prisoners were picked up by both wings as they met to burst their throats in loud ****** the army of tennessee knew how to enjoy its first grand victory the dews of twilight hung heavy about the trees as if to hold down the voice of victory but the two lines nearing as they advanced joined their continuous shouts in increasing volume not as the ********* from the cannons mouth but in a tremendous swell of heroic harmony that seemed almost to lift from their roots the great trees of the forest before greetings and congratulations upon the success had passed it was night and the mild beams of the quartering moon were more suggestive of venus than of mars the haversacks and ammunition supplies were ordered replenished and the confederate army made its bivouac on the ground it had gained in the first pronounced victory in the west and one of the most stubbornly contested battles of the war our cavalry had failed to close mcfarland gap and through that general thomas made his march for the stand at rossville gap it has been stated that this retreat was made under the orders of the union commander general thomas did in fact receive a message from his chief a little after four oclock saying that he was riding to chattanooga to view the position there that he general thomas was left in command of all of the organized forces and should seek strong and threatening position at rossville and send the other men back to chattanooga to be reorganized this was a suggestion more than an order given under the conviction that the confederates having the dry valley road would pass the ridge to the west side cut general thomas off and strike his rear at pleasure the order to command of the troops in action and the conditions referring to duties at chattanooga carried *********** discretion that general thomas so construed it was evidenced by his decision to hold until nightfall if possible but directly under the practice of our enfilading battery he became convinced that it was not possible changed his purpose and at ### gave orders for his commanders to prepare to retire and called reynoldss division from its trenches to be posted as rearguard to cover the retreat general granger was then engaged in severe contention against my left at snodgrass hill his march along the front of our cavalry and right wing suggested the advance of liddells division to the chattanooga road to try to check it the withdrawal of reynoldss division was in season to aid in driving liddells division back to its former ground reynolds was posted on eminent ground as rearguard and organized retreat followed it was not until after sunset that rosecranss order for retreat was issued as appears from the letter written from rossville by general james a ******** chief of staff dated ### three hours and more after the move was taken up viz so events and the evidence seem conclusive that it was our artillery practice that made the confusion of chickamauga forests unbearable and enforced retreat before rosecrans order was issued the union army and reserve had been fought and by united efforts we held the position at snodgrass hill which covered mcfarland gap and the retreat there were yet five brigades of confederates that had not been in active battle the confederate commander was not present and his next in rank thought night pursuit without authority a heavy unprofitable labor while a flank move after a nights rest seemed promising of more important results the confederate chief did not even know of his victory until the morning of the 21st when upon riding to his extreme right he found his commander at that point seeking the enemy in his immediate front and commended the officer upon his *************** hours after the retreat of the enemys forces the exceeding ********* of these losses will be better understood and the desperate and bloody character of the chickamauga battle more fully appreciated upon a little analysis the battle viewed from the standpoint of the union losses was the fifth greatest of the war gettysburg spottsylvania the wilderness and chancellorsville alone exceeding it but each of these battles were of much longer time viewed by comparison of confederate losses chickamauga occupies similar ************ the scale of magnitude among the battles of the war but the sanguinary nature of the contention is best illustrated by a simple suggestion of proportions official reports show that on both sides the **************** wounded and *************** the enormous proportion of thirtythree per cent of the troops actually engaged on the union side there were over a score of regiments in which the losses in this single fight exceeded ### per cent which was the heaviest loss sustained by a german regiment at any time during the ************ war the charge of the light brigade at balaklava has been made famous in song and history yet there were thirty union regiments that each lost ten per cent more men at chickamauga and many confederate regiments whose ********* exceeded this longstreets command in less than two hours lost nearly fortyfour per cent of its strength and of the troops opposed to a portion of their splendid assaults ********* and ******** commands lost respectively fortynine and thirtyeight in less than four hours and single regiments a far heavier percentage these are only a few of the cases in which it was possible to ******* *********** of casualties the number of effectives taken into battle not having been mentioned but they serve to illustrate the sanguinary severity of the fight and the heroism of the troops about sunrise of the next morning general bragg rode to my bivouac when report was made to him of orders of the night before to replenish supplies and prepare to take up pursuit at daylight he asked my views of the next step to be taken explaining that there were some defensive works about chattanooga to cover the enemy in that position i knew nothing of the country except of its general geographical features but the hunt was up and on the go when any move towards his rear was safe and a speedy one encouraging of great results i suggested that we cross the tennessee river north of chattanooga and march against the line of the enemys rear that if after so threatening as to throw general rosecrans to full retreat we found it inconvenient to pursue him we turn back with part of the army and capture or disperse the union army in east tennessee under general burnside he stated that he would follow that course ordered the right wing to march and the left wing to follow as soon as the way was ******** left to care for the dead and wounded during the wait as it was night when the rear of the right wing stretched out on the road my march was not taken up until the morning of the 22d general mclaws joined me on the 21st with his other brigades and general jenkins joined hoods division afterwards g t andersons brigade joined the latter when our march reached general braggs headquarters and reported on the 22d he gave me orders to direct a division from the line of march to follow the enemy towards chattanooga when asked if he had abandoned the course upon which his march was ordered he said the people would be greatly gratified to know that his army was marching through the streets of chattanooga with bands of music and salutations of the soldiers i thought and did not fail to say that it would give them greater pleasure to know that he had passed the tennessee river turned the enemy out of chattanooga in eager flight to save his rearward lines whilst we marched hammering against the broken flanks of his columns but the cavalry had reported that the enemy was in hurried and confused retreat his trains crossing the river and passing over the nose of lookout mountain in disorder the praise of the inhabitants of a city so recently abandoned to the enemy and a parade through its streets with bands of music and flaunting banners were more alluring to a spirit eager for applause than was the tedious march for fruition of our heavy labors general rosecrans prepared no doubt to continue his retreat anticipating our march towards his rear but finding that we preferred to lay our lines in front of him concluded that it would be more comfortable to rest at chattanooga reinforce repair damages and come to meet us when ready for a new trial when general bragg found that the enemy had changed his mind and was not inclined to continue his rearward march he stretched his army in a semicircle of six miles along the southeast front of chattanooga from the base of lookout mountain on his left to his right resting on the tennessee river and ordered alexanders batteries to the top of the mountain my command mclawss hoods and walkers divisions occupying the left of his line of investment his plan was to shell the enemy from his works by field batteries but the works grew stronger from day to day on all sides of the city our infantry was posted along the line as supports for the batteries with orders not to assault unless especially ordered the northern point of lookout mountain upon which alexanders batteries were posted ***** upon the tennessee river the city lies east of the ******** and nestles close under it the base of the mountain has a steep rugged grade of five hundred feet above the plateau and from its height the mountain crops out into ********* of seven hundred feet general alexander managed to drop an occasional shell or shot about the enemys lines by lifting the ****** of his guns but the fire of other batteries was not effective at the end of a weeks practice the confederate commander found the enemy getting more comfortable in his works and thought to break him up by a grand cavalry raid on the 30th he ordered general wheeler to organize a force of his effective mounts cross the river and ride against the railway and such depots and ************ as he could reach the cavalry destroyed some wagontrains and supplies and gave the enemy more trouble than the artillery practice yet failed to convince him that it was time to abandon his position but on the contrary satisfied him that he was safe from further serious trouble at that time the shortest line of the enemys haul of provisions from the depot at ********* was along the road on the north bank of the river the confederate chief conceived as our cavalry ride had failed of effect that a line of sharpshooters along the river on our side could break up that line of travel and ordered on the 8th of october a detail from my command for that purpose as the line was over the mountain about seven miles beyond support by a rugged road not practicable for artillery i ordered a brigade of infantry detailed to go over and protect the sharpshooters from surprise or capture the detail fell upon laws brigade the line for this practice extended from the east side of lookout creek some ten miles down the river the effect of the fire was about like that of the cavalry raid it simply put the enemy on shorter rations until he could open another route for his trains but more to be deplored than these novel modes of investment was the condition of the confederate army after moving from virginia to try to relieve our comrades of the army of tennessee we thought that we had cause to complain that the fruits of our labor had been lost but it soon became manifest that the superior officers of that army themselves felt as much aggrieved as we at the halting policy of their chief and were calling in letters and petitions for his removal a number of them came to have me write the president for them as he had not called for my opinion on military affairs since the johnston conference of 1862 i could not take that liberty but promised to write to the secretary of war and to general lee who i thought could excuse me under the strained condition of affairs about the same time they framed and forwarded to the president a petition praying for relief it was written by general d h hill as he informed me since the war while the superior officers were asking for relief the confederate commander was busy looking along his lines for victims lieutenantgeneral polk was put under charges for failing to open the battle of the 20th at daylight majorgeneral hindman was relieved under charges for conduct before the battle when his conduct of the battle with other commanders would have relieved him of any previous ********** according to the customs of war and pursuit of others was getting warm on the union side the washington authorities thought vindication important and majorgenerals ****** and crittenden of the twentieth and twentyfirst corps were relieved and went before a court of inquiry also one of the generals of division of the fourteenth corps the president came to us on the 9th of october and called the commanders of the army to meet him at general braggs office after some talk in the presence of general bragg he made known the object of the call and asked the generals in turn their opinion of their commanding officer beginning with myself it seemed rather a stretch of authority even with a president and i gave an ******* answer and made an effort to turn the channel of thought but he would not be satisfied and got back to his question the condition of the army was briefly referred to and the failure to make an effort to get the fruits of our success when the opinion was given in substance that our commander could be of greater service elsewhere than at the head of the army of tennessee majorgeneral buckner was called and gave opinion somewhat similar so did majorgeneral ******** who was then commanding the corps recently commanded by lieutenantgeneral polk and general d h hill who was called last agreed with emphasis to the views expressed by others the next morning the president called me to private conference and had an all day talk he thought to assign me to command but the time had passed for handling that army as an independent force regarding this question as considered in virginia it was understood that the assignment would be made at once and in time for opportunity to handle the army sufficiently to gain the confidence of the officers and soldiers before offering or accepting battle the action was not taken a battle had been made and won the army was then seriously entangled in a quasi siege the officers and soldiers were disappointed and disaffected in morale general grant was moving his army to reinforce against us and an important part of the union army of virginia was moving to the same purpose in my judgment our last opportunity was lost when we failed to follow the success at chickamauga and capture or disperse the union army and it could not be just to the service or myself to call me to a position of such responsibility the army was part of general joseph e johnstons department and could only be used in strong organization by him in combining its operations with his other forces in alabama and mississippi i said that under him i could cheerfully work in any position the suggestion of that name only served to increase his displeasure and his severe rebuke i recognized the authority of his high position but called to his mind that neither his words nor his manner were so impressive as the dissolving scenes that foreshadowed the dreadful end he referred to his worry and troubles with politicians and noncombatants in that connection i suggested that all that the people asked for was success with that the talk of politicians would be as ******* **** before him and when restored to his usual gracious calm i asked to have my resignation accepted to make place for some one who could better meet his ideas of the important service he objected that my troops would not be satisfied with the change i suggested a leave of absence as winter was near when i would go to the transmississippi department and after the troops were accustomed to their new commander send in my written resignation from texas but he was not minded to accept that solution of the premises finally i asked his aid in putting the divisions that were with me in more efficient working order by assigning a majorgeneral to command hoods division he had been so seriously crippled that he could not be in condition to take the field again even if he recovered and a commander for the division was essential to its proper service as he had no one or failed to name any one for the place i suggested the promotion of the senior brigadier then in command of it general m jenkins who was a bright gallant and efficient officer of more than two years experience in active warfare loved by his troops and all acquaintances as well he had been transferred recently by the war department to the division upon application of general hood and in consequence there was some feeling of rivalry between him and brigadiergeneral law the next in rank who had served with the division since its organization and had commanded it at gettysburg after general hood was wounded and after his taking off in the battle of chickamauga the president referred to the services of general law with the division but failed to indicate a preference i thought it unwise and not military to choose a junior for assignment to command over his senior officers and prejudicial to the ****** de corps and morale of any army except under most eminent services and in this instance where service high military character and equipment were on the side of the senior it was more objectionable but consented that it would be better to have general law promoted and the feeling of rivalry put at rest general jenkinss heart was in the service and could submit to anything that seemed best for its interests but the president was pleased to remain negative and failed to assign a commander the interview was exciting at times warm but continued until lookout mountain lifted above the sun to excuse my taking leave the president walked as far as the gate gave his hand in his usual warm grasp and dismissed me with his gracious smile but a bitter look lurking about its margin and the *********** admonished me that clouds were gathering about headquarters of the first corps even faster than those that told the doom of the southern cause a day or two after this interview the president called the commanders to meet him again at general braggs headquarters he expressed desire to have the army pulled away from the lines around chattanooga and put to active work in the field and called for suggestions and plans by which that could be done directing his appeal apparently to me as first to reply i suggested a change of base to rome georgia a march of the army to the railway bridge of the tennessee river at bridgeport and the crossing of the river as an easy ******* that would cut the enemys rearward line interrupt his supply train put us between his army at chattanooga and the reinforcements moving to join him and force him to precipitate battle or retreat general bragg proposed that we march up and cross the river and swing around towards the enemys rear and force him out by that means no other plans were offered nor did other officers express preference for either of the plans that were submitted maps were called for and demonstrations given of the two plans when the president ordered the move to be made by the change of base to rome and in a day or two took leave of us he had brought general pemberton with him to assign to the corps left by general polk but changed his mind general d h hill was relieved of duty after a time general buckner took a leave of absence and general hardee relieved general ******** of command of the corps left to him by general polk about this time general lee wrote me alluding to the presence of the president the questions under consideration my proposition for him to leave the army in virginia in other hands and come west to grander more important fields to his purpose in sending me west to be assigned to command them and expressing anticipation of my return to virginia the president left the army more despondent than he found it general pembertons misfortune at vicksburg gave rise to severe prejudice of the people and the army and when the troops heard of the purpose of the president to assign him to command of ***** corps parts of the army were so near to mutiny that he concluded to call general hardee to that command a few days after he left us a severe season of rain set in and our commander used the muddy roads to excuse his failure to execute the campaign that the president had ordered late on the 20th of september and during the 21st general rosecrans reported his condition deplorable and expressed doubt of his holding at chattanooga and called to general burnside in east tennessee to whom he looked for aid but finding only feeble efforts to follow our success he recovered hope prepared defensive works and was looking to renewal of his aggressive work when he was relieved from accounts made public since the war it appears that his animals were so reduced from want of forage at the time of the october rains that general rosecrans could not move his artillery over the muddy roads which suggests mention that the campaign ordered by the president for the change of base could have forced him from his works in his crippled condition and given us comfortable operations between him and his reinforcements coming from virginia and mississippi in his official account general bragg said that the road on the south side was left under my command which is misleading my ************ ************ on his line of investment east of the city and of the mountain the road was west of the mountain from six to twenty miles from the command we were in support of his batteries to be ready for action at the moment his artillery practice called for it we held nearly as much of his line as the other eight divisions none of the commanders had authority to move a man from the lines until the 8th of october when he gave orders for posting the sharpshooters west of the mountain the exposure of this detachment was so serious that i took the liberty to send a brigade as a rallying force for it and the exposure of these led me to inquire as to the assistance they could have from our cavalry force operating on the line from the mountain to bridgeport some eight or ten miles behind them the cavalry was not found as watchful as the eyes of an army should be and i reported them to the general but he thought otherwise assured me that his reports were regular daily and sometimes oftener nevertheless prudence suggested more careful guard and i ordered captain manning who brought from virginia part of my signal force to establish a station in observation of bridgeport and open its communication with my headquarters general bragg denied all reports sent him of the enemy from my signal party treated them with contempt then reported that the road was under my command his report is remarkable in that he failed to notice the conduct of his officers except of the killed and wounded and one division commander whom he found at daylight of the 21st advancing his line of skirmishers in careful search of the enemy who had retreated at early twilight the evening before under shouts from the confederate army that made the heavy wood *********** with resounding shouts of victory that officer he commended as the ever vigilant he gave due credit to his brave soldiers for their gallant execution of his orders to charge and continue to charge against the enemys *********** as he knew that they would under his orders until their efforts were successful but the conduct of the battle in all of its phases ********** this claim when the right wing of his army stepped into the ****************** road the enemys forces were in full retreat through mcfarland gap and all fighting and charging had ceased except the parting blows of prestons division with ******** reserve corps a peculiar feature of the battle was the early ride of both commanders from the field leaving the battle to their troops general rosecrans was generous enough to acknowledge that he left his battle in other hands general bragg claimed everything for himself failing to mention that other hands were there while general rosecrans was opening a route beyond reach of our sharpshooters his chief engineer general w f smith was busy upon a plan for opening the line of railway on the south side and his first step was to break up the line of sharpshooters on the 19th he made a survey of the river below chattanooga on the same day general rosecrans was superseded in command by general george h thomas a day or two after that my signal party reported some stir about the enemys camps near bridgeport and the cavalry reported a working force at ******** cave the cavalry was put under my orders for a reconnoissance and i was ordered to send a brigade of infantry scouting for the working party nothing was found at the cave or by the reconnoissance and the cavalry objected to my authority on the 25th orders came to me to hold the mountain by a brigade of infantry after ordering the brigade i reported a division necessary to make possession secure suggesting that the enemys best move was from bridgeport and along the mountain crest that we should assume that he would be wise enough to adopt it unless we prepared against it but our commander was disturbed by suggestions from subordinates and thought them presumptuous when they ventured to report of the probable movements of the enemy on the night of the 27th of october general smith moved to the execution of his plan against our line of sharpshooters he put fifty ************ and two flatboats in the river at chattanooga the former to take twentyfive men each the latter from forty to ************** boats to float quietly down the river eight miles to browns ferry cross and land the troops at the same time a sufficient force was to march by the highway to the same point to be in readiness for the boats to carry them over to their comrades the sharpshooters had been posted for the sole purpose of breaking up the haul along the other bank and not with a view of defending the line nor was it defensible while the enemy had every convenience for making a forced crossing and lodgement the vigilant foe knew his opportunity and only waited for its timely execution it is needless to say that general smith had little trouble in establishing his point he manned his boats floated them down to the crossing landed his men and soon had the boats cross back for his other men pushed them over and put them at work intrenching the strong ground selected for their holding by daylight he was comfortably intrenched and had his artillery on the other side in position to sweep along the front the confederate commander did not think well enough of his line when he had it to prepare to hold it but when he found that the enemy proposed to use it he thought to order his infantry down to recover the ground just demonstrated as indefensible and ordered me to meet him on the mountain next morning to learn his plans and receive his instructions for the work that afternoon the signal party reported the enemy advancing from bridgeport in ************** and infantry this despatch was forwarded to headquarters but was *********** it was repeated about dark and again forwarded and denied on the morning of the 28th i reported as ordered the general complained of my party sending up false alarms the only answer that i could make was that they had been about two years in that service and had not made such mistakes before while laying his plans sitting on the point of lookout rock the enemy threw some shells at us and succeeded in bursting one about two hundred feet below us that ******* the general a little and he ordered alexander to drop some of his shells about their heads as this little practice went on a despatch messenger came bursting through the brushwood asking for general longstreet and reported the enemy marching from bridgeport along the base of the ***************** and infantry general bragg denied the report and rebuked the soldier for sensational alarms but the soldier said general if you will ride to a point on the west side of the mountain i will show them to you we rode and saw the eleventh and twelfth corps under general hooker from the army of the potomac marching quietly along the valley towards browns ferry the general was surprised so was i but my surprise was that he did not march along the mountain top instead of the valley it could have been occupied with as little loss as he afterwards had and less danger he had marched by our line of cavalry without their knowing and general bragg had but a brigade of infantry to meet him if he had chosen to march down along the top of the mountain and that was posted twenty miles from support my estimate of the force was five thousand general bragg thought it not so strong and appearance from the elevation seemed to justify his estimate presently the rearguard came in sight and made its bivouac immediately in front of the point upon which we stood the latter force was estimated at fifteen hundred and halted about three miles in rear of the main body a plan was laid to capture the rearguard by night attack he proposed to send me mclawss and jenkinss divisions for the work and ordered that it should be done in time for the divisions to withdraw to the point of the mountain before daylight left me to arrange details for attack and rode to give orders for the divisions but changed his mind without giving me notice and only ordered jenkinss division after marching his command general jenkins rode to the top of the mountain and reported the route over which the enemy had marched was along the western base of a series of lesser heights offering strong points for our troops to find positions of defence between his main force and his rearguard after giving instructions to general jenkins he was asked to explain the plan of operations to general mclaws in case the latter was not in time to view the position from the mountain before night a point had been selected and ordered to be held by one of jenkinss brigades supported by mclawss division while general jenkins was to use his other brigades against the rearguard which rested in the edge of a woodland of fair field of approach the point at which laws brigade rested after being forced from its guard of the line of sharpshooters was near the northern base of the mountain about a mile east of the route of the enemys line of march as general laws detached service had given him opportunity to learn something of the country his brigade was chosen as the brigade of position between the parts of the enemys forces general law was to move first get into position by crossing the bridge over lookout creek to be followed by jenkinss other brigades when mclawss division was to advance to position in support of laws brigade i waited on the mountain the only point from which the operations could be seen until near midnight when seeing no indications of the movements i rode to the point that had been assigned for their assembly found the officers in wait discussing the movements and upon inquiry learned that mclawss division had not been ordered under the impression that the other division commander understood that the move had miscarried i rode back to my headquarters failing to give countermanding orders the gallant jenkins however decided that the plan should not be abandoned and went to work in its execution by his single division to quiet the apprehensions of general law he gave him robertsons brigade to be posted with his own and bennings brigade as their support and ordered his own brigade under colonel bratton to move cautiously against the rearguard and make the attack if the opportunity was encouraging as soon as colonel bratton engaged the alarm spread the enemy hastened to the relief of his rear encountered the troops posted to receive them and made swift severe battle general law claimed that he drove off their fight and under the impression that colonel bratton had finished his work and recrossed the bridge withdrew his command leaving colonel bratton at the tide of his engagement general jenkins and colonel bratton were left to their own cool and gallant skill to extricate the brigade from the swoop of numbers accumulating against them and with the assistance of brave bennings rock brigade brought the command safely over bennings brigade crossing as bratton reached the bridge the conduct of ******** forces was one of the cleverest pieces of work of the war and the skill of its handling softened the blow that took so many of our gallant officers and soldiers colonel bratton made clever disposition of his regiments and handled them well he met gallant resistance and in one instance had part of his command forced back but renewed the attack making his line stronger and forced the enemy into crowded ranks and had him under converging circular fire with fair prospects when recalled under orders to hasten to the bridge so urgent was the order that he left the dead and some of the wounded on the field it was an oversight of mine not to give definite orders for the troops to return to their camps before leaving them general jenkins was ordered to inquire into the conduct of the brigades of position and reported evidence that general law had said that he did not care to win general jenkinss spurs as a majorgeneral he was ordered to prepare charges but presently when we were ordered into active campaign in east tennessee he asked to have the matter put off to more convenient time we may pause here to reflect upon the result of the combination against rosecranss army in september after our lines of transit were seriously disturbed and after the severe losses in pennsylvania mississippi and tennessee and to consider in contrast the probable result of the combination if effected in the early days of may when it was first proposed see strategic map at that time general grant was marching to lay siege upon vicksburg the campaign in virginia had been settled for the time by the battle of chancellorsville our railways were open and free from virginia through east tennessee georgia alabama to central mississippi the armies of rosecrans and bragg were standing near ************ and *********** tennessee the richmond authorities were trying to collect a force at jackson mississippi to drive grants army from the siege two divisions of the first corps of the army of northern virginia were marching from suffolk to join general lee at fredericksburg under these circumstances positions and conditions i proposed to secretary seddon and afterwards to general lee as the only means of relief for vicksburg that johnston should be ordered with his troops to join braggs army that the divisions marching for fredericksburg should be ordered to meet johnstons the transit over converging lines would give speedy combination and johnston should be ordered to strike rosecrans in overwhelming numbers and march on to the ohio river as the combination of september and battle of chickamauga drew general grants army from its work in mississippi to protect the line through tennessee and kentucky and two federal corps from the army of the potomac the inference is fair that the earlier more powerful combination would have opened ways for grand results for the south saved the eight thousand lost in defending the march for vicksburg the ********* thousand surrendered there port hudson and its garrison of six thousand and the splendid army of northern virginia the twenty thousand lost at gettysburg and who can say that with these sixtyfive thousand soldiers saved and in the ranks the southern cause would not have been on a grand ascending grade with its bayonets and batteries bristling on the banks of the ohio river on the 4th day of july 1863 the elections of 1862 were not in support of the emancipation proclamation with the mississippi river still closed and the southern army along the banks of the ohio the elections of 1864 would have been still more pronounced against the federal policy and a new administration could have found a solution of the political ********* blood is thicker than water about the 1st of november it was ******* about camp that i was to be ordered into east tennessee against general burnsides army at the moment it seemed impossible that our commander after rejecting a proposition for a similar move made just after his battle when flushed with victory and the enemy discomfited could now think of sending an important detachment so far when he knew that in addition to the reinforcements that had joined the union army another strong column was marching from memphis under general sherman and must reach chattanooga in fifteen or twenty days but on second thoughts it occurred to me that it might after all be in keeping with his peculiarities and then it occurred to me that there are many ways to compass a measure when the spirit leads so i set to work to try to help his plans in case the report proved true after a little reflection it seemed feasible that by withdrawing his army from its lines about chattanooga to strong concentration behind the chickamauga river and recalling his detachment in east tennessee the latter to give the impression of a westward move and at the moment of concentration sending a strong force for swift march against general ************** enough to crush himand returning to chattanooga before the army under general sherman could reach there or if he thought better let the detachment strike into kentucky against the enemys communications something worth while could be effected presently i was called with lieutenantgeneral hardee and majorgeneral breckenridge the other corps commanders to learn his plans and receive his orders he announced his purpose in general terms to send me into east tennessee then paused as if inviting the opinions of others when i stated that the move could be made but it would be hazardous to make a detachment strong enough for rapid work while his army was spread along a semicircle of six miles with the enemy concentrated at the centre whence he could move in two or three threatening columns to hold his line to its extension and give his real attack such power that it must break through by its weight then i suggested the operations herein just mentioned he ordered the move to be made by my two divisions alexanders and leydons artillery and wheelers cavalry and horse artillery we had the promise of a force estimated from three to five thousand that was to come from southwest virginia and meet us but that command was to start from a point two hundred miles from our starting march south as we marched north and meet us at knoxville general bragg estimated general burnsides force south of knoxville at fifteen thousand i repeated the warning that the move as ordered was not such as to give assurances of rapid work saying that my march and campaign against the enemys *********** positions must be made with care and that would consume so much time that general grants army would be up when he would organize attack that must break through the line before i could return to him his sardonic smile seemed to say that i knew little of his army or of himself in assuming such a possibility so confident was he of his position that i ventured to ask that my column should be increased to twenty thousand infantry and artillery but he intimated that further talk was out of order general grant had in the mean time joined the army and assumed command on the 22d of october and it was known that general sherman was marching to join him on the 20th of october general burnside reported by letter to general grant an army of twentytwo thousand three hundred men with ********* guns but his returns for november show a force of twentyfive thousand two hundred and ninety and over one hundred guns eight thousand of his men were on service north of knoxville and about cumberland gap to march and capture or disperse this formidable force fortified at points i had mclawss and hoods divisions of infantry colonel alexanders and major leydons artillery and four brigades of general wheelers cavalry kershaws humphreyss woffords and ****** brigades constituted mclawss division hoods division which was commanded during the campaign by brigadiergeneral m jenkins was made up of jenkinss andersons bennings laws and robertsons brigades general wheelers cavalry was organized into two divisions of two brigades *********** john t morgans alabama and colonel ****** georgia brigades under majorgeneral w t martin colonels g g ********* tennessee and thomas harrisons texas brigades under brigadiergeneral frank armstrong this made about fifteen thousand men after deducting camp guards and foraging parties the remote contingent that was to come from southwest virginia was an unknown quantity not to be considered until it could report for service as soon as the conference at headquarters adjourned orders were issued for alexanders artillery to be withdrawn from lookout mountain and general mclaws was ordered to withdraw his division from the general line after night both commands were ordered to ****** station to take the cars for sweetwater on the 4th control of the trains was under general braggs quartermaster who had orders for the cars to be ready to transport the troops on their arrival but the trains were not ready until the 5th the brigades arrived at sweetwater on the 6th 7th and 8th alexanders batteries were shipped as soon as cars were ready to ******** matters his horses and wagons were ordered forward by the dirt road the batteries found cars the last battery getting to sweetwater on the 10th jenkinss division and leydons batteries were drawn from the lines on the 5th and ordered to meet the cars at the tunnel through missionary ridge they reached the station in due season but the cars were not there after waiting some days the battery horses and horses of mounted officers were ordered by the wagon road tired of the wait i advised the troops to march along the road and find the cars where they might have the good fortune to meet them the officers whose horses had been sent forward marching with the soldiers general bragg heard of the delay and its cause but began to urge the importance of more rapid movements his effort to make his paper record at my expense was not pleasing but i tried to endure it with patience he knew that trains and conductors were under his exclusive control but he wanted papers that would throw the responsibility of delay upon other shoulders on the 8th and 9th the infantry marched as far as ********* about thirty miles where the ************ gave notice that the trains could meet them but it was not until the 12th that the last of the brigades reached sweetwater while waiting for transportation i wrote some of my friends to excuse my failure to stop and say goodby the letter written to general buckner was returned to me some months after endorsed by him as having important bearing upon events as they ************* three months thereafter general buckner returned the letter with the following i asked at general headquarters for maps and information of the country through which i was to operate for a quartermaster and commissary of subsistence who knew of the resources of the country and for an engineer officer who had served with general buckner when in command of that department neither of the staffofficers was sent nor a map except one of the topographical outlines of the country between the ********* and tennessee rivers which was much in rear of the field of our proposed operations general buckner was good enough to send me a plot of the roads and streams between loudon and knoxville we were again disappointed at sweetwater we were started from chattanooga on short rations but comforted by the assurance that produce was abundant at that point and so it proved to be but general ********* commanding the outpost reported his orders from the commanding general were to ship all of his supplies to his army and to retire with his own command and join him upon our arrival in this connection it should be borne in mind that we were recently from ************** at the heated *********** we left most of our clothing and blankets and all of our wagon transportation and by this time too it was understood through the command that the richmond authorities were holding ************* over the head of the commander and that general bragg was disposed to make them more portentous by his pressing calls for urgency thus we found ourselves in a strange country not as much as a days rations on hand with hardly enough land transportation for ordinary camp equipage the enemy in front to be captured and our friends in rear putting in their paper bullets this sounds more like romance than war but i appeal to the records for the facts including reports of my chiefs of quartermaster and subsistence departments and general alexanders account of the condition of some of the battery horses and ammunition our foraging parties were lively and we lost but a day and part of another in gathering in rations for a start anticipating proper land transportation plans were laid for march across the little tennessee above its confluence with the greater river through marysville to the heights above knoxville on the east bank by forced march this would have brought the city close under fire of our field batteries and forced the enemy into open grounds a guide had been secured who claimed to be familiar with the country and was useful in laying our plans but when our pontoon bridge came up it was without a train for hauling so our plan must be changed fortunately we found a point in a bend of the river near the railroad at which we could force a crossing at dark the cars were rolled up to that point by hand and we learned that the little tennessee river above us was fordable for cavalry general wheeler had been ordered to have vedettes along the river from loudon to some distance below kingston where a considerable body of union troops occupied the north bank he was ordered with his other troops to prepare for orders to cross the little tennessee at its fords ride to marysville capture the enemys cavalry outpost at that point ride up the east side of the river to knoxville and seize the heights overlooking the city or finding that not feasible to endeavor to so threaten as to hold the enemys forces there to their works while we marched against the troops of the west side but when he found his service on that side ceased to be effective or cooperative with our movements to cross the river and join the main column as just now explained the failure of wagons for our pontoon bridge forced us to cross at loudon and to make direct march upon knoxville by that route weary of the continual calls of general bragg for hurried movements it seemed well to make cause for him to assign another commander or to move him to discontinue his work at a paper record so i wired to remind him that he assured me before sending me away that he was safe in his position and that he was told before my leaving that the command was not strong enough to excuse any but a careful proper campaign that he had since been informed that all delays of our movements were due to his inefficient staff corps and that we were dependent upon foraging for our daily rations for men and animals it began to look more like a campaign against longstreet than against burnside as general burnsides orders were to hold knoxville he decided to act on the defensive leaving the troops in the northern district of his department in observation of that field he withdrew his division on the south side of tennessee river as we marched for loudon took up his pontoon bridge and broke up the railroad bridge orders were issued on the 12th for the general move of my cavalry by marysville the infantry and artillery along the railroad route pains were taken to have the bridge equipments carried by hand to the river and skirmishing parties put in the boats and drifted to the opposite bank the troops in rear were marched during the night to the vicinity of loudon and held in readiness in case the enemy came to oppose our crossing the bridge was laid under the supervision of general alexander and major clark our chief engineer at ***** ferry without serious resistance a few miles east of loudon the holston and little tennessee rivers come together making the tennessee river which flows from the confluence west to kingston where it ******* its general flow southwest the holston rises in the mountains north and flows south to the junction the little tennessee rises in the mountains east and flows west to the junction the railroad crosses the main river at loudon thirty miles from knoxville and runs about parallel to the holston river and near its west bank west of the railroad and parallel is a broken spur of the clinch mountain range with occasional gaps or passes for vehicles and some other blind ********** and ************ west of this spur and near its base is the main wagonroad to knoxville as far as campbell station about seventeen miles where it joins the kingston road passes a gap and unites with the wagonroad that runs with the railroad east of the mountain spur at campbell station south of this gap about eleven miles is another pass at lenoirs mill and three miles south of that another pass not used a detail of sharpshooters under captain foster of jenkinss brigade manned the first boats and made a successful lodging after an exchange of a few shots with the enemys picketguard on the north bank they intended to surprise and capture the picket and thus secure quick and quiet passage but in that they were not successful the north bank was secured however without loss and troops were passed rapidly over to hold it putting out a good skirmish line in advance of the ********** as we advanced towards loudon the part of general whites union division that had been on the opposite bank of the river was withdrawn to lenoirs station during the 13th and 14th the command was engaged in making substantial ********** for the bridge and constructing its defences general ******* regiments and a battery of major leydons with brokendown horses were assigned to guard the bridge on the afternoon of the 14th the enemy appeared on our front in strong force drove our skirmish line back and seemed prepared to give battle as we were then waiting the return of our foraging wagons we could only prepare to receive him some of the provisions looked for came in during the night and we advanced on the 15th finding that the enemy had retired the force that came back to meet us on the 15th was part of whites division chapins brigade sent by general burnside and general potter commanding the ninth corps sent general ******* with his division the move was intended probably to delay our march it was chapins brigade that made the advance against our skirmishers and it probably suffered some in the affair we lost not a single man general wheeler crossed the little tennessee river at ******* ford at nightfall on the 13th and marched to cut off the force at marysville he came upon the command only one regiment the eleventh kentucky cavalry that was advised in time to prepare for him he attacked as soon as they came under fire dispersed them into small parties that made good their escape except one hundred and fifty taken by ********* brigade colonel ******* brought up the balance of his brigade and made strong efforts to support his broken regiment but was eventually forced back and was followed by the eighth and eleventh texas and third arkansas cavalry and general john t morgans brigade the next day he encountered sanderss division of cavalry and a battery and after a clean cavalry engagement of skilful manuvres on both sides succeeded in reaching the vicinity of the city of knoxville but found it too well guarded to admit of any very advantageous work on the 15th our advance was cautiously made by hoods division and alexanders artillery leading mclawss division and leydons artillery following all along the route of the railroad the valley between the mountain and the river is so narrow and rough that a few thousand men can find many points at which they can make successful stands against great odds our course was taken to turn all of those points by marching up the road on the west side of the mountain a few miles out from our bridge we encountered a skirmishing party near the lower gap of the mountain which when pressed back passed through the gap general jenkins continued his ************ a guard at the gap till it could be relieved by general ******** lenoirs station the enemy was looking for us to follow through the lower gaps and attack his strong front and was a little surprised to find us close on his right flank he was well guarded there however against precipitate battle by the mountain range and narrow pass and the heavy muddy roads through which our men and animals had to pull arrangements were made for a good days work from early morning our guide promised to lead part of our men through a blind route during the night by which we could cut off the enemys retreat so that they would be securely hemmed in generals jenkins and mclaws came up during the night the former was ordered to advance part of his command to eligible points at midnight and hold them ready for use at daylight the guide was sent with a brigade to the point which was to intercept the enemys retreat mclaws was held on the road ready for use east or west of the ridge jenkins was ordered to have parties out during the night to watch that the enemy did not move and report as no report came from them all things were thought to be properly adjusted when we advanced before daylight in feeling our way through the weird gray of the morning stumps seen on the roadside were taken to be sharpshooters but we were surprised that no one shot at us when behold before it was yet quite light we came upon a park of eighty wagons well loaded with food camp equipage and ammunition with the ground well strewn with spades ***** and axes the animals had been taken from the wagons to double their teams through the mud general potter had sent the division under general hartranft back to the campbell station pass to occupy the junction of his line of retreat with the kingston road and the road upon which we were marching and was well on the march with the balance of the ninth corps ******** division and his cavalry before we knew that there was an opening by which he could escape our guide who promised to post the brigade so as to command the road in rear of the enemy so far missed his route as to lead the brigade out of hearing of the enemys march during the night harts cavalry brigade that was left in observation near kingston had been called up and with mclawss division advanced on the roads to campbell station while general jenkins followed the direct line of retreat on double time and right royally did his skirmishers move he brought the rear to an occasional stand but only leaving enough to require him to form line for advance when the enemy again sped away on their rearward march at double time general jenkins made the march before noon but the enemy had passed the gap and the junction of the roads and was well posted in battle array in rear of them general mclaws was not up he was not ordered on double time as it was thought to first bring the enemy to bay on the east road when some of his infantry could be called over the mountain on the enemys flank general ******* who covered the retreat reported that it was necessary to attach from sixteen to twenty animals to a piece to make the haul through the mud the retreat was very ******** conducted and was in time to cover the roads into campbells station forming into line of battle to meet us jenkinss division being in advance was deployed on the right with alexanders battalion as soon as the line was organized the batteries opened practice in deliberate ********* combat but general alexander had the sympathy of his audience his shells often exploded before they reached the game and at times as they passed from the muzzles of his guns and no remedy could be applied that improved their fire as general mclaws came up his division was put upon our left with the other batteries and harts brigade of cavalry was assigned in that part to observe the enemys farther off it was not yet past ******** we had ample time to make a battle with confident hope of success by direct advance and the pressing in on the enemys right by mclawss left but our severe travel and labor after leaving virginia were not to find an opportunity to make a simply successful battle as the rear of the enemy was open and could be covered success would have been a simple victory and the enemy could have escaped to his trenches at knoxville leaving us crippled and delayed whereas as he stood he was ours how we failed to make good our claim we shall presently see mclaws was ordered to use one of his brigades well out on his left as a diversion threatening the enemys right and to use harts cavalry for the same purpose while general jenkins was ordered to send two of his brigades through a *********** way off our right to march out well past the enemys left and strike down against that flank and rear general law being his officer next in rank was ordered in charge of his own and andersons brigades general jenkins rode with the command and put it in such position that the left of this line would strike the left of the enemys thus throwing the weight of the two brigades past the enemys rear i rode near the brigades to see that there could be no ******* or misconception of orders after adjusting the line of the brigades and giving their march the points of direction general jenkins rode to his brigades on the front to handle them in direct attack i remained near the front of the flanking brigades for complete assurance of the adjustment of their march and waited until they were so near that it was necessary to ride at speed close under the enemys line to reach our main front to time its advance with the flanking move the ride was made alone as less likely to draw the enemys fire the staff riding around as i approached the front the men sprang forward without orders to open the charge but were called to await the appearance of the flanking move of our right but general law had so changed direction as to bring his entire force in front instead of in the rear of the enemys left this gave him opportunity to change position to strong ground in rear which made other movements necessary in view of the objective of the battle there was yet time for successful battle but it would have been a fruitless victory before other combinations suited to our purpose could be made it was night and the enemy was away on his march to the fortified grounds about knoxville the demonstration of our left under general mclaws was successful in drawing the enemys attention and in causing him to change front of part of his command to meet the threatening in his official account general jenkins reported apropos of this the following memorandum of a staffofficer is interesting and *********** this has been called a battle by the other side but it was only an artillery combat little very little musket ammunition being burnt the next day the enemy was safely behind his works about knoxville except his cavalry under general sanders and his horse artillery left to delay our march mclawss division reached the suburbs of the city a little after noon and was deployed from near the mouth of third creek as his right the enemy holding a line of dismounted cavalry skirmishers about a thousand yards in advance of his line of works alexanders artillery was disposed near mclawss deployment jenkins got up before night and was ordered to deploy on mclawss left as far as the tazewell road preceded by harts cavalry which was to extend the line north to the holston river general wheeler came up later and was assigned to line with colonel hart the city stands on the right bank of the holston river on a plateau about one and a half miles in width and extending some miles down south at knoxville the plateau is one hundred and twenty feet above the river and there are little streams called first second and third creeks from the upper to the lower suburbs of the ********* creek between the city and east knoxville or temperance hill second creek between the city and college hill third creek below and outside the enemys lines of defence the plateau slopes down to the valley through which the railway passes and west of the valley it rises to the usual elevation the confederates were posted on the second plateau with their batteries of position the line of the enemys works starting at its lower point on the west bank of the river was just above the mouth of second creek lying at right angles to the river it ran to a fort constructed by the confederates when occupied by them years before called fort loudon above the kingston road and about a thousand yards in front of the college east from that point it was about parallel with the river reaching to temperance hill to ****** hill and to the holston below the ********** an interior line extended from temperance hill to flint hill on the east and another on the west between the

west bank these were defended at some points by earthworks well manned from the lower point of the enemys line the confederates extended to his right at the river ********** to his defensive lines the part of our line occupied by the cavalry was a mere ********** our move was hurried and our transportation so limited that we had only a few tools in the hands of small pioneer parties and our wagons were so engaged in collecting daily rations that we found it necessary to send our cavalry down to lenoirs for the tools captured there for use in making riflepits for our sharpshooters when general burnside rode to the front to meet us at lenoirs he left general parke in command at knoxville and he and captain poe of the engineers gave attention to his ******************** works upon laying our lines about knoxville the enemys forces in the northeast of his department were withdrawn towards cumberland gap but we had no information of the troops ordered to meet us from southwest virginia the

many hard knocks in our eastern service opened upon us as soon as we were in its reach it was not until night of the 17th that our line was well established and then only so as to enclose the enemys front leaving the country across the river to be covered when the troops from virginia should join us when general mclaws advanced on the morning of the 18th he found the enemys line of ****************** **************** a line of heavy rail defences general alexander was ordered to knock the rails about them and drive them out and was partially successful but the enemy got back before our infantry could reach them so we had to carry the line by assault part of our line drove up in fine style and was ********** successful but other parts ******** under the stiff musket fire hesitated and lay down under such slight shelter as they could find but close under ****** close that to remain inactive would endanger repulse captain winthrop of alexanders staff appreciating the crisis dashed forward on his horse and led the halting lines successfully over the works in his gallant ride he received a very severe hurt neither our numbers nor our condition were such as to warrant further aggressive action at the moment nor in fact until the column from virginia joined us our sharpshooters were advanced from night to night and pitted before daylight each line being held by new forces as the advance was made the first line occupied was a little inside of the rail piles it seemed probable upon first examination of the line along the northwest that we might break through and preparations were made for that effort but upon closer investigation it was found to be too hazardous and that the better plan was to await the approach of the other forces when within six hundred yards of the enemys works our lines well pitted it seemed safe to establish a battery on an elevated plateau on the east or south side of the river some of our troops were sent over in flatboats and the reconnoissance revealed an excellent point commanding the city and the enemys lines of works though parts of his lines were beyond our range some of our best guns were put in position and our captured pontoon bridges down at lenoirs were sent for to be hauled up along the river but impassable ****** were found and we were obliged to take part of our *********** to haul them they were brought up and communication between the detachment and main force was made easy the brigades of law and robertson were left on the east or south side as guard for that battery the

general burnside reported general poe reported on the 22d general mclaws thought his advance near enough the works to warrant assault he was ordered to it with assaulting columns supported by the division general jenkins was also ordered up and general wheeler was ordered to push his troops and his horse artillery forward as mclawss attack opened so that the entire line would engage and hold to steady work till all the works were carried after consulting his officers general mclaws reported that they preferred to have daylight for their work on the 23d reports came of a large force of the enemy at kingston advancing general wheeler was sent with his main force of cavalry to look after them he engaged the enemy on the 24th and after a skirmish withdrew soon afterwards receiving orders from general bragg to join him leaving his cavalry under command of majorgeneral martin he rode to find his commander general martin brought the brigades back and resumed position on our left colonel hart who was left at kingston with his brigade reported that there were but three regiments of cavalry and a field battery that engaged general wheeler on the 24th on the night of the 24th the enemy made a sortie against a point of general woffords line which broke through but was speedily driven back with a loss of some prisoners and a number of killed and wounded general woffords loss was five wounded two mortally our cavalry except a brigade left at kingston resumed its position on the left of our line on the 26th on the 23d a telegram came from general bragg to say that the enemy had moved out and attacked his troops at chattanooga later in the day he announced the enemy still in front of him but not engaging his forces on the 25th i had a telegram from general bushrod r johnson at loudon who was marching with two brigades to reinforce us saying that the enemy was throwing his cavalry forward towards charleston this in connection with the advance of the enemy towards general bragg reported by his despatch of the 23d i took to be an effort to prevent reinforcements coming to us or to cut in and delay their march that night general leadbetter chief engineer of general braggs army reported at headquarters with orders from general bragg that we should attack at knoxville and very promptly i asked him to make the reconnoissance and designate the assailable points at the same time he was asked to consider that the troops from virginia were on the march and would join us in eight or ten days when our investment could be made complete that the enemy was then on half rations and would be obliged to surrender in two weeks also whether we should assault fortifications and have the chance of repulse rather than wait for a surrender from his first reconnoissance he pronounced fort sanders the assailable point but after riding around the lines with general jenkins and general alexander he pronounced in favor of assault from our left at ****** hill on the 27th after more thorough reconnoissance in company with my officers he came back to his conclusion in favor of assault at fort sanders i agreed with him that the field at ****** hill was too wide and the march under fire too long to warrant attack at that point he admitted that the true policy was to wait and reduce the place by complete investment but claimed that the crisis was on the time imperative and that the assault must be tried meanwhile rumors reached us through the telegraph operator of a battle at chattanooga but nothing official though outside indications were ************* in the afternoon colonel ******* of the command from virginia reported with his cavalry and next day 28th general w e jones of that command reported with his cavalry the brigades from chattanooga under general b r johnson were at hand but not yet up the artillery and infantry coming from virginia were five or six days march from us but general leadbetter was impatient general mclaws was ordered to double his force of sharpshooters and their reserve advance during the night and occupy the line of the enemys pickets and arrange for assault the artillery was to open on the fort as soon as the weather cleared the view after ten minutes practice the assaulting column was to march but the practice was to hold until the near approach of the storming party to the fort the assault was to be made by three of mclawss brigades his fourth advancing on his right to carry the line of works in its front as soon as the fort was taken three brigades of jenkinss division were to follow in echelon on the left of mclawss column g t andersons of his right leading at two hundred yards interval from mclawss anderson to assault the line in his front and upon entering to wheel to his left and sweep up that line followed by jenkinss and bennings brigades but in case of delay in mclawss assault anderson was to wheel to his right and take the fort through its rear opening leaving the brigades of jenkins and benning to follow the other move to their left the ditch and parapets about the fort were objects of careful observation from the moment of placing our lines and opinions coincided with those of reconnoitring officers that the former could be passed without ******* general alexander and i made frequent examinations of them within four hundred yards after careful conference general mclaws ordered general b r johnson was in time to follow the main attack by general mclaws with his own and gracies brigades two thousand six hundred and twentyfive effectives the order was given for the 28th but the weather became so heavy and murky as to hide the fort from view of our artillery so operations were put off until the 29th on the 28th reports were brought of an advance of union troops from the direction of cumberland gap the cavalry under general w e jones was sent to arrest their march pending operations ordered for the 29th and he was authorized to call the artillery and infantry marching from virginia to his assistance if the force proved formidable after arranging his command general mclaws wrote me as follows in reply i wrote after writing the letter it occurred to me to show it to general leadbetter who was stopping at our headquarters when he suggested the postscript which was added the assault was made by the brigades of generals wofford humphreys and bryan at the appointed time and in admirable style the orders were that not a musket should be discharged except by the sharpshooters who should be vigilant and pick off every head that might appear above the parapets until the fort was carried the troops marched steadily and formed regularly along the outside of the works around the ditch i rode after them with the brigades under general b r johnson until within five hundred yards of the fort whence we could see our advance through the gray of the morning a few men were coming back wounded major ****** of general mclawss staff who had been at the fort rode back met me and reported that it would be useless for us to go on that the enemy had so surrounded the fort with network of wire that it was impossible for the men to get in without axes and that there was not an axe in the command without a second thought i ordered the recall and ordered general johnson to march his brigades back to their camps he begged to be allowed to go on but giving full faith to the report i forbade him i had known major ****** many years he was a classmate at west point and had served with us in the field in practical experience so that i had confidence in his judgment recall was promptly sent general jenkins and his advance brigade under general anderson but the latter seeing the delay at the fort changed his direction outside the enemys works and marched along their front to the ditch and was there some little time before he received the order in his march and ************ in front of the enemys line he lost four killed and thirtythree wounded as a diversion in favor of the assaulting columns our troops on the south side were ordered to a simultaneous attack and to get in on that side if the opportunity occurred they were reinforced by russells brigade of morgans division of cavalry and harrisons brigade of armstrongs division dismounted general morgan commanding this demonstration had the effect anticipated in detaining troops to hold on that side that were intended as reserve for the fort just after the troops were ordered back it occurred to me that there must be some mistake about the wire network for some of our men had been seen mounting and passing over the parapets but it was too late to reorganize and renew the attack and i conceived that some of the regimental pioneers should have been at hand prepared to cut the wires but all had been armed to help swell our ranks since reading the accounts of general poe the engineer in charge of the works i am convinced that the wires were far from being the serious obstacle reported and that we could have gone in without the use of axes and from other accounts it appears that most of the troops had retired from the fort leaving about a hundred and fifty infantry with benjamins battery our muskets from the outside of the parapet could have kept the infantry down and the artillery practice except the few ************ prepared at the time by the artillerists johnsons brigades would have been at the ditch with me in ten minutes when we would have passed over the works hence it seems conclusive that the failure was due to the order of recall it is not a part of my nature to listen to reports that always come when stunning blows are felt but confidence in the conduct of the war was broken and with it the tone and spirit for battle further impaired by the efforts of those in authority to damage if not prevent the success of work ordered in their own vital interest a poor excuse for want of golden equipoise in one who ******** to hold the lives of his soldiers but better than to look for ways to shift the responsibility of a wavering spirit that sometimes comes unawares after the repulse general burnside was so considerate as to offer a flag of truce for time to remove our killed and wounded about his lines about half an hour after the repulse and while yet on the slope leading up to the fort major branch of majorgeneral ransoms staff came with a telegram from the president informing me that general bragg had been forced back by superior numbers and ordering me to proceed to cooperate with his army orders were issued at once for our trains to move south and preparations were begun for a move of the troops after nightfall in the afternoon word came from general wheeler authorized by general bragg that i should join him if practicable at ringgold but our first step was to be relieved of the threatening from the direction of cumberland gap general martin was sent to reinforce general jones with orders to hurry his operations and return in time to cover anticipated movements his brigades which had done their clever work on the south side were withdrawn to go with him when he came up with jones the latter was severely engaged but it was then night too late for other operations their arrangements were made during the night and battle renewed at early dawn and severely contested the union troops giving from point to point until they crossed the ford at walkers and were beyond further threatening they lost some fifty killed and wounded and one company captured at colonel ******* camp generals martin and jones joined us in good season after their affair of the morning their loss was slight but not detailed in separate reports as general wheelers note indicated doubt of the feasibility of the move towards general bragg it occurred to me that our better course was to hold our lines about knoxville and in that way cause general grant to send to its relief and thus so reduce his force as to stop for a time pursuit of general bragg under this impression i ordered our trains back and continued to hold our lines the superior officers were called together and advised of affairs and asked for suggestions the impression seemed to be that it would not be prudent to undertake to join general bragg at the same time reports came from him to inform me that he had retired as far as dalton and that i must depend upon my own resources we were cut off from communication with the army at dalton except by an impracticable mountain route and the railway to the north was broken up by the removal of bridges and rails for a distance of a hundred miles and more deciding to remain at knoxville i called on general ransom to join us with his main force to aid in *********** it or to hold it while we could march against a succoring force if the numbers should warrant on the 1st of december colonel ******* commanding one of general ransoms cavalry brigades reported that he had orders to join general ransom with his brigade on the same day a courier going from general grant to general burnside was captured bearing an autograph letter for the latter stating that three columns were advancing for his ********* by the south side under general sherman one by ******* under general elliott the third by cumberland gap under general foster when general leadbetter left us on the 29th of november he was asked to look after affairs at loudon and to order general vaughn to destroy such property as he could not haul off and retire through the mountains to general braggs army finding that general vaughn had not been moved he was ordered on the 1st of december to cross the river to our side with everything that he could move and to be ready to destroy property that he must leave and march to join us as soon as the pressure from general shermans force became serious at the same time an order came from general bragg that his cavalry be ordered back to his army as i had relieved the pressure against him in his critical emergency and affairs were getting a little complicated about my position i felt warranted in retaining the cavalry for the time reports coming at the same time of reinforcements for the enemy at kingston pressing towards general vaughn at loudon he was ordered to join us as he had no horses for the battery he tumbled it from the bridge into the middle of the tennessee river burned the bridge and marched under the circumstances there seemed but one move left for **** march around knoxville to the north side up the holston and try to find the column reported to be marching down from cumberland gap the mountain ranges and valleys of that part of the state offering beautiful fields for the manuvre of small armies the order was issued december 2 trains were put in motion on the 3d and ordered up the railroad route under escort of laws and robertsons brigades and one of alexanders batteries on the night of the 4th the troops were marched from the southwest to the north side of the city and took up the march along the west bank of the holston general martin with his own and general w e joness cavalry was left to guard the rear of our march and pick up weak men or stragglers he was ordered to cross part of his cavalry to the east bank at strawberry plains and march up on that side and general w e jones to follow on our rear with his and the balance of martins corps as we were not disturbed we reached blains crossroads on the afternoon of the 5th where we met general ransom with his infantry and the balance of his artillery on the 6th we marched to rutledge halting two days to get food and look for the succoring column by cumberland gap which failed to appear however it was time for us to be looking for better fields of food for men and animals who had not had comfortable rations for weeks it seemed too that general braggs call for his cavalry could not be longer left in abeyance to get away from convenient march of the enemy we went up the river as far as rogersville where we might hope to forage under reduced cavalry force we marched on the 8th ordering our cavalry except ******** brigade across the holston near beans station general ransoms command to cover our march general braggs cavalry to go by an eastern route through the mountains to georgia we halted at rogersville on the 9th where we were encouraged to hope for full rations for a few days at least but to be sure of accumulating a few days extra supply the mills being only able to grind a full days rations for us every man and animal was put on short rations until we could get as much as three days supply on hand on the 7th of december the union army under majorgeneral john g parke took the field along the rear of our march and reached rutledge on the 9th the enemys cavalry advancing as far as beans station the object was supposed to be the securing of the forage and subsistence stores of the country but of these movements we were not fully advised until the 11th on the 10th of december general morgans brigade of cavalry was attacked at ************ while engaged in foraging but got force enough and in time to drive the enemy away on the 10th a telegram from the president gave me discretionary authority over the movements of the troops of the department and i ordered the recall of general martin and put his command between us and the enemy on the 12th we had information that general sherman had taken up his march for return to general grants army with the greater part of his troops at the same time we had information of the force that had followed our march as far as rutledge and blains crossroads under general parke who had posted a large part of the force of artillery cavalry and infantry at beans station a point between the clinch mountain and the holston river the mountain there is very rugged and was reported to be inaccessible except at very rough passes the valley between it and the river is about two miles wide at some places less i

west and bar the enemys retreat by my cavalry in his ********* was to cross the holston behind himthen by marching the main column down the valley to capture this advance part of the command my column though complaining a little of short rations and very muddy roads made its march in good season so also did jones on the west of the mountain and martin on the other side of the holston but the latter encountered a brigade at mays ford which delayed him and gave time for the enemy to change to a position some four miles to his rear as we approached the position in front of the gap ******** cavalry in advance general b r johnson met and engaged the enemy in a severe fight but forced him back steadily as we were looking for large capture more than fight delay was unfortunate i called kershaws brigade up to force contention till we could close the west end of the gap the movements were nicely executed by johnson and kershaw but general martin had not succeeded in gaining his position so the rear was not closed and the enemy retired at night i thought the army was in position to get the benefit of the small force cut off at the gap as some reward for our very hard work we received reports from general jones west of the mountain that he was in position at his end of the gap and had captured several ********** of good things as his orders included the capture of the train he had failed of full comprehension of them and after nightfall had withdrawn to comfortable ************** to enjoy his large catch of sugar and coffee and other things seldom seen in confederate camps in those days thus the troops at the gap got out during the night some running over the huge rocks and heavy wood tangles along the crest by torchlight to their comrades some going west by easier ways so when i sent up in the morning looking for their doleful surrender my men found only empty *********** ******** tents and a few abandoned guns and twelve prisoners while the yankees were no doubt sitting around their campfires enjoying the joke with the comrades they had rejoined during our march and wait at rogersville general foster passed down to knoxville by a more southern route and relieved general burnside of command of the department on the 12th general jenkins was ordered to follow down the valley to the new position of the enemy his brigades under generals law and robertson had been detached guarding trains general law commanding them had been ordered to report to the division commander on the 13th but at night of the 14th he was eight miles behind orders were sent him to join the division at the earliest practicable moment on the 15th he reported to the division commander between two and three oclock in the afternoon if he started at the hour he should have marched six am at the latest he was about eight hours making as many miles meanwhile the enemy had been reinforced by a considerable body of infantry and later it appeared that he was advancing to offer battle general mclaws was ordered to reinforce our front by a brigade he sent word that his men had not yet received their bread rations he sent kershaws brigade however that had captured rations the day before but then it was night and the appearance of general martins cavalry on or near the enemys flank caused a change of his plans during the night he retreated and we occupied his trenches i could have precipitated an affair of some moment both at this point and at beans station gap but my purpose was when i fought to fight for all that was on the field the time was then for full and glorious victory a fruitless one we did not want the enemy retired to blains crossroads where general foster after reinforcing by the fourth corps decided to accept battle he reported his force as twentysix thousand and credited the confederates with equal numbers but twenty thousand would have been an ************ for us he assigned the true cause of our failure to follow up and find him and now the weather grew very heavy and the roads already bad became soft and impracticable for trains and artillery the men were brave steady patient occasionally they called pretty loudly for parched corn but always in a bright merry mood there was never a time when we did not have enough of corn and plenty of wood with which to keep us warm and ***** our corn at this distance it seems almost incredible that we got along as we did but all were then so healthy and strong that we did not feel severely our really great hardships our serious trouble was in the matter of clothing and shoes as winter had broken upon us in good earnest it seemed necessary for us to give up the game of war for the time seek some good place for shelter and repair railroads and bridges to open our way back towards richmond general bragg had been relieved from command of the army at dalton by lieutenantgeneral w j hardee who declined however the part of permanent commander to which after a time general joseph e johnston was assigned on his return from knoxville general sherman proposed to general grant to strike at general hardee and gain rome and the line of the ********** he wrote but general halleck was much concerned about the confederate army in east tennessee the only strategic field then held by southern troops it was ************** near kentucky and the ohio river and president lincoln and his war secretary were as anxious as halleck on account of its ***************** bearing general halleck impressed his views upon general grant and despatched general foster that it was of first importance to drive longstreet out of east tennessee and keep him out general grant ordered drive longstreet to the farthest point east that you can and he reported to the authorities referring to his orders general foster reported his plan to intrench a line of infantry along bulls gap and mulberry gap and have his cavalry ready for the ride against saltville but the confederates turned upon him and he despatched general grant on the 11th the failure to follow has been explained the summing up of the plans laid for general hardee and saltville is brief hardee was not disturbed the ride towards saltville made about the last of the month was followed by general w e jones and came to grief as will be elsewhere explained upon relinquishing command of his army general bragg was called to richmond as commanderinchief near the president before general hood was so seriously hurt at the battle of chickamauga he made repeated complaints of want of conduct on the part of brigadiergeneral j b robertson after the fiasco in lookout valley on the night of the 28th of october i reported to general bragg of the representations made by general hood and of want of conduct on the part of general robertson in that night attack when general bragg ordered me to ask for a board of officers to examine into the merits of the case the board was ordered and general robertson was relieved from duty by orders from general braggs headquarters while the proceedings and actions of the examining board in his case were pending on the 8th without notice to my headquarters general bragg ordered brigadiergeneral robertson will rejoin his command until the board can renew its session on the 18th of december the division commander preferred charges and ************** against brigadiergeneral robertson in which he accused him of calling the commanders of his texas regiments to him and saying there were but general robertson was ordered to bristol to await the action of the richmond authorities who were asked for a courtmartial to try the case on the 17th the following orders concerning general mclaws were issued on the same day he wrote in reply the following was sent on the 19th general law handed in his resignation at headquarters and asked leave of absence on it this was cheerfully granted then he asked the privilege of taking the resignation with him to the adjutantgeneral at richmond this was a very unusual request but the favor he was doing the service gave him some claim to unusual consideration and his request was granted the law disaffection was having effect or seemed to be among some of the officers but most of them and all of the soldiers were true and brave even through all of the hardships of the severest winter of the four years of war marching and fighting had been almost daily occupation from the middle of january 1863 when we left fredericksburg to move down to suffolk virginia until the 16th of december when we found bleak winter again breaking upon us away from our friends and dependent upon our own efforts for food and clothing it is difficult for a soldier to find words that can express his high appreciation of conduct in officers and men who endured so bravely the severe trials they were called to encounter orders were given to cross the holston river and march for the railroad only a few miles away before quitting the fields of our arduous labors mention should be made of general bushrod r johnsons clever march of sixteen miles through deep mud to beans station on the 13th when he and general kershaw attacked and pushed the enemy back from his front at the gap before he could get out of it honorable mention is also due general jenkins for his equally clever pursuit of the enemy at lenoirs station

colonel thomas of the sixteenth georgia who also died in the ditch lieutenant ******* adjutant of the sixteenth georgia regiment who overcame all obstacles crowned the parapet with ten or a dozen men

campaign was the dash of captain winthrop who led our once halting lines over the rail defences at knoxville the transfer of the army to the east bank of the river was executed by diligent work and the use of such flatboats and other means of crossing as we could collect and construct we were over by the 20th and before christmas were in our camps along the railroad near morristown blankets and clothes were very scarce shoes more so but all knew how to enjoy the beautiful country in which we found ourselves the french broad river and the holston are ********* at knoxville the country between

tennessee wired general foster december 25 this will give you great advantage and general foster despatched general parke commanding his troops in the field december 26 longstreet will feel a little

the confederate departments were not so prompt in filling our requisitions but we had hopes the bitter freeze of two weeks had made the rough angles of mud as firm and sharp as so many *************** rocks and the poorly protected feet of our soldiers sometimes left bloody marks along the roads general sturgis rode in advance of the army and occupied dandridge by ******** ******** and ******** divisions of cavalry and motts brigade of infantry the fourth and twentythird corps followed the cavalry leaving the ninth corps to guard at strawberry plains general martin gave us prompt notice that the march was at dandridge and in force the move was construed as a flanking proceeding but it was more convenient to adopt the short march and meet it at dandridge than to leave our shoe factory and winter huts and take up the tedious rearward move the army was ordered under arms the cavalry was ordered concentrated in front of general sturgis and the divisions of jenkins and b r johnson and alexanders batteries were marched to join general martin mclawss division under general wofford and ransoms under general **** with such batteries as they could haul were assigned to positions on the morristown strawberry plains road to strike forward or reinforce at dandridge as plans developed the men without shoes were ordered to remain as camp guards but many preferred to march with their comrades i rode in advance to be assured that our cavalry had not mistaken a strong cavalry move for one by the enemy we found general martin on the bulls gap road sharply engaged with the enemy both sides on strong defensive grounds and using their horse batteries but no infantry was in sight general martin was ordered to push on gain the opposing plateau and force the enemy to show his infantry he found the enemy in strong fight but got the plateau when the enemy deployed in stronger force but his infantry did not appear when asked to take the next hill he thought it could not be done without infantry but my idea was to save the infantry the trying march if possible and to that end it was necessary to push with the cavalry he was called to send me a detachment of his troopers and about six hundred ************* brigade as i remember we rode away from the enemys left concealing our march under traverse of an elevated woodland while general martin engaged their front attention at a secluded spot a little beyond the enemys left the men dismounted leaving their animals under guards moved under cover to good position deployed into single line and marched for the second plateau part of the march was over a small opening near a farmhouse the exposure brought us under fire of some sharpshooters but we hadnt time to stop and shoot as our line marched a chicken dazed by the formidable appearance crouched in the grass until it was kicked up when it flew and tried to clear the line but one of the troopers jumped up knocked it down with the end of his gun stooped picked it up put it in his haversack and marched on without losing his place or step and without looking to his right or left as though it was as proper and as much an everyday part of the exercise of war as shooting at the enemy presently we got up the hill and general martin advanced his mounts to meet us we lost but two ************ officer and a soldier the officer was at my side and hearing the **** of the blow i turned and asked if he was much hurt he said it was only a ********** and remained with his command until night from that point we saw enough to tell that a formidable part of the army

whistling bullets about his men and our batteries preparing something worse for him his troopers got back faster than they came in trying by a rapid ride to find position for handling his men he lost a number of his staff captured and narrowly escaped himself it was near night when the command got up skirmishers from the advance division reinforced the cavalry and pushed the enemy back nearer the

the interesting character of its citizens the ************* unit in heart and ********** prepared to do their share towards making an effective battle and our plans were so laid at the time ordered

was made stronger and relieved the cavalry of their dismounted service a narrow unused road practicable for artillery was found that opened a way for us to reach the enemys rearward line of march sharpshooters were organized and ordered forward by it to be followed by our infantry columns it was thought better to move the infantry alone as the ringing of the iron ***** of the guns might give notice of our purpose the artillery to be called as our sharpshooters approached the junction of the roads the head of the turning force encountered a picketguard some of whom escaped without firing but speedily gave notice of our feeling towards their rear general granger decided to retire and was in time to leave our crossroad behind him his rearguard passing the point of intersection before my advance party reached it about midnight the weather moderated before night and after dark a mild gentle rain began to fall when i rode into dandridge in the gray of the morning the ground was *******

us something of general granger during the night before she had never heard a person swear about another as general granger did about me some of the officers proposed to stop and make a battle but general granger swore and said it was no use to stop and fight longstreet you cant whip him it dont make any difference whether he has one man or a hundred thousand presently she brought out a flask that general granger had forgotten and thought that i should have it it had about two refreshing inches left in it though not left with compliments it was accepted although the weather had moderated it was very wet and nasty and as we had taken our coffee at three oclock it was resolved to call it noon and divide the spoils colonel fairfax who knew how to enjoy good things thought the occasion called for a sentiment and offered general ********** his shadow never grow less the cavalry found the road and its sideways so cut up that their pursuit was reduced to labored walk the previous hard service and exposure had so reduced the animals that they were not in trim for real effective cavalry service they found some crippled battery ****** and a little of other plunder but the enemy passed the holston and broke his bridges behind him our army returned to their huts and winter homes part of our cavalry was ordered to the south side of the french broad and general martin was ordered to press close on the enemys rear with the balance of his force general armstrong followed the line of retreat and by the use of flatboats passed his cavalry over the holston and rode to the vicinity of knoxville he caught up with some stragglers equipments ammunition and remains of some caissons and at last made a grand haul of a herd of eight hundred beef cattle and ********* wagons upon getting his cavalry back to knoxville general foster crossed them over the bridge at the city below the french broad to foraging grounds about louisville and called his dandridge march a foraging excursion saying that he was building a bridge to cross to the south side when we bore down against him but the strategy of his tedious march by our front to find a crossing point at dandridge and build a bridge in our presence when he could have crossed to the south side of the french broad by his bridge at knoxville and reached those foraging grounds unmolested was not like napoleon he claimed that he recovered two hundred of the lost herd of beef cattle in that our reports do not agree it is possible that his officers may have confounded that adventure with another my explanation of the *************** ******** that another of our parties undertook to get in a herd of swine with which there was a smaller herd of beef cattle that all of the latter herd were recovered and the reports of the two adventures were confounded on the 14th general ***** came down from the mountains of north carolina on a raid towards *********** he captured a number of wagons but was promptly pursued by the enemy his prize recovered and he and a number of his staff were taken prisoners with the loss of a hundred or more horses and equipments they were not a part of my command and failed to give us notice of their ride the first intimation we had of them was of their unfortunate adventure on the 21st orders came from richmond to send corses brigade back to petersburg in virginia it was so ordered and ******* brigade was ordered to us from the department of west virginia in place of corses to seek some of the fruits of our advantage at dandridge the roads being a little firmer our leading division under general jenkins was ordered on the 21st to prepare to march towards strawberry plains and the richmond authorities were asked to send us a pontoon bridge tools of construction and to hurry forward such shoes as they could send on the 24th as the official records show general grant sent word to general halleck of our return towards knoxville that he had ordered general foster to give battle if necessary and that he would send general thomas with additional troops to insure that we would be driven from the state he also directed general thomas to go in person and take command and said i want longstreet routed and pursued beyond the limits of the state of tennessee and he ordered general foster to put his cavalry on a raid from cumberland gap to cut in upon our rear on the 26th we were advised of the advance of the enemys cavalry up the south side of the french broad to some of the fords above dandridge general martin was ordered to cross in force below it get in rear of the enemy and endeavor to put him to confusion he crossed with morgans division and called armstrongs to follow but the enemy finding opportunity to put his force against the division advanced and made a severe battle on the 27th which became desperate as developed until in their successive gallant charges our ranks were broken to confusion when the enemy made a dash and got two of our guns and two hundred prisoners driving us towards the river general armstrong crossed pending these operations and received the enemys attack on the 28th general b r johnsons infantry division had been ordered near dandridge and crossed while armstrongs command held the enemy the latter was caught in battle from which there was no escape but to fight it out johnsons infantry crossed in time to march towards the enemys rear before he could dislodge armstrong i rode a little in advance of johnsons command the enemy advised of the approach of infantry made his final charge and retired south towards marysville in his last effort one of his most reckless troopers rode in upon headquarters but colonel fairfax put spurs into his horse dashed up against him had his pistol at his head and called surrender before the man could level his gun the trooper was agreeably surprised to find it no worse the enemys move to marysville left us in possession of the foraging grounds on the 30th general grant urged general ******* army to the offensive and called for the cavalry raid through the powell river valley and cumberland gap towards our rear and general foster called on general thomas for a force of ten thousand infantry and working details to repair the railroad and bridges between knoxville and chattanooga general thomas was willing to respond to the call for troops but asked timely notice so that he could call shermans forces from mississippi to replace those to be sent and make a cooperative move against general johnston at dalton at the same time general foster called for a pontoon bridge to make his crossing of the holston at strawberry plains which was ordered general sturgis could not approve the ride through powell river valley and expressed preference for a route through the mountains of north carolina towards ********* to find our rear general grant had suggested raids from both these points on the 24th of january but general foster decided against the raid from cumberland gap explaining that general jones was at little war gap to intercept a column that might ride from that point he found too upon counting his effectives for the raid that he could only mount fifteen hundred men and that our guards at weak points had been doubled our railroad was in working order on the 26th of january and the part of the pontoon bridge ordered for us was on the road general jenkins was ordered with the leading division down towards strawberry plains to collect such material as he could and be prepared to throw the bridge across the holston as soon as it was up and ready for us notice was given general a e jackson of indications of raids to captain ****** commanding scouts to general ******* to ******* cavalry legion and joness cavalry and general vaughn was ordered to collect his command at rogersville to be prepared to threaten cumberland gap if the forces there should be reduced due notice was sent our outlying parties and scouts to be on the watch for the reported raiding parties and the guards of bridges in our rear were reinforced on the 6th of february general grant reported from nashville on the 9th majorgeneral j m schofield arrived at knoxville and assumed command of the army of the ohio general grant reported on the 11th general schofield ordered preparations for the eastern raid continued but to await further orders of execution and reported that its execution would require all of his effective mounts break his animals down and leave him without cavalry general grant wired these several despatches from nashville on february 12 later despatches from general grant and commanderinchief halleck were as follows the raids ordered north and south of us were now given over general thomas made his advance towards dalton and retired unsuccessful general halleck was right in his estimate of east tennessee as a strategic field essential to the union service the gateway to kentucky to the union line of communication and the ohio river but general grant found it so far from his lines of active operations that it could not be worked without interrupting plans of campaigns for the summer and giving his adversary opportunity to dictate the work of the year he thought it better to depend upon the conservative spirit that controlled at the south to draw the army in east tennessee off to meet threatenings in virginia and georgia when he was prepared for them on the 10th of february general jenkins was ordered with his division at strawberry plains to use the pontoon and flatboats in ******** the holston river other columns were ordered to approximate concentration including ******** brigade from bulls gap and ******* brigade coming from the department of west virginia ******* cavalry was ordered to blains crossroads on the west bank and outlying forces were advised of the advance general jenkins was ordered to put some of the cavalry over to be in observation towards knoxville and a brigade of infantry as supporting force batteries on the hither bank to cover the troops and the bridge in case the enemy was disposed to dispute our crossing and await my arrival and further orders the army being ready for the crossing and move for knoxville inquiry was made of general johnston as to the condition of affairs with the enemy at chattanooga in answer he said on the 17th i asked the richmond authorities for ten thousand additional men and general lee approving our work asked to have picketts division sent and other detachments to make up the number on the 19th i was informed from general johnstons headquarters that eight trains loaded with troops went up from chattanooga on the night of the 17th a telegram came on the 19th from richmond to say that the additional troops called for could not be sent and on the same day a telegram from the president ordered me to send general martin with his cavalry to general johnston in reply i reported that the order depriving me of the cavalry would force me to abandon the move then in progress against knoxville and draw the troops back towards bristol then came other despatches from general johnston that the enemy was still drawing forces from chattanooga but no authority came from richmond authorizing me to retain the cavalry so we were obliged to draw back to fields that could be guarded by smaller commands referring to the proposed advance general grant said longstreet cannot afford to place his force between knoxville and the tennessee it was not so intended but to put the army alongside of knoxville to hold the enemy to his intrenched lines while the troops asked for would be employed in breaking the railroad and bridges between that point and chattanooga it was thought that the army at chattanooga could not afford sufficient detachments to drive me from that work without exposing that position to danger from general johnston at dalton but upon inquiry of general johnston if he could avail himself of such opportunity he replied that he was ordered to reinforce general polk who was operating in mississippi in front of general sherman instead of reinforcing general polk the latter should have been ordered to general johnston that would have drawn general sherman to general thomas but polk having interior lines of transit could have been in time for johnston to strike and break up the road and bridge behind thomas before sherman could reach him the break could have forced thomas to care for his own position and the want of the bridge behind him might have forced him to abandon it in search of safe communication with his supplies but the authorities could not be induced to abandon the policy of placing detachments to defend points to which the enemy chose to call us we had troops enough in tennessee georgia alabama and mississippi if allowed to use them in cooperative combination to break the entire front of the federal forces and force them back into kentucky before the opening of the spring campaign when we might have found opportunity to dictate their campaign the enemy was in no condition for backward move at the time of my advance upon knoxville so simultaneous advance of our many columns could have given him serious trouble if not confusion the order for the return of martins cavalry to georgia and the notice that other troops could not be sent me called for the withdrawal of the command east where we could find safer lines of defence and good foraging the order to retire was issued and the march was taken up on the 22d of february jenkinss division and the cavalry to cover the march he was ordered to ****** the ************ destroy ********** flatboats the railroad bridge and march in advance of the cavalry he inquired if he should cut the wires and crossings of small streams but was ordered to leave them undisturbed as the enemy would not be so likely to trouble us when he found we were disposed to be accommodating the march was not seriously disturbed the enemys cavalry reduced by severe winter service was in poor condition to follow and the roads we left behind us were too heavy for artillery a good position was found behind bulls gap and the army was deployed to comfortable camps from the holston river on the right to the ********** on the left the prime object of the second advance upon knoxville was to show the strategic strength of the field and persuade the authorities that an army of twenty thousand in that zone could be of greater service than double that force on the enemys front or elsewhere but they could not or would not hear of plans that proposed to take them from the settled policy of meeting the enemy where he was prepared for us it would be difficult to find a country more inviting in agriculture and ************ than east tennessee and its mineral resources are as interesting but for those whose mission was strategic its geographical and topographical features were more striking our position at bulls gap was covered by a spur of the mountains which ****** out from the south side of the holston river towards the north bend of the ********** opening gaps that could be improved by the pick and shovel until the line became unassailable in a few days our line was strong enough and we looked for the enemy to come and try our metal until we learned that he was as badly crippled of the cavalry arm as we general martin was ordered with his division to general johnston in georgia and colonel gary with his legion was ordered to south carolina to be mounted for cavalry service the armies under general lee in virginia and general johnston in georgia were in defensive positions with little prospect of striking by their right or left flanks in search of a way to break their bounds and the army in east tennessee had been called back to the defensive for want of cavalry but the latter still covered ******** through the mountains that offered routes to kentucky for strategic manuvres the transmississippi department was an open field of vast opportunities but was lying ****** an officer of the union service had worked his way during three years of severe field service from obscure position with a regiment to command of armies and had borne his banners in triumph through battle and siege over the prejudice of higher officers until president lincolns good judgment told him that grant was the man for the times congress provided the place and the president sent his commission as lieutenantgeneral to the united states senate where it was promptly confirmed and the lieutenantgeneral was presently assigned as commander over half a million of men to the surprise of many more than all to the bureau generalinchief he was soon at work arranging his combination for the campaign of the coming year he was a west point boy and we had been together during three years of academic service then two years in the united states fourth regiment of infantry and later in worths division in mexico forced to extremities the richmond authorities began to realize the importance of finding a way out of our pentup borders before the union commander could complete his extensive arrangements to press on with his columns they called upon general lee general johnston and myself for plans or suggestions that could anticipate the movements of the enemy ********** his plans and move him to new combinations in front of general lee and on his right and left the country had been so often ******* by both union and confederate armies that it was ******* of supplies besides a forced advance of lees army could only put the enemy back a few miles to his works about washington general johnstons opportunities were no better and in addition to other difficulties he was working under the avowed displeasure of the authorities more trying than his trouble with the enemy i was under the impression that we could collect an army of twenty thousand men in south carolina by ********* our forts and positions of all men not essential for defence that that army could be quietly moved north by rail through greenville to the borders of north carolina and promptly marched by abingdon virginia through the mountain passes while my command covered the move by its position in east tennessee that army passing the mountains my command could drop off by the left to its rear and follow into *********** whole to march against the enemys only line of railway from louisville and force him to loose his hold against general johnstons front and give the latter opportunity to advance his army and call all of his troops in alabama and mississippi to like advance the grand junction of all of the columns to be made on or near the ohio ************ beauregard to command the leading column with orders not to make or accept battle until the grand junction was made that general johnston should have like orders against battle until he became satisfied of fruitful issues the supplies and transportation for beauregard to be collected at the head of the railroad in advance of the movement of troops under the ********** purpose of hauling for my command the arrangements perfected the commander of the leading column to put his troops on the rail at or near charleston and march with them as they arrived at the head of the road with this proposition i went to virginia and submitted it to general lee he approved and asked me to take it to the richmond authorities i objected that the mere fact of its coming from me would be enough to cause its rejection and asked if he approved that he would take it and submit it as his own he took me with him to richmond but went alone next morning to see the president he met besides the president the secretary of war and general bragg conference was held during the forenoon but was not conclusive in the afternoon he called me with him for further deliberation at the opening of the afternoon council it appeared that general bragg had offered a plan for early spring campaign and that it had received the approval of the ************ when asked an opinion of this i inquired as to general johnstons attitude towards it and was told that he objected that he thought the *************** country of the mountains through which he would move could not supply his army that he would consume all that he could haul before turning westward for the middle country and would be forced to active foraging from his first step between the two armies of the enemy general lee inquired if general johnston had ******** considered the matter i thought that he had and that the objections of the officer who was to conduct the campaign were of themselves reasons for overruling it but its advocates were not ready to accept a summary disposal of their plans and it began to ********* that the president had serious objections to general beauregard as a commander for the field but general lee called us back to business by asking if there was anything more to be added than general johnstons objections i called attention to general braggs official account of the battle of chickamauga in which he reported that a similar move had been proposed for him through middle tennessee towards the enemys line of communication at nashville early on the morning after the battle that he rejected it reported it visionary said that it would leave his rear open to the enemy and alluded to the country through which the march was proposed as affording no subsistence to men or animals this at harvest season too the enemy demoralized by the late battle and the confederates in the vigor of success now after a winter of foraging by the union armies the country could not be so ********* of supplies as to support us while an active army was on each flank better prepared to dispute our march general lee wore his beard full but neatly trimmed he pulled at it nervously and more vigorously as time and silence grew until at last his suppressed emotion was conquered the profound quiet of a minute or more seemed an hour when he spoke it was of other matters but the air was troubled by his efforts to surrender hopeful anticipations to the caprice of ******** he rose to take leave of the august presence gave his hand to the president and bowed himself out of the council chamber his assistant went through the same forms and no one approached the door to offer parting courtesy i had seen the general under severe trial before especially on his pennsylvania campaign when he found the cavalry under general imboden had halted for rest at hancock at the opening of an aggressive movement my similar experience with the president in the ****** talk on missionary ridge six months before had better prepared me for the ordeal and i drew some comfort from the reflection that others had their trials general lee took the next train for his army on the rapidan and i that by the direct route to my command by the southside railway when ordered from virginia in september my wife remained in petersburg with her good friend mrs **** on the 20th of october following a son was born and christened robert lee after continuous field service since the 1st of july 1861 i thought to avail myself of the privilege as department commander to take a two days leave of absence to see the precious woman and her infant boy while there it occurred to me to write to the president and try to soften the ********** of the richmond council also to find a way to overcome the objections to general beauregard i suggested too that general lee be sent to join us and have command in kentucky in reply the president sent a rebuke of my delay on my return to headquarters at greenville the other division of general johnstons cavalry was ordered to him through the mountains just then a severe snowstorm came upon us and blocked all roads meanwhile the enemy had mended his ways secured munitions and thought to march out from mossy creek as far as morristown orders were given for a march to meet him but we found ourselves in need of forage so we rested in position and presently learned that the enemy had retired towards his works our reduced cavalry force made necessary a change of position behind the holston river where a small force could at least observe our flanks and give notice of threatenings on either side a letter from the president under date of the 25th ordered that we be prepared to march to meet general johnston for the campaign through middle tennessee he was informed that we were ready only needing supplies for the march and his orders that i had cared for the bridges in that direction so that there was no reason with us for delay on the 7th of april i was ordered with the part of my command that had originally served with the army of northern virginia back to service with general lee on the rapidan the move was made as soon as cars could be had to haul the troops halting under orders at charlottesville to meet a grand flanking move then anticipated on the 22d we were ordered down as far as mechanicsville five miles west of gordonsville watching there for a lesser flank move on the 29th general lee came out and reviewed the command referring to the general officers who had been put under charges while in east tennessee general robertson had been sentenced to suspension and an excellent officer general gregg had been sent to report and was assigned to the texas brigade in the case of general mclaws the courtmartial ordered official reprimand but the president disapproved the proceedings passing reprimand upon the court and the commanding general and ordered the officer to be restored to duty which was very gratifying to me who could have taken several ********** to relieve a personal friend of embarrassing position general mclaws was a classmate and had been a warm personal friend from childhood i had no desire to put charges against him and should have failed to do so even under the directions of the authorities i am happy to say that our personal relations are as close and interesting as they have ever been and that his heart was big enough to separate official duties and personal relations charges had been preferred against brigadiergeneral e m law for *************** disposing of an official communication to the war department that had been intrusted to his care in which was enclosed his pretended resignation from the confederate army the president refused to entertain the charges and ordered the officer released from arrest and restored to his command of the paper that was ********** disposed of general cooper adjutant and inspectorgeneral of the army reported general lee wrote to the department of the charges the *********** of general cooper shows that the paper was ************ handled the letter of general lee shows the offence a high crime and misdemeanor general lee wrote to inform me that the authorities at richmond had ordered general law to be restored to duty with his command the limit of endurance had thus been reached and passed i ordered the ******** of general law upon his appearance within the limits of the command to hold me at the head of the command while encouraging mutinous conduct in its ranks was beyond all laws and customs of war and i wrote general lee that my orders were out to have general law again put under arrest and that the case should be brought before a military tribunal or i must be relieved of duty in the confederate states service the authorities then thought to find their way by transferring me to another command but on that point general lee became impatient and inclined to serious thought and action the commander of the army was involved as well as the commander of the first corps and both or neither must be relieved the authorities halted and that was the last that i heard of general law until his newspaper articles began to appear years after the surrender the following vote of thanks given by the congress at this juncture affords a remarkable commentary upon the conduct of the authorities as well as constituting a compliment most heartily appreciated by the recipients after reporting the return of my command to service with the army of northern virginia i took the earliest opportunity to suggest that the preliminaries of the campaign should be carefully confined to strategic manuvre until we could show better generalship that accomplished i argued the enemys forces would lose confidence in the superiority of their leaders skill and prowess that both armies were composed of intelligent experienced veterans who were as quick to discover the better handling of their ranks as trained generals that by such successful manuvres the confederates would gain confidence and power as the enemy began to lose prestige that then we could begin to look for a favorable opportunity to call the enemy to aggressive work while immediate aggression from us against his greater numbers must make our labors heavy and more or less doubtful that we should first show that the power of battle is in generalship more than in the number of soldiers which properly illustrated would make the weaker numbers of the contention the stronger force in this connection i refer to the policy of attrition which became a prominent feature during part of the campaign and showed that the enemy put his faith in numbers more than in superior skill and generalship general grant made his headquarters near the army of the potomac in culpeper county virginia commanded by majorgeneral george g meade it had been organized into three corps second fifth and sixth commanded respectively by majorgeneral w s hancock majorgeneral g k warren and majorgeneral john sedgwick all in ********** near culpeper courthouse the ninth corps was a distinct body reorganized under majorgeneral a e burnside and posted in cooperative position near the railroad bridge over the rappahannock river the aggregate of the two commands was about one hundred and thirty thousand men classified as follows these figures are from majorgeneral a a humphreys chief of staff of the army of the potomac but general badeau in his military history of u s grant p ## gives as the exact numbers put into battle after deducting a division of colored troops not then used for battle service the following the army of northern virginia stood on the west side of rapidan river mine run on its right extending north the left division r h andersons looking towards madison courthouse the second and third corps commanded by lieutenantgenerals r s ewell and a p hill two divisions and alexanders artillery of longstreets first corps being held at mechanicsville but general badeau objects on authority of a letter from general bragg to general joseph e johnston stating that i had fourteen thousand men in my command if general braggs letter referred to my command in east tennessee it was accurate enough but buckners division of that command the cavalry and other detachments were left in east tennessee general badeau claims besides six thousand ********** men and conscripts as joining the army between the 20th of april and the 4th of may of this there is no official record and it is more than probable that new cases of sick and ********** men of that interval were as many at least as the fragmentary parties that joined us general humphreys reported me as having fifteen thousand men if he intended those figures as the strength of the first corps he is accurate enough but picketts division of that corps was not with it nor did it return to the army of northern virginia until late in the campaign so i find no good reason for changing the figures of colonel taylor except so far as to add johnsons brigade of rodess division which is reported to have joined the second corps on the 6th of ************ at #### which added to ##### would make the total ##### but general ewells official account of numbers on the morning of the 6th of may puts his force at ##### which is better authority than colonel taylors from the return of april 20 or general ******* computation to these figures should be added johnsons brigade that reported later of the day estimated by general badeau at #### which makes the aggregate of the second corps 17000 and brings that of the army of northern virginia back to ##### however the numerical strength of armies should not be considered as of exclusive bearing upon the merits of the campaign the commanders had chosen their battle after mature deliberation they knew of each others numbers and resources before they laid their plans and they had even known each other personally for more than twenty years each had the undivided support and confidence of his government and his army and it was time now to leave the past and give attention to the future general lee had acquired fame as a strategist in his two years service in the army of northern virginia and general grant by his three years service in the west had come to be known as an ******** soldier seldom if ever surpassed but the biggest part of him was his heart they were equally ********** and *********** the more deliberate six months before the opening of the impending campaign in november 1863 general meade essaying a blow at the army of northern virginia crossed the rapidan below general lees right and deployed along the south side of mine run but found lees line so strong and so improved by fieldworks that he felt constrained to withdraw without making battle as the purpose of this writing is to convey ideas of personal observations and experience it will be confined as far as practicable to campaigns or parts of them with which i was directly or indirectly connected so when participants and partisans have passed away i shall have contributed my share towards putting the historian in possession of evidence which he can weigh with that of other actors in the great drama at midnight of the 3d of may 1864 the army of the potomac took its line of march for the lower crossings of the rapidan river at germania and elys fords the fifth and sixth corps for the former the second for the latter wilsons division of cavalry leading the first greggs the second column the cavalry was to secure the crossings and lay bridges for the columns as they came up wilsons cavalry crossed at germania ford drove off the confederate outpost and began the construction of a bridge at daylight gregg also was successful and the bridges were ready when the solid columns came warrens fifth corps crossed after wilsons cavalry marching westward as far as wilderness tavern sedgwicks corps followed and pitched camp near the crossing hancocks corps followed greggs cavalry and made camp at chancellorsville generals grant and meade went over after warrens column and established headquarters near the crossing general grant despatched for burnsides corps to come and join him by night march sheridan was expected to engage stuarts cavalry at hamiltons crossing near fredericksburg general grant had no fixed plan of campaign beyond the general idea to avoid the strong defensive line occupied by general lee behind mine run and find a way to draw him out to open battle the wilderness is a forest land of about fifteen miles square lying between and *********** from orange courthouse and fredericksburg it is broken occasionally by small farms and abandoned ********* and two ******** orange plank road and the turnpike which are cut at right angles by the germania ****** general course nearly parallel open ways through it between fredericksburg and the courthouse the germania ford road joins the brock road the strategic line of the military zone and crosses the turnpike at wilderness tavern and the plank road about two miles south of that point though the march was set on foot at midnight it was soon made known to general lee and its full purport was revealed by noon of the 4th and orders were sent the different commanders for their march to meet the ******** second corps ewells consisting of rodess johnsons and earlys divisions by the orange turnpike the third a p ****** h andersons heths and wilcoxs *********** the orange plank road general lees signals were interpreted and sent to general grant who so far modified his plans as to prepare for immediate battle the commands of the first corps fields and kershaws divisions and alexanders batteries were stationed fields north of gordonsville where he had been posted on the 1st of may in anticipation of a move around our left the other commands near mechanicsville we were ordered forward by the plank road to parkers store the order was received after one oclock and sent out for information of the commanders who were ordered to prepare and march but i asked for and received authority to march by a shorter route that would at the same time relieve the plank road of pressure of troops and trains for we had been crowded off the road once before by putting too many troops upon a single track by the same despatch i asked and subsequently obtained leave to go on to the brock road where we could look for and hope to intercept the enemys march and cause him to develop plans before he could get out of the wilderness we marched at four oclock by the lawyers road our chief quartermaster colonel taylor whose home was between orange courthouse and the wilderness had been ordered to secure the services of the most competent guide to be found we halted at ****** bridge for rest and there colonel taylor brought up our guide james robinson who had been for several years the sheriff of the county and whose whole life had been spent in the wilderness the march was resumed and continued with swinging step with occasional rests until we reached richards shops at five pm of the 5th there we overtook rossers cavalry engaged in severe encounter with part of sheridans the enemy abandoned the contest and rode away leaving his dead with some of ours on the field the distance of march was twentyeight miles soon after my arrival at the shops colonel venable of general headquarters staff came with orders for a change of direction of the column through the wood to unite with the troops of the third corps on the plank road the rear of my column closed up at dark and orders were sent to prepare to resume march at twelve oclock the accounts we had of the days work were favorable to the confederates but the change of direction of our march was not reassuring in accordance with the general plan of turning the confederate right without touching our intrenched line along mine run the army of the potomac had been put in motion early on the 5th the second corps towards shady grove church by the todds tavern road the fifth by the dirt road towards parkers store on the plank road the sixth on the right to follow the fifth as movements developed general warren moved with three divisions leaving griffins on the turnpike presently after taking up his march towards parkers store the confederates were discovered on the plank road and general meade ordered the corps made ready for battle the sixth except gettys division was ordered to make connection on the right of the fifth by wood roads and prepare for the battle gettys division was ordered to the plank road at the brock road crossing to hold that point at all hazards until the second corps could join it the latter being recalled from todds tavern for that holding and developments there indicated at noon general warren was prepared on the turnpike and attacked with griffins and wadsworths divisions general lees orders were against a general engagement until his forces were in hand but the troops had met and action could not wait warrens attack had some success as by his orders general ewell felt called upon to delay battle but a sudden dash of the enemy broke into disorder his brigade under j m jones also battles brigade but other of his troops joined them recovered his ground drove off the attacking forces taking two guns and called warrens corps to better concentration the sixth was to be with warren but was delayed by the narrow tangled roads till night general ewell prepared for the next day by intrenching his front meanwhile general hill had pushed the divisions under heth and wilcox along the plank road until they were near the brock road crossing occupied by gettys division of the sixth corps general getty was in time to drive back a few of our men who had reached the brock road in observation and hancocks corps joined him at two pm fronting his **************** motts gibbons and ************ the brock road on the left of gettys his artillery was massed on his left near barlow except a battery nearer the plank road and one section at the crossing he ordered his line intrenched as soon as he found his troops in hand at the crossroads general meade ordered them into action gettys division supported by the second corps was to drive hill back occupy parkers store and connect with warrens line he afterwards learned of the repulse of warren on the turnpike but repeated his orders for the advance on the plank road at ### gettys division advanced and met the divisions of heth and wilcox a few hundred yards in advance of their trenches in the fierce engagement that followed birneys and motts divisions were engaged on gettys left and later the brigades of carroll and owen of gibbons division wadsworths division and ******* brigade of the fifth corps were put in to aid gettys right the combination forced heth and wilcox back about half a mile when the battle rested for the night hancock reinforced his front by ***** brigade of gibbons division and was diligently employed at his lines during the night putting up fieldworks about eleven oclock in the night the guide reported from general lee to conduct my command through the wood across to the plank road and at one oclock the march was resumed the road was overgrown by the bushes except the ********** made by the draft animals and the ruts of wheels which marked occasional lines in its course after a time the wood became less dense and the unused road was more difficult to follow and presently the guide found that there was no road under him but no time was lost as by ordering the lines of the divisions doubled they were ready when the trail was found and the march continued in double line at daylight we entered the plank road and filed down towards the field of strife of the afternoon of the 5th and daylight of the 6th r h andersons division of the third corps marching on the plank road had rested at verdierville during the night and was called to the front in the morning the divisions of heth and wilcox rested during the night of the 5th where the battle of that day ceased but did not prepare ammunition nor strengthen their lines for defence because informed that they were to be relieved from the front both the division commanders claim that they were to be relieved and that they were ordered not to intrench or replenish supplies so it seems that they were all night within hearing of the voices of hancocks men not even ************ their lines so as to offer a front of battle general heth has stated that he proposed to arrange for battle but was ordered to give his men rest while hancock was sending men to his advanced line during the night and intrenching there and on his second line the confederates were all night idle hancock advanced and struck the divisions before sunrise just as my command reported to general lee my line was formed on the right and left of the plank road kershaw on the right field on the left as the line deployed the divisions of heth and wilcox came back upon us in disorder more and more confused as their steps hurried under hancocks musketry as my ranks formed the men broke files to give free passage for their comrades to the rear the advancing fire was getting brisk but not a shot was fired in return by my troops until the divisions were ready three of fields brigades the texas alabama and bennings georgia were formed in line on the left of the road and three of kershaws on the right general lee appalled at the condition of affairs thought to lead the texas brigade alone into desperate charge before my lines were well formed the ordeal was trying but the steady troops seeing him off his balance refused to follow begged him to retire and presently colonel venable of his staff reported to me general lees efforts to lead the brigade and suggested that i should try to call him from it i asked that he would say with my compliments that his line would be recovered in an hour if he would permit me to handle the troops but if my services were not needed i would like to ride to some place of safety as it was not quite comfortable where we were as full lines of battle could not be handled through the thick wood i ordered the advance of the six brigades by heavy skirmish lines to be followed by stronger supporting lines hancocks lines thinned by their push through the wood and somewhat by the fire of the disordered divisions weaker than my line of fresh and more lively skirmishers were checked by our first steady rolling fire and after a brisk fusillade were pushed back to their intrenched line when the fight became steady and very firm occasionally swinging parts of my line back and compelling the reserves to move forward and recover it general lee sent general m l smith of the engineers to report to me he was ordered through the wood on my right to the unfinished railroad to find a way around the left of the enemys line while we engaged his front r h andersons division of the third corps came up about eight oclock and was ordered to report to me hancocks early advance was under a general order including the army of the potomac the ninth corps that had been called up reported to general grant and was ordered in between the plank and turnpike roads at eight oclock hancock was reinforced by ********** division of the ninth and wadsworth of the fifth was put under his orders at nine oclock he attacked with wadsworths birneys ********** and motts divisions and the brigades of webb carroll and owen of gibbons division making as formidable battle as could be organized in the wood but the tangle thinned his lines and our fire held him in desperate engagement two divisions of the ninth corps at the same time marching for parkers store were encountered between the plank and turnpike roads by our second corps ewells under this combination the forces struggled an hour at the extreme tension of skill and valor about ten oclock general smith returned and reported favorably of his reconnoissance that the heavy woodland concealed the route of the proposed flank march and that there was no force of the enemy in observation hancocks left on the brock road was in strong *********** position but there was room along its front for our troops to march near the unfinished railroad beyond view of that left on the brock road general smith was then asked to take a small party and pass beyond the brock road and find a way for turning the extreme union left on that road there were two brigades of fields division and one of kershaws not on the line of battle but on flank march as supports and r h andersons division of the third corps colonel sorrel chief of staff was ordered to conduct three brigades g t andersons of fields mahones of r h andersons and woffords of kershaws division by the route recommended by general smith have them faced to the left and marched down against hancocks left daviss brigade of the third corps also got into this command as soon as the troops struck hancock his line began to break first slowly then rapidly somehow as they retreated a fire was accidentally started in the dry leaves and began to spread as the confederates advanced mahones brigade approached the burning leaves and part of it broke off a little to get around but the twelfth virginia was not obstructed by the blaze and moved directly on at the plank road colonel sorrel rode back to join us all of the enemys battle on the right of the plank road was broken up and general field was fighting severely with his three brigades on the left against wadsworth and ********* pushing them a little the twelfth virginia regiment got to the plank road some little time before the other regiments of the brigade and viewing the contention on the farther side between fields and wadsworths divisions dashed across and struck the left of wadsworths line this relieved field a little and under this concentrating push and fire wadsworth fell mortally wounded in a little while followed the general break of the union battle the break of his left had relieved kershaws troops and he was waiting for the time to advance and jenkinss brigade that had been held in reserve and that part of r h andersons division not in use were ready and anxious for opportunity to engage and followed as our battle line pushed forward general smith then came and reported a way across the brock road that would turn hancocks extreme left he was asked to conduct the flanking brigades and handle them as the ranking officer he was a splendid tactician as well as skilful engineer and gallant withal he started and not to lose time or distance moved by ********* woffords left leading woffords favorite manuvre as woffords left stepped out the other troops moved down the plank road jenkinss brigade by the road kershaws division alongside i rode at the head of the column jenkins kershaw and the staff with me after discussing the dispositions of their troops for ********* battle jenkins rode closer to offer congratulations saying i am happy i have felt despair of the cause for some months but am relieved and feel assured that we will put the enemy back across the rapidan before night little did he or i think these sanguine words were the last he would utter when wadsworth fell the union battle broke up in hasty retreat fields brigades closed to fresh ranks the flanking brigades drew into line near the plank road and with them the other regiments of mahones brigade but the twelfth regiment some distance in advance of the others had crossed the road to strike at wadsworths left before the other regiments were in sight and was returning to find its place in line the order for the flanking brigades to resume march by their left had not moved those brigades of the right as the twelfth regiment marched back to find its place on the other side of the plank road it was mistaken in the wood for an advance of the enemy and fire was opened on it from the other regiments of the brigade the men threw themselves to the ground to let the fire pass just then our party of officers was up and rode under the fire general jenkins had not finished the expressions of joyful congratulations which i have quoted when he fell mortally wounded captain **** and the orderly bowen of kershaws staff were killed general kershaw turned to quiet the troops when jenkinss brigade with levelled guns were in the act of returning the fire of the supposed enemy concealed in the wood but as kershaws clear voice called out friends the arms were recovered without a shot in return and the men threw themselves down upon their faces at the moment that jenkins fell i received a severe shock from a ***** ball passing through my throat and right shoulder the blow lifted me from the saddle and my right arm dropped to my side but i settled back to my seat and started to ride on when in a minute the flow of blood admonished me that my work for the day was done as i turned to ride back members of the staff seeing me about to fall dismounted and lifted me to the ground orders were given general field the senior officer present to push on before the enemy could have time to rally the two lines marching along the plank road southward in pursuit and the flanking brigades to move in the other direction were for the moment a little perplexing as he was not accurately advised of the combinations but he grasped the situation before he was prepared however general r h anderson came into command as senior and then general lee came up the plans orders and opportunity were explained to him but the woods concealed everything except the lines of troops alongside the road general lee did not care to handle the troops in broken lines and ordered formation in a general line for parallel battle the change in the forest tangle consumed several hours of precious time and gave general hancock time to collect his men into battle order post his heavy reinforcements and improve his intrenchments after several hours of work our new line was finally adjusted and ordered forward it approached the enemys stronghold in ranks a little thinned by the march through the wood and the enemys fire made desperate and repeated charges and jenkinss gallant brigade mounted their breastworks but the solid ranks behind them threw it off with the lines that essayed to give it support and the whole were forced back from their fight thus the battle lost and won three times during the day wore itself out general ewell found opportunity before night to push some of his brigades around the enemys right and did clever work in taking a number of ***************** seymour and ****** among thembut it was too late in the day to follow his work with a strong fight he handled his troops with skill and care putting defensive works before them whenever they halted like attention by general hancock may be noted while in marked contrast was the conduct of the third corps after their affair on the afternoon of the 5th the commanders of the leading divisions of the third had proposed to prepare their troops for the next day but were ordered to give their men rest and told that they were to be relieved and withdrawn from the battle not even a line of battle was formed so that they were in disorder when they were struck in the morning and speedily fell into confusion my command less than ten thousand had found the battle on the plank road in retreat little less than a panic in a few hours we changed defeat to victory the broken divisions of the third corps rallying in their rear as my litter was borne to the rear my hat was placed over my face and soldiers by the roadside said he is dead and they are telling us he is only wounded hearing this repeated from time to time i raised my hat with my left hand when the burst of voices and the flying of hats in the air ***** my pains somewhat but micah jenkins who fell by the same fire was no more he was one of the most estimable characters of the army his taste and talent were for military service he was intelligent quick untiring attentive zealous in discharge of duty truly faithful to official obligations abreast with the foremost in battle and withal a humble noble christian in a moment of highest earthly hope he was transported to serenest heavenly joy to that life beyond that knows no bugle call beat of drum or clash of steel may his beautiful spirit through the mercy of god rest in peace amen ******* ******* ******** ******* an *********** which seems an appropriate substitute is a level head a level head always a level head with patience to wait ten minutes to see my flanking brigades stretched out on their march to retrieve my aplomb we could have found a good battle against hancocks strong left while we broke over his confused front fearing another change of plan i hurried on to execute before it could be ordered there were twentytwo thousand men in the third corps it is not claiming too much therefore to say that that corps carefully prepared during the night of the 5th could have held hancocks battle on the morning of the 6th until my attack of his left could have relieved them under that plan events support the claim that the third corps intrenched in their advanced position with fresh supplies and orders to hold their ground could have received and held against hancocks early battle until my command could have come in on his left rear and completed our strongly organized battle by which we could have carried the wilderness even down and into the classic rapidan general field says in his account of the day colonel fairfax says a northern historian says some years after the affair on the plank road general hancock said to me he explained that reinforcements crowding up through the wood the retreating troops and confusion caused by ****** in with wagontrains and horses made a troublesome tangle but it was ********** and his troops at rest when the final attack was made he had sixty thousand men in hand bad as was being shot by some of our own troops in the battle of the ************** was an honest mistake one of the accidents of ******** shot at since the war by many officers was worse fitzhugh lee wrote of me in the southern historical society papers *** v no 4 april 1878 saying among other things he lost his way and reached the wilderness twentyfour hours behind time now from mechanicsville to parkers store by our line of march was thirtyfour ******* the plank road thirtyfive from parkers store to the battle three miles from the time of our march to going into battle was thirtysix hours including all of two nights deducting twentyfour hours alleged as lost leaves twelve hours including all night of the 4th for the march of thirtyseven miles his logic and method of injury remind one of the french teacher who when out of patience with the boys used to say i will give you **** and mark you absent another report started by fitzhugh lee as coming from his cousin g w c lee was that general lee said that he sent an officer to longstreet to stay with and show him the roads this like all other reported sayings of general lee in regard to me was not published until after general lees death when it was first published i wrote general g w c lee for the name of the officer sent he referred me to the members of general lees staff not one of them knew of the circumstance or the officer but referred me to general lees engineers after long search i found the engineers and applied for information but not one of them knew anything of the alleged fact i had the letters published as an advertisement for the officer who was claimed as my guide no response came i inquired of the members of the staff first corps not one had seen or heard of such a person the quartermaster colonel taylor who was ordered to secure a competent guide at the first moment of receipt of orders to march reported of the matter thus these efforts to secure one witness in support of the allegation or rather to prove a ******** were all that occurred to me at the time and now i can think of but one more chance which is for fitzhugh lee to offer a liberal reward it is not probable that he would fail to find a false witness who could answer for a time to support the false charges it may be added that the accounts of the march by other officers agree with mine as already given i present here a letter from general alexander and an extract from one written me by colonel venable the former says colonel venable writes from the wilderness i was taken to the meadow farm home of my friend ******* taylor and carefully nursed by his charming wife until put on board of a train for lynchburg and taken to my good kinswoman mrs caroline garland who had lost her only son and child general samuel garland killed two years before at south mountain from her hospitable home when strong enough for a ride in the fresh air i was taken to the home of a cherished friend colonel john d alexander at campbell courthouse but a raiding party rode through the village early one morning which suggested a change and i was taken to my ******** the ******* at augusta georgia and after a time to other good friends the harts and daniels at and near union point on the georgia railroad before i was strong enough to sit more than a few minutes news came of the change of commanders in the army of ********** *********** of general joseph e johnston by assignment of general j b hood and i was asked to take command of the corps left vacant by assignment of general hood answer was made that when able for duty i would be prepared to obey orders later came sadder news from virginia announcing the fall of our cavalier j e b stuart the most famous american rider fell mortally wounded on the 18th of may 1864 near yellow tavern in a cavalry engagement with general sheridan just then budding into fame stuart endowed by nature with the gifts that go to make a perfect cavalryman improved and cultivated through years of active warfare experience and discipline was the embodiment of all that goes to make up the ideal soldierly ************ bold dashing dragoon his death was possibly a greater loss to the confederate army even than that of the *********** general stonewall jackson through all the

to ride horseback and after a little practice and having become weary of idle hours took leave of wife and children and travelled back to richmond to find our great commander and his noble followers the general seemed worn by past labor besides suffering at seasons from severe ******** while his work was accumulating and his troubles *********** to proportions that should have employed half a dozen able men the military staff of his headquarters was made up of excellent intelligent active zealous young men more than anxious to anticipate his wants and to meet their official obligations and it is a source of gratification to write that they were efficient affectionate admirable and polite but facts will not justify like commendation of the ********* department complaints had been made early in the war and continued of our inefficient subsistence department at richmond the diminishing resources of the country called for ************* earnest ********** business faculties in these departments especially that of subsistence but unfortunately as our resources became more circumscribed the officers instead of putting forth stronger efforts in their business seemed to lose the energy of their former service and general lee found himself called upon to feed as well as fight his army although anxious to assist in his severe trials and relieve him of part of his work i feared that he might think a cripple an additional *********** and wrote the chief of staff an order came assigning me to command on the north side of james river and drurys bluff and picketts division on the south side along bermuda hundred front as far as swift creek on the north side were the local defence troops under lieutenantgeneral ewell and hokes and fields divisions and garys brigade of one thousand cavalry there had been severe fighting on that side a few days previous in an attack of the federals upon fort harrison of our line which resulted in the capture of the fort then a more desperate fight of the confederates to recover it which was not successful the loss of fort harrison broke our line off a little near the river and caused a new line to be taken from that point to our left where it joined the line occupied in 1862 when general mcclellan was against us the line of the north side extended from chapins bluff on the james river by fort gilmer across north of white oak swamp to the vicinity of the chickahominy at new bridge hokes and fields divisions occupied the line from fort gilmer covering charles city road on the left and garys cavalry had a strong picket force on the nine miles road with vedettes to guard and ****** the west side of the swamp and the south side of the chickahominy the crossings of the swamp were heavily obstructed by fallen timber the batteries at chapins and drurys bluffs were manned by officers of the navy and sailors and other organized artillery and infantry and the local defence contingent lined out towards fort gilmer my men had become experts in fortifying so that parapets and dams along the front grew apace our officers during their experience in east tennessee had become skilled as ******** and soon began to find in nooks and corners of northern virginia food and forage which relieved general lee of the trouble of supplying the men on the north side and my troops were beginning to feel comfortable but there were more serious embarrassments on the south side and desertions were becoming more numerous from day to day towards the latter part of october general grant conceived a plan by which he proposed to extend and advance his left so as to get the southside railroad and connect this new point with his line of intrenchments at the same time he thought to have general butler on his extreme right break through the lines on the north side into richmond for his left attack he ordered the second corps under hancock to be supported by parts of the fifth and ninth corps general lee had his third corps a p hills heths and wilcoxs divisions and mahones in reserve hancocks advance was met by mahones division and the entire march of the different commands was arrested after a severe ********** in which mahone got a number of prisoners and some pieces of ************ latter not brought off as the enemy held the bridge according to the reports of the **************** office the federal losses were #### the confederate losses were not accurately accounted for but the federal accounts claimed two hundred prisoners taken at one time and other losses equal to their own i was informed of troops crossing the bridge to the north side on the 25th and that the crossings continued at intervals till after the night of the 26th the plan of operations contemplated that general butler should have twenty thousand men north of the james where longstreet was now in command these were parts of the tenth and eighteenth corps commanded by generals terry and weitzel general terry was to make a fierce demonstration against our front along the darby and charles city roads with the tenth while general weitzel was to march the eighteenth across white oak swamp and get in the unoccupied lines on the williamsburg road or between that and garys cavalry on the nine miles road early on the 27th general terry moved out with the tenth corps and made demonstration for formidable attack putting his infantry in sharp practice along the outer edge of our abatis and his artillery in practice near the roads our sharpshooters opened in reply from behind their breastworks and held a lively rattle of musketry for quite a time the delay in making more serious work told me that some other was the point of danger which must mean the unoccupied lines beyond white oak swamp field was ordered to pull his division out of the works and march for the williamsburg road hoke to cover the line of field by extending and doubling his sharpshooters when the head of general fields column got to the williamsburg road the enemys skirmishers were deployed and halfway across the field approaching our line just behind the trenches was a growth of pines which concealed our troops until a line of sharpshooters stepped into the works their fire surprised the enemy somewhat as they had seen nothing but part of garys cavalry and their skirmish line gave up the field for their heavy infantry the open in front of the breastworks was about six hundred yards wide and twelve hundred in length extending from the york river railroad on the north to a ditch draining towards the head of white oak swamp on the south about midway of the field is a slight depression or swale of five or six feet depth quickly following the repulse of the skirmish line and just as field had adjusted the infantry and artillery to their trenches came the eighteenth corps bursting into the open and ********* on both sides of the road in solid ranks they were at once in fair canister range and soon under the terrific fire of a solid line of **************** so experienced that they were not likely to throw as much as one bullet without welldirected aim at the first fire they began to drop and they fell more rapidly until they reached the swale when the entire line dropped to the ground they had just enough cover there for their bodies as they spread themselves closely to the ground but not enough to permit them to load or rise to deliver fire without exposing their persons to our fire to attempt to retreat would have been as disastrous as to advance so they were entrapped general gary reported that the field of the nine miles road was clear and was ordered to come in on the flank of the entrapped infantry and order surrender but before he was there another report reached him of a formidable force advancing against his squadron on the nine miles road he was sent on a gallop to meet this meanwhile the troops hiding under the swell of ground found ways to drop off on their right under the railroad cut and many others got away down the dry ditch on their left until captain lyle of the fifth south carolina regiment got a force out on the flank and secured the surrender of the remainder he picked up about six hundred prisoners general garys guard on the nine miles road held an open work by a section of artillery and a squadron of cavalry the advance against it was so well executed and our cavalry so interested in the operations on the williamsburg road that the guard was taken by surprise and pushed away from its post by the first attack losing its fieldworks and a piece of artillery gary soon made amends for the careless watch by dismounting his brigade and marching in line of battle at right angles to the line of the enemy striking him in flank recovering the lost cannon and driving him back the way he came under cover of the night the federals returned to their fortified lines where they were as strong as were the lines held by the confederates in their front the confederates lost fields division ## garys cavalry 8 artillery 11 total 64 federal losses killed wounded and missing #### general grant sent orders to have the positions gained by his left held and intrenched but they were abandoned because they were weak in the too extended line after the loss of fort harrison general lee became more anxious for his line on the north side and rode out to witness the operations on that front under the threatening of butlers forces and as our cavalry had made no report of the enemy crossing the swamp he was not quite satisfied to have the troops moved over to the williamsburg road but did not order them retained his idea was that the north side was the easier route of grants triumphal march into richmond and that sooner or later he would make his effort there in great force these were the closing scenes between the armies about richmond and petersburg for the year 1864 the defeat of general early in the valley of virginia on the 19th of october concluded active work in that quarter most of sheridans infantry was sent back to the army of the potomac and the greater part of earlys to the army of northern virginia kershaws division of the first corps had been left with general early for his battle of the 19th of october in his account of the battle general early alludes to its outcome and ******** as a ********* panic started by the break of his left division under general gordon followed by kershaws and other troops it is sufficient for this writing to say that the general called the rout thorough and disgraceful mortifying beyond measure we had within our grasp a great and glorious victory and lost it by the uncontrollable ********** of our men for plunder kershaws division was restored to duty with the first corps in november late in december i was informed of a move of the enemys land and naval forces against fort fisher in wilmington harbor the information was despatched to general lee at petersburg and brought a midnight order for me to send hokes division to wilmington hoke was relieved and on the move before daylight general bragg was relieved of duty at richmond and ordered to wilmington general butler was in command of the land forces and admiral porter of the navy between them or under the direction of one or the other was the steamer louisiana freighted with about two hundred and fifty tons of gunpowder intended to blow up fort fisher but its only tangible effect was to relieve the commander of the land forces from further service in the field in georgia general hood led his army off from the front of general sherman at atlanta and marched west and north and the latter took up his line of march south for savannah on the 16th of november these moves brought shermans army into remote bearing upon our army at richmond and as a matter of course it began to receive more careful attention from general lee in order to better guard our position on the north side i ordered in addition to the timber obstructions over white oak swamp the roads leading around towards our left to be broken up by ******* ******* so as to make greater delay of any movements in that direction during the winter rains and wrote to ask general lee if he could not order the roads upon which general grant would probably march against the southside railroad broken in the same way also suggesting that the roads in georgia upon which general sherman was marching could be obstructed in this and other ways so as to delay and annoy his march with the possibility that it might eventually be broken up the pickets along our lines were in more or less practice shooting at each other from their riflepits until i ordered it stopped on the north end of the line as an annoyance and not a legitimate part of war to carry on the shooting of sentinels on guard duty the example was soon followed by the army on our front so that the men on the picket lines became friendly and afterwards came to mutual ********** to give the other side notice in case of battle in time for the pickets to get to their pits before the batteries could open on them before the winter was half gone the pickets established quite a ********* trade giving tobacco for sugar and coffee our foraging parties of the north side were fortunate in collecting supplies and at times were in condition to aid our comrades of the south side but the officers found that they could only get a small portion of the produce by *********** or tax in kind they were ordered to ****** all supplies that they could not collect the chief of staff of the first corps colonel sorrel was appointed brigadiergeneral and relieved of his duties by colonel ***** latrobe the army of tennessee under general hood pursuing its march northward late in november and early in december came upon the federal forces under general schofield at franklin and general thomas at nashville tennessee where desperate battles were fought until hoods army was reduced to skeleton commands and forced to retreat and thus with shermans progressive movements in the extreme south our own ill success in virginia and an apparent general strengthening of the federal cause the year 1864 drew to a close with little of happy omen for the confederacy the second expedition against wilmington was sent in january 1865 general terry commanding the land and *********** porter the naval forces after very desperate work the fort and outworks were carried the commander general whiting being mortally and colonel lamb severely wounded all points of the harbor were captured by the enemy the confederates losing besides most of the ********* of the forts about two thousand five hundred officers and men in killed wounded and prisoners general terrys loss was about five hundred a remarkable ********** storming of a position fortified during months and years of labor and by most approved engineering as the first months of 1865 passed the confederate congress realized the extreme tension of affairs and provided among other expedients for the enrollment of negroes as confederate soldiers other measures for giving confidence and strength to the cause were adopted on the 21st of january the confederate president was informed of disaffection in the virginia legislature and what was more significant in the confederate congress where a resolution expressive of want of confidence in the chief executive was under informal consideration and would undoubtedly pass by a large vote if introduced at this critical juncture it seems that a compromise was effected it was agreed that congress should enact a law providing a supreme commander of the confederate armies this law to be approved by the president who should then call general lee to the exercise of the functions of that office the intention was to invest him with *********** power during the early days of february hon montgomery blair visited richmond upon a mission of peace and brought about a meeting at hampton roads between president lincoln and secretary seward and the confederate vicepresident alexander h stephens and the hon r m t hunter and judge j a campbell president lincoln was firm for the surrender of the confederate armies and the abolition of slavery which the confederate president did not care to consider about the 15th of february majorgeneral j c breckenridge was appointed secretary of war and brigadiergeneral f m st john was appointed commissarygeneral of subsistence general ord commanding the army of the james sent me a note on the 20th of february to say that the ********* between our troops on the picket lines was irregular that he would be pleased to meet me and arrange to put a stop to such intimate intercourse as a soldier he knew his orders would stop the business it was evident therefore that there was other matter he would introduce when the meeting could be had i wrote in reply appointing a time and place between our lines we met the next day and presently he asked for a side interview when he spoke of the purpose of the meeting i mentioned a simple manner of correcting the matter which he accepted without objection or amendment then he spoke of affairs military and political referring to the recent conference of the confederates with president lincoln at hampton roads he said that the politicians of the north were afraid to touch the question of peace and there was no way to open the subject except through officers of the armies on his side they thought the war had gone on long enough that we should come together as former comrades and friends and talk a little he suggested that the work as belligerents should be suspended that general grant and general lee should meet and have a talk that my wife who was an old acquaintance and friend of mrs grant in their girlhood days should go into the union lines and visit mrs grant with as many confederate officers as might choose to be with her then mrs grant would return the call under escort of union officers and visit richmond that while general lee and general grant were arranging for better feeling between the armies they could be aided by intercourse between the ladies and officers until terms honorable to both sides could be found i told general ord that i was not authorized to speak on the subject but could report upon it to general lee and the confederate authorities and would give notice in case a reply could be made general lee was called over to richmond and we met at night at the presidents mansion ************** breckenridge was there the report was made several hours were passed in discussing the matter and finally it was agreed that favorable report should be made as soon as another meeting could be arranged with general ord secretary breckenridge expressed especial approval of the part assigned for the ladies as we separated i suggested to general lee that he should name some irrelevant matter as the occasion of his call for the interview with general grant and that once they were together they could talk as they pleased a telegram was sent my wife that night at lynchburg calling her to richmond and the next day a note was sent general ord asking him to appoint a time for another meeting the meeting was appointed for the day following and the result of the conference was reported general ord asked to have general lee write general grant for an interview stating that general grant was prepared to receive the letter and thought that a way could be found for a military convention while old friends of the military service could get together and seek out ways to stop the flow of blood he indicated a desire on the part of president lincoln to devise some means or excuse for paying for the liberated slaves which might be arranged as a condition and part of the terms of the convention and relieve the matter of political bearing but those details were in the form of remote probabilities to be discussed when the parties became advanced in their search for ways of settlement on the 1st of march i wrote general lee giving a report of the second interview and on the 2d he wrote general grant as follows the letter was sent to me open with instructions to read seal and forward i rode into richmond to ask that some other business should be named as the cause of the call for the interview but he was not disposed to approach his purpose by diplomacy and ordered the letter to be delivered he sent another letter however to which general grant replied under the impression that general lee would construe the act of congress in its broad sense and proceed to handle the confederate armies and affairs under his own good judgment i wrote begging that he would call general joseph e johnston back to service and command and presently suggested and then wrote that i was ******** informed that there was plenty of produce in the country which the farmers would cheerfully deliver at richmond or petersburg if liberal prices in gold could be paid them that the authority given to impress bread and meat ****** should be applied as including gold that right or wrong the emergency called for it and that i would undertake to secure the gold upon his authority i suggested that as grants combinations were looking to concentration against the army of northern virginia and richmond we should use the railways for collecting and drawing detachments from southern points calling cavalry by the dirt roads while the farmers were bringing their produce by private conveyance furthermore i cited the fact that there were eight or ten thousand noncombatants in richmond who could be put in my trenches as conscripts and ********* by the officers of the department on duty there and twelve hundred in lynchburg that could be made similarly available and argued that using them in the trenches would enable him to draw the first corps out for a ******* force to meet flanking efforts of his adversary and keep open his lines of communication in that way i continued he could collect a hundred thousand men at richmond with a good supply of rations while general grant was drawing his two hundred thousand together to attack us that when concentrated grant would find himself obliged to give speedy battle as he could not long supply his large force that our interior lines would enable us to repel and break up the attack and relieve richmond the times were heavy of events executive authority intended to be suspended and it seemed possible that the use of a little gold would so manifest its power as to induce our people to let cotton and tobacco go for foreign exchange which might put us on a gold basis for a twelvemonth this was the expedient that offered light and hope for the future and the times called either for heroic methods or the giving over of the forms of war general lee agreed that the provisions were in the country and would be delivered for gold but did not think the gold could be found he made his orders assuming command of the armies but instead of exercising authority on a scale commensurate with the views of congress and the call of the crisis applied to the richmond authorities for instructions under the new assignment and wrote that he would call general johnston to command if he could be ordered to report to him for duty general johnston was so ordered and was assigned to command of such fragments of troops as he could collect in the carolinas general wade hampton was relieved of duty as chief of cavalry in the army of northern virginia and ordered to join general johnston after collecting such detachments as he could gather general johnston threw them from time to time along the flank of shermans march from georgia for virginia and had some spirited affairs with that army which was gathering strength along the seaboard as it marched meanwhile general grant was drawing forces from the north and west to further strengthen his already overwhelming combinations against richmond general schofield was called from tennessee to north carolina to guard and join on if necessary the flank of shermans column the cavalry and infantry of the valley of virginia were brought down to the union army about richmond and ************* latter by transports general sheridan marched his cavalry ten thousand strong from the valley to ride across james river through lynchburg to join the northward march of shermans column his divisions were under generals custer and ****** general ****** ******* was his chief of cavalry he was to destroy railroads ****** bridges and other works of value as he marched at staunton he decided to take in the balance of general earlys command near his route at waynesboro he found that command posted behind fieldworks but the line did not cover the left of the position near the river after some preliminary dashes general custer found his way around general earlys left and with part of the cavalry dismounted made a bold simultaneous charge on the front and flank breaking up the line and capturing most of the troops some of the union commanders claimed that the confederates cheered them as they surrendered this however the confederates deny the affair is mentioned in the diary of major j ******* the engineer of the confederate army of the valley in not more creditable terms than general early gave of his battle of cedar run picketts division fitzhugh lees cavalry and other detachments were sent to lynchburg to defend against sheridans ride but the high waters of james river and other obstacles turned sheridan from his southern course to a sweep down the north side generals pickett and fitzhugh lee were recalled and ordered to the north side to join me at richmond for a march to intercept sheridans forces general pickett reported on the 13th and we marched for hanover on the 14th i made requisition for a pontoon bridge and was delayed a day waiting for it and for the cavalry the bridge was not sent as we marched towards the pamunkey river general sheridan heard of the move and crossed to the north bank with his main force leaving a brigade to watch our march but presently drew the brigade after him general rosser reported to me with five hundred cavalry one of the remnants of general earlys army not captured and was ordered across the pamunkey river to follow sheridans ride our artillery and infantry were delayed part of a day and night building a bridge from the timbers of an old barn that stood near the bank of the river and part of the command crossed early in the morning to find a cold cavalry trail growing colder as the prospect of *********** the march was not encouraging we retraced our steps returning to richmond on the 18th where picketts men rested until the 24th as shermans army drew towards richmond general grant gave up the thought of taking the city by attack of his strong columns on the north side lest he should leave open the way of escape of the confederate army and give time for it to combine with johnstons forces before he could ******** it he found too that the attrition policy could not be made effective even with his superior numbers unless he could so manuvre as to call his adversary from his fortified grounds to make the work of attrition mutual on the 14th of march he gave instructions of preparation for a general move by his left and on the 24th gave definite orders for the move to be made on the 29th on the 24th general lee gave consent to the making of a sortie from his line at hares hill in front of petersburg against fort steadman of the enemys works the distance between the lines at that point was one hundred and fifty yards the distance between the picket lines fifty yards union officers had given out that deserters from the confederate army were permitted to march into the union lines with their arms under the circumstances it was conceived to be practicable to gain fort steadman by surprise and the confederate chief was led to believe that there were other forts to the rear of steadman that could be carried and held until general grant could be forced to make a longer line to reach our southern communications and give us time to find dry roads for our march away or for reinforcements to join us it was a hazardous adventure at best but his brave heart usually went with a proposition for a bold fight the second corps under majorgeneral gordon was assigned for the sortie to be reinforced by other troops to be called picketts division of the first corps that had been resting on the north side since the 18th was called to report to general lee at petersburg without intimation of the service proposed but all calls and orders of the times were looked upon as urgent the quartermaster was despatched to richmond to have the transportation at the station as soon as the troops could reach the depot and the division was ordered to march in anticipation of due preparation for their transit but the quartermaster found that the railroad company could furnish transportation for three brigades only general lee was informed of the fact and i suggested that his only way to be assured of the service of a division was to draw mahones from bermuda hundred and have picketts march to replace it he preferred part of picketts *************** it could not be used as a division as pickett the ranking officer would be called to command the work during the early morning for which he had no opportunity to prepare general lee collected about eighteen thousand men near the ******** field ordered men selected to cut away the ****** and abatis for the storming column that should advance with empty guns to avoid premature alarms and ordered a squadron of cavalry ready to dash across the lines to cut the wires about general grants lines the army of the potomac general meade commanding was ********* ninth corps on the right from james river

its garrison and turned the guns there and at battery 10 against the enemy but the alarm spread and the enemy was afield feeling his way towards the assailants for it was not yet light enough to see and direct his artillery fire over his own men batteries 11 and 12 were taken and guides sent to conduct the confederate columns to forts reported to be in rear of steadman were in search but there were no forts there redoubts constructed on the main line had commanding positions over fort steadman and a sweeping fire along its lines in anticipation of a surprise attack but their fire was withheld for daylight to direct it light broke and the fire opened general parke called his field artillery under ******* into practice from high ground over the confederates put the divisions of hartranft and wilcox against the confederate flanks and held them back near the troops crowding in along the breach and called for a division from the second corps the confederate columns were strong enough to repel the attack of two ************* put there for that ********** so far from breaking up and pushing back the ninety thousand men in front of them they were not so handled as to check two divisions long enough for the forces to get back to their lines the artillery fire not only tore the confederate ranks but crossed fire in their rear cutting off reinforcements and retreat our side was without artillery except captured guns which were handled by infantry as the sortie was ****** along the line general humphreys and general wright advanced the second and sixth corps against the confederate lines along their fields to learn if troops had been drawn from their fronts to join the attack batteries 11 and 12 were recovered before eight oclock and general parke ordered ********** division to regain fort steadman and battery 10 which was done with slight loss before nine oclock many confederates got back to their lines in disordered flight but #### prisoners and nine stands of colors were taken by the ninth corps the aggregate of union losses was reported as #### confederate losses are not reported in detail or in numbers general meades estimate of our loss was 5000 general humphreys captured the intrenched picket line in front of him but found the confederate works in front well manned general wright got well in on the front of his line to favorable position from which he assaulted and carried the confederate works on the 2d of april corses and terrys brigades of picketts division remained in wait under arms until a late hour of the 25th but were not called to take part in the sortie the result calls for little comment upon the adventure for an army of forty thousand veterans without field batteries to dislodge from their wellchosen and ***************** lines an army of ninety thousand ********* and ******************* veterans was impossible ******** to previous orders general grant started on his move around the confederate right on the 27th general ord was called to the south side with fourteen thousand men of the army of the james leaving general weitzel with twenty thousand on the north side in front of that force we had ten thousand men of fields and kershaws divisions and g w c lees division of local defence troops not including garys cavalry the sailors and marines holding the forts at drurys and chapins farms general grants orders were that his troops at all points should be ready to receive orders for assault duly informed of the enemys movements and understanding his purpose general lee marched to his right on the 29th fitzhugh lees cavalry was called in advance to march for five forks general lee marched with fifteen thousand infantry three thousand cavalry including fitzhugh lees division and a quota of artillery along the white oak road to his right the purpose of the enemy was to ********* the fortified grounds and call the confederates to field work and general lee thought to anticipate him by aggressive work as soon as he was in the open field and ordered battle for the 31st general pickett with three brigades of his division two of b r johnsons division ransoms and wallaces with the cavalry was ordered to engage sheridans cavalry at five forks while general lee attacked with ******** gracies huntons and wises brigades the fifth army corps that was between pickett and our line of fortifications the opening of this part of the battle was in favor of the confederates general lee drove back the advance division of the fifth corps to the next and pushed the two back to concentration upon the third where that part of the battle rested general pickett made his part of the battle by putting w h f lees and rossers divisions of cavalry on his right and following that leading by his infantry and artillery leaving fitzhugh lees cavalry division under general t t mumford along the right front of sheridans cavalry he pressed his separate battle by his right advance until night forcing sheridan back to dinwiddie courthouse where the latter reported to general grant that the force in front of him was too strong and asked for reinforcements pickett prepared to follow his success by early morning battle and rested for the night but miless division of the second corps was put against the other end of the battle and the fifth corps rallied and advanced against the brigades that were with general lee they were forced back to the white oak road then into their fortified lines leaving an interval of five miles behind picketts left responding to general sheridans call general grant ordered the fifth corps under general warren fifteen thousand strong and mackenzies cavalry division sixteen hundred the design was that the fifth corps should come in on picketts left rear and cut off his retreat but heavy rains of the 30th and morning of the 31st had so flooded the streams and roads that the night march was slow and fatiguing and pickett receiving notice during the night of the projected move against his rear changed his orders for battle and directed the troops withdrawn for five forks before daylight his retrograde was made in time to escape the fifth corps and was followed by sheridans cavalry but no serious effort was made to delay his movements he made his march of five miles to five forks put his troops in order of battle by nine oclock of the morning of the 1st of april and ordered his wellchosen line examined and put under construction of fieldworks corses terrys and ******** brigades of picketts division and ransoms and wallaces brigades of b r

division on his *********** t t mumford commanding the latter rossers division in rear guarding trains general fitzhugh lee was chief of cavalry as soon as the infantry line was formed the troops set to work intrenching the position the line of battle was parallel to and lay along the white oak road the left broken ******* to the rear the retired end in traverse and flanking defence the extreme right of the infantry line was also refused but not so much four miles east from picketts left was the right of the fortified lines of general lees army on the right and outside of those lines was a detachment of cavalry under general roberts the division of fitzhugh lees cavalry was ordered to cover the ground between ******** cavalry and picketts left by a line of vedettes and his division was posted on that part of the field w h f lees cavalry held strong guard on the right and had the benefit of some swamp lands his lines formed and fieldworks under construction general pickett rode to the rear for his noon lunch and was soon followed by the cavalry chief sheridans cavalry followed close on picketts march but did not attempt to seriously delay it he made a dash about ten oclock to measure the strength of the works under construction and found them too strong to warrant fierce adventure delayed by the heavy roads and flooding streams the fifth corps was not in position until four oclock in the afternoon general sheridan planned for battle to have general ******* display the cavalry divisions of custer and ****** against the confederate front and right to convey the impression that that was the field from which his battle would be made while he drew up and massed the fifth corps at the other end of the field for the real fight the corps was arranged crawfords division in column on the right ayress on crawfords left griffins division in support mackenzies cavalry division on the right of the infantry column at the white oak road the fifth corps was to wheel in close connection and assault against the face of the return of confederate works while the cavalry divisions in front were to assail on that line and the right of the works the march and wheel of the fifth corps were made in tactical order and the lines advanced in courageous charge but staggered and halted under the destructive infantry fire the charge was repeated but held in check until crawfords division found a way under cover of a woodland beyond the confederate works and marched to that advantage ransom drew his brigade from the intrenched line to meet that march but it was one brigade against ******** those supported by part of griffins division ransoms horse was killed falling on him his adjutantgeneral captain *** was killed and the brigade was forced back this formidable move by open field to picketts rear made his position untenable feeling this the veteran soldiers of the left brigades realized that their battle was ************* those who could find escape from that end of the works fell back in broken ranks while many others finding the enemy closing in on their rear thought it more soldierly to surrender to ayress brave assaulting columns and not a few were the captives of crawfords division it was not until that period that general pickett knew by the noise of battle that it was on he rode through the fire to his command but his cavalry chief riding later was cut off from the field and failed to take part in the action when pickett got to the forks colonel pegram of the artillery had been mortally wounded the battery commander was killed and many of the cannoneers killed or wounded he found an artillery sergeant and enough men to man one gun and used it with effect until the **** broke the brigades of ******* and terry changed front and received the rolling battle the cavalry assailants of the front and right had no decided success but the infantry columns pressing their march the confederate brigades were pushed back to their extreme right where in turn corses brigade changed front to receive the march leaving w h f lees cavalry to look to his right the union cavalry essayed to charge the confederate remnants to dismay but the noble son of the noble sire seized opportunity to charge against the head of this threatening column before it could pass the swamp lands drove back its head until corses brigade got back to cover of woodland and night came to cover the disastrous field the remnants of the command were collected as soon and as well as they could be in the dead of night and marched towards exeter mills where pickett proposed to cross the appomattox and return to the army but early movements of the next morning changed the face of the military zodiac the position was not of general picketts choosing but of his orders and from his orders he assumed that he would be reinforced his execution was all that a skilful commander could apply he reported as to his position and the movements of the enemy threatening to cut his command from the army but no force came to guard his right the reinforcements joined him after night when his battle had been lost and his command disorganized the cavalry of his left was in neglect in failing to report the advance of the enemy but that was not for want of proper orders from his headquarters though taken by surprise there was no panic in any part of the command brigade after brigade changed front to the left and received the overwhelming battle as it rolled on until crushed back to the next before it could deploy out to aid the ******* flank *********** the last right brigade of the brave corse changed and stood alone on the left of w h f lees cavalry fronting at right angle against the enemys cavalry columns it is not claiming too much for that grand division to say that aided by the brigades of ransom and wallace they could not have been dislodged from their intrenched position by parallel battle even by the great odds against them as it was ayress division staggered under the pelting blows that it met and crawfords drifted off from the blows against it until it thus found the key of the battle away beyond the confederate limits in generalship pickett was not a bit below the gay rider his defensive battle was better organized and it is possible that he would have gained the day if his cavalry had been diligent in giving information of the movements of the enemy the losses are not found in separate reports both sides suffered severely pickett losing two thousand he had nine thousand men of all arms his adversary had twentysix thousand reinforcements of huntons brigade and lieutenantgeneral r h anderson with the other brigades of b r johnson were sent him too late and a telegram came for me at richmond to march a division to petersburg to report to general lee the hour at which the telegram was received was not noted as the operations at five forks were not decisive until after five oclock the telegram may have been received about seven pm fields division was ordered to the railway station and the quartermaster was sent in advance to have the cars ready to move it to give the troops the benefit of our limited transportation i rode with the staff by the dirt road the darkness of night still covered us when we crossed over james river by the pontoon bridge but before long land and water batteries lifted their bombs over their lazy curves screaming shells came through the freighted night to light our ride and signal ********** gave momentary illumination our noble beasts peered through the loaded air and ******* the coming battle nightbirds fluttered from their startled cover and the solid pounding upon mahones defensive walls drove the ***** from their ***** if tears and prayers could have put out the light it would not have passed ************* it passed by twenty miles a hundred guns and more added their lightning and thunder to the storm of war that carried consternation to thousands of **************** people the cause was lost but the end was not yet the noble army of northern virginia once twice conqueror of empire must bite the dust before its formidable adversary the impulse was to stop and guard mahone but some of his men had been called to assist in guarding elsewhere which with our imperative orders admonished us that he must be left to his fate and weitzels fire upon the lines we had just left told of his orders to be prepared for the grand enveloping charge but the order for weitzels part in the general charge was afterwards suspended until enough troops could be sent to assure success had general grant known that fields division was withdrawn during the night weitzels assault would have gone in the general move of the morning of the 2d and richmond with the confederate authorities would have been taken before noon as morning approached the combat was heavier the rolling thunder of the heavy metal ************ along the line and its bursting blaze spread afar to light the doom of the army once so proud to meet the ************ army of northern virginia general grant had ordered assault for four oclock but it was near five before there was light enough for the men to see their way across the line and over the works our ********* was beyond range of the enemys batteries crossing the appomattox we rode through the streets of petersburg for general lees headquarters some miles farther west as no part of the command had reached the station when we passed orders were left for the detachments to march as soon as they landed before the first rays of morning we found general headquarters some members of the staff were up and dressed but the general was yet on his couch when told of my presence he called me to a seat at his bedside and gave orders for our march to support the broken forces about five forks he had no censure for any one but mentioned the great numbers of the enemy and the superior repeating rifles of his cavalry he was ill suffering from the rheumatic ******* that he had been afflicted with for years but keener trouble of mind made him in a measure superior to the shooting pains of his disease from the line gained by the sixth corps on the 25th it was a run of but two or three minutes across to the confederate works at ### general wright advanced as the signal for general assault general lee was not through with his instructions for our march when a staffofficer came in and reported that the lines in front of his headquarters were broken drawing his wrapper about him he walked with me to the front door and saw as far as the eye could cover the field a line of skirmishers in quiet march towards us it was hardly light enough to distinguish the blue from the gray general wright drove in our picket line and in desperate charges crowned the confederate works general gibbon followed the move with his divisions of the twentyfourth and *********** corps one of his brigades harriss carrying part of the confederate works the troops weary of their ******** watch and early battle halted to close their ranks and wait for the skirmish line to open up the field general lee appealed to have me interpose and stop the march but not a man of my command was there nor had we notice that any of them had reached the station at petersburg all staffofficers mounted and rode to find the parts of heths and wilcoxs divisions that had been forced from their lines the display of officers riding in many directions seemed to ******** the skirmishers to delay under cover of an intervening swale the alarm reached general a p hill of the third corps who rode off to find his troops but instead came suddenly upon the enemys skirmishers in their concealment he wheeled and made a dash to escape but the federal fire had deadly effect the gallant general fell and the southern service lost a sword made bright by brave work upon many heavy fields general humphreys of the second followed the move of the sixth corps and general parke assaulted on the bermuda hundred front and at petersburg he had partial success at the former but was repulsed when he met mahones strong line at petersburg he had more success capturing twelve guns general sheridan reinforced by miless division was ordered to follow up his work on the right bank the reinforcements sent under lieutenantgeneral anderson joined general pickett at night of the 1st and the combined forces succeeded in getting out of the way of the union infantry and they gave the cavalry a severe trial a little before night at ****** creek where the pursuit rested but the union forces made some important captures of artillery and prisoners the divisions of heth and wilcox moved to the right and left to collect their broken files general wright wheeled to the right and massed the sixth corps for its march to petersburg and was joined by general gibbon not ********* to hope i looked towards petersburg and saw general benning with his rock brigade winding in rapid march around the near hill he had but six hundred of his men i asked for two hundred and led them off to the canal on our right which was a weak point threatened by a small body of skirmishers and ordered the balance of his troops deployed as skirmishers in front of the enemys main force i rode then to bennings line of skirmishers and at the middle point turned and rode at a walk to the top of the hill took out my glasses and had a careful view of the enemys formidable masses i thought i recognized general gibbon and raised my hat but he was busy and did not see me there were two forts at our line of ********** and ********* general grant rode over the captured works and ordered the forts taken upon withdrawing my glasses i looked to the right and left and

another messenger for some of the ladies then another and still another and in a few moments the congregation followed by the minister giving up the sacred service passed out and to their homes to prepare in silent resignation for whatever was to come the tragic scenes of the south side in a different way were as impressive as these general gibbon prepared his divisions under foster and turner for assault upon forts gregg and ********* and when the sixth corps lined up with him he ordered the divisions to their work as they advanced the other brigades of fields division came up were ******* before the enemys heavy massing forces and ordered to intrench general foster found his work at fort gregg called for all the force and skill that he could apply he made desperate assault but was checked and charged again and again even to the bayonet before he could mount the parapets and claim the fort it had been manned by part of harriss brigade twelfth mississippi regiment under captain j h duncan three hundred men of mahones division fiftyfive dead were found in the fort two hundred and fifty including wounded were prisoners general turner attacked at fort ********* and had easier work general wilcox thinking it a useless sacrifice to try to hold it ordered his troops withdrawn and many got out in time to escape the heavy assault but many were taken prisoners general gibbon lost ten officers and one hundred and twelve men killed twentyseven officers and five hundred and sixtyfive men wounded two pieces of artillery and several colors were captured it was my time next general meade called miless division back to the second corps and prepared to march down upon petersburg but general grant thought that the work might prove hazardous of delay to his plans for the next day that general lee was obliged to pull away from his lines during the night to find escape and standing as he was he would have the start while at petersburg he would be behind him he therefore ordered all things in readiness for his march westward at early light of the next morning after a p hill fell his staff and corps were assigned as part of my command heths and wilcoxs divisions were much broken by the losses of the day mahone had repulsed the attack made upon his position and had his division in good order and spirits except the regiment of harriss brigade that was at fort gregg

threatening our left flank at the courthouse the cavalry was more demonstrative and seemed ready to offer battle field heth wilcox and the artillery were put in position and looked for opportunity to strike the head of the enemys column and delay his march but it proved to be only the purpose of the cavalry to delay our march while the enemy was passing his heavier column by us to jetersville orders had been sent for provisions to meet us at the courthouse but they were not there so we lost the greater part of a day gathering supplies from the farmers our purpose had been to march through burkeville to join our forces to those of general j e johnston in north carolina but at jetersville on the 5th we found the enemy square across the route in force and intrenching where our cavalry under general w h f lee engaged him general field put out a strong line of skirmishers to support the cavalry fields heths and wilcoxs divisions and artillery were prepared for action and awaited orders general meade was in front of us with the second and fifth corps and sheridans cavalry but his sixth corps was not up general fitzhugh lee had been sent by the *********** road with the balance

nothing beyond the roads and ******* from place to place general meade finding that his sixth corps could not join him till a late hour decided to wait till next morning for his attack general ord rested his column for the night at burkeville the enemy was quiet at jetersville except for a light exchange of cavalry fire no orders came the afternoon was passing further delay seemed perilous i drew the command off and filed to the right to cross flat creek to march for farmville the other infantry and trains and artillery followed and kept the march until a late hour halting for a short rest before daylight early on the 6th general meade advanced for battle and not finding us at jetersville started towards amelia courthouse to look for us but general humphreys of his second corps learned that our rearguard was on the north side of flat creek on the westward march general ******* of the fifth corps also had information of troops in march west and general meade therefore changed direction to pursue with his second and sixth corps putting the fifth on the *********** road general sheridan despatched general ord that we had broken away from him and were marching direct for

follow by the road through rices station after repairing the bridge at flat creek general humphreys marched in hot pursuit of our rearguard followed by the sixth corps merritts and crooks cavalry moving on the left of our column as we marched general humphreys in his account of the pursuit says my column marched before daylight on the 6th the design from the night we left petersburg was that its service should be to head off and prevent the enemys infantry columns passing us and standing across our march at sailors creek the road ******** road to the high bridge crossing of appomattox river the other by rices station to farmville we had information of ords column moving towards rices station and i was ordered to that point to meet it the other columns to follow the trains over the bridge at rices station the command was prepared for ************ division across the road of ords march wilcox on fields right both ordered to intrench artillery in battery heths division was put in support of wilcox mahone to support field just then i learned that ords detachment of bridgeburners had passed out of sight when the head of my command arrived i had no cavalry and the head of ords command was approaching in sight but directly general rosser reported with his division of cavalry he was ordered to follow after the bridgeburners and capture or destroy the detachment if it took the last man of his command to do it general ord came on and drove in my line of skirmishers but i rode to meet them marched them back to the line with orders to hold it till called in ords force proved to be the head of his column and he was not prepared to press for general engagement general t t mumford reported with his cavalry and was ordered to follow rosser with similar directions garys cavalry came and reported to me high bridge was a vital point for over it the trains were to pass and i was under the impression that general lee was there passing with the rest of his army but hearing our troops engaged at rices station he had ridden to us and was waiting near mahones division ords command was not up till near night and he only engaged with desultory fire of skirmishers and occasional exchange of battery practice arranging to make his attack the next morning general ewells column was up when we left amelia courthouse and followed andersons by amelia springs where he was detained some little time defending trains threatened by cavalry at the same time our rearguard was near him followed by the enemy near *********** crooks cavalry got in on our trains and caused delay of several hours to andersons march crook was joined by part of merritts cavalry and repeated the attack on the trains but ewell was up in time to aid in repelling the attack and the march was resumed the enemys cavalry moving on their left flank anderson crossed sailors creek closely followed by ewell the route by which they were to march was by high bridge but they were on strange ground without maps or instructions or commander in the absence of orders anderson thought to march for the noise of battle at rices station they had no artillery or cavalry the chief of cavalry was there but his troopers were elsewhere and he rode away advising the force to follow him the rearguard came up rapidly and essayed to deploy for defence but the close pursuit of humphreyss corps forced its continued march for high bridge letting the pursuit in upon ewells rear as anderson marched he found merritts cavalry square across his route humphreys was close upon ewell but the former awaited battle for the arrival of the sixth corps there was yet a way of escape from the closing clutches of the enemy by filing to their right and marching to the rear of the command at rices station but they were true soldiers and decided to fight even to sacrifice their commands if necessary to break or delay the pursuit until the trains and rearguard could find safety beyond high bridge ewell deployed his divisions kershaws on the right g w c lees on the left their plan was that anderson should attack and open the way while ewell defended the rear as anderson attacked wrights corps was up humphreys had matured his plans and the attack of anderson hastened that of the enemy upon the confederate rear anderson had some success and ewell received the assaults with resolute coolness and at one moment pushed his fight to aggressive return but the enemy finding that there was no artillery with the confederates dashed their batteries into closer range putting in artillery and infantry fire front and flanks until the confederate rear was crushed to fragments general ewell surrendered so also did general g w c lee with his division general kershaw advised such of his men as could to make their escape and surrendered with his division general anderson got away with the greater part of b r johnsons division and pickett with six hundred men generals corse and hunton and others of picketts men were captured about two hundred of kershaws division got away general r s ewell and general r h anderson are barely known in the retreat but their stand and fight on that trying march were among the most *********** of the many noble deeds of the war while waiting near my rear general lee received information through colonel venable of his staff as to the disaster at sailors creek he drew mahones division away and took it back to find the field general mahone writes of the scenes that he witnessed as follows general mahone withdrew at eleven oclock at night through the wood found the bridge had the fragments of commands over before daylight and crossed high bridge the parties called to fire the bridge failed to appear he sent a brigade back to do the work and had a sharp skirmish in checking the enemy long enough to start the fire after which he withdrew as far as cumberland church and deployed for battle poagues artillery on his right general rosser got up with the detachment sent to burn the bridge and attacked general reed seeing his approach found a defensive position and arranged the command to receive battle general mumford got up and deployed his troopers dismounted on rossers left nothing daunted general reed received the attack and in gallant fight made one or two ************** with his small cavalry force but ere long he was mortally wounded as was colonel ******** most of his cavalry officers and many of his infantry were killed or wounded and the rest surrendered reeds fight was as gallant and skilful as a soldier could make and its noise in rear of sailors creek may have served to increase the confusion there the result shows the work of these remnants of confederate veterans as skilful and worthy of their old chief who fell at yellow tavern i heard nothing of the affair at sailors creek nor from general lee until next morning our work at rices station was not very serious but was continued until night when we marched and crossed the appomattox at farmville without loss some of rossers and mumfords cavalry following we crossed early in the morning and received two days ********** first regular issue since we left ************** our wagons made fires got out cooking utensils and were just ready to prepare a good breakfast we had not heard of the disasters on the other route and the hasty retreat and were looking for a little quiet to prepare breakfast when general lee rode up and said that the bridges had been fired before his cavalry crossed that part of that command was cut off and lost and that the troops should hurry on to position at cumberland church i reminded him that there were fords over which his cavalry could cross and that they knew of or would surely find them everything except the food was ordered back to the wagons and ****** in meanwhile the alarm had spread and our teamsters frightened by reports of cavalry trouble and approaching fire of artillery joined in the panic put whips to their teams as quick as the *********** were tumbled over the ********** of the wagons and rushed through the woods to find a road somewhere in front of them the command was ordered under arms and put in quick march but general lee urged doublequick our cavalry was then engaged near farmville and presently came a reckless charge of greggs troopers towards parts of rossers and mumfords commands heths division of infantry was sent to support them as the balance of the command marched general lee took the head of the column and led it on the doublequick i thought it better to let them pass me and to quiet their apprehensions a little rode at a walk general mahone received the attack of part of the enemys second corps like greggs cavalry making reckless attack the enemy seemed to think they had another sailors creek affair and part of their attack got in as far as poagues battery but mahone recovered it and then drove off an attack against his front general gregg and a considerable part of his command were captured by rosser and mumford at cumberland church the command deployed on the right of poagues battery but mahone reported a move by part of miless division to turn his left which might dislodge him g t andersons brigade of fields division was sent with orders to get around the threatening force and break it up mahone so directed them through a woodland that they succeeded in overreaching the threatened march and took in some three hundred prisoners the last of our trouble for the day general lee stopped at a cottage near my line where i joined him after night the trains and other parts of his army had moved on towards appomattox courthouse the beginning of the end was now at ******* perhaps necessarily but at least as the sequence of cause and effect actually followed an event occurred on the 7th says general long which must not be omitted from the narrative perceiving the difficulties that surrounded the army and believing its *********** hopeless a number of the principal officers from a feeling of affection and sympathy for the commanderinchief and with a wish to lighten his responsibility and soften the pain of defeat volunteered to inform him that in their opinion the struggle had reached a point where further resistance was hopeless and that the contest should be terminated and negotiations opened for a surrender of the army the delivery of this opinion was confided to general pendleton who both by his character and devotion to general lee was well qualified for such an office the names of longstreet and some others who did not coincide in the opinion of their associates did not appear in the list presented by pendleton a little after nightfall a flag of truce appeared under torchlight in front of mahones line bearing a note to general lee i was sitting at his side when the note was delivered he read it and handed it to me without referring to its contents after reading it i gave it back saying not yet general lee wrote in reply i was not informed of the contents of the return note but thought from the orders of the night it did not mean surrender general lee ordered my command from forward to rearguard and his cavalry in rear of the march the road was clear at eleven oclock and we marched at twelve the enemy left us to a quiet days march on the 8th nothing disturbing the rearguard and our left flank being but little annoyed but our animals were worn and reduced in strength by the heavy haul through rain and mud during the march from petersburg and the troops of our broken columns were troubled and faint of heart we passed abandoned wagons in flames and limbers and caissons of artillery burning sometimes in the middle of the road one of my battery commanders reported his horses too weak to haul his guns he was ordered to bury the guns and cover their ************ with old leaves and brushwood many weary soldiers were picked up and many came to the column from the woodlands some with many without ******* asking for food general grant renewed efforts on the 8th to find a way to strike across the head of our march by his cavalry and the army of the james pursuing our rearguard with the second and sixth corps of the army of the potomac in the forenoon general pendleton came to me and reported the proceedings of the *************** council of war of the night before and stated that he had been requested to make the report and ask to have me bear it to general lee in the name of the members of the council much surprised i turned and asked if he did not know that the articles of war provided that officers or soldiers who asked commanding officers to surrender should be shot and said it seems that general pendleton then went to general lee and made the report general longs account of the interview as reported by pendleton is as follows the delicate affection that prompted the knights of later days to offer to relieve our grand commander of his official obligations and take upon themselves responsibility to disarm us and turn us over to the enemy is somewhat pathetic but when to it are applied the stern rules of a soldiers duty upon a field of emergency when the commander most needs steady hands and brave hearts their proceeding would not stand the test of a military tribunal the interesting part of the interview is that in it our great leader left a sufficient *********** of his regard as a legacy to the soldiers of his column of the right though commanders of other columns were in mutinous conduct towards him he had confidence that we were firm and steady in waiting to execute his last command during the day general grant wrote general lee in reply to his note of the 7th inquiring as to terms of surrender in reply general lee wrote the enemys movements of the day were impressive of his desire to get by our left flank and make a strong stand across the route of our head of column at prospect station general sheridan was informed of four trains of cars at appomattox station loaded with provisions for general lees army he gave notice to merritts and crooks cavalry and rode twentyeight miles in time for custers division to pass the station cut off the trains and drive back the guard advancing to protect them he helped himself to the provisions and captured besides twentyfive pieces of artillery and a wagon and hospital train at night general lee made his headquarters near the rearguard and spread his couch about a hundred feet from the saddle and blanket that were my pillow and spread for the night if he had a more comfortable bed than mine i do not know but i think not he sent for his cavalry commander and gave orders for him to transfer his troopers from the rear to the advanced guard and called general gordon commanding in front for report and orders the advance was then at appomattox courthouse wallaces brigade resting in the village his orders were to march at one oclock in the morning the trains and advanced forces to push through the village in time for my column to stand and prepare to defend at that point in case of close pursuit general gordon reported as i remember less than two thousand men general fitzhugh lee puts it at sixteen hundred but he may have overlooked wallaces brigade which joined the advance on that day my column was about as it was when it marched from petersburg parts of ewells andersons and picketts commands not captured on the march were near us and reported to me except wallaces brigade on the 9th the rearguard marched as ordered but soon came upon standing trains of wagons in the road and still in park alongside the command was halted deployed into position and ordered to intrench against the pursuing army it was five oclock when the advance commands ********* hours after the time ordered to these general longs batteries of thirty guns were attached they met sheridans cavalry advancing across their route the column was deployed the cavalry on the right of the artillery and infantry as they advanced to clear the way they reported some success capturing two pieces of artillery when general ords column came up he had besides his army of the james the fifth army corps these commands with the cavalry pushed the confederates back a little while the two corps of the army of the potomac were advancing against my rearguard of the early hours of this the last day of active existence of the army of northern virginia colonel venable of general lees staff wrote thus presently general lee called to have me ride forward to him he was dressed in a suit of new uniform sword and sash a handsomely embroidered belt boots and a pair of gold spurs at first approach his compact figure appeared as a man in the flush vigor of forty summers but as i drew near the handsome apparel and brave bearing failed to conceal his profound depression he stood near the embers of some burned rails received me with graceful salutation and spoke at once of affairs in front and the loss of his subsistence stores he remarked that the advanced columns stood against a very formidable force which he could not break through while general meade was at my rear ready to call for all the work that the rearguard could do and closing with the expression that it was not possible for him to get along requested my view i asked if the bloody sacrifice of his army could in any way help the cause in other quarters he thought not then i said your situation speaks for itself he called up general mahone and made to him a similar statement of affairs the early morning was raw and damp general mahone was chilled standing in wait without fire he pushed up the embers and said to the general he did not want him to think he was scared he was only chilled general mahone sometimes liked to talk a little on questions of moment and asked several questions my attention was called to messages from the troops for a time so that i failed to hear all of the conversation but i heard enough of it to know that general mahone thought it time to see general grant appeal was made to me to affirm that judgment and it was promptly approved general grant had been riding with his column in our rear during the correspondence of the 7th and 8th so general lee upon mounting traveller his favorite horse rode to our rear to meet him leaving his advanced forces engaged in a lively skirmish he did not think to send them notice of his intended ride nor did he authorize me to call a truce he passed my rear under flag but general grants orders were that his correspondence with general lee should not interrupt or delay the operations of any of his forces our advance troops were in action and general humphreys was up with the second corps of the army of the potomac preparing for action against our rearguard the situation was embarrassing it was plain enough that i should attack the second corps before others could be up and prepare for action though our truce forbade it could not prevail however to call me to quiet while the enemy in plain view was preparing for attack so we continued at our work constructing our best line of defence and when strong enough i ordered parts of the rearguard forward to support the advanced forces and directed general alexander to establish them with part of his batteries in the best position for support or rallying line in case the front lines were forced back that was the last line of battle formed in the army of northern virginia while this formation was proceeding report came from our front that a break had been found through which we could force passage i called for a swift courier but not one could be found colonel j c haskell had a blooded mare that had been carefully led from petersburg appreciating the signs of the times he had ordered her saddled intending a desperate ride to escape impending humiliation but learning my need of a swift courier he came and offered his services and his mare he was asked to take the information just brought in to general lee and as he mounted was told to kill his mare but bring general lee back he rode like the wind general lee had passed out and dismounted beyond a turn of the road and was not seen until the gallant rider had dashed by him the steed swept onward some distance before the rider could pull up as colonel haskell rode back general lee walked to meet him exclaiming you have ruined your beautiful mare why did you do so the swift despatch was too late general lees note to general grant asking an interview had gone beyond recall as my troops marched to form the last line a message came from general lee saying he had not thought to give notice of the intended ride to meet general grant and asked to have me send his message to that effect to general gordon and it was duly sent by captain sims of the third corps staff serving at my headquarters since the fall of a p hill after delivering the message captain sims through some informality was sent to call the truce the firing ceased general custer rode to captain sims to know his authority and upon finding that he was of my staff asked to be conducted to my headquarters and down they came in fast gallop general custers ****** locks flowing over his shoulders and in ***** excited manner he said in the name of general sheridan i demand the unconditional surrender of this army he was reminded that i was not the commander of the army that he was within the lines of the enemy without authority addressing a superior officer and in disrespect to general grant as well as myself that if i was the commander of the army i would not receive the message of general sheridan he then became more moderate saying it would be a pity to have more blood upon that field then i suggested that the truce be respected and said as you are now more reasonable i will say that general lee has gone to meet general grant and it is for them to determine the future of the armies he was satisfied and rode back to his command general grant rode away from the army of the potomac on the morning of the 9th to join his troops near appomattox courthouse so general lees note was sent around to him when advised of the change general lee rode back to his front to await there the answer to his note while waiting general lee expressed apprehension that his refusal to meet general grants first proposition might cause him to demand harsh terms i assured him that i knew general grant well enough to say that the terms would be such as he would demand under similar circumstances but he yet had doubts the conversation continued in broken sentences until the bearer of the return despatch approached as he still seemed apprehensive of humiliating demands i suggested that in that event he should break off the interview and tell general grant to do his worst the thought of another round seemed to brace him and he rode with colonel marshall of his staff to meet the union commander the status of affairs spread through the advance troops of the army but the work of preparation on my rear line was continued general field inquired of a passing officer whats up but seeing arrangements going on for attack in our rear he continued his work of preparation to receive it general grant was found prepared to offer as liberal terms as general lee could expect and to obviate a collision between his army of the rear with ours ordered an officer sent to give notice of the truce a ride around the lines would consume time and he asked to have the officer conducted through our lines colonel fairfax was sent with him when they reached our rear line it was still at work on the trenches the officer expressed surprise at the work of preparation as not proper under truce colonel fairfax ordered the work discontinued and claimed that a truce between belligerents can only be recognized by mutual consent as the object of the ride was to make the first announcement of properly authorized truce the work of preparation between the lines was no violation of the usages of war particularly when it was borne in mind that the orders of general grant were that the correspondence should not delay or interrupt military operations as general lee rode back to his army the officers and soldiers of his troops about the front lines assembled in *********** crowds of all arms and grades in anxious wait for their loved commander from force of habit a burst of salutations greeted him but quieted as suddenly as they arose the road was packed by standing troops as he approached the men with hats off heads and hearts bowed down as he passed they raised their heads and looked upon him with swimming eyes those who could find voice said goodby those who could not speak and were near passed their hands gently over the sides of traveller he rode with his hat off and had sufficient control to fix his eyes on a line between the ears of traveller and look neither to right nor left until he reached a large whiteoak tree where he dismounted to make his last headquarters and finally talked a little the shock was most severe upon fields division seasoned by four years of battle triumphant the veterans in that body stood at appomattox when the sun rose on the 9th day of april 1865 as invincible of valor as on the morning of the 31st of august 1862 after breaking up the union lines of the second field of manassas they had learned little of the disasters about petersburg less of that at sailors creek and surrender had not had time to enter their minds until it was announced accomplished the reported opportunity to break through the enemys lines proved a mistake general mumford suspecting surrender from the sudden quiet of the front made a dashing ride and passed the enemys lines with his division of cavalry and that caused the impression that we would be able to march on soon after general lees return ride his chief of ordnance reported a large amount of united states currency in his possession in doubt as to the proper disposition of the funds general lee sent the officer to ask my opinion as it was not known or included in the conditions of capitulation and was due and ten times more to the faithful troops i suggested a pro **** distribution of it the officer afterwards brought three hundred dollars as my part i took one hundred and asked to have the balance distributed among fields *********** troops most distant from their homes the commissioners appointed to ********* details of the capitulation were assigned a room in the mclean residence the way to it led through the room occupied as general grants headquarters as i was passing through the room as one of the commissioners general grant looked up recognized me rose and with his oldtime cheerful greeting gave me his hand and after passing a few remarks offered a cigar which was gratefully received the first step under capitulation was to deliver to the union army some fifteen hundred prisoners taken since we left petersburg not all of them by my infantry rossers and mumfords cavalry having taken more than half of them besides these i delivered to general grant all of the confederate soldiers left under my care by general lee except about two hundred lost in the affairs about petersburg amelia courthouse jetersville rices station and cumberland church none were reported killed except the gallant officers brigadiergeneral dearing of rossers cavalry colonel ****** of mumfords cavalry and major thompson of stuarts horse artillery in the desperate and gallant fight to which they were ordered against the ************* party general grants artillery prepared to fire a salute in honor of the surrender but he ordered it stopped as the world continues to look at and study the grand combinations and strategy of general grant the higher will be his award as a great soldier confederates should be foremost in ********* him with all that his admirers so justly claim and ask at the same time that his great adversary be measured by the same high standards on the 12th of april the army of northern virginia marched to the field in front of appomattox courthouse and by divisions and parts of divisions deployed into line stacked their arms folded their colors and walked *********** to find their distant blighted homes in glancing backward over the period of the war and the tremendous and terrible events with which it was fraught the reflection irresistibly arises that it might perhaps have been avoided and without dishonor the flag and the fame of the nation could have suffered no reproach had general scotts advice before the outbreak been *************** sisters depart in peace the southern states would have found their way back to the union without war far earlier than they did by war the ********** bonds would then have been those only of love and the theory of government ********** by george washington would have experienced no ******** but the inflexible fiat of fate seemingly went forth for war and so for four long years the history of this great nation was written in the blood of its strong men some weeks after the surrender the newspapers announced that i was to visit washington city my old company commander bradford p ***** who had resigned from the army some years before the war came down from new york to meet me not finding me he wrote to tell me of his trip that he was anxious about me lest i might be in need of assistance that in that event i should draw on him for such amount of money as i wanted when ready to return his favor he was not in the country and it was only through a mutual friend general ****** that his address in europe was found and the amount returned a more noble lovable character never descended from the people of plymouth rock about the 1st of november 1865 business of personal nature called me to washington i stopped at the metropolitan hotel upon seeing the arrival in the morning papers general w a ******* of the united states army called and insisted that my visit should be with him and his family the request was declined with the suggestion that the ********** was too warm for an officer of the army to entertain a prominent confederate but he insisted and urged that his good wife would not be satisfied unless the visit was made so it was settled and i became his guest he was on duty at the time as assistant adjutantgeneral at the war department as i was stopping with an officer of the army the usages of military life required that i should call upon the commanding general the next morning i walked with general ******* to make an official call on general grant he recognized us as we entered his office rose and walked to meet us after the usual brief call we rose to take leave when he asked to have us call on his family during the evening most of those whom we met during the evening were oldtime personal friends especially the fatherinlaw mr dent when leaving after a pleasant evening general grant walked with us to the gate and asked if i cared to have my pardon i pleaded not guilty of an offence that required pardon he said that he meant *********** he wished to know if i cared to have it i told him that i intended to live in the country and would prefer to have the privileges of citizenship he told me to call at his office at noon next day that in the mean time he would see the secretary of war and the president in regard to the matter the next day he gave me a letter to the president and said that he had seen him and thought the matter was arranged that i should first see the secretary of war then the president his strong and characteristic letter to the president was as follows supported by this generous endorsement i called on the secretary of war who referred me to the president after a lengthy interview the president asked to have the matter put off until next day when i should call at noon the next day he was still unprepared to make decision but after a long pleasant talk he said there are three persons of the south who can never receive amnesty mr davis general lee and yourself you have given the union cause too much trouble i replied you know mr president that those who are forgiven most love the most yes he said you have very high authority for that but you cant have amnesty during a subsequent session of congress general pope sent in a list of names from georgia for whom he asked relief from their political disabilities general grant after approving it made request to one of his friends in congress to have my name put on the list and i was extended relief soon after it was given to general r e lee in january 1866 i engaged in business in new orleans with the owen *************** miller and edward old soldiers of the washington *********** cotton ******* and speedily found fair prosperity before the year was out i was asked to take position in an insurance company but declined and repeated applications were refused under plea of limited business experience but under promise of ample and competent assistance i accepted the place with a salary of five thousand dollars and my affairs were more than prosperous until i was asked an opinion upon the political crisis of 1867 as the whole animus of the latterday adverse criticisms upon and ********** assertions in regard to the commander of the first corps of the army of northern virginia had its origin in this matter of politics a brief review of the circumstances is in order as will be readily recalled by my older readers while for the younger it is a matter of history president johnson after the war adopted a reconstruction policy of his own and some of the states were reorganized under it with democratic governors and legislatures and all would have followed but congress being largely republican was not satisfied and enacted that the states could not be accepted unless they provided in their new constitutions for negro suffrage in case they would not the state governments should be removed and the states placed in the hands of general officers of the army as military governors who should see that the states were reorganized and restored to the union under the laws under the severe ordeal one of the city papers of new orleans called upon the generals of confederate service to advise the people of the course that they should ************ the officers i thought it better policy to hold the states as they were organized under the presidents policy shape their constitutions as directed by congress and have the states not yet reorganized follow the same course my letter upon the subject was as follows i might have added that not less ******** than the grounds i gave were the obligations under which we were placed by the terms of our ********* respect the laws of *********** the letter was enough the afternoon of the day upon which my letter was published the paper that had called for advice published a column of editorial calling me traitor deserter of my friends and accusing me of joining the enemy but did not publish a line of the letter upon which it based the charges other papers of the democracy took up the ******* representation of this journal and spread it broadcast not even giving the letter upon which they based their evil attacks upon me up to that time the first corps in all of its parts in all of its history was above reproach i was in successful business in new orleans as cotton factor with a salary from an insurance company of five thousand dollars per year the day after the announcement old comrades passed me on the streets without speaking business began to grow dull general hood the only one of my old comrades who occasionally visited me thought that he could save the insurance business and in a few weeks i found myself at leisure two years after that period on march 4 1869 general grant was inaugurated president of the united states and in the ******* of his generous heart called me to washington before i found opportunity to see him he sent my name to the senate for confirmation as surveyor of customs at new orleans i was duly confirmed and held the office until 1873 when i resigned since that time i have lived in new orleans louisiana and in gainesville georgia surrounded by a few of my old friends and in occasional appreciative touch with others south and north of all the people alive i still know and meet probably no one carries me farther back in recollections of my long life than does my old nurse most of the family servants were discharged after the war at macon mississippi where some of them still reside among them this old man daniel who still claims the family name but at times uses another he calls promptly when i visit macon and looks for something to remember you by during my last visit he seemed more concerned for me than usual and on one of his calls asked marse jim do you belong to any church oh yes i said i try to be a good christian he laughed loud and long and said something must have scared you mighty bad to change you so from what you was when i had to care for you in a recent letter he sent a message to say that he is getting to be a little feeble blessings on his brave heart
