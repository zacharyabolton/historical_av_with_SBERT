and gently pressed the lids over his ******* eyes not a word was uttered but while the seconds sadly regarded the stiffening form the surviving principal coolly drew out a cigar lighted and placed it

perceived her standing there in their midst with loathing and horror in the gaze she fixed on the *********** of the awful deed in great surprise he drew back a step or two and asked gruffly who are

dead what is it he killed him in a duel which is considered quite right and altogether proper a duel she had never heard the word before and pondered an instant to take a mans life is murder is there no law to punish a duel none strong enough to prohibit the practice it is regarded as the only method of honorable satisfaction open to gentlemen honorable satisfaction she **************** the new

father at home i have no father but grandpa has not gone to the shop yet will you show me the way to the house do you wish to carry him there she asked glancing at the corpse and shuddering violently yes i want some assistance from your grandfather i will show you the way sir the surgeon spoke hurriedly to the two remaining gentlemen and followed his guide slowly she retraced her steps ********

was fought at sunrise in the edge of the woods yonder and the challenged party mr dent of georgia was killed i came to ask permission to bring the body here until arrangements can be made for its interment and also to beg your assistance in obtaining a coffin edna passed on to the kitchen and as she deposited the bucket on the table a tall muscular ********* woman who was stooping over the fire raised her flushed face and exclaimed angrily what upon earth have you been doing i have been halfway to the spring to call you and hadnt a drop of water in the kitchen to make coffee a pretty

white as that pan of flour are you scared or sick there was a man killed this morning and the body will be brought here directly if you want to hear about it you had better go out on the porch one of the gentlemen is talking to grandpa stunned by what she had seen and indisposed to narrate the horrid details the girl went to her own room and seating herself in the window tried to collect her thoughts she was tempted to believe the whole affair a hideous dream which would pass away with vigorous rubbing of her eyes but the crushed purple and scarlet flowers she took from her forehead her

boards and temporarily placed on ednas bed and toward evening when a coffin arrived from chattanooga the remains were removed and the coffin rested on two chairs in the middle of the same room the surgeon insisted upon an immediate interment near the scene of combat but the gentleman who had officiated as second for the deceased expressed his determination to carry the unfortunate mans body back to his home and family and the earliest train on the following day was appointed as the time for their departure late in the afternoon edna cautiously opened the door of the room which she had hitherto avoided and with her apron full of lilies while poppies and sprigs of ******** approached the coffin and looked at the rigid sleeper judging from his appearance not more than thirty years had gone over his handsome head his placid features were unusually regular and a soft silky brown beard fell upon his pulseless breast fearful lest she should touch the icy form the girl timidly strewed her flowers in the coffin and tears gathered and dropped with the blossoms as she noticed a plain gold ring on the little finger and wondered if he were ********* his death would leave wailing orphans in his home and a brokenhearted widow at the desolate hearthstone absorbed in her melancholy task she heard neither the sound of strange voices in the passage nor the faint ***** of the door as it swung back on its rusty hinges but a shrill scream a wild despairing shriek terrified her and her heart seemed to stand still as she bounded away from the side of the coffin the light of the setting sun streamed through the window and over the white convulsed face of a feeble but beautiful woman who was supported on the threshold by a venerable grayhaired man down whose furrowed cheeks tears coursed rapidly struggling to free herself from his *********** grasp the stranger tottered into the middle of the room o harry my husband my husband she threw up her wasted arms and fell forward senseless on the corpse they bore her into the adjoining apartment where the surgeon administered the usual restoratives and though finally the pulses stirred and throbbed feebly no symptom of returning consciousness greeted the anxious friends who bent over her hour after hour passed during which she lay as motionless as her husbands body and at length the physician sighed and pressing his fingers to his eyes said sorrowfully to the ************* old man beside her it is paralysis mr dent and there is no hope she may linger twelve or twentyfour hours but her sorrows are ended she and harry will soon be reunited knowing her constitution i feared as much you should not have suffered her to come you might have known that the shock would kill her for this reason i wished his body buried here i could not restrain her some meddling gossip told her that my poor boy had gone to fight a duel and she rose from her bed and started to the railroad depot i pleaded i reasoned with her that she could not bear the journey but i might as well have talked to the winds i never knew her obstinate before but she seemed to have a presentiment of the truth god pity her two sweet babes the old man bowed his head upon her pillow and sobbed aloud throughout the night edna crouched beside the bed watching the wan but lovely face of the young widow and tenderly chafing the numb fair hands which lay so motionless on the coverlet children are always sanguine because of their ignorance of the stern inexorable realities of the untried future and edna could not believe that death would snatch from the world one so beautiful and so necessary to her prattling fatherless infants but morning showed no encouraging symptoms the stupor was unbroken and at noon the wifes spirit passed gently to the everlasting reunion before sunrise on the ensuing day a sad group clustered once more under the dripping chestnuts and where a pool of blood had dyed the sod a wide grave yawned the coffins were lowered the bodies of henry and helen dent rested side by side and as the mound rose slowly above them the solemn silence was broken by the faltering voice of the surgeon who read the burial service man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery he cometh up and is cut down like a flower he ****** as it were a shadow and never ********** in one stay yet o lord god most holy o lord most mighty o holy and most merciful saviour deliver us not into the pains of eternal death the melancholy **** ended the party dispersed the strangers took their departure for their distant homes and quiet reigned once more in the small dark cottage but days and weeks brought to edna no oblivion of the tragic events which constituted the first great epoch of her monotonous life a nervous restlessness took possession of her she refused to occupy her old room and insisted upon sleeping on a pallet at the foot of her grandfathers bed she forsook her whilom haunts about the spring and forest and started up in terror at every sudden sound while from each opening between the chestnut trees the hazel eyes of the dead man and the wan thin face of the goldenhaired wife looked out beseechingly at her frequently in the warm light of day ere shadows stalked to and fro in the thick woods she would steal with an ******** of wild flowers to the solitary grave scatter her treasures in the rank grass that waved above it and hurry away with hushed breath and quivering limbs summer waned autumn passed and winter came but the girl recovered in no degree from the shock which had cut short her chant of praise on that bloody june day in her morning visit to the spring she had stumbled upon a monster which custom had adopted and *********** the passions and sin fulness of men had adroitly draped and fondled and called honorable satisfaction but her pure *********** ******** nature pierced the conventional mask recognized the loathsome lineaments of crime and recoiled in horror and amazement wondering at the wickedness of her race and the forbearance of outraged jehovah innocent childhood had for the first time stood face to face with sin and death and could not forget the vision edna earl had lost both her parents before she was old enough to remember either her mother was the only daughter of aaron hunt the village blacksmith and her father who was an intelligent promising young carpenter accidentally fell from the roof of the house which he was ********* and died from the injuries sustained thus mr hunt who had been a widower for nearly ten years found himself burdened with the care of an infant only six months old his daughter had never left him and after her death the loneliness of the house oppressed him painfully and for

loved the little orphan committed to her care she contrived to alienate her affection and to tighten the bonds of union between her husband and the child possessing a remarkably amiable and equable disposition edna rarely vexed mrs hunt who gradually left her more and more to the indulgence of her own views and caprices and contented herself with exacting a certain amount of daily work after the accomplishment of which she allowed her to amuse herself as childish whims dictated there chanced to be no children of her own age in the neighborhood consequently she grew up without companionship save that furnished by her grandfather who was ******** fond of her and would have utterly spoiled her had not her temperament fortunately been one not easily injured by ************ liberty of action before she was able to walk he would take her to the forge and keep her for hours on a ********* in one corner whence she watched with infantile delight the blast of the furnace and the shower of sparks that fell from the anvil and where she often slept lulled by the monotonous chorus of trip and sledge as she grew older the mystery of ******* and ******** engaged her attention and at one end of the shop on a pile of shavings she collected a mass of curiously shaped bits of iron and steel and blocks of wood from which a miniature shop threatened to rise in rivalry and finally when strong enough to grasp the handles of the ******* her greatest pleasure consisted in rendering the feeble assistance which her grandfather was always so proud to accept at her hands although ignorant and ************ mr hunt was a man of warm tender feelings and rare nobility of soul he regretted the absence of early advantages which poverty had denied him and in teaching edna to read and to write and to cipher he never failed to impress upon her the vast superiority which a thorough education ******* whether his ************ first kindled her ambition or whether her aspiration for knowledge was spontaneous and irrepressible he knew not but she manifested very early a fondness for study and thirst for learning which he gratified to the fullest extent of his limited ability the blacksmiths library consisted of the family bible pilgrims progress a copy of ******* sermons on ******** guy ********* a few ****** and two books which had belonged to an ********* minister who preached occasionally in the neighborhood and who having died rather suddenly at mr hunts house left the volumes in his saddlebags which were never claimed by his family residing in a distant state those books were ********* lives and a worn school copy of ******* classical dictionary and to edna they proved a literary ***** of inestimable value and *********** interest plutarch especially was a ****** of letters whence the vast domain of learning the ****** of human wisdom stretched ********** before her and as often as she climbed this height and viewed the wondrous scene beyond it seemed indeed an arch where through gleams that ********** world whose margin fades forever and forever when we move in after years she sometimes questioned if this mount of observation was also that of temptation to which ambition had led her spirit and there ********* for and bought her future love of nature love of books an earnest piety and deep religious enthusiasm were the characteristics of a noble young soul left to stray through the devious checkered paths of life without other guidance than that which she received from communion with greek sages and hebrew prophets an utter stranger to fashionable conventionality and ************** ethics it was no marvel that the child stared and shivered when she saw the laws of god vetoed and was blandly introduced to murder as honorable satisfaction nearly a mile from the small straggling village of chattanooga stood aaron hunts shop shaded by a grove of oak and chestnut trees which grew upon the knoll where two roads *********** like the majority of blacksmiths shops at country crossroads it was a low narrow shed filled with dust and rubbish with old wheels and new *********** broken ***** and dilapidated wagons awaiting repairs and at the rear of the shop stood a smaller shed where an old gray horse quietly ate his corn and fodder waiting to carry the master to his home two miles distant as soon as the sun had set beyond the neighboring mountain early in winter having an unusual amount of work on hand mr hunt hurried away from home one morning neglecting to take the bucket which contained his dinner and edna was sent to repair the oversight accustomed to ramble about the woods without companionship she walked leisurely along the rocky road swinging the tin bucket in one hand and pausing now and then to watch the shy ******** that flitted like ********* in and out of the trees as she passed the unbroken repose of earth and sky the cold still atmosphere and peaceful sunshine touched her heart with a sense of quiet but pure happiness and half unconsciously she began a hymn which her grandfather often sang over his anvil lord in the morning thou shalt hear my voice ascending high to thee will i direct my prayer to thee lift up mine eye ere the first verse was ended the clatter of a horses hoofs hushed her song and she glanced up as a harsh voice asked impatiently are you stone deaf i say is there a blacksmiths shop near the rider reined in his horse a spirited beautiful animal and waited for an answer yes sir there is a shop about half a mile ahead on the right hand side where the road forks he just touched his hat with the end of his gloved fingers and galloped on when edna reached the shop she saw her grandfather examining the horses shoes while the stranger walked up and down the road before the forge he was a very tall strong man with a gray shawl thrown over one shoulder and a black fur hat drawn so far over his face that only the lower portion was visible and this swarthy and harsh left a most disagreeable impression on the childs mind as she passed him and went up to the spot where mr hunt was at work putting the bucket behind her she stooped kissed him on his furrowed forehead and said grandpa guess what brought me to see you today i forgot my dinner and you have trudged over here to bring it aint i right pearl stand back honey or this satan of a horse may kick your brains out i can hardly manage him here the stranger uttered an oath and called out how much longer do you intend to keep me waiting no longer sir than i can help as i like the company of polite people oh grandpa whispered edna ************* as she saw the traveller come rapidly forward and throw his shawl down on the grass mr hunt pushed back his old battered woolen hat and looked steadily at the master of the *********** gravely and resolutely ill finish the job as soon as i can and that is as much as any reasonable man would ask now sir if that doesnt suit you you can take your horse and put out and swear at somebody else for i wont stand it it is a cursed nuisance to be detained here for such a trifle as one shoe and you might hurry yourself your horse is very restless and vicious and i could shoe two gentle ones while i am trying to quiet him the man muttered something indistinctly and laying his hand heavily on the horses mane said very sternly a few words which were utterly ************** to his human listeners though they certainly exerted a magical influence over the fiery creature who savage as the pampered pets of ******** soon stood tranquil and contented rubbing his head against his masters shoulder repelled by the rude harshness of this man edna walked into the shop and watched the silent group outside until the work was finished and mr hunt threw down his tools and wiped his face what do i owe you said the impatient rider springing to his saddle and putting his hand into his vest pocket i charge nothing for such trifles as that but i am in the habit of paying for my work it is not worth talking about good day sir mr hunt turned and walked into his shop there is a dollar it is the only small change i have he rode up to the door of the shed threw the small gold coin toward the blacksmith and was riding rapidly away when edna darted after him exclaiming stop sir you have left your shawl he turned in the saddle and even under the screen of her calico bonnet she felt the fiery gleam of his eyes as he stooped to take the shawl from her hand once more his fingers touched his hat he bowed and said hastily i thank you child then spurring his horse he was out of sight in a moment he is a rude blasphemous wicked man said mr hunt as edna reentered the shop and picked up the coin which lay glistening amid the ******* around the anvil why do you think him wicked no good man swears as he did before you came and didnt you notice the vicious wicked expression of his eyes no sir i did not see much of his face he never looked at me but once i should not like to meet him again i am afraid of him never fear pearl he is a stranger here and theres little chance of your ever setting your eyes on his ugly savage face again keep the money dear i wont have it after all the airs he put on if instead of ******* his wild brute i had knocked the fellow down for his insolence in cursing me it would have served him right politeness is a cheap thing and a poor man if he ******* himself and does his work well is as much entitled to it as the president i will give the dollar to grandma to buy a new ********* for she said today the old one was burnt out and she could not use it any longer but what is that yonder on the grass that man left something after all she picked up from the spot where he had thrown his shawl a handsome ************ pocket copy of dante and opening it to discover the name of the owner she saw written on the flyleaf in a bold and beautiful hand s e m ****** gardens florence ******** **** ******** *** ** ******* what does this mean grandpa she held up the book and pointed out the words of the dread inscription indeed pearl how should i know it is greek or latin or dutch like the other outlandish ********* he talked to that devilish horse he must have spent his life among the heathens to judge from his talk for he has neither manner nor religion honey better put the book there in the furnace it is not fit for your eyes he may come back for it if he misses it pretty soon not he one might almost believe that he was running from the law he would not turn back for it if it was bound in gold instead of leather it is no account ill warrant or he would not have been reading it the illmannered heathen weeks passed and as the owner was not heard of again edna felt that she might justly claim as her own this most marvellous of books which though beyond her comprehension furnished a source of endless wonder and delight the copy was garys translation with illustrations designed by ******* and many of the grand gloomy passages were ********** by pencil and ********* in the unknown tongue which so completely baffled her curiosity night and day she ***** over this new treasure sometimes dreaming of the hideous

station in life and well calculated to ********** her with her humble unpretending home and uninviting future education she contended was useless to poor people who could not feed and clothe themselves with book learning and experience had taught her that those who ******* about with books in their hands generally came to want and invariably to harm it was in vain that she endeavored to convince her husband of the impropriety of permitting the girl to spend so much time over her books he finally put the matter at rest by declaring that in his opinion edna was a remarkable child and if well educated might even rise to the position of teacher for the neighborhood which would confer most honorable distinction upon the family laying his brawny hand fondly on her head he said tenderly let her alone wife let her alone you will make us proud of you wont you little pearl when you are smart enough to teach a school i shall be too old to work by that time and you will take care

thou availing christ and fill this pause of all that occurred during many ensuing weeks edna knew little she retained in after years only a vague confused remembrance of keen anguish and utter prostration and an abiding sense of irreparable loss in delirious visions she saw her grandfather now struggling in the grasp of ******** and now writhing in the fiery tomb of ****** with jets of flame leaping through his white hair and his shrunken hands stretched appealingly toward her as she had seen those of the doomed ********** leader in the hideous dante picture all the appalling images evoked by the sombre and embittered imagination of the gloomy ****** had seized upon her fancy even in happy hours and were now reproduced by her disordered brain in multitudinous and aggravated forms her wails of agony her passionate prayers to god to release the beloved spirit from the tortures which her delirium painted were painful beyond expression to those who watched her ravings and it was with a feeling of relief that they finally saw her sink into ********** a quiet mental ********** which nothing seemed to rouse her she did not remark mrs hunts absence or the presence of the neighbors at her bedside and one morning when she was wrapped up and placed by the fire mrs wood told her as gently as possible that her grandmother had died from a disease which was ******** the country and supposed to be ******* the intelligence produced no emotion she merely looked up an instant glanced mournfully around the dreary room and shivering slightly drooped her head again on her hand week after week went slowly by and she was removed to mrs woods house but no improvement was discernible and the belief became general that the childs mind had sunk into hopeless imbecility the kindhearted miller and his wife endeavored to coax her out of her chair by the ************* but she crouched there a wan mute figure of woe pitiable to contemplate asking no questions causing no trouble receiving no consolation one bright march morning she sat as usual with her face bowed on her thin hand and her vacant gaze fixed on the blazing fire when through the open window came the impatient lowing of a cow mrs wood saw a change pass swiftly over the girls face and a quiver cross the lips so long frozen she lifted her head rose and followed the sound and soon stood at the side of brindle who now furnished milk for the millers family as the gentle cow recognized and looked at her with an expression almost human in the mild liquid eyes all the events of that last serene evening swept back to ednas ******** memory and leaning her head on brindles horns she shed the first tears that had flowed for her great loss while sobs thick and suffocating shook her feeble emaciated frame bless the poor little outcast she will get well now that is just exactly what she needs i tell you peter one good cry like that is worth a wagonload of ****** dont go near her let her have her cry out poor thing it aint often you see a child love her ********** as she loved aaron hunt poor lamb mrs wood wiped her own eyes and went back to her weaving and edna turned away from the mill and walked to her deserted home while the tears poured ceaselessly over her white cheeks as she approached the old house she saw that it was shut up and neglected but when she opened the gate grip the fierce yellow terror of the whole neighborhood sprang from the doorstep where he kept guard as tirelessly as ***** and with a dismal ***** of welcome leaped up and put his paws on her shoulders this had been the blacksmiths pet fed by his hand chained when he went to the shop and released at his return and grim and *********** ugly though he was the only playmate edna had ever known had ******** around her cradle slept with her on the ********* and ********* with her through the woods in many a long search for brindle he alone remained of all the happy past and as precious memories crowded mournfully up she sat upon the steps of the dreary homestead with her arms around his neck and wept bitterly after an hour she left the house and followed by the dog crossed the woods in the direction of the neighborhood graveyard in order to reach it she was forced to pass by the spring and the green hillock where mr and mrs dent slept side by side but no nervous terror seized her now as formerly the great present horror swallowed up all others and though she trembled from physical ******** she dragged herself on till the rude rough paling of the buryingground stood before her

orphan wrestling with grief and loneliness striving to face a future that loomed before her *************** and here mr wood found her when anxiety at her long absence induced his wife to search for the missing invalid the storm of sobs and tears had spent itself fortitude took the measure of the burden imposed shouldered the galling weight and henceforth with undimmed vision walked steadily to the appointed goal the miller was surprised to find her so calm and as they went homeward she asked the particulars of all that had occurred and thanked him gravely but cordially for the kind care bestowed upon her and for the last friendly offices performed for her grandfather conscious of her complete helplessness and physical prostration she ventured no allusion to the future but waited patiently until renewed strength permitted the execution of designs now fully mapped out notwithstanding her feebleness she rendered herself invaluable to mrs wood who praised her ********* and neatness as a ********** and predicted that she would make a model housekeeper late one sunday evening in may as the miller and his wife sat upon the steps of their humble and comfortless looking home they saw edna slowly approaching and surmised where she had spent the afternoon instead of going into the house she seated herself beside them and removing her bonnet traces of tears were visible on her sad but patient face you ought not to go over yonder so often child it is not good for you said the miller knocking the ashes from his pipe she shaded her countenance with her hand and after a moment said in a low but steady tone i shall never go there again i have said goodbye to everything and have nothing now to keep me here you and mrs wood have been very kind to me and i thank you heartily but you have a family of children and have your hands full to support them without taking care of me i know that our house must go to you to pay that old debt and even the horse and cow and there will be nothing left when you are paid you are very good indeed to offer me a home here and i never can forget your kindness but i should not be willing to live on anybodys charity and besides all the world is alike to me now and i want to get out of sight ******** shows my sorrow to me every day i dont love this place now it wont let me forget even for a minute ****** here the voice faltered and she paused but where could you go and how could you make your bread you poor little ailing thing i hear that in the town of columbus georgia even little children get wages to work in the factory and i know i can earn enough to pay my board among the factory people but you are too young to be ******** about in a strange place if you will stay here and help my wife about the house and the weaving i will take good care of you and clothe you till you are grown and married i would rather go away because i want to be educated and i cant be if i stay here *********** you will know as much as the balance of us and thats all you will ever have any use for i notice you have a ********* after books but the quicker you get that *********** out of your head the better for books wont put bread in your mouth and clothes on your back and folks that want to be better than their neighbors generally turn out worse the less ************ you women have the better i dont see that it is any of your business peter wood how much learning we women choose to get provided your bread is baked and your socks darned when you want em a woman has as good a right as a man to get ************ if she wants it and as for sense ill thank you mine is as good as yours any day and folks have said it was a blessed thing for the neighborhood when the ********* laid peter wood up and his wife dorothy elmira wood run the mill now its of no earthly use to cut at us women over that childs shoulders if she wants an education she has as much right to it as anybody if she can pay for it my doctrine is everybody has a right to whatever they can pay for whether it is schooling or a satin frock mrs wood seized her *********** and plunged a stick vigorously into the contents and as the miller showed no disposition to skirmish she continued i take an interest in you edna earl because i loved your mother who was the only sweettempered beauty that ever i knew i think i never set my eyes on a prettier face with big brown eyes as meek as a partridges and then her hands and feet were as small as a queens now as long as you are satisfied to stay here i shall be glad to have you and i will do as well for you as for my own tabitha but if you are bent on factory work and schooling i have got no more to say for i have no right to say where you shall go or where you shall stay but one thing i do want to tell you it is a serious thing for a poor motherless girl to be all alone among strangers there was a brief silence and edna answered slowly yes mrs wood i know it is but god can protect me there as well as here and i have none now but him i have made up my mind to go because i think it is the best for me and i hope mr wood will carry me to the chattanooga depot tomorrow morning as the train leaves early i have a little ********** *************** grandpa gave me at different times and both brindles calves belong to **** gave them to meand i thought may be you would pay me a few dollars for them but you are not ready to start tomorrow yes sir i washed and ****** my clothes yesterday and what few i have are all packed in my box everything is ready now and as i have to go i might as well start tomorrow dont you think you will get dreadfully homesick in about a month and write to me to come and fetch you back i have no home and nobody to love me how then can i ever be homesick grandpas grave is all the home i have ********* would not take me there when i was so sick ****** the quiver of her face showed that she was losing her selfcontrol and turning away she took the cedar ****** and went out to milk brindle for the last time feeling that they had no right to dictate her future course neither the miller nor his wife offered any further opposition and very early the next morning after mrs wood had given the girl what she called some good motherly advice and provided her with a basket containing food for the journey she kissed her heartily several times and saw her stowed away in the millers covered cart which was to convey her to the railway station the road ran by the old blacksmiths shop and mr woods eyes filled as he noticed the wistful lingering loving gaze which the girl fixed upon it until a grove of trees shut out the view then the head bowed itself and a stifled moan reached his ears the engine whistled as they approached the station and edna was hurried aboard the train while her companion busied himself in transferring her box of clothing to the baggage car she had insisted on taking her grandfathers dog with her and notwithstanding the horrified looks of the passengers and the scowl of the conductor he followed her into the car and threw himself under the seat glaring at all who passed and looking as ********* savage as the norse ********** you cant have a whole seat to yourself and nobody wants to sit near that ugly brute said the surly conductor edna glanced down the aisle and saw two young gentlemen stretched at full length on separate seats eyeing her curiously observing that the small seat next to the door was partially filled with the luggage of the parties who sat in front of it she rose and called to the dog saying to the conductor as she did so i will take that half of a seat yonder where i shall be in nobodys way here mr wood came forward thrust her ticket into her fingers and shook her hand warmly saying hurriedly hold on to your ticket and dont put your head out of the window i told the conductor he must look after you and your box when you left the cars said he would goodby edna take care of yourself and may god bless you child the locomotive whistled the train moved slowly on and the miller hastened back to his cart as the engine got fully under way and dashed around a curve the small straggling village disappeared trees and hills seemed to the orphan to fly past the window and when she leaned out and looked back only the *********** rocks of lookout and the dim purplish outline of the ********** heights were familiar in the shadow of that solitary sentinel peak her life had been passed she had gathered chestnuts and ********** among its wooded ****** and clambered over its gray boulders as fearlessly as the young ****** of the ****** and now as it rapidly receded and finally vanished she felt as if the last link that bound her to the past had suddenly snapped the last friendly face which had daily looked down on her for twelve years was shut out forever and she and grip were indeed alone in a great struggling world of selfishness and sin the sun shone dazzlingly over wide fields of grain whose green billows swelled and surged under the freshening breeze golden butterflies fluttered over the pink and blue morningglories that festooned the ********** a ******** whistled merrily on the platform and children inside the car ******** and played while at one end a slender little girlish figure in homespun dress and pink calico bonnet crouched in a corner of the seat staring back in the direction of hooded lookout feeling that each instant bore her farther from the dear graves of her dead and oppressed with an intolerable sense of desolation and utter isolation in the midst of hundreds of her own race who were too entirely absorbed in their individual speculations fears and aims to spare even a glance at that solitary young mariner who saw the last ******** fade from view and found herself with no pilot but ambition drifting rapidly out on the great unknown treacherous sea of life strewn with mournful human wrecks whom the charts and ***** of six thousand years of navigation could not guide to a haven of usefulness and peace interminable seemed the dreary day which finally drew to a close and edna who was weary of her cramped position laid her aching head on the windowsill and watched the red light of day die in the west where a young moon hung her silvery crescent among the dusky treetops and the stars flashed out thick and fast far away among strangers ******* for and unnoticed come what might she felt that gods ********** stars smiled down as lovingly upon her face as on her grandfathers grave and that the cosmopolitan language of nature knew neither the modifications of time and space the distinctions of social caste nor the limitations of national dialects as the night wore on she opened the cherished copy of dante and tried to read but the print was too fine for the dim lamp which hung at some distance from her corner her head ached violently and as sleep was impossible she put the book back in her pocket and watched the flitting trees and fences rocky banks and occasional houses which seemed weird in the darkness as silence deepened in the car her sense of loneliness became more and more painful and finally she turned and pressed her cheek against the fair chubby hand of a baby who slept with its curly head on its mothers shoulder and its little dimpled arm and hand hanging over the back of the seat there was comfort and a soothing sensation of human companionship in the touch of that babys hand it seemed a link in the electric chain of sympathy and after a time the orphans eyes ************* conquered memory and sorrow and she fell asleep with her lips pressed to those mesmeric baby fingers and ***** head resting against her knee *************** lilies of the field folded their perfumed petals under the syrian dew ********* god nightly baptized them in token of his ceaseless guardianship and the sinless world of birds the fowls of the air those secure and ****** yet

with the rigid edict of *********** necessity that at that instant the ******** of death ******* down on the sleeping passengers and silver cords and golden bowls were rudely snapped and crushed amid the crash of timbers the screams of women and children and the groans of tortured men that made night hideous over the holy hills of ***** out of crumbling jerusalem the message of ******* has floated on the wings of eighteen centuries what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter edna was awakened by a succession of shrill sounds which indicated that the engineer was either frightened or frantic the conductor rushed bareheaded through the car people sprang to their feet there was a scramble on the platform then a shock and crash as if the day of doom had ********* all was chaos viewed by the aid of lanterns and the lurid flickering light of torches the scene of disaster presented a ghastly ****** of dead and dying of crushed cars and wounded men and women who writhed and groaned among the shattered timbers from which they found it impossible to extricate themselves the cries of those who recognized relatives in the mutilated corpses that were dragged out from the wreck increased the horrors of the occasion and when edna opened her eyes amid the flaring of torches and the piercing wails of the bereaved passengers the first impression was that she had died and gone to ****** hell but the pangs that seized her when she attempted to move soon dispelled this frightful illusion and by degrees the truth presented itself to her blunted faculties she was held fast between timbers one of which seemed to have fallen across her feet and crushed them as she was unable to move them and was conscious of a horrible sensation of ******** one arm too was ******** at her side and something heavy and cold lay upon her throat and chest lifting this weight with her uninjured hand she uttered an exclamation of horror as the white face of the little baby whose fingers she had clasped now met her astonished gaze and she saw that the sweet coral lips were pinched and purple the waxen lids lay rigid over the blue eyes and the dimpled hand was stiff and icy the confusion increased as day dawned and a large crowd collected to offer assistance and edna watched her approaching ********** as they cut their way through the wreck and lifted out the wretched sufferers finally two men with axes in their hands bent down and looked into her face here is a live child and a dead baby ****** in between these beams are you much hurt little one yes i believe i am please take this log off my feet it was a difficult matter but at length strong arms raised her carried her some distance from the ruins and placed her on the grass where several other persons were writhing and groaning the collision which precipitated the train from *********** over a deep ravine had occurred near a village station and two physicians were busily engaged in examining the wounded the sun had risen and shone full on ednas pale suffering face when one of the surgeons with a countenance that indexed earnest sympathy and compassion came to investigate the extent of her injuries and sat down on the grass beside her very tenderly he handled her and after a few moments said gently i am obliged to hurt you a little my child for your shoulder is ********** and some of the bones are broken in your feet but i will be as tender as possible here ****** help me the pain was so intense that she fainted and after a short time when she recovered her consciousness her feet and ankles were tightly bandaged and the doctor was chafing her hands and bathing her face with some powerful extract smoothing back her hair he said were your parents on the cars do you know whether they are hurt they both died when i was a baby who was with you nobody but ****** dog had you no relatives or friends on the train i have none i am all alone in the world where did you come from chattanooga where were you going my grandpa died and as i had nobody to take care of me i was going to columbus to work in the cotton factory humph much work you will do for many a long day he stroked his grayish beard and mused a moment and edna said timidly if you please sir i would like to know if my dog is hurt the physician smiled and looked round inquiringly has any one seen a dog that was on the train one of the ******** a stout irishman took his pipe from his mouth and answered aye aye sir and as vicious a brute as ever i set eyes on both his hind legs were ************** ***** i tapped him on the head with an axe to put him out of his misery yonder he now lies on the track edna put her hand over her eyes and turned her face down on the grass to hide tears that would not be driven back here the surgeon was called away and for a half hour the child lay there wondering what would become of her in her present crippled and helpless condition and questioning in her heart why god did not take her instead of that dimpled darling whose parents were now weeping so bitterly for the untimely death that ***** their blossom ere its petals were expanded the chilling belief was fast gaining ground that god had cursed and forsaken her that misfortune and bereavement would dog her steps through life and a hard bitter expression settled about her mouth and looked out gloomily from the sad eyes her painful reverie was interrupted by the cheery voice of dr rodney who came back accompanied by an **************** middleaged lady ah my brave little soldier tell us your name edna earl have you no relatives asked the lady stooping to scrutinize her face no maam she is a very pretty child mrs murray and if you can take care of her even for a few weeks until she is able to walk about it will be a real charity i never saw so much fortitude displayed by one so young but her fever is increasing and she needs immediate attention will it be convenient for you to carry her to your house at once certainly doctor order the carriage driven up as close as possible i brought a small mattress and think the ride will not be very painful what splendid eyes she has poor little thing of course you will come and prescribe for her and i will see that she is carefully nursed until she is quite well again here henry you and richard must lift this child and put her on the mattress in the carriage mind you do not stumble and hurt her during the drive neither spoke and edna was in so much pain that she lay with her eyes closed as they entered a long avenue the rattle of the wheels on the gravel aroused the childs attention and when the carriage stopped and she was carried up a flight of broad marble steps she saw that the house was very large and handsome bring her into the room next to mine said mrs murray leading the way edna was soon undressed and placed within the snowy sheets of a ************* bedstead whose crimson canopy shed a ruby light down on the laced and ruffled pillows mrs murray administered a dose of medicine given to her by dr rodney and after closing the blinds to exclude the light she felt the girls pulse found that she had fallen into a heavy sleep and then with a sigh went down to take her breakfast it was several hours before edna awoke and when she opened her eyes and looked around the elegantly furnished and beautiful room she felt bewildered mrs murray sat in a cushioned chair near one of the windows with a book in her hand and edna had an opportunity of studying her face it was fair proud and handsome but wore an expression of habitual anxiety and gray hairs showed themselves under the costly lace that bordered her morning ********* while lines of care marked her brow and mouth children instinctively decipher the ************* which time ****** on human faces and in reading the countenance of her hostess edna felt that she was a haughty ambitious woman with a kind but not very warm heart who would be scrupulously attentive to the wants of a sick child but would probably never dream of caressing or ******** such a charge chancing to glance towards the bed as she turned a leaf mrs murray met the curious gaze fastened upon her and rising approached the sufferer how do you feel edna i believe that is your name thank you my head is better but i am very thirsty the lady of the house gave her some iced water in a silver goblet and ordered a servant to bring up the refreshments she had directed prepared as she felt the girls pulse edna noticed how white and soft her hands were and how dazzlingly the jewels flashed on her fingers and she longed for the touch of those aristocratic hands on her hot brow where the hair clustered so heavily how old are you edna almost thirteen had you any luggage on the train i had a small box of clothes i will send a servant for it she rang the bell as she spoke when do you think i shall be able to walk about probably not for many weeks if you need or wish anything you must not hesitate to ask for it a servant will sit here and you have only to tell her what you want you are very kind maam and i thank you very much she paused and her eyes filled with tears mrs murray looked at her and said gravely what is the matter child i am only sorry i was so ungrateful and wicked this morning how so oh everything that i love dies and when i lay there on the grass unable to move among strangers who knew and cared nothing about me i was wicked and would not try to pray and thought god wanted to make me suffer all my life and i wished that i had been killed instead of that dear little baby who had a father and mother to kiss and love it it was all wrong to feel so but i was so wretched and then god raised up friends even among strangers and shows me i am not forsaken if i am desolate i begin to think he took everybody away from me that i might see how he could take care of me without them i know he doeth all things well but i feel it now and i am so sorry i could not trust him without seeing it edna wiped away her tears and mrs murrays voice faltered slightly as she said you are a good little girl i have no doubt who taught you to be so religious grandpa how long since you lost him four months can you read oh yes maam well i shall send you a bible and you must make yourself as contented as possible i shall take good care of you as the hostess left the room a ************ elderly negro woman took a seat at the window and sewed silently now and then glancing toward the bed exhausted with pain and fatigue edna slept again and it was night when she opened her eyes and found dr rodney and mrs murray at her pillow the kind surgeon talked pleasantly for some time and after giving ample instructions took his leave ********* his patient to keep up her fortitude and all would soon be well so passed the first day of her sojourn under the hospitable roof which appeared so ************ to shelter her and the child thanked god fervently for the kind hands into which she had fallen day after day wore wearily away and at the end of a fortnight though much prostrated by fever and suffering she was propped up in bed by pillows while hagar the servant combed and plaited the long thick matted hair mrs murray came often to the room but her visits were short and though invariably kind and considerate edna felt an involuntary awe of her which rendered her manner exceedingly constrained when they were together hagar was almost as ******** as her mistress and as the girl asked few questions she remained in complete ignorance of the household affairs and had never seen any one but mrs murray hagar and the doctor she was well supplied with books which the former brought from the library and thus the invalid contrived to amuse herself during the long tedious summer days one afternoon in june edna persuaded hagar to lift her to a large cushioned chair close to the open window which looked out on the lawn and here with a book on her lap she sat gazing out at the soft blue sky the waving elm boughs and the glittering plumage of a beautiful ********* pheasant which seemed in the golden sunshine to have forgotten the rosy glow of his native snows leaning her elbows on the windowsill edna rested her face in her palms and after a few minutes a tide of tender memories rose and swept over her heart bringing a touching expression of patient sorrow to her sweet wan face and giving a faroff wistful look to the beautiful eyes where tears often gathered but very rarely fell hagar had dressed her in a new white muslin wrapper with fluted ruffles at the wrists and throat and the fair young face with its delicate features and glossy folds of soft hair was a pleasant picture which the nurse loved to contemplate standing with her ********** in her hand she watched the graceful little figure for two or three moments and a warm loving light shone out over her black features then nodding her head resolutely she muttered i will have my way this once she shall stay and passed out of the room closing the door behind her edna did not remark her departure for memory was busy among the ashes of other days ******** a thousand precious reminiscences of mountain home chestnut groves showers of sparks ******** an anvil with fire and an old mans unpainted ********* in the deserted buryingground she started nervously when a half hour later mrs murray laid her hand gently on her shoulder and said child of what are you thinking for an instant she could not command her voice which faltered but making a strong effort she answered in a low tone of all that i have lost and what i am to do in future would you be willing to work all your life in a factory no maam only long enough to educate myself so that i could teach you could not obtain a suitable education in that way and beside i do not think that the factory you spoke of would be an agreeable place for you i have made some inquiries about it since you came here i know it will not be pleasant but then i am obliged to work in some way and i dont see what else i can do i am not able to pay for an education now and i am determined to have one mrs murrays eyes wandered out toward the velvety lawn and she mused for some minutes then laying her hands on the orphans head she said child will you trust your future and your education to me i do not mean that i will teach ***** ***** i will have you thoroughly educated so that when you are grown you can support yourself by teaching i have no ********* lost mine when she was a babe but i could not have seen her enter a factory and as you remind me of my own child i will not allow you to go there i will take care of and educate ******* see that you have everything you require if you are willing to be directed and advised by me understand me i do not adopt you nor shall i consider you exactly as one of my family but i shall prove a good friend and protector till you are eighteen and capable of providing for yourself you will live in my house and look upon it as your home at least for the present what do you say to this plan is it not much better and more pleasant than a ********* chase after an education through the dust and din of a factory oh mrs murray you are very generous and good but i have no claim on ***** right to impose such expense and trouble upon you i am hush child you have that claim which poverty always has on wealth as for the expense that is a mere trifle and i do not expect you to give me any trouble perhaps you may even make yourself useful to me thank you oh thank you maam i am very grateful i can not tell you how much i thank you but i shall try to prove it if you will let me stay ****** one condition what is that that when i am able to pay you you will receive the money that my education and clothes will cost you mrs murray laughed and stroked the silky black hair where did you get such proud notions pay me indeed you poor little beggar ha ha ha well yes you may do as you please when you are able that time is rather too distant to be considered now meanwhile quit ******** over the past and think only of improving yourself i do not like doleful faces and shall expect you to be a cheerful contented and obedient girl hagar is making you an entire set of new clothes and i hope to see you always neat i shall give you a smaller room than ******* one across the hall you will keep your books there and remain there during study hours at other times you can come to my room or amuse yourself as you like and when there is company here remember i shall always expect you to sit quietly and listen to the conversation as it is very improving to young girls to be in really good society you will have a music teacher and practice on the upright piano in the library instead of the large one in the parlor one thing more if you want anything come to me and ask for it and i shall be very much displeased if you talk to the servants or encourage them to talk to you now everything is understood and i hope you will be happy and properly improve the advantages i shall give you edna drew one of the white hands down to her lips and murmured thank ******** you you shall never have cause to regret your goodness and your wishes shall always guide me well well i shall remember this promise and trust i may never find it necessary to remind you of it i dare say we shall get on very happily together dont thank me any more and hereafter we need not speak of the matter mrs murray stooped and for the first time kissed the childs white forehead and edna longed to throw her arms about the stately form but the polished hauteur awed and repelled her before she could reply and just as mrs murray was moving toward the door it was thrown open and a gentleman strode into the room at sight of edna he stopped suddenly and dropping a bag of game on the floor exclaimed harshly what the dl does this mean my son i am so glad you are at home again i was getting quite uneasy at your long absence this is one of the victims of that terrible railroad disaster the neighborhood is full of the sufferers come to my room when did you arrive she linked her arm in his picked up the ******* and led him to the adjoining room the door of which she closed and locked a painful thrill shot along ednas nerves and an indescribable sensation of dread a presentiment of coming ill overshadowed her heart this was the son of her friend and the first glimpse of him filled her with instantaneous repugnance there was an innate and powerful repulsion which she could not analyze he was a tall athletic man not exactly young yet certainly not elderly one of anomalous appearance prematurely old and though not one white thread silvered his thick waving brown hair the heavy and habitual scowl on his high full brow had plowed deep furrows such as age claims for its ******** his features were bold but very regular the piercing ********* eyes were unusually large and beautifully shaded with long heavy black lashes but repelled by their cynical glare and the finely formed mouth which might have imparted a wonderful charm to the countenance wore a chronic savage sneer as if it only opened to utter jeers and curses evidently the face had once been singularly handsome in the dawn of his earthly career when his mothers goodnight kiss rested like a blessing on his smooth boyish forehead and the prayer learned in the nursery still crept across his pure lips but now the fair ******** lineaments were blotted by dissipation and blackened and distorted by the baleful fires of a fierce passionate nature and a restless powerful and ********** intellect *********** and grand as that temple of juno in shrouded ******* whose polished shafts gleamed centuries ago in the morning sunshine of a day of woe whose untimely night has endured for nineteen hundred years so in the glorious flush of his youth this man had stood facing a noble and possibly a sanctified future but the ungovernable flames of sin had reduced him like that darkened and desecrated **** to a melancholy mass of ashy arches and blackened

distressed and wondering how she could avoid all the ************ of this amiable character under whose roof fate seemed to have deposited her at length by the aid of crutches edna was able to leave

was extinguished when mrs murray remarked one day that passage leads to my sons apartments and he dislikes noise or intrusion thenceforth edna avoided it as if the ******* of pharaoh were pent therein

but fate brought her to the vestibule of the temple of mammon and its defiling incense floated about her how long would the consecration last as she slowly limped about the house and grounds acquainting herself with the details she was impressed with the belief that happiness had once held her court here had been dethroned exiled and now waited beyond the confines of the park anxious but unable to renew her reign and expel ******** gloom for some weeks after her arrival she took her meals in her own room and having learned to recognize the hasty heavy tread of the dreaded master of the house she invariably fled from the sound of his steps as she would have shunned an ogre consequently her knowledge of him was limited to the brief inspection and *************** conversation which introduced him to her acquaintance on the day of his return her habitual avoidance and desire of continued concealment was however summarily thwarted when mrs murray came into her room late one night and asked did not i see you walking this afternoon without your crutches yes maam i was trying to see if i could not do without them entirely did the experiment cause you any pain no pain exactly but i find my ankle still weak be careful not to ********** it by degrees it will strengthen if you use it ********** by the by you are now well enough to come to the table and from breakfast tomorrow you

if you please mrs murray i would rather stay here pray what possible objection can you have to the diningroom edna averted her head but wrung her fingers nervously mrs murray frowned and continued gravely dont be silly edna it is proper that you should go to the table and learn to eat with a fork instead of a knife you need not be ashamed to meet people there is nothing ******** about you unless you affect it goodnight i shall see you at breakfast the bell rings at eight oclock there was no escape and she awoke next morning oppressed with the thought of the ordeal that awaited her she dressed herself even more carefully than usual despite the trembling of her hands and when the ringing of the little silver bell summoned her to the diningroom her heart seemed to stand still but though exceedingly sensitive and shy edna was brave and even selfpossessed and she promptly advanced to meet the trial entering the room she saw that her benefactress had not yet come in but was approaching the house with a basket of flowers in her hand and one swift glance around discovered mr murray standing at the window unobserved she scanned the tall powerful figure clad in a suit of white linen and saw that he wore no beard save the heavy but ************** moustache which now in some degree concealed the harshness about the handsome mouth only his profile was turned toward her and she noticed that while his forehead was singularly white his cheeks and chin were thoroughly bronzed from exposure as mrs murray came in she nodded to her young protegee and approached the table saying good morning it seems i am the laggard today but nicholas had ******* the flower ****** and detained me hereafter i shall turn over this work of dressing vases to you child my son this is your birthday and here is your buttonhole souvenir she fastened a few sprigs of white jasmine in his linen coat and as he thanked her briefly and turned to the table she said with marked emphasis st elmo let me introduce you to edna earl he looked around and fixed his keen eyes on the orphan whose cheeks crimsoned as she looked down and said quite distinctly good morning mr murray good morning miss earl no i protest miss earl indeed call the child edna as you please mother provided you do not let the coffee and chocolate get cold while you decide the momentous question neither spoke again for some time and in the embarrassing silence edna kept her eyes on the china wondering if all their breakfasts would be like this at last mr murray pushed away his large ********* and said abruptly after all it is only one year today since i came back to america though it seems much longer it will soon be time to prepare for my trip to the south sea islands the ********** here is intolerable an expression of painful surprise flitted across the mothers countenance but she answered quickly it has been an exceedingly short happy year to me you are such a confirmed ******** that when you are at home time slips by unnoticed but few and far between as my visits are they certainly never approach the angelic welcome the coming speed the parting guest must frequently recur to you before his mother could reply he rose ordered his horse and as he drew on his gloves and left the room looked over his shoulder saying indifferently that box of pictures from ****** is at the warehouse i directed henry to go after it this morning i will open it when i come home a moment after he passed the window on horseback and with a heavy sigh mrs murray dropped her head on her hand compressing her lips and ****** abstractedly with the ********** edna watched the grave troubled countenance for some seconds and then putting her hand on the ************ she asked softly shall i dress the ********** yes child in four rooms this the parlors and the library always cut the flowers very early while the dew is on them her eyes went back to the ********** and edna joyfully escaped from a room whose ********** and associations were irksome impressed by ****** vehement ********** to keep out of mr murrays path she avoided those portions of the house to which he seemed most partial and thus although they continued to meet at meals no words passed between them after that brief salutation on the morning of presentation very often she was painfully conscious that his searching eyes scrutinized her but though the blood mounted instantly to her cheeks at such times she never looked ********** his gaze as she would that of a ******** one sultry afternoon she went into the park and threw herself down on the long grass under a clump of cedars near which the deer and bison were quietly browsing while the large white ******** huddled in the shade and ******* at the sun opening a pictorial history of england which she had selected from the library she spread it on the grass and leaning her face in her palms rested her elbows on the ground and began to read now and then she paused as she turned a leaf to look around at the beautiful animals each one of which might have served as a model for ******** or rosa bonheur gradually the ******* of the atmosphere stole into her busy brain as the sun crept down the sky her eyelids sunk with it and very soon she was fast asleep with her head on the book and her cheeks flushed almost to a ********* hue from that brief summer dream she was aroused by some sudden noise and starting up she saw the sheep bounding far away while a large gaunt ******* grey dog snuffed at her hands and face once before she had seen him chained near the stables and hagar told her he was very dangerous and was never loosed except at night consequently the expression of his fierce red eyes as he stood over her was well calculated to alarm her but at that instant mr murrays voice thundered keep still dont move or you will be torn to pieces then followed some rapid ************* and vehement words in the same ************** dialect which had so puzzled her once before when her grandfather could not control the horse he was attempting to shoe the dog was sullen and unmanageable keeping his black muzzle close to her face and she grew pale with terror as she noticed that his shaggy breast and snarling jaws were dripping with blood leaping from his horse mr murray strode up and with a quick movement seized the heavy brass collar of the savage creature hurled him back on his haunches and held him thus giving vent the while to a volley of oaths pointing to a large *********** elm branch lying at a little distance he tightened his grasp on the collar and said to the still trembling girl bring me that stick yonder edna complied and there ensued a scene of cursing ********* and howling that absolutely sickened her the dog writhed leaped ****** and ******* but the iron hold was not relaxed and the face of the master rivaled in rage that of the brute which seemed as ferocious as the hounds of **** maria ******** fed with human flesh by ******** ****** distressed by the severity and duration of the punishment and without pausing to reflect or to remember ****** warning edna interposed oh please dont whip him any more it is cruel to beat him so probably he did not hear her and the blows fell thicker than before she drew near and as the merciless arm was raised to strike she seized it with both hands and swung on with her whole weight repeating her words if one of his meek frightened sheep had sprung at his throat to ******** him mr murray would not have been more astounded he shook her off threw her from him but she carried the stick in her grasp dn you how dare you interfere what is it to you if i cut his throat which i mean to do that will be cruel and sinful for he does not know it is wrong and besides he did not bite me she spoke resolutely and for the first time ventured to look straight into his flashing eyes did not bite you did not he worry down and ****** one of my finest ********** it would serve you right for your impertinent meddling if i let him tear you limb from limb he knows no better she answered firmly then by ** i will teach him hand me that stick oh please mr murray you have nearly put out one of his eyes already give me the stick i tell you or i he did not finish the threat but held out his hand with a peremptory gesture edna gave one swift glance around saw that there were no other branches within reach saw too that the dogs face was swelling and bleeding from its bruises and bending the stick across her knee she snapped it into three pieces which she threw as far as her strength would permit there was a brief pause broken only by the piteous howling of the suffering creature and as she began to realize what she had done ednas face reddened and she put her hands over her eyes to shut out the vision of the enraged man who was absolutely dumb with indignant astonishment presently a sneering laugh caused her to look through her fingers and she saw ali the dog now released ******* and whining at his masters feet aha the way of all natures human as well as brute pet and fondle and ****** them they turn under your caressing hand and bite you but ****** and trample them and instantly they are on their knees licking the feet that kicked them ****** you bloodthirsty devil ill settle the account at the kennel ****** is a fool and pennant was right after all the blood of the ****** pricks up your ears he ******* the crouching culprit and as it slunk away in the direction of the house edna found herself alone face to face with the object of her aversion and she almost wished that the earth would open and swallow her mr murray came close to her held her hands down with one of his and placing the other under her chin forced her to look at him how dare you defy and disobey me i did not defy you sir but i could not help you to do what was wrong and cruel i am the judge of my actions and neither ask your help nor intend to permit your interference with what does not concern you god is the judge of mine sir and if i had obeyed you i should have been guilty of all you wished to do with that stick i dont want to interfere sir i try to keep out of your way and i am very sorry i happened to come here this evening i did not dream of meeting you i thought you had gone to town he read all her aversion in her eyes which strove to avoid his and smiling gently he continued you evidently think that i am the very devil himself walking the earth like a roaring lion mind your own affairs hereafter and when i give you a positive order obey it for i am master here and my word is law meddling or disobedience i neither tolerate nor forgive do you understand me i shall not meddle sir that means that you will not obey me unless you think proper she was silent and her beautiful soft eyes filled with tears answer me i have nothing to say that you would like to hear what out with it you would have a right to think me impertinent if i said any more no i swear i will not devour you say what you may she shook her head and the motion brought two tears down on her cheeks oh you are one of the stubborn sweet saints whose lips even *********** redhot steel fingers could not open child do you hate or dread me most answer that question he took his own handkerchief and wiped away the tears i am sorry for you sir she said in a low voice he threw his head back and laughed heartily sorry for me for me me the owner of as many thousands as there are hairs on your head keep your pity for your povertystricken vagrant self why the deuce are you sorry for me she withdrew her hands which he seemed to hold unconsciously and answered because with all your money you never will be happy and what the dl do i care for happiness i am not such a fool as to expect it and yet after all out of the mouths of babes and ********* pshaw i am a fool nevertheless to waste words on you stop what do you think of my park and the animals i notice you often come here the first time i saw it i thought of noah and the ark with two of every living thing but an hour ago it seemed to me more like the garden of eden where the animals all lay down together in peace before sin came into it and ali and i entered like satan and completed the vision thank you considering the fact that you are on my premises and know something of my angelic sanctified temper i must say you indulge in bold flights of imagery i did not say that sir you thought it nevertheless dont be hypocritical is not that what you thought of she made no reply and anxious to terminate an interview painfully embarrassing to her stepped forward to pick up the history which lay on the grass what book is that she handed it to him and the leaves happened to open at a picture representing the murder of ****** a scowl blackened his face as he glanced at it and turned away muttering malice ******** or the devil at a little distance leisurely cropping the long grass stood his favorite horse whose arched forehead and peculiar ********** proclaimed his unmistakable descent from the swift hordes that ***** the ******** ******* and sanctioned the whim which induced his master to call him tamerlane as mr murray approached his horse edna walked away toward the house fearing that he might overtake her but no sound of hoofs reached her ears and looking back as she crossed the avenue and entered the flowergarden she saw horse and rider standing where she left them and wondered why mr murray was so still with one arm on the neck of his tartar pet and his own head bent down on his hand in reflecting upon what had occurred she felt her repugnance increase and began to think that they could not live in the same house without continual conflicts which would force her to abandon the numerous advantages now within her grasp the only ray of hope darted through her mind when she recalled his allusion to a contemplated visit to the south sea islands and the possibility of his long absence insensibly her dislike of the owner extended to everything he handled and much as she had enjoyed the perusal of dante she determined to lose no time in restoring the lost volume which she felt well assured his keen eyes would recognize the first time she inadvertently left it in the library or the greenhouse the doubt of her honesty which he had expressed to his mother rankled in the orphans memory and for some days she had been nerving herself to anticipate a discovery of the book by voluntarily restoring it the ********* in the park by no means diminished her dread of addressing him on this subject but she resolved that the rendition of caesars things to caesar should take place that evening before she slept the narrow vaulted passage leading to mr murrays suit of rooms was dim and gloomy when edna approached the partly opened door of the rotunda whence issued a stream of light timidly she crossed the threshold and stood within on the checkered floor whose polished tiles glistened under the glare of gas from bronze ******** representing ********* that stood at regular intervals around the apartment the walls were painted in ********* style and here and there hung specimens of oriental ************* ******** ******** swords ******* ****** and a crimson silk flag with heavy gold fringe surmounted by a crescent the ******* of the lofty arched ceiling was elaborately arabesque and as edna looked up she saw through the glass roof the flickering of stars in the summer sky in the centre of the room immediately under the dome stretched a ************* and near it was a circular one of black marble inlaid with red **** and ***** ****** which formed a miniature zodiac similar to that at ******** while in the middle of this table sat a small ****** ********* filled with sand from the dreary valley of el **** a huge plaster ******** stood close to the wall on a ********** pedestal of black rock and the ******** and the writhing ***** confronted all who entered just opposite grinned a red granite slab with a quaint ************ taken from the ruins of ***** near the door were two silken ****** and a richly carved urn three feet high which had once ornamented the ****** of a tomb in the royal days of ***** ere the curse fell on **** now stood an in memoriam of the original ********** for what purpose this room was designed or used edna could not imagine and after a hasty survey of its singular furniture she crossed the rotunda and knocked at the door that stood slightly ajar all was silent but the smell of a cigar told her that the owner was within and she knocked once more come in i dont wish to come in i only want to hand you something oh the deuce you dont but i never meet people even halfway so come in you must if you have anything to say to me i have neither blue ****** nor ********** about me and you will be safe inside i give you my word there are no small devils shut up here to fly away with ********** ***** in either enter i say or be off the temptation was powerful to accept the alternative but as he had evidently recognized her voice she pushed open the door and reluctantly entered it was a long room and at the end were two beautiful fluted white marble pillars supporting a handsome arch where hung heavy curtains of crimson persian silk that were now partly looped back showing the furniture of the sleeping apartment beyond the richly carved arch for a moment the bright light dazzled the orphan and she shaded her eyes but the next instant mr murray rose from a sofa near the window and advanced a step or two taking the cigar from his lips come to the window and take a seat he pointed to the sofa but she shook her head and said quickly i have something which belongs to you mr murray which i think you must value very much and therefore i wanted to see it safe in your own hands without raising her eyes she held the book toward him what is it he took it mechanically and with his gaze fixed on the girls face but as she made no reply he glanced down at it and his stern swarthy face lighted up joyfully is it possible my dante my lost dante the copy that has travelled round the world in my pocket and that i lost a year ago somewhere in the mountains of tennessee girl where did you get it i found it where you left **** the grass near a blacksmiths shop a blacksmiths shop where near

he was my ************** only person in the world i had to care for or to love ******** well go on you cursed him because your horse fretted and he could not shoe him in five minutes humph there was an awkward silence st elmo murray bit his lip and scowled and recovering her selfcontrol the orphan added you put your shawl and book on the ground and when you started you forgot them i called you back and gave you your shawl but i did not see the book for some time after you rode out of sight yes yes i remember now about the shawl and the shop strange i did not recognize you before but how did you learn that the book was mine i did not know it was yours until i came here by accident and heard mrs murray call your name then i knew that the initials written in the book ***** your name and besides i remembered your figure and your voice again there was a pause and her mission ended edna turned to go stop why did you not give it to me when you first came she made no reply and putting his hand on her shoulder to detain her he said more gently than she had ever heard him speak to any one was it because you loved my book and disliked to part with it or was it because you feared to come and speak to a man whom you hate be truthful still she was silent and raising her face with his palm as he had done in the park he continued in the same low sweet voice which she could scarcely believe belonged to him i am waiting for your answer and i intend to have it her large sad eyes were brimming with precious memories as she lifted them steadily to meet his and answered my grandfather was noble and good and he was all i had in this world and you can not forgive a man who happened to be rude to him if you please mr murray i would rather go now i have given you your book and that is all i came for which means that you are afraid of me and want to get out of my sight she did not deny it but her face flushed painfully edna earl you are at least honest and truthful and those are rare traits at the present day i thank you for preserving and returning my dante did you read any of it yes sir all of it goodnight sir wait a moment when did aaron hunt die two months after you saw him you have no relatives no cousins uncles aunts none that i ever heard of i must go sir goodnight child for the present when you go out in the grounds be sure that wolf ali is chained up or you may be sorry that i did not cut his throat as i am still inclined to do she closed the door ran lightly across the rotunda and regaining her own room felt inexpressibly relieved that the ordeal was

august she carried her to see him telling her as they drove along that he was the minister of the largest church in the county was an old friend of her family and that she considered herself exceedingly fortunate in having prevailed upon him to consent to undertake her education the parsonage stood on the skirts of the village in a square immediately opposite the church and was separated from it by a wide handsome street lined on either side with elm trees the oldfashioned house was of brick with a wooden portico ******* out over the front door and around the slender pillars twined honeysuckle and clematis tendrils purple with clustering bells while the brick walls were draped with luxuriant ivy that hung in festoons from the eaves and clambered up the chimneys and in at the windows the ********** walk leading to the gate was bordered with white and purple *********** as the ********* dubbed themand over the little gate sprang an arch of *********** loaded with ******* and english honeysuckle whose fragrant wreaths drooped till they touched the heads of all who entered when mrs murray and edna ascended the steps and knocked at the open door bearing the name allan hammond no living thing was visible save a ****** that looked out shyly from the clematis vines and after waiting a moment mrs murray entered unannounced they looked into the parlor with its cool matting and white curtains and polished oldfashioned mahogany furniture but the room was unoccupied then passing on to the library or study where tiers of books rose to the ceiling they saw through the open window the form of the pastor who was stooping to gather the violets blooming in the little shaded garden at the rear of the house a large white cat ****** herself on the strawberry bed and a mockingbird sang in the ********** that overshadowed the studywindow mrs murray called to the minister and taking off his straw hat he bowed and came to meet them mr hammond i hope i do not interrupt you no ellen you never interrupt me i was merely gathering some violets to strew in a childs coffin susan archer poor thing lost her little winnie last night and i knew she would like some flowers to sprinkle over her baby he shook hands with mrs murray and turning to her companion offered his hand saying kindly this is my pupil edna i presume i expected you several days ago and am very glad to see you at last come into the house and let us become acquainted at once as he led the way to the library talking the while to mrs murray ednas eyes followed him with an expression of intense veneration for he appeared to her a living original of the pictured *********** samuel ****** and ******* whose faces she had studied in the large illustrated bible that lay on a satin cushion in the sittingroom at le bocage sixtyfive years of wrestling and ********* on the ********* of life had set upon his noble and benignant countenance the seal of holiness and shed over his placid features the mild sweet light of a pure serene heart of a lofty trusting sanctified soul his white hair and beard had the silvery sheen which seems peculiar to prematurely gray heads and the snowy mass wonderfully softened the outline of the face while the pleasant smile on his lips the warm cheering light in his bright blue eyes won the perfect trust the profound respect the lasting love and veneration of those who entered the charmed circle of his influence learned without pedantry dignified but not pompous genial and ****** never forgetting the sanctity of his mission though never thrusting its credentials into notice judging the actions of all with a leniency which he denied to his own zealous without ******* charitable yet rigidly just as free from ********* as levity his heart throbbed with warm tender sympathy for his race and while none felt his or her happiness complete until his cordial congratulations sealed it every sad mourner realized that her burden of woe was lightened when poured into his sympathizing ears the sage ********* of the aged among his flock he was the loved companion of younger members in whose juvenile sports and sorrows he was never too busy to interest himself and it was not surprising that over all classes and denominations he wielded an influence incalculable for good the limits of one church could not contain his great heart which went forth in yearning love and fellowship to his christian brethren and ********** throughout the world while the refrain of his daily work was bear ye one anothers burdens so in the evening of a life blessed with the bounteous fruitage of good deeds he walked to and fro in the wide vineyard of god with the light of peace of faith and hope and hallowed resignation shining over his worn and aged face drawing edna to a seat beside him on the sofa mr hammond said mrs murray has intrusted your education entirely to me but before i decide positively what books you will require i should like to know what particular branches of study you love best do you feel disposed to take up latin yes ****** well go on my dear do not hesitate to speak freely if you please sir i should like to study greek also oh nonsense edna women never have any use for greek it would only be a waste of your time interrupted mrs murray mr hammond smiled and shook his head why do you wish to study greek you will scarcely be called upon to teach it i should not think that i was well or thoroughly educated if i did not understand greek and latin and beside i want to read what ***** and ******** and *********** wrote in their own language why what do you know about those men only what plutarch says what kind of books do you read with most pleasure history and travels are you fond of arithmetic no sir but as a teacher you will have much more use for mathematics than for greek i should think that with all my life before me i might study both and even if i should have no use for it it would do me no harm to understand it knowledge is never in the way is it certainly not half so often as ignorance very well you shall learn greek as fast as you please i should like to hear you read something here is goldsmiths deserted village suppose you try a few lines begin here at sweet was the sound she read aloud the passage designated and as he expressed himself satisfied and took the book from her hand mrs murray said i think the child is as inveterate a ******** as i ever knew but for heavens sake mr hammond do not make her a bluestocking ellen did you ever see a genuine bluestocking i am happy to be able to say that i never was so unfortunate you consider yourself lucky then in not having known de ***** hannah more charlotte ****** and mrs browning to be consistent of course i must answer yes but you know we women are never supposed to understand that term much less possess the jewel itself and beside sir you take undue advantage of me for the women you mention were truly great ******** i was not ********* to genius in women without those *********** and adjuncts which you ********* so earnestly would their native genius ever have distinguished them or charmed and benefited the world brilliant success makes ************* ********** and the world ******** and crowns them but unsuccessful ********* are strangled with an offensive sobriquet than which it were better that they had ********** tied about their necks after all ellen it is rather ludicrous and seems very unfair that the whole class of literary ladies should be sneered at on account of the color of ************** stockings eighty years ago if you please sir i should like to know the meaning of bluestocking said edna you are in a fair way to understand it if you study greek answered mrs murray laughing at the puzzled expression of the childs countenance mr hammond smiled and replied a bluestocking my dear is generally supposed to be a lady neither young pleasant nor pretty and in most instances unmarried who is unamiable ungraceful and untidy ignorant of all domestic accomplishments and truly feminine acquirements and ambitious of appearing very learned a woman whose fingers are more frequently adorned with ******** than thimble who holds housekeeping in detestation and talks loudly about politics science and philosophy who is ugly and learned and cross whose hair is never smooth and whose ruffles are never fluted is that a correct likeness ellen as good as one of ****** photographs take warning edna the title of bluestocking continued the pastor originated in a jest many many years ago when a circle of very brilliant witty and elegant ladies in london met at the house of mrs ***** to listen to and take part in the conversation of some of the most gifted and learned men england has ever produced one of those gentlemen ************* who always wore blue stockings was so exceedingly agreeable and *********** that when he chanced to be absent the company declared the party was a failure without the blue stockings as he was familiarly called a frenchman who heard of the circumstance gave to these conversational gatherings the name of *** **** which means blue stocking and hence you see that in popular acceptation i mean in public opinion the humorous title which was given in compliment to a very charming gentleman is now supposed to belong to very tiresome ******** and disagreeable ladies do you understand the matter now i do not quite understand why ladies have not as good a right to be learned and wise as gentlemen to satisfy you on that point would involve more historical discussion than we have time for this morning some day we will look into the past and find a solution of the question meanwhile you may study as hard as you please and remember my dear that where one woman is considered a bluestocking and ********** learned twenty are more tiresome still because they know nothing i will obtain all the books you need and hereafter you must come to me every morning at nine oclock when the weather is good you can easily walk over from mrs murrays as they drove homeward edna asked has mr hammond a family no he lost his family years ago but why do you ask that question i saw no lady and i wondered who kept the house in such nice order he has a very faithful servant who attends to his household affairs in your intercourse with mr hammond be careful not to allude to his domestic afflictions mrs murray looked earnestly searchingly at the girl as if striving to fathom her thoughts then throwing her head back with the haughty air which edna had remarked in st elmo she compressed her lips lowered her veil and remained silent and abstracted until they reached home the comprehensive and very thorough curriculum of studies now eagerly commenced by edna and along which she was gently and skilfully guided by the kind hand of the teacher furnished the mental ******* for which she ******** gave constant and judicious exercise to her active intellect and induced her to visit the quiet parsonage library as assiduously as did horace ******* and virgil the gardens on the ********* where ******** held his literary ****** instead of ******** a few textbooks that **** the brain with ******** scientific technicalities and pompous philosophic *********** her range of thought and study gradually stretched out into a broader grander ***** embracing as she grew older the application of those great principles that ******** modern science and crop out in *********** phenomena and ********* *************** ednas tutor seemed impressed with the fallacy of the popular system of acquiring one branch of learning at a time locking it away as in drawers of rubbish never to be opened where it ******** in ********* confusion till swept out ultimately to make room for more recent scientific ******** thus in lieu of the educational plan of finishing natural philosophy and chemistry this session and ******* and astronomy next term and taking up moral science and criticism the year we graduate mr hammond allowed his pupil to finish and lay aside none of her studies but sought to impress upon her the great value of *********** ******** for sciences are of a sociable disposition and flourish best in the neighborhood of each other nor is there any branch of learning but may be helped and improved by assistance drawn from other arts finding that her imagination was remarkably fertile he required her as she advanced in years to compose essays letters ********* and sometimes ******** all of which were not only written and handed in for correction but he frequently directed her to recite them from memory and invited her to assist him while he ********* and criticised either her diction line of argument choice of metaphors or intonation of voice in these compositions he encouraged her to seek illustrations from every department of letters and convert her theme into a ***** upon which to pour all the concentrated light which research could reflect assuring her that what is often denominated ************** in metaphors furnished not only evidence of the laborious industry of the writer but is an implied compliment to the cultured taste and general knowledge of those for whose entertainment or edification they are **************** always said metaphors and ******* really illustrate elucidate

principal dramas over which **** holds august critical tribunal but so carefully selected her miscellaneous reading that poetry novels biography and essays reflected light upon the actors of the particular epoch which she was studying and thus through the subtle but imperishable links of association of ideas chained them in her mind the extensive library at le bocage and the valuable collection of books at the parsonage challenged research and with a boundless ambition equalled only by her patient persevering application edna devoted herself to the acquisition of knowledge and astonished and delighted her teacher by the rapidity of her progress and the vigor and originality of her restless intellect the noble *********** of spirit that distinguished mr hammonds character encouraged her to discuss freely the ethical and psychological problems that arrested her attention as she grew older and facilitated her appreciation and acceptance of the great fact that all *******

****** ******* that would not have disgraced ******** or made ******** blush when pompey and ****** sought to surprise him in the apollo there were *************** and ********** and merry gatherings at the ****** alley and laughter and music and dancing usurped the dominions where silence and gloom had so long reigned naturally shy and unaccustomed to companionship edna felt no desire to participate in these festivities but became more and more absorbed in her studies and her knowledge of the company was limited to the brief intercourse of the table where she observed the deference yielded to the opinions of the master of the house and the dread that all manifested lest they should fall under the lash of his merciless sarcasm an ******* in society his uplifted hand smote all conventionalities and shams spared neither age nor sex nor *********** and acknowledged sanctity nowhere the *********** courtesy of his manner polished and pointed his satire and when a personal application of his remarks was possible he would bow gracefully to the lady indicated and fill her glass with wine while he filled her heart with chagrin and ******** hate since the restoration of the dante not a word had passed between him and edna who regarded him with increasing detestation but on one occasion when the conversation was general and he sat silent at the foot of the table she looked up at him and found his eyes fixed on her face inclining his head slightly to arrest her attention he handed a decanter of sherry to one of the servants with some brief direction and a moment after her glass was filled and the waiter said mr murrays compliments to aaron hunts granddaughter observation had taught her what was customary on such occasions and she knew that he had once noticed her taking wine with the gentleman who sat next to her but now repugnance conquered politeness the mention of her grandfathers name seemed an insult from his lips and putting her hand over her glass she looked him full in the face and shook her head nevertheless he lifted his wine bowed and drank the last drop in the crystal goblet then turned to a gentleman on his right hand and instantly entered into a learned discussion on the superiority of the wines of the ****** over those of germany quoting triumphantly the lines of m de ****** *** la ******** de **** **** **** des ******* ******** when the ladies withdrew to the parlor he rose as was his custom and held the door open for them edna was the last of the party and as she passed him he smiled mockingly and said it was unfortunate that my mother omitted to ********* etiquette in the catalogue of studies prosecuted at the parsonage instantly the answer sprang to her lips she knew i had a teacher for that branch nearer home but her conscience smote her she ********* the words and said gravely my reason was that i think only good friends should take wine together this is your declaration of war very well only remember i raise a black flag and show no quarter woe to the conquered she hurried away to the library and thenceforth kept out of his way more assiduously than ever while the fact that he scrutinized her closely rendered her constrained and uncomfortable when forced to enter his presence mrs murray well understood her hostile feeling toward her son but she never alluded to it and his name was not mentioned by either one by one the guests departed autumn passed winter was ushered in by wailing winds and drizzling rains and one morning as edna came out of the hothouse with a basketful of ********* she saw st elmo bidding his mother goodbye as he started on his long journey to ******** they stood on the steps mrs murrays head rested on his shoulder and bitter tears were falling on her cheeks as she talked eagerly and rapidly to him edna heard him say impatiently you ask what is impossible it is worse than useless to urge me better pray that i may find a peaceful grave in the cinnamon groves and under the ***** palms of the far south he kissed his mothers cheek and sprang into the saddle but checked his horse at sight of the orphan who stood a few yards distant are you coming to say goodbye or do you reserve such courtesies for your good friends regret for her former rudeness and sympathy for mrs murrays uncontrollable distress softened her heart toward him she selected the finest white ******** in the basket walked close to the horse and ********* the flower said goodbye sir i hope you will enjoy your travels and prolong them indefinitely ah you offer a flag of truce i warned you i should not respect it you know my motto **** me ****** ******** thank you for this lovely ************* since you are willing to negotiate run and open the gate for me i may never pass through it again except as a ghost she placed her basket on the steps and ran down the avenue while he paused to say something to his mother edna knew that he expected to be absent possibly several years and while she regretted the pain which his departure gave her benefactress she could not avoid rejoicing at the relief she promised herself during his sojourn in foreign lands slowly he rode along the venerable aisle of elms that had overarched his childish head in the sunny morning of a quickly clouded life and as he reached the gate which edna held open he dismounted edna if you are as truthful in all matters as you have proved in your dislikes i may safely intrust this key to **** keeping it belongs to that marble temple in my sittingroom and opens a vault that contains my will and a box of papers ******* other things that i value there is no possibility of entering it except with this key and no one but myself knows the contents i wish to leave the key with you on two conditions first that you never mention it to any ****** even my mother or allow her to suspect that you have it secondly that you promise me solemnly you will not open the tomb or temple unless i fail to return at the close of four years this is the tenth of ************ years from today if i am not here and if you have good reason to consider me dead take this key which i wish you to wear about your person to my mother inform her of this conversation and then open the vault can you resist the temptation to look into it think well before you answer he had disengaged the golden key from his watchchain and held it in his hand i should not like to take charge of it mr murray you can certainly trust your own mother sooner than an utter stranger like myself he frowned and muttered an oath then exclaimed i tell you i do not choose to leave it in any hands but yours will you promise or will you not the dreary wretchedness the savage hopelessness of his countenance awed and pained the girl and after a moments silence and a short struggle with her heart she extended her hand saying with evident reluctance give me the key i will not betray your trust do you promise me solemnly that you will never open that vault except in accordance with my directions weigh the promise well before you give it yes sir i promise most solemnly he laid the key in her palm and continued my mother loves ****** to make her happy while i am away and if you succeed you will be the first person to whom i have ever been indebted i have left directions concerning my books and the various articles in my rooms feel no hesitation in examining any that may interest you and see that the dust does not ruin them goodbye child take care of my mother he held out his hand she gave him hers for an instant only and he mounted lifted his cap and rode away closing the ponderous gate edna leaned her face against the iron bars and watched the ********* form gradually trees intervened then at a bend in the road she saw him wheel his horse as if to return for some moments he remained stationary looking back but suddenly disappeared and with a sigh of indescribable relief she retraced her steps to the house as she approached the spot where mrs murray still sat with her face hidden in her handkerchief the touch of the little key tightly folded in her palm brought a painful consciousness of concealment and a tinge of shame to her cheeks for it seemed in her eyes an insult to her benefactress that the guardianship of the papers should have been withheld from her she would have stolen away to her own room to secrete the key but mrs murray called her and as she sat down beside her the miserable mother threw her arms around the orphan and resting her cheek on her head wept bitterly timidly but very gently and tenderly the latter strove to comfort her caressing the white hands that were clasped in almost despairing anguish dear mrs murray do not grieve so deeply he may come back much earlier than you expect he will get tired of travelling and come back to his own beautiful home and to you who love him so devotedly no no he will stay away as long as possible it is not beautiful to him he hates his home and forgets me my loneliness my anxiety are nothing in comparison to his morbid love of change i shall never see him again but he loves you very much and that will bring him to you why do you think so he pointed to you a few moments ago and his face was full of wretchedness when he told me make my mother happy while i am gone and you will be the first person to whom i have ever been indebted do not weep so dear mrs murray god can preserve him as well on sea as here at home oh but he will not pray for himself sobbed the mother then you must pray all the more for him and go where he will he cannot get beyond gods sight or out of his merciful hands you know christ said whatsoever you ask in my name i will do it and if the ************** daughter was saved not by her own prayers but by her mothers faith why should not god save your son if you pray and believe mrs murray clasped edna closer to her heart and kissed her warmly you are my only comfort if i had your faith i should not be so unhappy my dear child promise me one thing that every time you pray you will remember my son and ask god to preserve him in his wanderings and bring him safely back to his mother i know you do not like him but for my sake will you not do this my prayers are not worth much but i will always remember to pray for him and mrs murray while he is away suppose you have family prayer and let all the household join in praying for the absent master i think it would be such a blessing and comfort to you grandpa always had prayer night and morning and it made every day seem almost as holy as sunday mrs murray was silent a little while and answered hesitatingly but my dear i should not know how to offer up prayers before the family i can pray for myself but i should not like to pray aloud there was a second pause and finally she said edna would you be willing to conduct prayers for me it is your house and god expects the head of every family to set an example even the ****** offered sacrifices every day for the good of the household and you know the jews had morning and evening sacrifices so it seems to me family prayer is such a beautiful offering on the altar of the hearthstone if you do not wish to pray yourself you could read a prayer there is a book called family prayer with selections for every day in the week i saw a copy at the parsonage and i can get one like it at the book store if you desire it that will suit my purpose much better than trying to compose them myself you must get the book for me but edna dont go to school today stay at home with me i am so lonely and lowspirited i will tell mr hammond that i could not spare you beside i want you to help me arrange some valuable relics belonging to my son and now that i think of it he told me he wished you to use any of his books or mss that you might like to examine this is a great honor child for he has refused many grown people admission to his rooms come with me i want to lock up his curiosities they went through the rotunda and into the rooms together and mrs murray busied herself in carefully removing the ****** ********* antique vases goblets etc etc from the tables and placing them in the drawers of the cabinets as she crossed the room tears fell on the costly trifles and finally she approached the beautiful miniature temple and stooped to look at the fastening she selected the smallest key on the bunch that contained a dozen and attempted to fit it in the small opening but it was too large then she tried her ******** but without success and a look of chagrin crossed her sad tearstained face st elmo has forgotten to leave the key with me ednas face grew scarlet and stooping to pick up a heavy ********* seal that had fallen on the carpet she said hastily what is that marble temple intended to hold i have no idea it is one of my sons oriental fancies i presume he uses it as a private desk for his papers does he leave the key with you when he goes from home this is the first time he has left home for more than a few weeks since he brought this gem from the east i must write to him about the key before he sails he has it on his watchchain the same curiosity which in ages long past prompted the discovery of the ********** or ****** mysteries now suddenly took possession of edna as she looked wonderingly at the shining ****** of the

circumstances which not only rendered it her duty to pray for the wanderer but necessitated her keeping always about her a souvenir of the man whom she could not avoid ********* and was yet forced to remember continually on the following day when she went to her usual morning recitation and gave the reason for her absence she noticed that mr hammonds hand trembled and a look of keen sorrow settled on his face gone again and so soon so far far away from all good influences he put down the latin grammar and walked to the window where he stood for some time and when he returned to his armchair edna saw that the muscles of his face were unsteady did he not stop to tell you goodbye no my dear he never comes to the parsonage now when he was a boy i taught him here in this room as i now teach you but for fifteen years he has not crossed my threshold and yet i never sleep until i have prayed for him oh i am so glad to hear that now i know he will be saved the minister shook his gray head and edna saw tears in his mild blue eyes as he answered a mans repentance and faith can not be offered by ***** to god so long as st elmo murray ******** in insulting his maker i shudder for his final end he has the finest intellect i have ever met among living men but it is ***************** still it is dedicated to the work of scoffing at and *********** the truths of religion in his youth he promised to prove a blessing to his race and an ornament to christianity now he is a curse to the world and a dreary burden to himself what changed him so sadly some melancholy circumstances that occurred early in his life edna he planned and built that beautiful church where you come on sabbath to hear me preach and about the time it was finished he went off to college when he returned he avoided me and has never yet been inside of the costly church which his taste and his money constructed still while i live i shall not cease to pray for him hoping that in gods good time he will bring him back to the pure faith of his boyhood mr hammond is he not a very wicked man he had originally the noblest heart i ever knew and was as tender in his sympathies as a woman while he was almost reckless in his munificent charities but in his present irreligious state i hear that he has grown bitter and sour and ********* yet however repulsive his manner may be i can not believe that his nature is utterly perverted he is dissipated but not unprincipled let him rest my child in the hands of his god who alone can judge him we can but pray and hope go on with your lesson the recitation was resumed and ended but edna was well aware that for the first time her teacher was *********** and the heavy sighs that passed his lips almost unconsciously told her how sorely he was distressed by the erratic course of his quondam pupil when she rose to go home she asked the name of the author of the family prayers which she wished to purchase for mrs murray and the pastors face flushed with pleasure as he heard of her cherished scheme my dear child be circumspect be prudent above all things be consistent search your own heart try to make your life an exposition of your faith let profession and practice go hand in hand ask gods special guidance in the difficult position in which you are placed and your influence for good in mrs murrays family may be beyond all computation laying his hands on her head he continued tremulously o my god if it be thy will make her the instrument of ******** ere it be indeed too late help me to teach her aright and let her pure life atone

the expansion of her mind and the development of her beauty with emotions of pride and pleasure which had she analyzed them would have told her how dear and necessary to her happiness the orphan had become as ednas reasoning powers strengthened mr hammond led her gradually to the contemplation of some of the gravest problems that have from time immemorial perplexed and maddened humanity plunging

during the first year of mr murrays absence his brief letters to his mother were written at long intervals in the second they were ***** and ******* still but toward the close of the third he wrote

beautiful scenery written now among the ******* of ***** *** or ***** *** and now from the pinnacle of mount ***** whence through waving forests of nutmeg and ***** flashed the blue waters of the

spoke in telling the glories of ********** and ********* skies and the matchless verdure and floral ********* of their serene spicy dells for many days after the receipt of each mrs murray was graver and sadder but the spectre that had disquieted edna was thoroughly exorcised and only when the cold touch of the golden key startled her was she conscious of a vague dread of some faroff but slowly and surely approaching evil in the fourth year of her ******** she was possessed by an unconquerable desire to read the ****** and in order to penetrate the mysteries and seize the treasures hidden in that *********** mine of oriental myths legends and ********** she prevailed upon mr hammond to teach her hebrew and the rudiments of chaldee very reluctantly and ************** he consented and subsequently informed her that as he had another pupil who was also commencing hebrew he would class them and hear their recitations together this new student was mr gordon leigh a lawyer in the town and a gentleman of wealth and high social position although quite young he gave promise of eminence in his profession and was a great favorite of the minister who pronounced him the most upright and exemplary young man of his acquaintance edna had seen him several times at mrs murrays dinners but while she thought him exceedingly handsome polite and agreeable she regarded him as a stranger until the lessons at the parsonage brought them every two days around the little table in the study they began the language simultaneously but edna knowing the flattering estimation in which he was held could not resist the temptation to measure her intellect with his and soon threatened to ****** him in the ****** race piqued pride and a manly resolution to conquer spurred him on and the venerable instructor looked on and laughed at the generous emulation thus excited he saw an earnest friendship daily strengthening between the rivals and knew that in gordon leighs magnanimous nature there was no element which could cause an objection to the companionship to which he had paved the way four months after the commencement of the new study edna ***** at daylight to complete some exercises which she had neglected to write out on the previous evening and as soon as she concluded the task went down stairs to gather the flowers it was the cloudless morning of her seventeenth birthday and as she stood clipping geraniums and jasmine and verbena memory flew back to the tender years in which the ****** blacksmith had watched her career with such fond pride and loving words of encouragement and painted the whitehaired old man smoking on the porch that fronted lookout while from his lips tremulous with a tender smile seemed to float the last words he had spoken to her on that calm afternoon when in the fiery light of a dying day he was gathered to his forefathers you will make me proud of you my little pearl when you are smart enough to teach a school and take care of me for i shall be too old to work by that time now after the lapse of years when her educational course was almost finished she recalled every word and look and gesture even the thrill of horror that shook her limbs when she kissed the lips that death had sealed an hour before mournfully vivid was her recollection of her tenth birthday for then he had bought her a blue ribbon for her hair and a little china cup and saucer and now tears sprang to her eyes as she murmured i have studied hard and the triumph is at hand but i have nobody to be proud of me now ah grandpa if you could only come back to me your little pearl it is so desolate to be alone in this great world so hard to have to know that nobody cares specially whether i live or die whether i succeed or fail ignominiously i have only myself to live for only my own heart and will to sustain and stimulate me through the fringy ******* that waved their long hair across the hothouse windows the golden sunshine flickered over the graceful

edna had endeavored to realize and remember what her bible first taught her and what ********* of all creeds climes and ages had ************** human life was at best but vanity and vexation of spirit that man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward yet as she stood on the line narrow and thin as ******* that divides girlhood and womanhood all seemed to her fresh pure heart as inviting and bewitching as the magnificent panorama upon which ********** ********* gazed from the ancient ********* of ****** as edna turned to leave the hothouse the ring of horses hoofs on the rocky walk attracted her attention and a moment after mr leigh gave his horse to the gardener and came to meet her good morning miss edna as i am bearer of dispatches from my sister to mrs murray i have invited myself to breakfast with you you are an earlier riser than i had supposed mr leigh from your ************ over your exercises i do not deny that i love my morning nap and generally indulge myself for like sydney smith i can easily make up my mind to rise early but i cannot make up my body in one respect i certainly claim equality with *********** my talent for sleeping is inferior neither to his nor goethes do you know that we are both to have a holiday today no sir upon what score it happens to be my birthday as well as yours and as my sister mrs inge gives a party tonight in honor of the event i have come to insist that my classmate shall enjoy the same ******** that i promise myself mrs inge commissioned me to insure your presence at her party thank you but i never go out to parties but bad precedents must not guide you any longer if you persist in staying at home i shall not enjoy the evening for in every dance i shall fancy my ******* your spectre with an exercise in one hand and a hebrew grammar in the other a ****** mr hammond told me to say that he would not expect you today but would meet you tonight at mrs inges you need not trouble yourself to decline for i shall arrange matters with mrs murray in honor of my birthday will you not give me a sprig of something sweet from your basket they sat down on the steps of the diningroom and edna selected some delicate oxalis cups and nutmeg geranium leaves which she tied up and handed to her companion fastening them in the buttonhole of his coat he drew a small box from his pocket and said i noticed last week when mr hammond was explaining the ********** tenets you manifested some curiosity concerning their ******* and ******** stones many years ago while an uncle of mine was missionary in arabia he saved the life of a son of a wealthy ***** and received from him in token of his gratitude a curious ring which tradition said once belonged to a ****** and had been found near the ruins of ********* the ring was bequeathed to me and is probably the best authenticated antique in this country presto we are in ****** in the blessed reign in the golden prime of good ****** ********* i am ****** in neither ***** nor ****** lore but the characters engraved on this ring are said to belong to the former dialect and to mean peace be with thee which is and i believe has been from time immemorial the national salutation of the arabs he unwound the cotton that enveloped the gem and held it before ednas eyes a broad band of dusky tarnished gold was surmounted by a large ************** emerald set with beautiful pearls and underneath the arabic inscription was engraved a rams head bearing on one horn a small crescent on the other a star as edna bent forward to examine it mr leigh continued i do not quite comprehend the symbolism of the rams head and the star the crescent is clear enough i think i can guess the meaning ednas eyes kindled tell me your conjecture my own does not satisfy me as the arabic love of mutton is the only solution at which i have arrived oh mr leigh look at it and think a moment well i have looked at it and thought a great deal and i tell you *********** ******* is the only idea suggested to my mind you need not look so shocked for when cooled with the snows of ******** i am told it makes a ******** fit for greek gods think of the second chapter of st **** he pondered a moment and answered gravely i am sorry to say that i do not remember that particular chapter well enough to appreciate your clew she hesitated and the color deepened on her cheek as she repeated in a low voice and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men mr leigh the star on the rams horn may be the star of ********* that shone over the manger and the arabic inscription is certainly the salutation of the angel to the shepherds peace good will toward men says st **** peace be with thee said ******** your solution seems plausible but pardon me is totally ************ from the fact that it ****** crescent and cross and ******* *********** that ******* centuries with blood you forget mr leigh that ************* is nothing but a huge *********** and that its founder stole its elements from surrounding systems the symbolism of the crescent he took from the mysteries of **** and ******* the ethical code of christ he ********* on the ********** of ******* his typical forms are drawn from the old testament or the more modern ****** and his pretended miracles are mere *********** of the wonders performed by our ********** instance the basket of dates the ******* lamb the loaf of barley bread in the siege of ****** even the ****** ******** is a palpable imitation of the hebrew ******* beside sir you know that ********* reigned in arabia just before the advent of ******** and if you refuse to believe that the star of ********* was signified by this one shining here on the rams horn at least you must admit that it refers to stars studied by the shepherds who watched their flocks on the ******** plains in a cabinet of ***** and medals belonging to mr murray i have examined one of silver representing ******** with the head of a woman adorned with horns and a crescent and another of brass containing an image of ***** human face on the head of an ox with the horns surrounded by stars however i am very ignorant of these things and you must refer the riddle of the ring to some one more astute and learned in such matters than your humble ********** in hebrew peace be with you i repeat peace be with thee during the new year on which we are both entering and as you have at least attempted to read the riddle let me beg that you will do me the honor to accept and wear the ring in memory of our friendship and our student life he took her hand and would have placed the ring on her finger but she resisted thank you mr leigh i appreciate the honor but indeed you must excuse me i cannot accept the ring why not miss edna in the first place because it is very valuable and beautiful and i am not willing to deprive you of it in the second i do not think it proper to accept presents ******* one but relatives or dear friends i thought we were dear friends why can we not be such at this moment mrs murray came into the diningroom and as she looked at the two sitting there in the early sunshine with the basket of flowers between them as she marked the heightened color and embarrassed expression on one fair sweet face and the eager pleading written on the other so full of manly beauty so frank and bright and genial a possible destiny for both flashed before her and pleased surprise warmed her own countenance as she hurried forward goodmorning gordon i am very glad to see you how is clara quite well thank you and entirely absorbed in preparations for her party as you will infer from this note which she charged me to deliver in person and for which i here pray your most favorable consideration as mrs murray glanced over the note edna turned to leave the room but mr leigh exclaimed do not go just yet i wish mrs murray to decide a matter for me well gordon what is it first do you grant my sisters petition certainly i will bring edna with me tonight unless she prefers staying at home with her books you know i let her do pretty much as she pleases now then for my little quarrel here is a curious old ring which she will appreciate more highly than any one else whom i happen to know and i want her to accept it as a birthday memento from me but a few minutes ago she refused to wear it can you not come to my assistance my dear mrs murray she took the ring examined it and said after a pause i think gordon that she did exactly right but i also think that now with my approval and advice she need not hesitate to wear it henceforth as a token of your friendship edna hold out your hand my dear the ring was slipped on the slender finger and as she released her hand mrs murray bent down and kissed her forehead seventeen today my child i can scarcely believe it and ********* may i ask how old you are *********** grieve to say you need not tell me the conversation was interrupted by the ringing of the breakfast bell and soon after mr leigh took his departure edna felt puzzled and annoyed and as she looked down at the ring she thought that instead of peace be with thee the ******* characters must surely mean disquiet seize thee for they had shivered the beautiful calm of her girlish nature and thrust into her mind ideas unknown until that day going to her own room she opened her books but ere she could fix her wandering thoughts mrs murray entered edna i came to speak to you about your dress for tonight please do not say that you wish me to go my dear mrs murray for i dread the very thought but i must tell you that i insist upon your ********** to the usages of good society mrs inge belongs to one of the very first families in the state at her house you will meet the best people and you could not possibly make your debut under more favorable circumstances beside it is very unnatural that a young girl should not enjoy parties and the society of gay young people you are very unnecessarily making a recluse of yourself and i shall not permit you to refuse such an invitation as mrs inge has sent it would be rude in the extreme dear mrs murray you speak of my debut as if like other girls i had nothing else to do but fit myself for society these people care nothing for me and i am as little interested in them i have no desire to move for a short time in a circle from which my work in life must soon separate me to what work do you allude the support which i must make by teaching in a few months i hope to be able to earn all i need and then then it will be quite time enough to determine what necessity demands in the meanwhile as long as you are in my house you must allow me to judge what is proper for you clara inge is my friend and i can not allow you to be rude to her i have sent the carriage to town for miss ****** my *********** and hagar will make the skirt of your dress come into my room and let her take the measure thank you for your kind thoughtfulness but indeed i do not want to go please let me stay at home you can frame some polite excuse and mrs inge cares not whether i go or stay i will write my regrets and dont be childish edna i care whether you go or stay and that fact should weigh with you much more than mrs inges wishes for you are quite right in supposing that it is a matter of indifference to her do not keep hagar waiting mrs murrays brow clouded and her lips contracted as was their habit when anything displeased her consequently after a quick glance edna followed her to the room where hagar was at work it was the first time the orphan had been invited to a large party and she shrank from meeting people whose standard of ********* was confined to high birth and handsome fortunes mrs inge came frequently to le bocage but ednas acquaintance with her was comparatively slight and in addition to her repugnance to meeting strangers she dreaded seeing mr leigh again so soon for she felt that an *********** barrier had suddenly risen between them the frank fearless freedom of the old friendship at the parsonage table had vanished she began to wish that she had never studied hebrew that she had never heard of ********* and that the ****** ring was back among the ruins of ********* mrs murray saw her ************ but chose to take no notice of it and superintended her toilet that night with almost as much interest as if she had been her own daughter during the drive she talked on indifferent subjects and as they went up to the dressingroom had the satisfaction of seeing that her protegee manifested no trepidation they arrived rather late the company had assembled and the rooms were quite full as mrs murray entered but mrs inge met them at the threshold and mr leigh who seemed on the watch came forward at the same instant and offered edna his arm ah mrs murray i had almost abandoned the hope of seeing you miss edna the set is just forming and we must celebrate our birthday by having the first dance together excuse you indeed you presume upon my wellknown good nature and generosity but this evening i am privileged to be selfish as he drew her into the middle of the room she noticed that he wore the flowers she had given him in the morning and this in conjunction with the curious scrutiny to which she was subjected brought a sudden ***** of color to her cheeks the dance commenced and from one corner of the room mr hammond looked eagerly at his two pupils contrasting them with the gay groups that filled the brilliant apartment ednas slender graceful figure was robed in white swiss muslin with a ****** of rich lace and rosecolored ribbons formed the sash and floated from her shoulders her beautiful glossy hair was simply coiled in a large roll at the back of the head and fastened with an ivory comb scrutinizing the face lifted toward mr leighs while he talked to her the pastor thought he had never seen a countenance half so eloquent and lovely turning his gaze upon her partner he was compelled to confess that though gordon leigh was the handsomest man in the room no acute observer could look at the two and fail to discover that the blacksmiths granddaughter was far superior to the petted brother of the aristocratic mrs inge he was so much interested in watching the couple that he did not observe mrs murrays approach until she sat down beside him and whispered are they not a handsome couple gordon and edna yes indeed they are i think that childs face is the most attractive the most fascinating i ever looked at there is such a rare combination of intelligence holiness strength and serenity in her countenance such a calm pure light shining in her splendid eyes such a tender loving look far down in their soft depths child why she is seventeen today no matter ellen to me she will always seem a gentle clinging questioning child i look at her often when she is intent on her studies and wonder how long her pure heart will reject the vanities and ******* that ******* most women how long mere abstract study will continue to charm her and i tremble when i think of the future to which i know she is looking so eagerly now her emotional nature sleeps her heart is at ************** also she is all intellect at ************* her brain no relaxation ah if it could always be so but it will not there will come a time i fear when her fine mind and pure warm heart will be arrayed against each other will battle desperately and one or the other must be ************ gordon seems to admire her very much said mrs murray mr hammond sighed and a shadow crept over his placid features as he answered do you wonder at it ellen can any one know the child well and fail to admire and love her if he could only forget her obscure ******* he could only consent to marry ******* a splendid match it would be for her ellen ellen murray i am surprised at you let me beg of you for her sake for yours for all parties concerned not to raise your little finger in this matter not to utter one word to edna that might arouse her suspicions not to hint to gordon that you dream such an alliance possible for there is more at stake than you imagine he was unable to conclude the sentence for the dance had ended and as edna caught a glimpse of the beloved countenance of her teacher she drew her fingers from mr leighs arm and hastened to the pastors side taking his hand between both hers o sir i am glad to see you i have looked around so often hoping to catch sight of you mrs murray i heard mrs inge asking for you when the lady walked away edna glided into the seat next the minister and continued i want to talk to you about a change in some of my studies wait till tomorrow my dear i came here tonight only for a few moments to gratify gordon and now i must slip away but sir i only want to say that as you objected at the outset to my studying hebrew i will not waste any more time on it just now but take it up again after a while when i have plenty of leisure dont you think that would be the best plan my child are you tired of hebrew no sir on the contrary it possesses a singular fascination for me but i think if you are willing i shall discontinue **** least for the present i shall take care to forget nothing that i have already learned you have some special reason for this change i presume she raised her eyes to his and said frankly yes sir i have very well my dear do as you like goodnight i wish i could go now with you why i thought you appeared to enjoy your dance very much edna look at me she ************* obeyed him and he saw tears glistening on her long lashes very quietly the old man drew her arm through his and led her out on the dim veranda where only an occasional couple ********** something troubles you edna will you confide in me i feel as if i were occupying a false position here and yet i do not see how i can extricate myself without *********** mrs murray whom i can not bear to ********* is so very kind and generous explain yourself my dear you know that i have not a cent in the world except what mrs murray gives me i shall have to make my bread by my own work just as soon as you think me competent to teach and notwithstanding she thinks i ought to visit and associate as she does with these people who tolerate me now simply because they know that while i am under her roof she will exact it of them tonight during the dance i heard two of her fashionable friends *********** and sneering at me ********** her for attempting to smuggle that spoiled creature of unknown parentage and doubtless low origin into really first circles other things were said which i can not repeat that showed me plainly how i am regarded here and i will not remain in a position which subjects me to such remarks mrs murray thought it best for me to come but it was a mistaken kindness i thought so before i ******* i have ************ proof that i was right in my forebodings can you not tell me all that was said i shrink sir from repeating it even to you did mr leigh hear it i hope not my dear child i am very much pained to learn that you have been so cruelly wounded but do not let your mind dwell upon it those weak heartless giddy people are to be pitied are beneath your notice try to fix your thoughts on nobler themes and waste no reflection on the idle words of those poor gilded moths of fashion and folly who are incapable of realizing their own degraded and deplorable condition i do not care particularly what they think of me but i am anxious to avoid hearing their comments upon me and therefore i am determined to keep as much out of sight as possible i shall try to do my duty in all things and poverty is no stigma thank god my grandfather was very poor but he was noble and honest and as courteous as a nobleman and i honor his dear dear memory as tenderly as if he had been reared in a palace i am not ashamed of my parentage for my father was as honest and industrious as he was poor and my mother was as gentle and good as she was beautiful there was no faltering in the sweet voice and no bitterness poisoning it mr hammond could not see the face but the tone indexed all and he was satisfied i am glad my dear little edna that you look at the truth so bravely and give no more importance to the gossip than your future peace of mind demands if you have any difficulty in convincing mrs murray of the correctness of your views let me know and i will speak to her on the subject goodnight may god watch over and bless you when the orphan reentered the parlor mrs inge presented her to several gentlemen who had requested an introduction and though her heart was heavy and her cheeks burned painfully she exerted herself and danced and talked constantly until mrs murray announced herself ready to depart joyfully edna ran upstairs for her wrappings bade adieu to her hostess who complimented her on the sensation her beauty had created and felt relieved and comparatively happy when the carriagedoor closed and she found herself alone with her benefactress well edna notwithstanding your repugnance to going you acquitted yourself admirably and seemed to have a delightful time i thank you maam for doing all in your power to make the evening agreeable to me i think your kind desire to see me enjoy the party made me happier than everything else gratefully she drew mrs murrays hand to her lips and the latter little dreamed that at that instant tears were rolling over the flushed face while the words of the conversation which she had overheard rang mockingly in her ears mrs murray and even mr hammond are ******** to make a match between her and gordon leigh studying hebrew indeed a likely story she had better go back to her ******* and spinningwheel much hebrew she will learn her eyes are set on gordons fortune and mrs murray is silly enough to think he will step into the trap she will have to bait it with something better than hebrew and black eyes or she will miss her game gordon will make a fool of her i dare say for like all other young men he can be flattered into paying her some little attention at first i am surprised at mrs inge to countenance the girl at all such was the orphans ********** into the charmed circle of fashionable society such her welcome to le beau monde as she laid her head on her pillow she could not avoid exclaiming heaven save me from such aristocrats and commit me rather to the ***** but outstretched hands the brawny arms the untutored minds the simple but *************** hearts of ********** when mr hammond mentioned ednas determination to discontinue hebrew mr leigh expressed no surprise asked no explanation but the minister noticed that he bit his lip and beat a hurried tattoo with the heel of his boot on the stony hearth and as he studiously avoided all allusion to her he felt assured that the conversation which she had overheard must have reached the ears of her partner also and supplied him with a satisfactory solution of her change of purpose for several weeks edna saw nothing of her quondam schoolmate and fixing her thoughts more firmly than ever on her studies the painful recollection of the birthday fete was lowly fading from her mind when one morning as she was returning from the parsonage mr leigh joined her and asked permission to attend her home the sound of his voice the touch of his hand brought back all the embarrassment and constraint and called up the flush of confusion so often attributed to other sources than that from which it really springs after a few commonplace remarks he asked when is mr murray coming home i have no idea even his mother is ignorant of his plans how long has he been absent four years today indeed so long where is he i believe his last letter was written at **** and he said nothing about returning what do you think of his singular character i know almost nothing about him as i was too young when i saw him to form an estimate of him do you not correspond edna looked up with unfeigned astonishment and could not avoid smiling at the inquiry certainly not a short silence followed and then mr leigh said do you not frequently ride on horseback yes sir will you permit me to accompany you tomorrow afternoon i have promised to make a visit with mr hammond tomorrow morning then before breakfast she ************ blush deepened and after a brief struggle she said hurriedly please excuse me mr leigh i prefer to ride alone he bowed and was silent for a minute but she saw a smile lurking about the corners of his handsome mouth threatening to run riot over his features by the by miss edna i am coming tonight to ask your assistance in a chaldee ******** for several days i have been engaged in a controversy with mr hammond on the old battlefield of ********* and in order to establish my position of diversity of origin have been comparing the ********** with some passages from the ****** i heard you say that there was a ********** targum in the library at le bocage and i must beg you to examine it for me and ascertain whether it contains any comments on the first chapter of genesis somewhere in my most desultory reading i have seen it stated that in some of those early ******* was the declaration that god originally created men red white and black mr hammond is charitable enough to say that i must have smoked an extra cigar and dreamed the ********* i am so anxious to ************ will you oblige me by searching for the passage certainly mr leigh with great pleasure though perhaps you would prefer to take the book and look through it yourself my knowledge of chaldee is very limited pardon me my mental *** ******** ****** the bare suggestion i study by ***** whether an opportunity offers for ******** is the only hereditary taint in the leigh blood as i am very much interested in this ************ question i shall enter into the search with great eagerness thank you do you take the unity or diversity side of the discussion her merry laugh rang out through the forest that bordered the road oh mr leigh what a ridiculous question i do not presume to take any side for i do not pretend to understand or appreciate all the arguments advanced but i am anxious to acquaint myself with the bearings of the controversy the idea of my taking sides on a subject which grayhaired savants have spent their laborious lives in striving to elucidate seems extremely ludicrous still you are entitled to an idea either pro or con even at the outset i have an idea that neither you nor i know anything about the matter and the per ****** plan of taking sides will only add the **** of prejudice to my ignorance if with all his erudition mr hammond still ******** from *********** on this subject i can well afford to hold my crude opinions in abeyance i must stop here mr leigh at mrs carters on an errand for mrs murray good morning sir i will hunt the passage you require how have i offended you miss edna he took her hand and detained her i am not offended mr leigh and she drew back why do you dismiss me in such a cold unfriendly way if i sometimes appear rude pardon my unfortunate manner and believe that it results from no ************** you will be at home this evening yes sir unless something very unusual occurs they parted and during the remainder of the walk edna could think of nothing but the revelation written in gordon leighs eyes the immemorial yet ever new and startling truth that opened a new vista in life that told her she was no longer an isolated child but a woman ******* over the generous heart of one of the pets of society she saw that he intended her to believe he loved her and suspicious as gossips had made her with reference to his conduct she could not suppose he was guilty of heartless and contemptible trifling she trusted his honor yet the discovery of his affection brought a sensation of ******** vague selfreproach and she felt that in future he would prove a source of endless disquiet hitherto she had enjoyed his society henceforth she felt that she must **** it she endeavored to banish the recollection of that strange expression in his generally laughing eyes and bent over the targum hoping to cheat her thoughts into other channels but the face would not down at her bidding and as the day drew near its close she grew nervous and restless the chandelier had been lighted and mrs murray was standing at the window of the sittingroom watching for the return of a servant whom she had sent to the postoffice when edna said i believe mr leigh is coming here to tea he told me so this morning where did you see him he walked with me as far as mrs carters gate and asked me to look out a reference which he thought i might find in one of mr murrays books mrs murray smiled and said do you intend to receive him in that calico dress why not i am sure it is very neat it is perfectly new and fits me well and is very suitable to wear to the parsonage but not quite appropriate when gordon leigh takes tea here you will oblige me by changing your dress and *********** your hair which is twisted too loosely when she reentered the room a halfhour later mrs murray leaned against the mantelpiece with an open letter in her hand and dreary disappointment printed on her face i hope you have no unpleasant tidings from mr murray may i ask why you seem so much depressed the mothers features twitched painfully as she restored the letter to its envelope and answered my sons letter is dated ****** just two months ago and he says he intended starting next day to the interior of persia he says too that he did not expect to remain away so long but finds that he will probably be in central **** for another year the only comforting thing in the letter is the assurance that he weighs more and is in better health than when he left home the ringing of the ******** announced mr leighs arrival and as she led the way to the parlor mrs murray hastily fastened a drooping spray of coral berries in ednas hair before tea was ended other visitors came in and the orphan found relief from her confusion in the general conversation while dr rodney the family physician was talking to her about some discoveries of ********* concerning which she was very curious mr leigh engrossed mrs murrays attention and for some time their conversation was exceedingly earnest then the latter rose and approached the sofa where edna sat saying gravely edna give me this seat i want to have a little chat with the doctor and by the way my dear i believe mr leigh is waiting for you to show him some book you promised to find for him go into the ************ is a good fire there the room was tempting indeed to students and as the two sat down before the glowing grate and mr leigh glanced at the warm rich curtains sweeping from ceiling to carpet the *********** bookcases ******* the walls on all sides and the sentinel bronze busts keeping watch over the musty tombs within he rubbed his fingers and exclaimed certainly this is the most delightful library in the world and offers a premium for recluse life and studious habits how incomprehensible it is that murray should prefer to pass his years ******* over deserts and wandering about neglected comfortless ***** when he might spend them in such an elysium as this the man must be ******** how do you explain the mystery ****** a son gout i consider it none of my business and as i suppose he is the best judge of what *********** to his happiness i do not meddle with the mystery poor murray his wretched disposition is a great curse i pity him most sincerely from what i remember of him i am afraid he would not thank you for your pity or admit that he needed or merited it here is the targum mr leigh and here is the very passage you want she opened an ancient chaldee ms and spreading it on the library table they examined it together spelling out the words and turning frequently to a dictionary which lay near neither knew much about the language now and then they differed in the interpretation and more than once edna referred to the rules of her grammar to establish the construction of the sentences engrossed in the translation she forgot all her apprehensions of the morning and the old ease of manner came back her eyes met his fearlessly her smile greeted him cheerily as in the early months of their acquaintance and while she bent over the pages she was *********** his eyes dwelt on her beaming countenance with a fond tender look that most girls of her age would have found it hard to resist and pleasant to recall in after days neither suspected that an hour had passed until dr rodney peeped into the room and called them back to the parlor to make up a game of ***** it was quite late when mr leigh rose to say goodnight and as he drew on his gloves he looked earnestly at edna and said i am coming again in a day or two to show you some plans for a new house which i intend to build before long clara ******* with me about the arrangement of some columns and arches and i shall claim you and mrs murray for my ****** in this architectural war the orphan was silent but the lady of the house replied promptly yes come as often as you can gordon and cheer us up for it is terribly dull here without st elmo suppose you repudiate that incorrigible vandal and adopt me in his place i would prove a model son very well i shall acquaint him with your proposition and threaten an immediate compliance with it if he does not come home soon mrs murray rang the bell for the servant to lock up the house and said ***** voce what a noble fellow gordon is if i had a daughter i would select him for her husband where are you going edna i left a ms on the library table and as it is very rare and valuable i want to replace it in the glass box where it belongs before i go to sleep lighting a candle she lifted the heavy targum and slowly approached the suite of rooms which she was now in the habit of visiting almost daily earlier in the day she had bolted the door but left the key in the lock expecting to bring the targum back as soon as she had shown mr leigh the ************ passage now as she crossed the rotunda an unexpected sound as of a chair sliding on the marble floor seemed to issue from the inner room and she paused to listen under the ***** of the candle the vindictive face of **** and the hooded viper twined about his arm looked more hideous than ever warning her not to approach yet all was silent save the tinkling of a bell far down in the park where the sheep clustered under the cedars opening the door which was ajar she entered held the light high over her head and peered a little nervously around the room but here too all was quiet as the grave and quite as dreary and the only moving thing seemed her shadow that flitted slightly as the candlelight flickered over the cold gleaming white tiles the carpets and ************ the rich silk hangings of the ******** all packed away and edna shivered as she looked through both rooms satisfied herself that she had mistaken the source of the sound and opened the box where the mss were kept at sight of them her mind reverted to the theme she had been ************* and happening to remember the importance attached by ************ to the early ****** inscriptions she took from the *********** a volume containing copies of many of these characters and drawings of the triumphal processions carved on granite and representing the captives of various nations torn from their homes to swell the pompous ******* of some ******** ******* or ********* drifting back over the gray ******** ******** sea of centuries she stood in imagination upon the steps of the ******** at memphis and when the wild chant of the priests had died away under the huge ********** she listened to the sighing of the ********* and ******* and the low babble of the sacred nile as it rocked the *********** under the glowing purple sky whence a full moon flooded the ancient city with light and kindled like a beacon the vast placid face of the ************ solemn and lonely and weird from its desert ******* staring ******* hopelessly across arid yellow sands at the dim ******* of old ******* following the sinuous stream of ****** civilization to its inexplicable source in the ********** of ***** the girls thoughts were borne away to the golden fountain of the sun where ****** black doves fluttered and cooed over the shining altars and amid the mystic symbols of the marvelous ******* as edna bent over the drawings in the book oblivious for a time of everything else she suddenly became aware of the presence of some one in the room for though perfect stillness reigned there was a consciousness of companionship of the proximity of some human being and with a start she looked up expecting to meet a pair of eyes fastened upon her but no living thing confronted ****** tall bent figure of the ****** prophetess gleamed ghostly white upon the wall and the bright blue ******** eyes seemed to count the dripping ********** and the unbroken solemn silence of night brooded over all things ******* even the chime of ********** that had died away among the elm arches knowing that no superstitious terrors had ever seized her heretofore the young student rose took up the candle and proceeded to search the two rooms but as unsuccessfully as before there certainly is somebody here but i can not find out where these words were uttered aloud and the echo of her own voice seemed sepulchral then the chill silence again fell upon her she smiled at her own folly and thought her imagination had been unduly excited by the pictures she had been examining and that the nervous shiver that crept over her was the result of the cold just then the candlelight flashed over the black marble statuette grinning horribly as it kept guard over the taj mahal edna walked up to it placed the candle on the slab that supported the tomb and stooping scrutinized the lock a spider had ensconced himself in the golden receptacle and spun a fine web across the front of the temple and edna swept the airy drapery away and tried to drive the little ****** from his den but he shrank further and further and finally she took the key from her pocket and put it far enough into the opening to ***** the intruder who ***** himself down one of the silken threads and crawled sullenly out of sight withdrawing the key she toyed with it and glanced curiously at the mausoleum taking her handkerchief she carefully brushed off the cobwebs that festooned the minarets and murmured that fragment of persian poetry which she once heard the absent master repeat to his mother and which she had found only a few days before quoted by an eastern traveller the spider hath woven his web in the imperial palaces and the own hath sung her ********* on the towers of ******** it is exactly four years tonight since mr murray gave me this key but he charged me not to open the taj unless i had reason to believe that he was dead his letter states that he is alive and well consequently the time has not come for me to ****** the mystery it is strange that he trusted me with this secret strange that he who doubts all of his race could trust a child of whom he really knew so little certainly it must have been a singular freak which gave this affair into my keeping but at least i will not betray the confidence he reposed in me with the contents of that vault i can have no concern and yet i wish the key was safely back in his hands it annoys me to conceal it and i feel all the while as if i were deceiving his mother these words were uttered half unconsciously as she fingered the key and for a few seconds she stood there thinking of the master of the house wondering what luckless influence had so early blackened and distorted his life and whether he would probably return to le bocage before she left it to go out and carve her fortune in the worlds noisy ****** the light danced over her countenance and form showing the rich folds of her crimson merino dress with the gossamer lace surrounding her white throat and dimpled wrists and it seemed to linger caressingly on the shining mass of black hair on the beautiful polished forehead the firm delicate scarlet lips and made the large eyes look elfish under their heavy jet lashes again the girl started and glanced over her shoulder impressed with the same tantalizing conviction of a human presence of some powerful influence which baffled analysis snatching the candle she put the gold key in her pocket and turned to leave the room but stopped for this time an unmistakable sound like the shivering of a glass or the snapping of a musical string fell on her strained ears she could trace it to no particular spot and conjectured that perhaps a mouse had taken up his abode somewhere in the room and frightened by her presence had run against some of the numerous glass and china ornaments on the ******* jostling them until they jingled replacing the book which she had taken from the shelves and fastening the box that contained the mss she examined the cabinets found them securely closed and then hurried out of the room locked the door took the key and went to her own apartment with nerves more unsettled than she felt disposed to confess for some time after she laid her head on her pillow she racked her brain for an explanation of the singular sensation she had experienced and at last annoyed by her restlessness and silly superstition she was just sinking into dreams of ***** and ******* when the fierce barking of ali caused her to start up in terror the dog seemed almost wild running frantically to and fro howling and whining but finally the sounds receded gradually quiet was restored and edna fell asleep soon after the scream of the locomotive and the ****** of the cars told her that the four oclock train had just started to chattanooga modern ******** science ******** the popular fallacy that ********** assume and reflect at will the color of the substance on which they rest or feed but with a profound ****** to savants it is respectfully submitted that the mental ************

mr murrays sittingroom and sometimes the clock in the rotunda struck midnight before she locked up the mss and illuminated ****** two nights after the examination of the targum she was seated near the bookcase looking over the plates in that rare but very valuable volume ******* ********* when the idea flashed across her mind that a rigid analysis and comparison of all the mythologies of the world would throw some light on the problem of ********* and in conjunction with philology settle the vexed question pushing the ********* aside she sprang up and paced the long room and gradually her eyes kindled her cheeks burned as ambition pointed to a possible future of which till this hour she had not dared to dream and hope ********** all barriers grasped a victory that would make her name imperishable in her miscellaneous reading she had stumbled upon singular *************** in the customs and religions of nations separated by surging oceans and by ages nations whose **********

that overshadowed moses and also a likeness of a dove distributing tongues to those born after the deluge now the thought of carefully gathering up these vague mythologic links and establishing a chain of unity that would girdle the world seized and mastered her as if ********* clothed with all the power of a bath *** to firmly grasp the bible for a talisman as ulysses did the sprig of **** and to stand in the pantheon of the universe examining every shattered idol and crumbling denied altar where worshipping humanity had bowed to tear the veil from ******* and ****** and show the world that the true good and beautiful of all ********** and *********** of every system of religion that had waxed and waned since the gray dawn of time could be traced to moses and to jesus seemed to her a mission grander far than the conquest of empires and infinitely more to be desired than the crown and heritage of solomon the night wore on as she planned the work of coming years but she still walked up and down the floor with slow uncertain steps like one who peering at distant objects sees nothing close at hand flush and tremor passed from her countenance leaving the features pale and fixed for the first gush of enthusiasm like the jets of violet flame flickering over the ********* mass in ******** ********* had *********** thought was a *********** and consecrated purpose at last when the feeble light admonished her that she would soon be in darkness she retreated to her own room and the first glimmer of day struggled in at her window as she knelt at her bedside praying be pleased o lord to make me a fit instrument for thy work sanctify my heart ******* and enlighten my mind grant me patience and perseverance and unwavering faith guide me into paths that lead to truth enable me in all things to labor with an eye single to thy glory caring less for the applause of the world than for the advancement of the cause of christ o my father and my god bless the work on which i am about to enter crown it with success accept me as an humble **** for the benefit of my race and when the days of my earthly pilgrimage are ended receive my soul into that eternal rest which thou hast prepared from the foundations of the world for the sake of jesus christ one afternoon about a week after mr leighs last visit as edna returned from the parsonage where she had been detained beyond the usual time mrs murray placed in her hand a note from mrs inge inviting both to dine with her that day and meet some distinguished friends from a distant state mrs murray had already completed an elaborate toilet and desired edna to lose no time in making the requisite changes in her own dress the latter took off her hat laid her books down on a table and said please offer my excuses to mrs inge i can not accept the invitation and hope you will not urge me nonsense let me hear no more such childish stuff and get ready at once we shall be too late i am afraid the orphan leaned against the mantelpiece and shook her head mrs murray colored angrily and drew herself up haughtily edna earl did you hear what i said yes madam but this time i cannot obey you allow me to give you my reasons and i am sure you will forgive what may now seem mere obstinacy on the night of the party given by mrs inge i determined under no circumstances to accept any future invitations to her house for i overheard a conversation between mrs hill and mrs montgomery which i believe was intended to reach my ears and consequently wounded and mortified me very much i was ridiculed and denounced as a poor ******* and interloper who was being smuggled into society far above my position in life and pronounced an ********** schemer intent on thrusting myself upon mr leighs notice and ambitious of marrying him for his fortune they sneered at the idea that we should study hebrew with mr hammond and declared it a mere trap to catch mr leigh now mrs murray you know that i never had such a thought and the bare mention of a motive so sordid contemptible and unwomanly surprised and disgusted me but i resolved to study hebrew by myself and to avoid meeting mr leigh at the parsonage for if his sisters friends entertain such an opinion of me i know not what other people and even mrs inge may think those two ladies added some other things equally unpleasant and untrue and as i see that they are also invited to dine today it would be very disagreeable for me to meet them in mr leighs presence mrs murray frowned and her lips curled as she clasped a diamond bracelet on her arm i have long since ceased to be surprised by any manifestation of mrs *********** insolence she doubtless judges your motives by those of her ********* and ************** fashionable daughter maud who rumor says is paying most devoted attention to that same fortune of gordons i shall avail myself of the first suitable occasion to suggest to her that it is rather ********** in persons whose fathers were convicted of ******* and hunted out of the state to lay such stress on the mere poverty of young ********* for admission into society i have always noticed that people women especially whose lineage is enveloped in a certain twilight haze constitute themselves guardians of the ************* of their pretentious cliques and fly at the throats of those who they imagine desire to enter their fashionable ******** mutual admiration association as for mrs hill whose parents were positively respectable even ******* i expected less nervousness from her on the subject of ********* and should have given her credit for more courtesy and less malice but poor thing nature denied her any individuality and she serves her circle in the same capacity as one of those tin ********** fastened on locomotives all that you heard was excessively ******* and in really good society *********** is more ********** than ********* but however annoying it is beneath your notice and unworthy of consideration i would not gratify them by withdrawing from a position which you can so gracefully occupy it is no privation to me to stay at home on the contrary i prefer it for i would not exchange the companionship of the books in this house for all the dinners that ever were given there is no necessity for you to make a recluse of yourself simply because two rude silly gossips disgrace themselves you have time enough to read and study and still go out with me when i consider it advisable but my dear mrs murray my position in your family as an unknown dependent on your charity subjects me to is a matter which does not concern ******** hill and montgomery as i shall most ************* intimate to them i insist upon the dismissal of the whole affair from your mind how much longer do you intend to keep me waiting i am very sorry you cannot view the subject from my standpoint but hereafter i cannot accompany you to dinners and parties whenever you desire me to see company in your own house i shall be glad to comply with your wishes and commands but my selfrespect will not permit me to go out to meet people who barely tolerate me through fear of offending you it is exceedingly painful dear mrs murray for me to have to appear disrespectful and stubborn toward you but in this instance i can not comply with your wishes they looked at each other steadily and mrs murrays brow cleared and her lip unbent what do you expect me to tell mrs inge that i return my thanks for her very kind remembrance but am closely occupied in preparing myself to teach and have no time for ******** mrs murray smiled significantly do you suppose that excuse will satisfy your friend gordon he will fly for consolation to the stereotyped smile and delicious flattery of ********* miss maud i care not where he flies provided i am left in peace stop my dear child you do not mean what you say you know very well that you earnestly hope gordon will escape the tender mercies of silly maud and the machinations of her most amiable mamma if you dont i do understand that you are not to visit susan *********** sins on gordons head i shall come home early and make you go to bed at nine oclock to punish you for your obstinacy by the by edna hagar tells me that you frequently sit up till three or four oclock poring over those ********** documents in my sons cabinet this is absurd and will ruin your health and beside i doubt if what you learn is worth your trouble you must not sit up longer than ten oclock give me my furs edna ate her dinner alone and went into the library to practise a difficult music lesson but the spell of her new project was stronger than the witchery of music and closing the piano she ran into the egyptian museum as mrs murray termed her sons sittingroom the previous night she had been reading an account of the doctrines of ********* in which there was an attempt to trace all the chief features of the ********** to the old testament and the jews and now she returned to the subject with ********** interest pushing a cushioned chair close to the window she wrapped her shawl around her put her feet on the round of a neighboring chair to keep them from the icy floor and gave herself up to the perusal of the volume the sun went down in a wintry sky the solemn red light burning on the funeral **** of day streamed through the ******** windows flushed the fretted ****** of the taj mahal glowed on the marble floor and warmed and brightened the serene lovely face of the earnest young student as the flame faded in the west where two stars leaped from the pearly ashes the fine print of ednas book grew dim and she turned the page to catch the mellow silvery radiance of the full moon which shining low in the east threw a ghastly lustre on the awful form and floating white hair of the ******** woman on the wall but between the orphan and the light close beside her chair stood a tall dark figure with uncovered head and outstretched hands she sprang to her feet uttering a cry of mingled alarm and delight for she knew that erect stately form and regal head could belong to but one person oh mr murray can it be possible that you have indeed come home to your sad desolate mother oh for her sake i am so glad she had clasped her hands tightly in the first instant of surprise and stood looking at him with fear and pleasure struggling for mastery in her eloquent countenance edna have you no word of welcome no friendly hand to offer a man who has been wandering for four long years among strangers in distant lands it was not the harsh bitter voice whose mocking echoes had haunted her ears during his absence but a tone so low and deep and mournful so ************ sweet and she could not recognize it as his and unable to utter a word she put her hand in his outstretched palm his fingers closed over it with a pressure that was painful and her eyes fell beneath the steady searching gaze he fixed on her face for fully a minute they stood motionless then he took a match from his pocket lighted a gas globe that hung over the taj and locked the door leading into the rotunda my mother is dining out hagar informed me tell me is she well and have you made her happy while i was far away he came back leaned his elbow on the carved top of the cushioned chair and partly shading his eyes with his hand looked down into the girls face your mother is very well indeed but anxious and unhappy on your account and i think you will find her thinner and paler than when you saw her last then you have not done your duty as i requested i could not take your place sir and your last letter led her to believe that you would be absent for another year she thinks that at this instant you are in the heart of persia last night when the servant came from the postoffice without the letter which she confidently expected her eyes filled with tears and she said he has ceased to think of his home and loves the excitement of travel better than his mothers peace of mind why did you deceive her why did you rob her of all the joy of anticipating your speedy return as she glanced at him she saw the old scowl settling heavily between his eyes and the harshness had crept back to the voice that answered i did not deceive her it was a sudden and unexpected circumstance that determined my return moreover she should long since have accustomed herself to find happiness from other sources than my society for no one knows better my detestation of settling down in any fixed habitation edna felt all her childish repugnance sweeping over her as she saw the swift hardening of his features and she turned toward the door where are you going to send a messenger to your mother acquainting her with your arrival she would not forgive me if i failed to give her such good tidings at the very earliest moment you will do no such thing i forbid any message she thinks me in the midst of persian ruins and can afford to wait an hour longer among her friends how happened it that you also are not at mrs inges either the suddenness of the question or the intentness of his scrutiny or the painful consciousness of the true cause of her failure to accept the invitation brought back the blood which surprise had driven from her cheeks i preferred remaining at home home home he repeated and continued vehemently do you really expect me to believe that a girl of your age with the choice of a dinnerparty among the ***** with lace silk and feathers champagne ****** and scandal flattering speeches and soft looks from young gentlemen biting words and hard looks from old ladies or the alternative of a dull lonely evening in this cold dreary den of mine shut up with mummies mss and musty books could deliberately decline the former and voluntarily select the latter such an ******* in ********* such a ***** ******* might occur in bacons ******** or in some undiscovered and ********** realm where the men are all brave honest and true and the women conscientious and constant but here and now ah pardon me impossible edna felt as if ***** suggestion to ****** of a window in the human heart whereby ones thoughts might be rendered visible had been adopted for under the ******** eye bent upon her the secret motives of her conduct seemed spread out as on a scroll which he read as well i was invited to mrs inges yet you find me here because i preferred a quiet evening at home to a noisy one elsewhere how do you explain the contradiction if you ********** my words i am not so inexperienced as to tax my ingenuity with any such burden with the penelope web of female motives may fates and furies forbid rash meddling unless human nature here in america has undergone a radical change nay a most complete ****************** since i ******* it some years ago unless this year is to be chronicled as an ****** of truth and unselfishness i will stake all my possessions on the assertion that some very peculiar and cogent reason something beyond the desire to prosecute ************** researches has driven you to decline the invitation she made no reply but opened the bookcase and replaced the volume which she had been reading and he saw that she glanced uneasily toward the door as if longing to escape are you insulted at my presumption in thus *********** you i am sorry sir to find that you have lost none of your cynicism in your travels do you regard travelling as a ******* for minds diseased she looked up and smiled in his ***** smile so bright and arch and merry that even a stone might have caught the glow certainly not mr murray as you are the most incorrigible traveller i have ever known but there was no answering gleam on his darkening countenance as he watched her and the brief silence that ensued was annoying to his companion who felt less at ease every moment and convinced that with such antagonism of character existing between them all her peaceful happy days at le bocage were drawing to a close mr murray i am cold and i should like to go to the fire if you have no more questions to ask and will be so kind as to unlock the door he glanced round the room and taking his grey travelling shawl from a chair where he had thrown it laid it in a heap on the marble tiles and said yes this floor is icy stand on the shawl though i am well aware you are more tired of me than of the room another long pause followed and then st elmo murray came close to his companion saying for four long years i have been making an ************* of those experiments which men frequently attempt believing all the time that it is worse than childs play and half hoping that it will prove so and sanction the wisdom of their ********** concerning the result when i left home i placed in your charge the key of my private desk or cabinet exacting the promise that only upon certain conditions would you venture to open it those contingencies have not arisen consequently there can be no justification for your having made yourself acquainted with the contents of the vault i told you i trusted the key in your hands i did not i felt assured you would betray the confidence it was not a ******* was a temptation which i believed no girl or woman would successfully resist i am here to receive an account of your stewardship and i tell you now i doubt you where is the key she took from her pocket a small ivory box and opening it drew out the little key and handed it to him mr murray it was a confidence which i never solicited which has caused me much pain because it necessitated concealment from your mother but ******** is my ******** have not betrayed there is the key but of the contents of the tomb i know nothing it was ungenerous in you to tempt a child as you did to offer a premium as it were for a violation of secrecy by ******** my curiosity and then placing in my own hands the means of gratifying it of course i have wondered what the mystery was and why you selected me for its ********* and i have often wished to inspect the interior of that marble cabinet but child though i was i think i would have gone to the stake sooner than violate my promise as he took the key she observed that his hand trembled and that a sudden pallor overspread his face edna earl i give you one last chance to be truthful with me if you yielded to the ************* what woman what girl would ***** would be no more than i really expected and you will scarcely have disappointed me for as i told you i put no faith in you but even if you succumbed to a natural curiosity be honest and confess it she looked up steadily into his inquisitorial eyes and answered i have nothing to confess he laid his hand heavily on her shoulder and his tone was eager vehement pleading tremulous can you look me in the ******** say that you never put this key in yonder lock edna more hangs on your words than you dream of be truthful as if you were indeed in the presence of the god you worship i can forgive you for ****** into my affairs but i can not and will not pardon you for trifling with me now i never unlocked the vault i never had the key near it but ********* a week ******* i found the tomb covered with cobwebs and twisted the key partly into the hole to drive out the spider i give you my most solemn assurance that i never unlocked it never saw the interior your suspicions are ungenerous and **************** to you and insulting to me the proof is at hand and if i have indeed unjustly suspected you atonement full and ample shall be made clasping one of her hands so firmly that she could not extricate it he drew her before the taj mahal and stooping fitted the key to the lock there was a dull click as he turned it but even then he paused and scrutinized her face it was flushed and wore a proud defiant grieved look his own was colorless as the marble that reflected it and she felt the heavy rapid beating of his blood and saw the cords thickening on his brow if you have faithfully kept your promise there will be an explosion when i open the vault slowly he turned the key a second time and as the arched door opened and swung back on its golden hinges there was a flash and sharp report from a pistol within edna started involuntarily notwithstanding the warning and clung to his arm an instant but he took no notice of her whatever his fingers relaxed their iron grasp of hers his hand dropped to his side and leaning forward he bowed his head on the marble dome of the little temple how long he stood there she knew not but the few moments seemed to her interminable as she silently watched his motionless figure he was so still that finally she conjectured he might possibly have fainted from some cause unknown to her and averse though she was to addressing him she said timidly mr murray are you ill give me the key of the door and i will bring you some wine there was no answer and in alarm she put her hand on his tightly he clasped it and drawing her suddenly close to his side said without raising his face edna earl i have been ****** ******** i shall be better henceforth o child child your calm pure guileless soul can not comprehend the blackness and dreariness of mine better that you should lie down now in death with all the unfolded freshness of your life gathered in your grave than live to know the world as i have proved it for many years i have lived without hope or trust or faith in ********** anybody tonight i stand here lacking sympathy with or respect for my race and my confidence

you will not wonder that i doubted you but that my doubt proved unjust this little vault contains no skeleton no state secrets only a picture and a few jewels my will and the history of a wrecked

confidence in me and i would much sooner go for sympathy to one of your bronze monsters yonder on the doorsteps than to you neither of us likes the other and consequently a sham cordiality would be intolerably irksome i shall not be here much longer but while we are in the same house i trust no bitter or unkind feelings will be entertained i thank you sir for your polite offer of assistance but hope i shall soon be able to maintain myself without ********* your mother any longer how long have you burdened her ever since that night when i was picked up lame and helpless and placed in her kind hands i should like to know whether you really love my mother next to the memory of my grandfather i love her and mr hammond and i feel that my gratitude is beyond expression there your mother is coming i hear the carriage shall i tell her you are here without raising his face he took the key of the door from his pocket and held it toward her no i will meet her in her own room edna hastened to the library and throwing herself into a chair tried to collect her thoughts and reflect upon what had passed in the egyptian museum very soon mrs murrays cry of joyful surprise rang through the house and tears of sympathy rose to ednas eyes as fancy pictured the happy meeting in the neighboring room notwithstanding the strong antipathy to mr murray which she had assiduously cultivated and despite her conviction that he held in derision the religious faith to which she clung so tenaciously she was now disquieted and pained to discover that his bronzed face possessed an ************ indescribable **************** she had found nowhere else in striving to analyze the interest she was for the first time conscious of feeling she soothed herself with the belief that it arose from curiosity concerning his past life and sympathy for his evident *********** it was in vain that she endeavored to fix her thoughts on a book his eyes met hers on every page and when the bell summoned her to a late supper she was glad to escape from her own confused reflections mrs murray and her son were standing on the rug before the grate and as edna entered the former held out her hand have you seen my son come and congratulate me she kissed the girls forehead and continued st elmo has she not changed astonishingly would you have known her had you met her away from home i should certainly have known her under all circumstances he did not look at her but resumed the conversation with his mother which her entrance had interrupted and during supper edna could scarcely realize that the cold distant man who took no more notice of her than of one of the salt cellars was the same whom she had left leaning over the taj not the faintest trace of emotion lingered on the dark stony features over which occasionally flickered the light of a sarcastic smile as he briefly outlined the course of his wanderings and now that she could without being observed study his countenance she saw that he looked much older more worn and haggard and hopeless than when last at home and that the thick curling hair that clung in glossy rings to his temples was turning grey when they arose from the table mrs murray took an exquisite bouquet from the mantelpiece and said edna i was requested to place this in your hands as a token of the regard and remembrance of your friend and admirer gordon leigh who charged me to assure you that your absence spoiled his enjoyment of the day as he seemed quite inconsolable because of your ************* i promised that you should ride with him tomorrow afternoon as edna glanced up to receive the flowers she met the merciless gaze she so much dreaded and in her confusion let the bouquet fall on the carpet mr murray picked it up inhaled the fragrance rearranged some of the geranium leaves that had been crushed and smiling bitterly all the while bowed and put it securely in her hand edna you have no other engagement for tomorrow yes madam i have promised to spend it with mr hammond then you must excuse yourself for i will not have gordon disappointed again too much annoyed to answer edna left the room but paused in the hall and beckoned to mrs murray who instantly joined her of course you will not have prayers tonight as mr murray has returned for that very reason i want to have them to make a public acknowledgment of my gratitude that my son has been restored to me oh if he would only consent to be present it is late and he will probably plead fatigue leave that with me and when i ring the bell come to the library the orphan went to her room and diligently copied an essay which she intended to submit to mr hammond for criticism on the following day and as the comparative merits of the ******** and ******** ***** constituted her theme she soon became absorbed by grecian politics and was only reminded of the events of the evening when the ******* bell sounded calling the household to prayer she laid down her pen and hurried to the library whither mrs murray had enticed her son who was standing before one of the bookcases looking over the table of contents of a new scientific work the servants came in and ranged themselves near the door and suddenly mrs murray said you must take my place tonight edna i can not read aloud the orphan looked up appealingly but an imperative gesture silenced her and she sat down before the table bewildered and frightened mr murray glanced around the room and with a look of wrath and scorn threw down the book and turned toward the door but his mothers hand seized his my son for my sake do not go out of respect for me remain the first evening of your return for my sake st elmo he frowned shook off her hands and strode to the door then ************ the matter came back and stood at the fireplace leaning his elbow on the mantel looking gloomily at the coals although painfully embarrassed as she took her seat and prepared to conduct the services in his presence edna felt a great calm steal over her spirit when she opened the bible and read her favorite chapter the fourteenth of st john her sweet flexible voice gradually losing its tremor rolled ********** through the room and when she knelt and repeated the prayer selected for the ********* prayer of thanks for the safe return of a traveller to the haven of ******* tone was full of pathos and an earnestness that strangely stirred the proud heart of the wanderer as he stood there looking through his fingers at her uplifted face and listening to the first prayer that had reached his ears for nearly nineteen weary years of sin and scoffing when edna rose from her knees he had left the room and she heard his swift steps echoing drearily through the rotunda i do not wish to interrupt you there is certainly room enough in this library for both and my entrance need not prove the signal for your departure mr murray closed the door as he came in and walking up to the bookcases stood carefully examining the titles of the numerous volumes it was a cold dismal morning and sobbing wintry winds and the ceaseless pattering of rain made the outer world seem dreary in comparison with the genial atmosphere and the ruddy glow of the cosy luxurious library where choice exotics breathed their fragrance and early hyacinths exhaled their rich perfume in the centre of the ************** table stood a tall glass bowl filled with white ********* and from its ********* edges drooped a fringe of scarlet fuchsias while near the window was a china statuette in whose daily adornment edna took unwearied interest it was a lovely flora whose slender fingers held aloft small *********** vases into which fresh blossoms were inserted every morning the head was so arranged as to contain water and thus preserve the wreath of natural flowers which crowned the goddess today golden ******** nestled down on the streaming hair and purple ******* filled the fairy hands while the tiny rosy feet sank deep in the cushion of fine green mosses studded with double violets edna had risen to leave the room when the master of the house entered but at his request resumed her seat and continued reading after searching the shelves unavailingly he glanced over his shoulder and asked have you seen my copy of de ******* ******* anywhere about the house i had it a week ago i beg your pardon sir for causing such a fruitless

with peculiar force raising the book she read with much emphasis thou ******** after wisdom o ******** which is the science of the will of the gods and thou ******* from people to people like a mortal

ought to consult mr hammond but she wished to surprise him to hear his impartial opinion of a printed article which he could not suspect that she had written and finally she resolved to say nothing to any one to work on in silence relying upon herself with this determination she sat down before her desk opened the ms of her book and very soon became absorbed in writing the second chapter before she had finished even the first sentence a hasty rap summoned her to the door she opened it and found mr murray standing in the hall with a candle in his hand where is that volume of chess problems which you had last week it is here sir she took it from the table and as she approached him mr murray held the light close to her countenance and gave her one of those keen looks which always reminded her of the descriptions of the scrutiny of the council of ten in the days when lions mouths grinned at the ************* in venice something in the curious expression of his face and the evident

the unmistakable traces of the tears of vexation and disappointment at least he can have no idea of the cause and that is some comfort for he is too honorable to open my letters but just here a doubt flashed into her mind how do i know that he is honorable can any man be worthy of trust who holds nothing sacred and sneers at all religions no he has no conscience and yet she sighed and went back to

the blue ribbons that looped her hair and girdled her waist just at that instant ere she could reply a rustling of the undergrowth arrested further conversation and mr murray stepped out of the adjoining thicket with his gun in his hand and his grim pet ali at his heels whatever surprise he may have felt his countenance certainly betrayed none as he lifted his hat and said good morning leigh i shall not intrude upon the ********* on which i have happened to stumble longer than is necessary to ask if you are so fortunate as to have a match with you i find my case empty mr leigh took a match from his pocket and while mr murray lighted his cigar his eyes rested for an instant only on ednas flushed face are you not coming to the childrens celebration asked gordon no indeed i own that i as lazy as a turk but while i am constitutionally and habitually opposed to labor i swear i should prefer to plough or break stones till sundown sooner than listen to all the **** and ******* that

dear edna let me keep it always do i mistake your feelings when i hope that you return my affection you entirely mistake them mr leigh in supposing that you can ever be more to me than a very dear and valued friend it grieves me very much to be forced to give you pain or cause you disappointment but i should wrong you even more than myself were i to leave you in doubt concerning my feeling toward you i like your society and you have my entire confidence and highest esteem but it is impossible that i can ever be your wife why impossible because i never could love you as i think i ought to love the man i marry my dear edna answer one question candidly do you love any one else better than you love me no mr leigh does mr murray stand between your heart and mine oh no mr leigh then i will not yield the hope of winning your love if your heart is free i will have it all my own one day o edna why can not you love me i would make you very happy my darlings home should possess all that fortune and devoted affection could supply not one wish should remain *********** i am able to earn a home i do not intend to marry for one ah your pride is your only fault and it will cause us both much suffering i fear edna i know how sensitive you are and how deeply your delicacy has been wounded by the malicious meddling of illmannered gossips i know why you abandoned your hebrew recitations and a wish to spare your feelings alone prevented me from punishing certain ************** as they deserved but dearest do not visit their offences upon me because they dared ascribe their own ignoble motives to you do not lock your heart against me and refuse me the privilege of making your life happy mr leigh you are not necessary to my happiness while our tastes are in many respects congenial and it is pleasant to be with you occasionally it would not cause me any deep grief if i were never to see you again o edna you are cruel unlike yourself forgive me sir if i seem so and believe me when i assure you that it pains me more to say it than you to hear it no woman should marry a man whose affection and society are not absolutely essential to her peace of mind and heart applying this test to you i find that mine is in no degree dependent on you and though you may have no warmer friend i must tell you it is utterly useless for you to hope that i shall ever love you as you wish mr leigh i regret that i can not and if my heart were only ****** of my will i would try to reciprocate your affection because i appreciate so fully and so gratefully all that you generously offer me today you stretch out your hand to a poor girl of unknown parentage reared by ******** girl considered by your family and friends an obscure interloper in aristocratic circles and with a noble

those who sneer at your poverty and lineage o mr leigh god knows i wish i loved you as you deserve ambition and gratitude alike plead for you but it is impossible that i could ever consent to be your wife her eyes were full of tears as she looked in his handsome face hitherto so bright and genial now clouded and saddened by a bitter disappointment and suddenly catching both his hands in hers she stooped and pressed her lips to them although you refuse to encourage you cannot crush the hope that my affection will after a while win yours in return you are very young and as yet scarcely know your own heart and unshaken constancy on my part will plead for me in coming years i will be patient and as long as you are edna ****** long as you remain mistress of your own ****** shall cling fondly to the only hope that ******** my future over my feelings you have no control you may refuse me your ******** is your ******** while i shall abstain from demonstrations of affection i shall certainly cherish the hope of possessing it meantime permit me to ask whether you still contemplate leaving mrs murrays house miss harding told my sister yesterday that in a few months you would obtain a situation as governess or teacher in a school such is certainly my intention but i am at a loss to conjecture how miss harding obtained her information as the matter has not been alluded to since her arrival i trust you will pardon me the liberty i take in warning you to be exceedingly circumspect in your intercourse with her for i have reason to believe that her sentiments toward you are not so friendly as might be desired thank you mr leigh i am aware of her antipathy though of its cause i am ignorant and our intercourse is limited to the salutations of the day and the courtesies of the table drawing from her finger the emerald which had occasioned so many *********** reflections edna continued you must allow me to return the ring which i have hitherto worn as a token of friendship and which i cannot consent to retain any longer peace be with you dear friend is the earnest prayer of my heart our paths in life will soon diverge so widely that we shall probably see each other rarely but none of your friends will rejoice more sincerely than i to hear of your happiness and prosperity for no one else has such cause to hold you in grateful remembrance goodbye mr leigh think of me hereafter only as a friend she gave him both hands for a minute left the ring in his palm and with tears in her eyes went back to the tables and platforms very rapidly chattering groups of happy children collected in the grove ********** boys clad in white linen suits with new straw hats belted with black and ********** girls robed in spotless muslin garlanded with flowers and bright with rosy badges sparkling eyes laughing lips sweet mirthful eager voices and ********** hearts ah that mayday could stretch from the fairy ********** of childhood to the arctic zone of age where

glittered in the diadem of the ******** sovereign late in the evening of that festal day mr hammond sat alone on the portico of the oldfashioned parsonage the full moon rising over the arched windows of the neighboring church shone on the marble monuments that marked the rows of graves and the golden beams stealing through the thick vines which clustered around the wooden columns broidered in glittering arabesque the polished floor at the old mans feet that solemn mysterious silence which nature reverently folds like a velvet pall over the bier of the pale dead day when the sky is filling more and more with crystal light as ******* evening deepens into night was now ******* the hum and stir of the village and only the occasional faroff bark of a dog and the clear sweet ********** of a mockingbird singing in the myrtle tree broke the repose so soothing after the bustle of the day to labor and to pray from dawn till dusk is the sole legacy which ********** man brought through the flaming gate of eden and in the gray gloaming mother earth stretches her vast hands tenderly over her drooping ********* children and mercifully ******* **** ******** close to the ministers armchair stood a small table covered with a snowy cloth on which was placed the evening meal consisting of strawberries honey bread butter and milk at his feet lay the white cat bathed in moonshine and playing with a fragrant spray of honeysuckle which trailed within reach of her paws and swung to and fro like a spicy ****** as the soft breeze stole up from the starry south the supper was ******** the old mans silvered head leaned wearily on his shrunken hand and through a tearful mist his mild eyes looked toward the churchyard where gleamed the monumental shafts that guarded his mouldering household idols his whiterobed darling dead his past was a wide fair fruitful field of hallowed labor bounteous with promise for that prophetic harvest whereof gods angels are ******* and his future whose near horizon was already ****** with the light of eternity was full of that blessed peace which passeth all understanding yet tonight precious reminiscences laid their soft mesmeric fingers on his heart and before him all ******** floated visions of other ******* long long ago when the queen of his boyish affections had worn her crown of flowers and many many years later when as the queen of his home and the proud mother of his children she had stood with her quivering hand nestled in his listening breathlessly to the mayday speech of their goldenhaired daughter why does the sea of thought thus backward roll ******* the breeze that through the ******* raves and ever drives us on some homeward ***** as if she loved the melancholy waves that murmuring ********* break oer a reef of graves the song of the mockingbird still rang from the ***** cradle of myrtle blossoms and a whippoorwill answered from a cedar in the churchyard when the slamming of the parsonage gate startled the shy ****** that slept in the vines that overarched it and mr leigh came slowly up the walk which was lined with purple and white lilies whose loveliness undiminished by the wear of centuries still rivaled the glory of solomon as he ascended the steps and removed his hat the pastor rose and placed a chair for him near his own good evening gordon where did you ****** yourself all day i expected to find you taking part in the childrens festival and hunted for you in the crowd i expected to attend but this morning something occurred which unfitted me for enjoyment of any kind consequently i thought it best to keep myself and my moodiness out of sight i trust nothing serious has happened yes something that threatens to blast all my hopes and make my life one great disappointment has not edna told you she has told me nothing relative to yourself but i noticed that she was depressed and grieved about something she was abstracted and restless and went home very early pleading fatigue and headache i wish i had a shadow of hope that her heart ached also mr hammond i am very wretched and have come to you for sympathy and counsel of course you have seen for a long time that i loved her very devotedly that i intended if possible to make her my wife although she was very shy and guarded and never gave me any reason to believe she returned my affection i ******** hoped she would not reject me and i admired her even more because of her reticence for i could not value a love which i knew was mine ******* today i mentioned the subject to her told her how entirely my heart was hers offered her my hand and fortune and was refused most decidedly her manner more than her words distressed and discouraged me she showed so plainly that she felt only friendship for me and entertained only regret for the pain she gave me she was kind and delicate but oh so ********** positive i saw that i had no more place in her heart than that whippoorwill in the cedars yonder and yet i shall not give her up while i live i will cling to the hope that i may finally win her thousands of women have rejected a man again and again and at last yielded and accepted him and i do not believe edna can withstand the devotion of a lifetime do not deceive yourself gordon it is true many women are flattered by a mans perseverance their vanity is gratified they first reproach themselves for the suffering they inflict then gratitude for constancy comes to plead for the inconsolable suitor and at last they persuade themselves that such devotion can not fail to make them happy such a woman edna is not and if i have correctly understood her character never can be i sympathize with you gordon and it is because i love you so sincerely that i warn you against a hope destined to cheat you but she admitted that she loved no one else and i can see no reason why after a while she may not give me her heart i have watched her for years i think i know her nature better than any other human being and i tell you edna earl will never coax and persuade herself to marry any man no matter what his position and endowments may be she is not a dependent woman the circumstances of her life have forced her to dispense with companionship she is sufficient for herself and while she loves her friends warmly and tenderly she feels the need of no one if she ever marries it will not be from gratitude or devotion but because she learned to love almost against her will some strong vigorous thinker some man whose will and intellect masters hers who compels her hearts homage and without whose society she can not persuade herself to live and why may i not hope that such will one day be my good fortune for a few minutes mr hammond was silent walking up and down the wide portico and when he resumed his seat he laid his hand affectionately on the young mans shoulder saying my dear gordon your happiness as well as hers is very dear to me i love you both and you will you must forgive me if what i am about to say should wound or ******* you knowing you both as i do and wishing to save you future disappointment i should even were you my own son certainly tell you gordon you will never be ednas husband because intellectually she is your superior she feels this and will not marry one to whose mind her own does not bow in reverence to rule the man she married would make her miserable and she could only find happiness in being ruled by an intellect to which she looked up admiringly i know that many very gifted women have married their ********* but edna is peculiar and in some respects totally unlike any other woman whose character i have carefully studied gordon you are not offended with me mr leigh put out his hand grasped that of his companion and his voice was marked by unwonted tremor as he answered you pain and ********* me beyond expression but i could never be offended at words which i am obliged to feel are dictated by genuine affection mr hammond might not years of thought and study remove the obstacle to which you allude can i not acquire all that you deem requisite i would dedicate my life to the attainment of knowledge to the improvement of my faculties erudition would not satisfy her do you suppose she could wed a mere walking ************* she is naturally more gifted than you are and unfortunately for you she discovered the fact when you were studying together but sir women listen to the promptings of heart much oftener than to the cold stern dictates of reason very true gordon but her heart declares against you do you know any one whom you regard as fully worthy of ****** one who will probably win her i know no man whose noble generous heart renders him so worthy of her as yourself and if she could only love you as you deserve i should be rejoiced but that i believe to be impossible do you know how soon she expects to leave le bocage probably about the close of the year i cannot bear to think of her as going among ************** buffeted by the world while she toils to earn a maintenance it is inexpressibly bitter for me to reflect that the girl whom i love above everything upon earth who would preside so gracefully so elegantly over my home and make my life so proud and happy should prefer to shut herself up in a schoolroom and wear out her life in teaching fretful spoiled trying children oh mr hammond can you not prevail upon her to abandon this scheme think what a complete sacrifice it will be if she feels that the hand of duty points out this destiny as hers i shall not attempt to dissuade her for peace of mind and heart is found nowhere save in accordance with the dictates of conscience and judgment since miss ******** arrival at le bocage i fear edna will realize rapidly that she is no longer needed as a companion by mrs murray and her proud spirit will rebel against the surveillance to which i apprehend she is already subjected she has always expressed a desire to maintain herself by teaching but i suspect that she will do so by her pen when she prepares to quit mrs murrays house i shall offer her a home in mine but i have little hope that she will accept it much as she loves me for she wants to see something of that strange mask called life by the world she wishes to go to some large city where she can command advantages beyond her reach in this quiet little place and where her own exertions will pay for the roof that covers her however we may deplore this decision certainly we can not blame her for the feeling that prompts it i have racked my brain for some plan by which i could share my fortune with her without her suspecting the donor for if she ******* my hand i know she would not accept one cent from me can you suggest any feasible scheme mr hammond shook his head and after some reflection answered we can do nothing but wait and watch for an opportunity of aiding her i confess gordon her future fills me with serious apprehension she is so proud so sensitive so scrupulous and yet so *********** ambitious should her high hopes her fond dreams be destined to the sharp and summary defeat which frequently overtakes ambitious men

wrong and i can not believe that any woman whose heart is as warm and noble as ednas will continue to reject such love as i shall always offer her of one thing i feel assured no man will ever love her as well or better than i do and to this knowledge she will awake some day god bless her she is the only woman i shall ever want to call my wife i sympathize most keenly with your severe disappointment my dear young friend and shall earnestly pray that in this matter god will overrule all things for your happiness as well as hers he who notes the death of sparrows and numbers even the hairs of our

amused at the expression of her face and her manoeuvres to find a substitute no no she is too conscientious to wear a mask you must tax your ingenuity for some better solution she is shrewd enough to

cheek saying bravo set a thief to catch a thief i knew you would hit the nail on the head but who the dl is this fellow who is writing to her from new york this is the second letter i have taken out of the office and there is no telling how often they come for on both occasions when i troubled myself to ride to the postoffice i have found letters directed to her in this same handwriting he drew a letter from his pocket and laid it on his knee and as estelle looked at it and then glanced with a puzzled expression toward her aunts equally curious face mr murray passed his hand across his eyes to hide their malicious twinkle give me the letter st elmo it is my duty to examine it for as long as she is under my protection she has no right to carry on a clandestine correspondence with strangers pardon me if i presume to dispute your prerogative to open her letters it is neither your business nor mine to dictate with whom she shall or shall not correspond now that she is no longer a child doubtless you remember that i warned you against her from the first day i ever set my eyes upon her and predicted that you would repent in sackcloth and ashes your charitable credulity i swore then she would prove a thief you vowed she was a saint but nevertheless i have no intention of turning spy at this late day and assisting you in the eminently honorable work of ********* letters from her distant ***** very coolly he put the letter back in his pocket mrs murray bit her lip and held out her hand saying peremptorily i insist upon having the letter since you are so spasmodically and exceedingly scrupulous i will carry it immediately to her and demand a perusal of the contents st elmo i am in no mood for jesting he only shook his head and laughed the dictates of filial respect forbid that i should subject my mothers curiosity to so severe an ordeal moreover were the letter once in your hands your conscience would persuade you that it is your imperative duty to a poor inexperienced motherless girl to inspect it ere her eager fingers have seized it beside she is coming and will save you the trouble of seeking her i heard her run up the steps a moment ago before mrs murray could frame her indignation in suitable words edna entered holding in one hand her straw hat in the other basket lined with grape leaves and filled with remarkably large and fine strawberries exercise had deepened the color in her fair sweet face which had never looked more lovely than now as she approached her benefactress holding up the fragrant tempting fruit mrs murray here is a present from mr hammond who desired me to tell you that these berries are the first he has gathered from the new bed next to the row of lilacs it is the variety he ordered from new york last fall and some roots of which he says he sent to you are they not the most perfect specimens you ever saw we measured them at the parsonage and six filled a saucer she was selecting a cluster to hold up for inspection and had not remarked the cloud on mrs murrays brow the strawberries are very fine i am much obliged to mr hammond the severity of the tone astonished edna who looked up quickly saw the stern displeasure written on her face and glanced inquiringly at the cousins there was an awkward silence and feeling the eyes of all fixed upon her the orphan picked up her hat which had fallen on the floor and asked shall i carry the basket to the diningroom or leave it here you need not trouble yourself to carry it anywhere mrs murray laid her hand on the ******** and rang sharply edna placed the fruit on the centretable and suspecting that she must be de **** moved toward the door but mr murray rose and stood before her here is a letter which arrived yesterday he put it in her hand and as

his mother and said carelessly i neglected to tell you that i heard from clinton today he has invited himself to spend some days here and wrote to say that he might be expected next week at least his visit will be welcome to you estelle and i congratulate you on the prospect of adding to your list of admirers the most fastidious exquisite it has ever been my misfortune to encounter st elmo you

i imagine my flattering estimate of him would be substantially the same estelle do you know him i have not that pleasure but report prepares me to find him extremely agreeable i am rejoiced at the

am glad clinton is coming for st elmo is so shamefully selfish and oblivious of his duties as host that i know time often hangs very heavily on your hands mrs murray was too thoroughly out of humor to heed the dangerous sparkle in her sons eyes very true mother his amiable and accommodating disposition ******** him strongly to your affection and knowing what is expected of him he will politely declare himself her most devoted lover before he has been thirtysix hours in her society now if she can accept him for a husband and you will only consent to receive him as your son i swear i will reserve a mere scanty annuity for my traveling expenses i will gladly divide the estate between them and transport myself permanently and joyfully beyond the animadversion on my inherited sweetness of temper if you my dear *** can only coax clinton into this arrangement for your own and my mothers happiness you will render me eternally grateful and smooth the way for a trip to ****** and ******* which i have long contemplated bear this proposition in mind will you especially when the charms of le bocage most favorably impress you remember you will become its mistress the day that you marry clinton make my mother adopt him and release me if my terms are not sufficiently liberal confer with clinton as soon as ******** propriety will permit and acquaint me with your ultimatum for i am so

delighted edna much more than she would willingly have confessed mr manning wrote that upon the eve of leaving home for a tour of some weeks travel he chanced to stumble upon her letter and in a second perusal some peculiarity of style induced him to reconsider the offer it contained and he determined to permit her to send the manuscript as far as written for his examination if promptly forwarded it would reach him before he left home and ******** an answer drawing all happy auguries from this second letter and trembling with pleasure edna hastened to prepare her manuscript for immediate transmission carefully enveloping it in a thick paper she sealed and directed it then fell on her knees and with clasped hands resting on the package prayed earnestly vehemently that gods blessing would accompany it would crown her efforts with success afraid to trust it to the hand of a servant she put on her hat and walked back to town the express agent gave her a receipt for the parcel assured her that it would be forwarded by the evening train and with a sigh of relief she turned her steps homeward ah it was a frail paper bark freighted with the noblest purest aspirations that ever possessed a womans soul launched upon the tempestuous sea of popular favor with ambition at the helm hope for a compass and the gaunt spectre of failure grinning in the shrouds would it successfully weather the gales of malice envy and detraction would it battle valiantly and triumphantly with the ********* hordes of critics who prowl hungrily along the track over which it must sail would it become a melancholy wreck on the mighty ocean of literature or would it proudly ride at anchor in the harbor of immortality with her name floating for ever at the ******** it was an experiment such as had stranded the hopes of hundreds and thousands and the pinched starved features of ********** and the white pleading face of keats stabbed to death by ********* poisoned pens rose

as hope gayly struck the ******* and fingered the ******** when edna returned to her room she sat down before her desk to ******** the letter which had given her so much gratification and as she refolded it mrs murray came in and closed the door after her her face was stern and pale she walked up to the orphan looked at her suspiciously and when she spoke her voice was hard and cold i wish to see that letter which you received today as it is very improper that you should without my knowledge carry on a correspondence with a stranger i would not have believed that you could be guilty of such conduct i am very much pained mrs murray that you should even for a moment have supposed that i had forfeited your confidence the nature of the correspondence certainly sanctions my engaging in it even without consulting you this letter is the second i have received from mr manning the editor ********** and was written in answer to a request of mine with reference to a literary matter which concerns nobody but myself i will show you the signature there it ********** g manning you know his literary reputation and his high position if you demand it of course i can not refuse to allow you to read it but dear mrs murray i hope you will not insist upon it as i prefer that no one should see the contents at least at present as i have never deceived you i think you might trust me when i assure you that the correspondence is entirely restricted to literary subjects why then should you object to my reading it for a reason which i will explain at some future day if you will only have confidence in me still if you are determined to examine the letter of course i must submit though it would distress me exceedingly to know that you can not or will not trust me in so small a matter she laid the open letter on the desk and covered her face with her hands mrs murray took up the sheet glanced at the signature and said look at me dont hide your face that argues something wrong edna raised her head and lifted her eyes full of tears to meet the scrutiny from which there was no escape mr mannings signature somewhat ********* me and beside i never knew you to *********** or attempt to deceive me your habitual truthfulness ********** me to believe you and i will not insist on reading this letter though i can not imagine why you should object to it but edna i am disappointed in you and in return for the confidence i have always reposed in you i want you to answer candidly the question i am about to ask why did you refuse to marry gordon leigh because i did not love him oh pooh that seems incredible for he is handsome and very attractive and some young ladies show very plainly that they love him though they have never been requested to do so there is only one way in which i can account for your refusal and i wish you to tell me the truth you are unwilling to marry gordon because you love somebody else better child whom do you love no indeed no i like mr leigh as well as any gentleman i know but i love no one except you and mr hammond mrs murray put her hand under the girls chin looked at her for some seconds and sighed heavily child i find it difficult to believe you why whom do you suppose i could love mr leigh is certainly more agreeable than anybody else i know but girls sometimes take strange whims in these matters do you ever expect to receive a better offer than mr leighs as far as fortune is concerned i presume i never shall have so good an opportunity again but mrs murray i would rather marry a poor man whom i really loved and who had to earn his daily bread than to be mr leighs wife and own that beautiful house he is building i know you wish me to accept him and that you think me very unwise very shortsighted but it is a question which i have settled after consulting my conscience and my heart and you give me your word of honor that you love no other gentleman better than gordon yes mrs murray i assure you that i do not as the mistress of the house looked down into the girls beautiful face and passed her hand tenderly over the thick glossy folds of hair that crowned the pure brow she wondered if it were possible that her son could ever regard the orphan with affection and she asked her own heart why she could not willingly receive her as a daughter mrs murray believed that she entertained a sincere friendship for mrs inge and yet she had earnestly endeavored to marry her brother to a girl whom she could not consent to see the wife of her own son verily when human friendships are analyzed it seems a mere poetic fiction that love took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with might smote the chord of self that trembling passed in music out of sight one afternoon about ten days after the receipt of mr mannings letter when edna returned from the parsonage she found the family assembled on the front veranda and saw that the expected visitor had arrived as mrs murray introduced her to mr allston the latter rose advanced a few steps and held out his hand edna was in the act of giving him hers when the *********** diamond cluster on his finger flashed and one swift glance at his face and figure made her snatch away her hand ere it touched his and draw back with a halfsmothered exclamation he bit his lip looked inquiringly around the circle smiled and returning to his seat beside estelle resumed the gay conversation in which he had been engaged mrs murray was leaning over the iron balustrade twining a wreath of multiflora around one of the fluted columns and did not witness the brief pantomime but when she looked around she could not avoid remarking the unwonted pallor and troubled expression of the girls face what is the matter child you look as if you were either ill or dreadfully fatigued i am tired thank you was the rather abstracted reply and she walked into the house and sat down before the open window in the library the sun had just gone down behind a fleecy ************* and kindled a volcano from whose ************ crater fiery rays of scarlet shot up almost to the clear blue zenith while here and there through ****** and vapory gorges the lurid lava light streamed down toward the horizon vacantly her eyes rested on this ******** and its splendor passed away unheeded for she was looking far beyond the western gates of day and saw a pool of ****** ghastly face turned up to the **** ******** corpse strewn with white poppies and ********* wan dying woman whose waving hair braided the pillow with ***** wide deep grave under the rustling chestnuts from whose green arches rang the despairing wail of a broken heart oh harry my husband imagination travelling into the past painted two *********** prattling babes suddenly smitten with orphanage and

what apology have you to offer for insulting a relative and guest of mine under my roof none sir what how dare you treat with unparalleled rudeness a visitor whose claim upon the courtesy and hospitality of this household is certainly more legitimate and easily recognized than that of he stopped and kicked out of his way a stool upon which ednas feet had been resting she had risen and they stood face to face i am waiting to hear the remainder of your sentence mr murray he uttered an oath and hurled his cigar through the window why the dl did you refuse to shake hands with allston i intend to know the truth and it may prove an economy of trouble for you to speak it at once if you demand my reasons you must not be offended at the ********* of my language your cousin is a murderer and ought to be hung i could not force myself to touch a hand all ******* with blood mr murray leaned down and looked into her eyes you are either delirious or utterly mistaken with reference to the

******* than i had fancied you have been thoroughly trained down yonder at the parsonage but i will be there was a trembling pant in his voice like that of some wild creature driven from its jungle hopeless of escape holding its hunters temporarily at bay waiting for death the girls hand ached in his unyielding grasp and after two ineffectual efforts to free them a sigh of pain passed her lips and she said proudly no sir my detestation of that form of ********* murder politely called duelling was not taught me at the parsonage i learned it in my early childhood before i ever saw mr hammond and though i doubt not he agrees with me in my abhorrence of the custom i have never heard him mention the subject hypocrite hypocrite meek little wolf in lambs wool do you dream that you can deceive me do you think me an idiot to be ******* by your ********* ******* of a fact which i know a fact to the truth of which i will swear till every star falls mr murray i never deceived you and i know

can not conjecture but i tell you solemnly that he has never even indirectly alluded to the question of duelling since i have known him mr murray i know you do entirely believe me when i utter these words a tinge of red leaped into his cheek something that would have been called hope in any other mans eyes looked out shyly under his heavy black lashes and a tremor shook off the sneering curl of

********** proclaimed st elmo murray its king she could not analyze her new feelings they would not obey the summons to the tribunal of her outraged selfrespect and with bitter shame and reproach and abject contrition she realized that she had begun to love the sinful blasphemous man who had insulted her revered grandfather and who barely tolerated her presence in his house this danger had never once occurred to her for she had always believed that love could only exist where high esteem and unbounded reverence prepared the soil and she was well aware that this mans character had from the first hour of their acquaintance excited her aversion and dread ten days before she had positively disliked and feared him now to her amazement she found him ******* in her heart defying ******** the sudden revulsion bewildered and mortified her and she resolved to crush out the feeling at once cost what it might when mr murray had asked if she loved any one else better than mr leigh she thought nay she knew she answered truly in the negative but now when she attempted to compare the two men such a strange yearning tenderness pleaded for st elmo and ********* his grave faults that the girls ************ severity wrung a groan from the very depths of her soul when the sad discovery was first made conscience lifted its hands in horror because of the mans reckless wickedness but after a little while a still louder clamor was raised by womanly pride which bled at the thought of ********** a love unsought ******** and with this fierce rush of reinforcements to aid conscience the ********* heart seemed destined to summary subjugation until this hour although conscious of many faults she had not supposed that there was anything especially contemptible in her character but now the feeling of ************* was unutterably galling she despised herself most cordially and the consistent dignity of life which she had striven to attain appeared hopelessly shattered while the battle of reason versus love was at its height mrs murray put her head in the room and asked edna where are you edna here i am why are you sitting in the dark i have searched the house for you she

brought him here he came to scold me for not shaking hands with his cousin indeed you must have been singularly rude if he noticed any want of courtesy change your dress and come down it was in vain

regarded estelle reminded edna of the account given by a traveller of the playful mood of a lion who having devoured one ******* kept his *** on another and amid occasional growls teased and toyed with his victim as the orphan sat bending over her work listening to the conversation she asked herself scornfully what hallucination has seized me the man is a mocking devil unworthy the respect or

looking out gathering strength from the holy calm of the dewy morning ********* to watch her own heart ceaselessly to crush promptly the feeling she had found there and to devote herself unreservedly

he lifted his hat and rode on were those the same sinister sneering features she had looked at the evening before his face was paler sterner and sadder than she had ever seen it and covering her own with her hands she murmured god help me to resist that mans wicked magnetism oh grandpa are you looking down on your poor little pearl will you forgive me for allowing myself ever to have thought

unnoticed the house was thronged with visitors and families residing in the neighborhood were frequently invited to dinner but the orphan generally contrived on these occasions to have an engagement at the parsonage and as mrs murray no longer required or seemed to desire her presence she spent much of her time alone and rarely saw the members of the household except at breakfast she noticed that mr allston either felt or feigned unbounded admiration for estelle who graciously received his devoted attentions while mr murray now and then sneered openly at both and appeared daily more impatient to quit the home of which he spoke with undisguised disgust as day after day and week after week slipped by without bringing tidings of ednas ms her heart became oppressed with anxious forebodings and she found it difficult to wait patiently for the verdict upon which hung all her hopes one thursday afternoon when a number of persons had been invited to dine at le bocage and mrs murray was

the former with his gaze fastened on the carpet and a chilling smile fixed on his lip the faces of the two presented a painful *********** fair hopeful bright with noble aims and youthful yet manly beauty the other swarthy cold repulsive as some bronze image of ******* for more than three weeks edna had not spoken to mr murray except to say goodmorning as she entered the diningroom or passed him in the hall and now with a sigh which she did not possess the courage to analyze she went up to her room and sat down to read among the books on her desk was ************ prince and history of florence and the copy which was an exceedingly handsome one contained a portrait of the author between the regular features of the ********** satirist and those of the master of the house edna had so frequently found a startling resemblance that she one day mentioned the subject to mrs murray who after a careful examination of the picture was forced to admit rather ************ that they certainly looked somewhat alike tonight as the orphan lifted the volume from its restingplace it opened at the portrait and she looked long at the handsome face which had the lips been thinner and the hair thicker and more curling at the temples might have been ************** from that one downstairs under the chandelier one maxim of the prince had certainly been adopted by mr murray it is safer to be feared than to be loved and while the orphan detested the ****** and unscrupulous policy of ******* machiavelli her reason told her that the character of st elmo murray was scarcely more worthy of respect she heard the guests take their departure heard mrs murray ask hagar whether edna had returned from the parsonage and then doors were closed and the house grew silent vain were the girls efforts to concentrate her thoughts on her books or upon her ms they wandered toward the portrait and finally remembering that she needed a book of reference she lighted a candle took the copy of machiavelli which she determined to put out of sight and went down to the library the smell of a cigar aroused her suspicions as she entered and glancing nervously around the room she saw mr murray seated before the window his face was turned from her and hoping to escape unnoticed she was retracing her steps when he rose come in edna i am waiting for you for i knew you would be here some time before day taking the candle from her hand he held it close to her face and compressed his lips tightly for an instant how long do you suppose your constitution will endure the tax you impose upon it midnight toil has already robbed you of your color and converted a rosy robust child into a pale weary ********** woman what do you want here the **** what business have you with norse myths with ***** and ****** and ***** you cant have the book i carried it to my room yesterday and i am in no mood tonight to play ********* for any one edna turned to place the copy of machiavelli on the

had abstained from looking at him but now her eyes met his fearlessly and in their beautiful depths he read an expression of helpless repulsion such as a bird might evince for the serpent whose glittering eyes ********* it ah at least your honesty is refreshing in these accursed days of hypocritical sycophancy i wonder how much more training it will require before your lips learn fashionable lying tricks but you understand me as little as the world understood poor machiavelli of whom burke justly remarked he is obliged to bear the ********** of those whose maxims and rules of government

the expression of dismay of keen disappointment that came into her face the frail bark had struck the ***** she felt that her hopes were going down to ruin and her lips quivered with pain as she recognized mr mannings bold chirography on the paper wrapping what is the matter child something that concerns only myself are you unwilling to trust me with your secret whatever it may be i would sooner find betrayal from the grinning skeletons in ******** ****** than from my lips smothering a sigh she shook her head impatiently that means that redhot steel could not pinch it out of you and

with so much ********** my reason for not delivering the parcel more promptly was simply the wish to screen you from the ***** scrutiny with which we are both favored by some now resident at bocage as

allan the strangers voice was very sweet and winning and as she entered the room edna could scarcely repress an exclamation of admiration for the world sees but rarely such perfect beauty as was the portion of agnes powell she was one of those few women who seem the pets of time whose form and features catch some new grace and charm from every passing year and but for the tall lovely girl who clung to her hand and called her mother a stranger would have believed her only twentysix or eight fair rosy with a complexion fresh as a childs and a face faultless in contour as that of a greek goddess it was impossible to resist the fascination which she exerted over all who looked upon her her waving yellow hair flashed in the morning sunshine and as she raised one hand to shade her large clear blue eyes her open sleeve fell back disclosing an arm dazzlingly white and exquisitely moulded as mr hammond introduced his pupil to his guests mrs powell smiled pleasantly and pressed the offered hand but the eyes blue and cold as the *********** of ***** scanned the orphans countenance and when edna had seen fully into their depths she could not avoid recalling ****** poem of ******* my daughter gertrude promises herself much pleasure in your society miss earl for uncles praises prepare her to expect a most charming companion she is about your age but i fear you will find great disparity in her attainments as she has not been so fortunate as to receive her education from uncle allan you are i believe an adopted daughter of mrs murray no madam only a resident in her house until my education is pronounced sufficiently advanced to justify my teaching i have a friend miss harding who has recently removed to le bocage and intends making it her home how is she quite well i believe mr hammond left the study for a moment and mrs powell added her friends at the north tell me that she is to marry her cousin mr murray very soon i had not heard the report then you think there are no grounds for the rumor indeed madam i know nothing whatever concerning the matter estelle is handsome and brilliant edna made no reply and after waiting a few seconds mrs powell asked does mr murray go much into society now i believe not is he as handsome as ever i do not know when you saw him last but the ladies here seem rather to dread than admire him mrs powell you are dipping your sleeve in your uncles inkstand she by no means ******** this catechism and resolved to end it picking up her books she said to mr hammond who now stood in the door i presume i need not wait as you will be too much occupied today to attend to my lessons yes i must give you holiday until monday miss earl may i trouble you to hand this letter to miss harding it was entrusted to my care by one of her friends in new york pray be so good as to deliver it with my kindest regards as edna left the house the pastor took his hat from the rack in the hall and walked silently beside her until she reached the gate mr hammond your niece is the most beautiful woman i have ever seen he sighed heavily and answered hesitatingly yes yes she is more beautiful now than when she first grew up how long has she been a widow not quite a year the troubled expression settled once more over his placid face and when edna bade him goodmorning and had walked some distance she happened to look back and saw him still leaning on the little gate under the drooping honeysuckle tendrils with his gray head bent down on his hand that mrs powell was in some way connected with mr murrays estrangement from the minister edna felt sure and the curiosity which the inquiries of the former had betrayed told her that she must be guarded in her intercourse with a woman who was an object of distrust even to her own uncle very often she had been tempted to ask mr hammond why mr murray so sedulously shunned him but the shadow which fell upon his countenance whenever st elmos name was accidentally mentioned made her shrink from alluding to the subject which he evidently avoided discussing before she had walked beyond the outskirts of the village mr leigh joined her and she felt the color rise in her cheeks as his fine eyes rested on her face and his hand pressed hers you must forgive me for telling you how bitterly i was disappointed in not seeing you two days ago why did you absent yourself from the table because i had no desire to meet mrs murrays guests and preferred to spend my time with mr hammond if he were not old enough to be your grandfather i believe i should be jealous of him edna do not be offended i am so anxious about ***** pained at the change in your appearance last sunday as you sat in church i noticed how very pale and worn you looked and with what weariness you leaned your head upon your hand mrs murray says you are very well but i know better you are either sick in body or mind which is it neither mr leigh i am quite well i assure you you are grieved about something which you are unwilling to confide to me edna it is keen pain that sometimes brings that quiver to your lips and if you would only tell me edna i know that i you conjure up a spectre i have nothing to confide and there is no trouble which you can relieve they walked on silently for a while and then gordon said i am going away day after tomorrow to be absent at least for several months and i have come to ask a favor which you are too generous to deny i want your ********* or photograph and i hope you will give it to me without hesitation i have never had a likeness of any kind taken there is a good artist here will you not go today and have one taken for me no mr leigh oh edna why not because i do not wish you to think of remembering me the sooner you forget me entirely save as a mere friend the happier we both shall be but that is impossible if you withhold your picture it will do no good for i have your face here in my heart and you cannot take that image from me at least i will not encourage feelings which can bring only pain to me and disappointment to yourself i consider it unprincipled and contemptible in a woman to foster or promote in any degree an affection which she knows she can never reciprocate if i had fifty photographs i would not give you one my dear friend let the past be forgotten it ******* me whenever i think of it and is a barrier to all pleasant friendly intercourse goodbye mr leigh you have my best wishes on your journey will you not allow me to see you home i think it is ***** prefer that you should not mr leigh promise me that you will struggle against this feeling which distresses me beyond expression she turned and put out her hand he shook his head mournfully and said as he left her god bless you it will be a dreary dreary season with me till i return and see your face again god preserve you till then walking rapidly homeward edna wondered why she could not return gordon leighs ************ his noble face never haunted her dreams instead of ********** which she dreaded to think looking ********** into the past few weeks she felt that long before she was aware of the fact an image to which she refused homage must have stood between her heart and gordons when she reached home she inquired for miss harding and was informed that she and mrs murray had gone visiting with mr allston had taken lunch and would not return until late in the afternoon hagar told her that mr murray had started at daylight to one of his plantations about twelve miles distant and would not be back in time for dinner and rejoiced at the prospect of a quiet day she determined to complete the chapter which she had left unfinished two night previous needing a reference in the book which mr murray had taken from the library she went up to copy it and as she sat down and opened the volume to find the passage she required a letter slipped out and fell at her feet she glanced at the envelope as she picked it up and her heart bounded painfully as she saw mr murrays name written in mr mannings peculiar and unmistakable chirography the ******** and date corresponded exactly with the one that she had received the night mr murray gave her the roll of ms and the strongest temptation of her life here assailed her she would almost have given her right hand to know the contents of that letter and mr murrays confident assertion concerning the package was now fully explained he had recognized the handwriting on her letters and suspected her ambitious scheme he was not a stranger to mr manning and must have known the nature of their correspondence consequently his taunt about a lover was entirely ******** she turned the unsealed envelope over and over longing to know what it contained the house was ************* was she knew no human being nearer than the kitchen and no eye but gods upon her she looked once more at the superscription of the letter sighed and put it back into the book without opening the envelope she copied into her notebook the reference she was seeking and replacing the volume on the windowsill where she had found it went back to her own room and tried to banish the subject of the letter from her mind after all it was not probable that mr murray had ever mentioned her name to his correspondent and as she had not alluded to le bocage or its inmates in writing to mr manning st elmos hints concerning her ms were merely based on conjecture she felt as if she would rather face any other disaster sooner than have him scoffing at her daring project and more annoyed and puzzled than she chose to confess she resolutely bent her thoughts upon her work it was almost dusk before mrs murray and her guests returned and when it grew so dark that edna could not see the lines of her paper she smoothed her hair changed her dress and went down to the parlor mrs murray was resting in a corner of the sofa fanning herself vigorously and mr allston smoked on the veranda and talked to her through the open window well edna where have you been all day with my books i am tired almost to death this country visiting is an intolerable bore i am worn out with small talk and ********** society nowadays is composed of ******************* more to be dreaded than the ********** only devour the body and leave the character of an individual intact child let us have some music by way of variety play that symphony of beethoven that i heard you practicing last week she laid her head on the arm of the sofa and shut her eyes and edna opened the piano and played the piece designated the delicacy of her touch enabled her to render it with peculiar pathos and power and she played on and on unmindful of miss ******** ***************** of everything but the sublime strains of the great master the light streamed over her face and showed a gladness an exaltation of expression there as if her soul had broken from its earthly moorings and was making its way joyfully into the infinite sea of eternal love and *********** at last her fingers fell from the keys and as she rose she saw mr murray standing outside of the parlor door with his fingers shading his eyes he came in soon after and his mother held out her hand saying here is a seat my son have you just returned no i have been here some time how are affairs at the plantation i really have no idea why i thought you went there today i started but found my horse so lame that i went no further than town indeed hagar told me you had not returned when i came in from visiting like some other people of my acquaintance hagar ******* without her host i have been at home ever since twelve oclock and saw the carriage as you drove off and pray how have you employed yourself you incorrigible ***** ****** o my cousin you are well named aunt ellen must have had an intuitive insight into your character when she had you christened st elmo only she should have added the fire how have you spent the day sir most serenely and charmingly my fair cousin in the solitude of my den if my mother could give me satisfactory security that all my days would prove as quiet and happy as this has been i would enter into bonds never to quit the confines of le bocage again ah the indescribable relief of feeling that nothing was expected of me that the galling ***** of hospitality and etiquette were snapped and that i was entirely free from all danger of intrusion this day shall be marked with a white stone for i entered my rooms at twelve oclock and remained there in uninterrupted peace till five minutes ago when i put on my social shackles once more and hobbled down to entertain my fair guest edna was arranging some sheets of music that were scattered on the piano but as he mentioned the hour of his return she remembered that the clock struck one just as she went into the sittingroom where he kept his books and cabinets and she knew now that he was at that very time in the inner room beyond the arch she put her hand to her forehead and endeavored to recollect the appearance of the apartment the silk curtains she was sure were hanging over the arch for she remembered distinctly having noticed a large and very beautiful golden butterfly which had fluttered in from the terrace and was flitting over the glowing folds that fell from the carved ******** to the marble floor but though screened from her view he must have heard and seen her as she sat before his bookcase turning his letter curiously between her fingers she dared not look up and bent down to examine the music so absorbed in her own emotions of chagrin and astonishment that she heard not one word of what miss harding was saying she felt well assured that if mr murray were cognizant of her visit to the egyptian museum he intended her to know it and she knew that his countenance would solve her painful doubt gathering up her courage she raised her eyes quickly in the direction of the sofa where he had thrown himself and met just what she most dreaded his keen gaze riveted on her face evidently he had been waiting for this eager startling questioning glance for instantly he smiled inclined his head slightly and arched his eyebrows as if much amused never before had she seen his face so bright and happy so free from bitterness if he had said yes i saw you are you not thoroughly discomfited and ashamed of your idle curiosity what interest can you possibly have in carefully studying the outside of my letters how do you propose to mend ********* could not have more fully conveyed his meaning ednas face crimsoned and she put up her hand to shield it but mr murray turned toward the window and coolly discussed the merits of a popular ********* upon which clinton allston lavished extravagant praise estelle leaned against the window listening to the controversy and after a time when the subject seemed very effectually settled by an oath from the master of the house edna availed herself of the lull in the conversation to deliver the letter miss harding i was requested to hand you this estelle broke the seal glanced rapidly over the letter and exclaimed is it possible can she be here who gave you this letter mrs powell mr hammonds niece agnes powell yes agnes powell during the next three minutes one might have distinctly heard a pin fall for the ticking of two watches was very audible estelle glanced first at her cousin then at her aunt then back at her cousin mrs murray involuntarily laid her hand on her sons knee and watched his face with an expression of breathless anxiety and edna saw that though his lips blanched not a muscle moved not a nerve twitched and only the deadly hate that appeared to leap into his large shadowy eyes told that the name stirred some bitter memory the silence was growing intolerable when mr murray turned his gaze full on estelle and said in his usual sarcastic tone have you seen a ghost your letter must contain tidings of victors untimely demise for if there is such a thing as retribution such a personage as nemesis i swear that poor devil of a count has crept into her garments and come to haunt you did he cut his white ******** throat with a penknife or smother himself with charcoal fumes or light a poisoned candle and let his poor ************ soul drift out dreamily into eternity if so gabriel will require a powerful ********** to find him notwithstanding the fact that you destined him for my cousin the little curly creature always impressed me as being a stray specimen of an otherwise extinct type of intellectual ************ is he really dead peace to his ********** soul who had the courage to write and break the melancholy tidings to you or perhaps after all it is only the ghost of your own conscience that has brought that scared look into your face she laughed and shrugged her shoulders how insanely jealous you are of victor hes neither dead nor dreaming of suicide but enjoying himself vastly in ********** edna did mrs powell bring gertrude with her yes do you know how long she intends remaining at the parsonage i think her visit is of indefinite duration edna will you oblige me by inquiring whether henry intends to give us any supper tonight he forgets we have had no dinner st elmo do turn down that ****** wind makes it ***** dreadfully edna left the room to obey mrs murrays command and did not return immediately but after the party seated themselves at the table she noticed that the master seemed in unusually high spirits and when the meal was concluded he challenged his cousins to a game of ********* they repaired to the rotunda and mrs murray beckoned to edna to follow her as they entered her apartment she carefully closed the door edna when did mrs powell arrive last night did you see her yes maam is she very pretty she is the most beautiful woman i ever met how did mr hammond receive her her visit evidently annoys him but he gave me no explanation of the matter which i confess ******* me i should suppose her society would cheer and interest him oh pooh talk of what you understand she surely has not come here to live i think he fears she has she is very poor mrs murray set her teeth together and muttered something which her companion did not understand edna is she handsomer than estelle infinitely handsomer i think indeed they are so totally unlike it would be impossible to compare them your niece is very finelooking very commanding mrs powell is beautiful but she is no longer young she has a grown daughter true but in looking at her you do not realize it did you never see her no and i trust i never may i am astonished that mr hammond can endure the sight of her you say he has told you nothing about her nothing which explains the chagrin her presence seems to cause he is very wise but edna avoid her society as much as possible she is doubtless very fascinating but i do not like what i have heard of her and prefer that you should have little conversation or intercourse with her on the whole you might as well stay at home now it is very warm and you can study without mr hammonds assistance you do not mean that my visits must cease altogether oh no go **************** or twice a ******* certainly not every day as formerly and edna be careful not to mention that womans name again i dislike her exceedingly the orphan longed to ask for an explanation but was too proud to ******* confidence so studiously withheld mrs murray leaned back in her large rockingchair and fell into a reverie edna waited patiently for some time and finally rose mrs murray have you anything more to say to me tonight you look very much fatigued nothing i believe goodnight child send hagar to me edna went back to her desk and resolutely turned to her work for it was one of the peculiar traits of her character that she could at will fasten her thoughts upon whatever subject she desired to master all irrelevant ideas were sternly banished until such season as she chose to give them audience and tonight she tore her mind from the events of the day and diligently toiled among the fragments of scandinavian lore for the missing links in her mythologic chain now and then peals of laughter from the ************ startled her and more than once mr murrays clear cold voice rose above the subdued chatter of estelle and clinton after a while the game ended ********** were exchanged the party dispersed doors were closed and all grew silent while edna wrote on an unexpected sound arrested her pen she listened and heard the slow walk of a horse beneath her window as it passed she rose and looked out the moon was up and mr murray was riding down the avenue the girl returned to her ms and worked on without ************ for another hour then the last paragraph was carefully ********** the long and difficult chapter was finished she laid aside her pen and locked her desk shaking down the mass of hair that had been tightly coiled at the back of her head she extinguished the light and drawing a chair to the window seated herself silence and peace brooded over the world not a sound broke the solemn repose of nature the summer breeze had rocked itself to rest in the elm boughs and only the waning moon seemed alive and toiling as it climbed slowly up a cloudless sky passing starry sentinels whose mighty challenge was lost in vast ******** of blue as they paced their ceaseless round in the mighty camp of constellations with her eyes fixed on the gloomy ******* ******* of elms where an occasional slip of moonshine silvered the ground edna watched and waited the blood beat heavily in her temples and throbbed sullenly at her heart but she sat mute and motionless as the summer night reviewing all that had occurred during the day presently the distant sound of hoofs on the rocky road leading to town fell upon her strained ear the hard quick gallop ceased at the gate and very slowly mr murray walked his horse up the dusky avenue and on toward the stable from the shadow of her muslin curtain edna looked down on the walk beneath and after a few moments saw him coming to the house he paused on the terrace took off his hat swept back the thick hair from his forehead and stood looking out over the quiet lawn then a heavy heavy sigh almost a moan seemed to burst from the depths of his heart and he turned and went into the house the night was far spent and the moon had cradled herself on the treetops when edna raised her face all blistered with tears stretching out her arms she fell on her knees while a passionate sobbing prayer struggled brokenly across her trembling lips o my god have mercy upon him save his wretched soul from eternal death help me so to live and govern myself that i bring no shame on the cause of christ and if it be thy will o my god grant that i may be instrumental in winning this precious but wandering sinful soul back to the faith as it is in jesus ah verily more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of wherefore let thy voice rise like a fountain for him night and day for what are men better than sheep or goats that ******* a blind life within the brain if knowing god they lift not hands of prayer both for themselves and those who call them friend where are you going st elmo i know it is one of your amiable decrees that your movements are not to be questioned but i dare to brave your ire i am going to that blessed retreat familiarly known as murrays den where secure from feminine intrusion as if in the cool cloisters of ************* i surrender my happy soul to science and cigars and revel in complete forgetfulness of that awful curse which jove hurled against all mankind because of *********** robbery there are asylums for ******** and ********** and i wonder it has never occurred to some

you vow you will not listen to science and i swear i wont read poetry suppose we compromise on this new number of themagazine it is the ablest periodical published in this country let me see the

mention of the magazine the latter looked up suddenly at the master of the house holding his cigar between his thumb and third finger his eye ran over the table of contents who smote the marble gods of greece humph rather a difficult question to answer after the lapse of twentytwo centuries but doubtless our ************** are so much wiser than the ******** senate of five hundred who investigated the affair the day after it happened that a perusal will be exceedingly edifying now then for a solution of this classic mystery of the ********* ********** which in my humble opinion only the brazen lips of minerva ********* could satisfactorily explain turning to the article he read it aloud without pausing to comment while ednas heart bounded so rapidly that she could scarcely conceal her agitation it was indeed a treat to listen to him and as his musical voice filled the room she thought of jean paul ******** description of goethes reading there is nothing comparable to it it is like ********* thunder blended with whispering ********* but the orphans pleasure was of short duration and as mr murray concluded the perusal he tossed the magazine contemptuously across the room and exclaimed pretentious and shallow a tissue of pedantry and error from beginning to ********** i will wager my head by some ********* who never saw athens moreover the whole article is based upon a glaring blunder for according to plutarch and ******** on the memorable night in question there was a new moon pshaw it is a ********* ******* ********** from ***** and if i am to be bored with such ************ ******* i will stop my subscription for some time i have noticed symptoms of deterioration but this is altogether intolerable and i shall write to manning that if he cannot do better it would be advisable for him to suspend at once before his magazine loses its reputation if i were not aware that his low estimate of female intellect ********* fully with my own i should be tempted to suppose that some silly but ambitious woman wrote that stuff which sounds learned and is simply stupid he did not even glance toward edna but the peculiar emphasis of his words left no doubt in her mind that he suspected nay felt assured that she was the luckless author raising her head which had been drooped over the woolen ****** she said firmly yet very quietly if you will permit me to differ

the ruffled plumes of my selflove in his sunny smiles and forget your growls good morning mr allston what happy accident brought you again so soon to le bocage and its disconsolate inmates edna picked up the magazine which lay in one corner and made her escape the gratification arising from the acceptance and prompt publication of her essay was marred by mr murrays sneering comments but still her heart was happier than it had been for many weeks and as she turned to the editors table and read a few lines ************* the article of a new contributor and promising another from the same pen for the ensuing month her face flushed joyfully while she felt it difficult to realize that her writings had found favor in mr mannings critical eyes she thanked god that she was considered worthy of communicating with her race through the medium of a magazine so influential and celebrated she thought it probable that mr manning had written her a few lines and wondered whether at that moment a letter was not hidden in st elmos pocket taking the magazine she went into mrs murrays room and found her resting on a lounge her face wore a troubled expression and edna saw traces of tears on the pillow come in child i was just thinking of you she put out her hand drew the girl to a seat near the lounge and sighed heavily dear mrs murray i am very very happy and i have come to make a confession and ask your congratulations she knelt down beside her and taking the white fingers of her benefactress pressed her forehead against them a confession edna what have you done mrs murray started up and lifted the blushing face some time ago you questioned me concerning some letters which excited your suspicion and which i promised to explain at some future day i dare say you will think me very presumptuous when i tell you that i have been aspiring to authorship that i was corresponding with mr manning on the subject of a ms which i had sent for his examination and now i have come to show you what i have been doing you heard mr murray read an essay this morning from themagazine which he ridiculed very bitterly but which mr manning at least thought worthy of a place in his pages mrs murray i wrote that article is it possible who assisted ****** revised it mr hammond i did not suppose that you my child could ever write so elegantly so gracefully no one saw the ms until mr manning gave it to the printers i wished to surprise mr hammond and therefore told him nothing of my ambitious scheme i was very apprehensive that i should fail and for that reason was unwilling to acquaint you with the precise subject of the correspondence until i was sure of success oh mrs murray i have no mother and feeling that i owe everything to ******* without your generous aid and protection i should never have been able to accomplish this one hope of my life i come to you to share my triumph for i know you will fully sympathize with me here is the magazine containing mr mannings praise of my work and here are the letters which i was once so reluctant to put into your hands when i asked you to trust me you did so nobly and freely and thanking you more than my feeble words can express i want to show you that i was not unworthy of your confidence she laid magazine and letters on mrs murrays lap and in silence the proud reserved woman wound her arms tightly around the orphan pressing the bright young face against her shoulder and resting her own cheek on the girls fair forehead the door was partly ajar and at that instant st elmo entered he stopped looked at the kneeling figure locked so closely in his mothers arms and over his stern face broke a light that transformed it into such beauty as ******** might have worn before his sin and banishment when god ************* said as gabriel *********** as michael while serene he standing in the glory of the lamps answered my father innocent of shame and of the sense of thunder ********** he extended his arms toward the two who absorbed in their low talk were unconscious of his presence then the hands fell heavily to his side the brief smile was swallowed up by scowling shadows and he turned silently away and went to his own gloomy rooms mrs powell and her daughter to see miss estelle and miss edna why did you not say we were at dinner cried mrs murray impatiently darting an angry glance at the servant i did maam but they said they would wait as estelle folded up her ****** and slipped it into the silver ring she looked ********* at st elmo who holding up a bunch of purple grapes said in an indifferent tone to his mother the vineyards of ******** show nothing more perfect this cluster might challenge comparison with those from which red hermitage is made and the seeds of which are said to have been brought from ******* even on the sunny slopes of cyprus and ***** i found no finer grapes than these a ****** i want a basketful this afternoon henry tell old simon to gather them immediately pray what use have you for them i am sure the courteous idea of sending them as a present never could have forced an entrance into your mind much less have carried the outworks of your heart as his cousin spoke she came to the back of his chair and leaned over his shoulder i shall go out on the terrace and renew the obsolete ******** shouting **** ******* i shall crown and **** my marble ******* yonder with the grapes till his dainty sculptured limbs are bathed in their purple sacrificial blood what other use could i possibly have for them he threw his head back and added something in a lower tone at which estelle laughed and put up her red full lip mrs murray frowned and said sternly if you intend to see those persons i advise you to do so promptly her niece moved toward the door but glanced over her shoulder i presume gertrude expects to see edna as she asked for her the orphan had been watching mr murrays face but could detect no alteration in its expression save a brief gleam as of triumph when the visitors were announced rising she approached mrs murray whose clouded brow betokened more than ordinary displeasure and whispered gertrude is exceedingly anxious to see the house and grounds have i your permission to show her over the place she is particularly anxious to see the deer of course if she requests it but their effrontery in coming here caps the climax of all the impudence i ever heard of have as little to say as possible edna went to the parlor leaving mother and son together mrs powell had laid aside her mourning garments and wore a dress of blue muslin which heightened her beauty and as the orphan looked from her to gertrude she found it difficult to decide who was the loveliest after a few desultory remarks she rose saying as you have repeatedly expressed a desire to examine the park and ********* i will show you the way this afternoon take care my love that you do not fatigue yourself were mrs ******* low tenderly spoken words as her daughter rose to leave the room edna went first to the greenhouse and though her companion chattered ceaselessly she took little interest in her exclamations of delight and was ************ the probable cause of mrs murrays great indignation for some weeks she had been thrown frequently into the society of mr hammonds guests and while her distrust of mrs powell her aversion to her melting musical voice increased at every interview a genuine affection for gertrude had taken root in her heart they were the same age but one was an earnest women the other a fragile careless gleeful enthusiastic child although the orphan found it impossible to make a companion of this beautiful warmhearted girl who hated books and turned pale at the mention of study still edna liked to watch the lovely radiant face with its cheeks tinted like ********* its soft childish blue eyes sparkling with ********** and she began to caress and to love her as she would have petted a canary or one of the spotted ***** ********* over the lawn as they stood hand in hand admiring some ******** in a small ******** in the centre of the greenhouse gertrude exclaimed the place is as fascinating as its master do tell me something about him i wonder very often why you never mention him i know i ought not to say it but really after he has talked to me for a few minutes i forget every thing else and think only of what he says for days and days after you certainly do not allude to mr murray said edna i certainly do what makes you look so astonished i was not aware that you knew him oh i have known him since the week after our arrival here mamma and i met him at mrs inges mr inge had some gentlemen to dinner and they came into the parlor while we were calling mr murray sat down and talked to me then for some time and i have frequently met him since for it seems he loves to stroll about the woods almost as well as i do and sometimes we walk together you know he and my uncle are not friendly and i believe mamma does not like him so he never comes to the parsonage and never seems to see me if i am with her or uncle allan but is he not very fascinating if he were not a little too old for me i believe i should really be very much in love with him an expression of disgust passed swiftly over ednas pale face she dropped her companions hand and asked coldly does your mother approve of your walks with mr murray for heavens sake dont look so solemn ********** i dont know i never told her a word about it once i mentioned having met him and showed her some flowers he gave me and she took very little notice of the matter several times since he has sent me bouquets and though i kept them out of uncles sight she saw them in my room and must have suspected where they came from of course he can not come to the parsonage to see me when he does not speak to my uncle or to mamma but i do not see any harm in his walking and talking with me when i happen to meet him oh how lovely those lilies are leaning over the edge of the ******** mr murray said that some day he would show me all the beautiful things at le bocage but he has forgotten his promise i am afraid and i ah miss gertrude how could you doubt me i am here to fulfill my promise he pushed aside the boughs of a ***** which stood between them and coming forward took gertrudes hand drew it under his arm and looked down eagerly admiringly into her blushing face oh mr murray i had no idea you were anywhere near me i am sure i could did you imagine you could escape my eyes which are always seeking you permit me to be your ******** over le bocage instead of miss edna here who looks as if she had been scolding you perhaps she will be so good as to wait for us and i will bring you back in a halfhour at least edna will you wait here for me asked gertrude why can not mr murray bring you to the house there is nothing more to see here allow us to judge for ourselves if you please there is a late paris paper which will amuse you till we return st elmo threw a newspaper at her feet and led gertrude away through one of the glass doors into the park edna sat down on the edge of the ******** and the hungry little fish crowded close to her looking up wistfully for the crumbs she was wont to scatter there daily but now their mute appeal was unheeded her colorless face and clasped hands grew cold as the marble basin on which they rested and the great hopeless agony that seized her heart came to her large eyes and looked out drearily it was in vain that she said to herself st elmo murray is nothing to me why should i care if he loves gertrude she is so beautiful and confiding and winning of course if he knows her well he must love her it is no business of mine we are not even friends we are worse than strangers and it can not concern me whom he loves or whom he hates her own heart laughed her words to scorn and answered defiantly he is my king my king i have crowned and ******** him and right royally he rules in pitiable humiliation she acknowledged that she had found it impossible to tear her thoughts from him that his dark face *************** her sleeping and waking while she shrank from his presence and dreaded his character she could not witness his fond manner to gertrude without a pang of the keenest pain she had ever endured the suddenness of the discovery shocked her into a thorough understanding of her own feelings the grinning fiend of jealousy had swept aside the flimsy veil which she had never before fully lifted and looking sorrowfully down into the bared holy of ****** she saw standing between the hovering wings of golden ******** an idol of clay demanding homage daring the wrath of conscience the high priest she saw all now and saw too at the same instant whither her line of duty led the atmosphere was sultry but she shivered and if a mirror could have been held before her eyes she would have started back from the gray stony face so unlike hers it seemed so strange that the heart of the accomplished ************** man of letters and science who had ransacked the world for information and *************** surrender itself to the ******* of a pretty young thing who could sympathize in no degree with his pursuits and was as utterly incapable of understanding his nature as his tartar horse or his pet ********** she had often heard mrs murray say if there is one thing more uncertain even than the verdict of a ****** there is one thing which is known neither in heaven earth or hell and which angels and demons alike waste time in guessing **** is what style of woman any man will fancy and select for his wife it is utterly impossible to predict what matrimonial caprice may or may not seize even the wisest most experienced most practical and reasonable of men and i would sooner undertake to conjecture how high the thermometer stands at this instant on the crest of mount ********** up yonder in the moon than attempt to guess what freak will decide a mans choice of a bride sternly edna faced the future and pictured gertrude as mr murrays wife for if he loved her and did not his eyes declare it of course he would sweep every objection every obstacle to the winds and marry her speedily she tried to think of himthe cold harsh ********* the fond husband of that laughing child and though the vision was indescribably painful she forced herself to dwell upon it the idea that he would ever love any one or anything had never until this hour occurred to her and while she could neither tolerate his opinions or respect his character she found herself smitten with a great voiceless anguish at the thought of his giving his sinful bitter heart to any woman why did she love him curious fool be still is human love the growth of human will pressing her hand to her eyes she murmured gertrude is right he is fascinating but it is the fascination of a tempting demon ah if i had never come here if i had never been cursed with the sight of his face but i am no weak silly child like gertrude powell i know what my duty is and i am strong enough to conquer and if necessary to crush my foolish heart oh i know you mr murray and i can defy you today shortsighted as i have been i look down on you you are beneath me and the time will come when i shall look back to this hour and wonder if i were temporarily ********* or insane wake up wake up come to your senses edna earl put an end to this sinful folly blush for your unwomanly weakness as gertrudes merry laugh floated up through the trees the orphan lifted her head and the blood came back to her cheeks while she watched the two figures sauntering across the smooth lawn gertrude leaned on mr murrays arm and as he talked to her his head was bent down so that he could see the flushed face shaded by her straw hat she drew her hand from his arm when they reached the greenhouse and looking much embarrassed said hurriedly i am afraid i have kept you waiting an ************** time but mr murray had so many beautiful things to show me that i quite forgot we had left you here alone i dare say your mother thinks i have run away with you and as i have an engagement i must either bid you goodbye and leave you here with mr murray or go back at once with you to the house the orphans voice was firm and quiet and as she handed the french paper to st elmo she turned her eyes full on his face have you read it already he asked giving her one of his steely ******* glances no sir i did not open it as i take little interest in continental politics gertrude will you go or stay mr murray put out his hand took gertrudes and said goodbye till tomorrow do not forget your promise turning away he went in the direction of the stables in silence edna walked on to the house and presently gertrudes soft fingers grasped hers edna i hope you are not mad with me do you really think it is wrong for me to talk to mr murray and to like him so much gertrude you must judge for yourself concerning the propriety of your conduct i shall not presume to advise you but the fact that you are unwilling to acquaint your mother with your course ought to make you look closely at your own heart when a girl is afraid to trust her mother i should think there were grounds for uneasiness they had reached the steps and mrs powell came out to meet them where have you two ******** been i have waited a half hour for you estelle do come and see me it is very dreary at the parsonage and your visits are cheering and precious come gertrude when gertrude kissed her friend she whispered dont be mad with me dearie i will remember what you said and talk to mamma this very evening edna saw mother and daughter descend the long avenue and then running up to her room she tied on her hat and walked rapidly across the park in an opposite direction about a mile and a half from le bocage on a winding and unfrequented road leading to a ******* stood a small ******** containing only two rooms the yard was neglected full of rank weeds and the gate was falling from its rusty hinges edna walked up the decaying steps and without pausing to knock entered one of the ****************** rooms on a cot in one corner lay an elderly man in the last stage of consumption and by his side busily engaged in knitting sat a child about ten years old whose pretty white face wore that touching look of patient placidity peculiar to the blind huldah reed had never seen the light but a marvellous change came over her countenance when ednas light step and clear sweet voice fell on her ear huldah how is your father today not as well as he was yesterday but he is asleep now and will be better when he wakes has the doctor been here today no he has not been here since sunday edna stood for a while watching the labored breathing of the sleeper and putting her hand on huldahs head she whispered do you want me to read to you this evening it is late but i shall have time for a short chapter oh please do if it is only a few lines it will not wake him the child rose spread out her hands and groped her way across the room to a small table whence she took an old bible the two sat down together by the western window and edna asked is there any particular chapter you would like to hear please read about blind ********* sitting by the roadside waiting for jesus edna turned to the verses and read in a subdued tone for some moments in her eager interest huldah slid down on her knees rested her thin hands on her companions lap and raised her sweet face with its wide vacant sad hazel eyes when edna read the twentyfourth verse of the next chapter the small hands were laid upon the page to arrest her attention edna do you believe that what things ****** you desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them jesus said that and if i pray that my eyes may be opened do you believe i shall see they tell me ******** pa will not live oh do you think if i pray day and night and if i believe and oh i do believe i will believe do you think jesus will let me see ***** ************ he dies if i could only see his dear face once i would be willing to be blind afterward all my life i have felt his face and i knew it by my fingers but oh i cant feel it in the grave i have been praying so hard ever since the doctor said he must die praying that jesus would have mercy on me and let me see him just once last night i dreamed christ came and put his hands on my eyes and said to me too thy faith hath made thee whole and i waked up crying and my own fingers were pulling my eyes open but it was all dark dark edna wont you help me pray and do you believe i shall see him edna took the quivering face in her soft palms and tenderly kissed the lips several times my dear huldah you know the days of miracles are over and jesus is not walking in the world now to cure the suffering and the blind and the dumb but he is sitting close to the throne of god and he could send some angel down to touch my eyes and let me see my dear dear pa ****** just once oh he is the same jesus now as when he felt sorry for ********* and why wont he pity me too i pray and believe and that is what he said i must do i think that the promise relates to spiritual things and means that when we pray for strength to resist temptation and sin jesus sends the holy spirit to assist all who earnestly strive to do their duty but dear huldah one thing is very certain even if you are blind in this world there will come a day when god will open your eyes and you shall see those you love face to face for there shall be no night there in that city of ****** need of sun or moon for the lamb is the light thereof ************** the child glided swiftly to the cot and looking round edna doubted the evidence of her senses for by the side of the sufferer stood a figure so like mr murray that her heart began to throb painfully the corner of the room was dim and shadowy but a strong deep voice soon dispelled all doubt i hope you are better today reed here are some grapes which will refresh you and you can eat them as freely as your appetite prompts mr murray placed a luscious cluster in the emaciated hands and put the basket down on the floor near the cot as he drew a chair from the wall and seated himself edna crossed the room stealthily and laying her hand on huldahs shoulder led her out to the front steps huldah has mr murray ever been here before oh ******** and often but he generally comes later than this he brings all the wine poor pa drinks and very often peaches and grapes oh he is so good to us i love to hear him come up the steps and many a time when pa is asleep i sit here at night listening for the gallop of mr murrays horse somehow i feel so safe as if nothing could go wrong when he is in the house why did you never tell me this before why have you not spoken of him because he charged me not to speak to any one about ****** he did not choose to have it known that he ever came here there pa is calling me wont you come in and speak to him not this evening goodbye i will come again soon edna stooped kissed the child hastily and walked away she had only reached the gate where tamerlane was fastened when mr murray came out of the house edna reluctantly she stopped and waited for him are you not afraid to walk home alone no sir i am out frequently even later than this it is not exactly prudent for you to go home now alone for it will be quite dark before you can possibly reach the park gate he passed his horses reins over his arm and led him along the road i am not going that way sir there is a path through the woods that is much shorter than the road and i can get through an opening in the orchard fence good evening she turned abruptly from the beaten road but he caught her dress and detained her i told you some time ago that i never permitted espionage in my affairs and now with reference to what occurred at the greenhouse i advise you to keep silent do you understand me in the first place sir i could not condescend to play spy on the actions of any one and in the second you may rest assured i shall not trouble myself to comment upon your affairs in which i certainly have no interest your estimate of me must be contemptible indeed if you imagine that i can only employ myself in watching your career dismiss your apprehensions and rest in the assurance that i consider it no business of mine where you go or what you may choose to do my only desire is to shield my pretty gertrudes head from the wrath that may be bottled up for her edna looked up fixedly into the deep glittering eyes that watched hers and answered quietly mr murray if you love her half as well as i do you will be more careful in the future not to subject her to the opening of the ***** of wrath he laughed contemptuously and exclaimed you are doubtless experienced in such matters and fully competent to advise me no sir it does not concern me and i presume neither to criticise nor to advise please be so good as to detain me no longer and believe me when i repeat that i have no intention whatever of meddling with any of your affairs or reporting your actions putting his hands suddenly on her shoulders he stooped looked keenly at her and she heard him mutter an oath when he spoke again it was through set teeth you will be wise if you adhere to that decision tell them at home not to wait supper for me he sprang into his saddle and rode toward the village and edna hurried homeward asking herself what first took mr murray to the blacksmiths ***** why is he so anxious that his visits should remain undiscovered after all is there some latent nobility in his character is he so much better or worse than i have thought him perhaps his love for gertrude has softened his heart perhaps that love may be his salvation god grant it god grant it the evening breeze rose and sang solemnly through the pine trees but to her it seemed only to chant the melancholy refrain my pretty gertrude my pretty gertrude the chill light of stars fell on the orphans pathway and over her pale features where dwelt the reflection of a *********** silent desolation such as she had never realized even when her grandfather was snatched from her clinging arms she passed through the orchard startling a covey of partridges that nestled in the long grass and a rabbit that had stolen out under cover of dusk and when she came to the fountain she paused and looked out over the dark quiet grounds hitherto duty had worn a smiling loving countenance and walked gently by her side as she crossed the flowery vales of girlhood now the guide was transformed into an angel of wrath pointing with drawn sword to the gate of eden as the girls light fingers locked themselves tightly her beautiful lips uttered mournfully what hast thou done o soul of mine that thou ********* so hast thou wrought his task and kept the line he bade thee go ah the cloud is dark and day by day i am moving thither i must pass beneath it on my way god pity me whither when mrs murray went to her own room later than usual that night she found edna sitting by the table with her bible lying open on her lap and her eyes fixed on the floor i thought you were fast asleep before this i sat up waiting for st elmo as i wished to speak to him about some engagements for tomorrow the lady of the house threw herself wearily upon the lounge and sighed as she ********* her bracelets and took off the diamond cross that fastened her collar edna ring for hagar will you not let me take her place tonight i want to talk to you before i go to sleep well then ****** my ******* and take down my hair child what makes you look so very serious because what i am about to say ******* me very much my dear mrs murray i have been in this house five peaceful happy blessed years i have become warmly attached to everything about the home where i have been so kindly sheltered during my girlhood and the thought of leaving it is exceedingly painful to me what do you mean edna have you come to your senses at last and consented to make gordon happy no no i am going to new york to try to make my bread you are going to a lunatic asylum stuff nonsense what can you do in new york it is already *********** with poor men and women who are on the verge of starvation pooh pooh you look like making your bread dont be silly i know that i am competent now to take a situation as teacher in a school or family and i am determined to make the experiment immediately i want to go to new york because i can command advantages there which no poor girl can obtain in any southern city and the magazine for which i expect to write is published there mr manning says he will pay me liberally for such articles as he accepts and if i can only get a situation which i hear is now vacant i can easily support myself mrs powell received a letter yesterday from a wealthy friend in new york who desires to secure a governess for her young children one of whom is deformed she said she was excessively particular as to the character of the woman to whose care she committed her crippled boy and that she had advertised for one who could teach him greek i shall ask mrs powell and mr hammond to telegraph to her tomorrow and request her not to engage any one till a letter can reach her from mr hammond and myself i believe he knows the lady who is very ********* related to mrs powell still before i took this step i felt that i owed it to you to acquaint you with my intention it is a step which i cannot sanction i detest that mrs ******* utterly ****** the sound of her name and i should be altogether unwilling to see you ************ with any of her friends i am surprised that mr hammond could encourage any such foolish scheme on your part as yet he is entirely ignorant of my plan for i have mentioned it to no one except yourself but i do not think he will oppose it dear mrs murray much as i love you i cannot remain here any longer for i could not continue to owe my bread even to your kind and tender charity you have educated me and only god knows how inexpressibly grateful i am for all your goodness but now i could no longer preserve my selfrespect or be happy as a dependent on your bounty she had taken mrs murrays hand and while tears gathered in her eyes she kissed the fingers and pressed them against her cheek if you are too proud to remain here as you have done for so many years how do you suppose you can endure the ************ and ******** which will certainly be your portion when you accept a ********* position in the family of a stranger dont you know that of all drudgery that required of *********** is most fraught with vexation and bitterness of spirit i have never treated you as an upper servant but loved you and shielded you from slights and insults as if you were my niece or my daughter edna you could not endure the lot you have selected your proud sensitive nature would be galled to desperation stay here and help me keep house write and study as much as you like and do as you please only dont leave me she drew the girl to her bosom and while she kissed her tears fell on the pale face oh mrs murray it is hard to leave you for indeed i love you more than you will ever believe or realize but i must go i feel it is my duty and you would not wish me to stay here and be unhappy unhappy here why so something is wrong and i must know just what it is somebody has been **************** you edna i ask a plain question and i want the whole truth you and estelle do not like each other is her presence here the cause of your determination to quit my house no mrs murray if she were not here i should still feel it my duty to go out and earn my living you are correct in saying we do not particularly like each other there is little sympathy between us but no bad feeling that i am aware of and she is not the cause of my departure mrs murray was silent a moment scrutinizing the face on her shoulder edna can it be my son has some harsh speech of st elmos piqued and wounded you oh no his manner toward me is quite as polite nay rather more considerate than when i first came here beside you know we are almost strangers sometimes weeks elapse without our exchanging a word are you sure you have not had a quarrel with him i know you dislike him i know how exceedingly provoking he frequently is but child he is unfortunately constituted he is bitterly rude to everybody and does not mean to wound you particularly i have no complaint to make of mr murrays manner to me i do not expect or desire that it should be other than it is why do you doubt the sincerity of the reason i gave for quitting dear old bocage i have never expected to live here longer than was necessary to ******* myself for the work i have chosen i doubt it because it is so incomprehensible that a young girl who might be gordon leighs happy wife and mistress of his elegant home surrounded by every luxury and idolized by one of the noblest handsomest men i ever knew should prefer to go among strangers and toil for a scanty livelihood now i know something of human nature and i know that your course is very singular very unnatural edna my child my dear little girl i cant let you go i want you i cant spare you i find i love you too well my sweet comforter in all my troubles my only real companion she clasped the orphan closer and wept oh you dont know how precious your love is to my heart dear dear mrs murray in all this wide world whom have i to love me but you and mr hammond even in the great sorrow of leaving you it will gladden me to feel that i possess so fully your confidence and affection but i must go away and after a little while you will not miss me for estelle will be with you and you will not need me oh it is hard to leave you it is a bitter trial but i know what my duty is and were it even more difficult i would not hesitate i hope you will not think me unduly obstinate when i tell you that i have fully determined to apply for that situation in new york mrs murray pushed the girl from her and with a sob buried her face in her arms edna waited in vain for her to speak and finally she stooped and kissed one of the hands and said brokenly as she left the room *********** ********* best friend if you could only look into my heart and see how it aches at the thought of separation you would not add the pain of your displeasure to that which i already suffer when the orphan opened her eyes on the following morning she found a note pinned to her pillow my dear edna i could not sleep last night in consequence of your unfortunate resolution and i write to beg you for my sake if not for your own to reconsider the matter i will gladly pay you the same salary that you expect to receive as governess if you will remain as my companion and assist at le bocage i cannot consent to give you up i love you too well my child to see you quit my house i shall soon be an old woman and then what should i do without my little orphan girl stay with me always and you shall never know what want and toil and hardship mean as soon as you are awake come and kiss me goodmorning and i shall know that you are my own dear little edna affectionately yours ellen murray edna knelt and prayed for strength to do what she felt duty sternly dictated but though her will did not falter her heart bled as she wrote a few lines thanking her benefactress for the affection that had brightened and warmed her whole lonely life and assuring her that the reasons which induced her to leave le bocage were imperative and unanswerable an hour later she entered the breakfastroom and found the members of the family already assembled while mrs murray was cold and haughty taking no notice of ednas salutation estelle talked gayly with mr allston concerning a horseback ride they intended to take that morning and mr murray leaning back in his chair seemed engrossed in the columns of the london times which contained a recent speech of ********** presently he threw down the paper looked at his watch and ordered his horse st elmo where are you going do allow yourself to be prevailed upon to wait and ride with us estelles tone was musical and coaxing as she approached her cousin and put one of her fingers through

scottish ********** while i have an engagement that forces me most reluctantly and respectfully to decline the honor of ************ you confound these matches they are all damp involuntarily mrs murrays eyes turned to edna who had not even glanced at st elmo since her entrance now she looked up and though she had not read pennant she remembered the lines written on the old ******* well by an american poet yielding to some inexplicable impulse she slowly and gently repeated two verses oh restless heart and fevered brain ******* and ******** that holy well of loch ***** is more than idle

trembled when he stroked her bowed head i dread the separation from you and mrs murray but i know i ought to go and i feel that when duty commands me to follow a path lonely and dreary though it may seem a light will be shed before my feet and a staff will be put into my hands i have often wondered what the ********* intended to ********* in their *** ******** before whose awful decrees all other

hang it upon my walls in the great city whither i am going and when my weary days of work ended i could sit down before it and fold my tired hands and look at it through the mist of tears till its

not ****** ***** cross of the legion of honor yesterday when i read the description of the visit of the empress to the studio i think i was almost as proud and happy as that patient worker at the

that badge of immortality on womanly ********** crowned head crowning the queen of artists i wonder if when obscure and in disguise she haunted the ******** du ***** and worked on amid the lowing and bleating of the ******** wonder if faith prophesied of that distant day of glorious recompense when the ribbon of the legion fluttered from ******** white fingers and she was exalted above all thrones ah mr hammond we all wear our crosses but they do not belong to the order of the legion of honor the minister enclosed in his own the hand which she had laid on his knee and said gently but gravely my child your ambition is your ********* sin it is satan pointing to the tree of knowledge tempting you to eat and become as gods search your heart and i fear you will find that while you believe you are dedicating your talent entirely to the service of god there is a spring of selfishness underlying all you are too proud too ambitious of distinction too eager to climb to some lofty niche in the temple of fame where your name now unknown shall shine in the annals of literature and serve as a beacon to encourage others equally as anxious for celebrity i was not surprised to see you in print for long long ago before you realized the extent of your mental ***** i saw the kindling of that ambitious spark whose flame generally ******** the women in whose hearts it burns the history of

over their weary haggard faces you may answer they made their bread ah child it would have been sweeter if earned at the ******* or in the dairy or by their needles it is the rough handling the jars the tension of the heartstrings that *** the foundations of a womans life and consign her to an early grave and a cherokee ********* is not more thickly set with thorns than a literary career with

your eager aspirations if i could be always near you i should indulge less apprehension for your future for i believe that i could help you to bear patiently whatever is in store for you but far away among strangers you must struggle alone mr hammond i do not rely upon myself my hope is in god my child the days of miraculous inspiration are ended ah do not discourage me when the bishop of ***** hesitated to consecrate st ******** she said to him thou wilt have to render thy account and the shepherd will require of thee the souls of his sheep my dear sir your approbation is the consecration that i desire upon my purpose god will not forsake me he will strengthen and guide me and bless my writing even as he blesses your preaching because he gave you five talents and to me only one do you think that in the great day of reckoning mine will not be required of me i do not expect to enter into the joy of my lord as you will be worthy to do but with the blessing of god i trust the doom of the altogether unprofitable servant will not be pronounced against me she had bowed her head till it rested on his knee and presently the old man put his hands upon the glossy hair and murmured solemnly and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your heart and mind through christ jesus a brief silence reigned in the study broken first by the shout of the ********* and the rippling laugh of the children in the adjacent field and then by the calm voice of the pastor i have offered you a home with me as long as i have a roof that i can call my own but you prefer to go to new york and henceforth i shall never cease to pray that your resolution may prove fortunate in all respects you no longer require my direction in your studies but i will suggest that it might be expedient for you to give more attention to positive and less to abstract science remember those noble words of sir david brewster to which i believe i have already called your attention if the god of love is most appropriately worshipped in the christian temple the god of nature may be equally honored in the temple of science even from its lofty minarets the philosopher may summon the faithful to prayer and the priest and the sage may exchange altars without the compromise of faith or of knowledge ********** has shifted the battlefield from metaphysics to ******* from ******** and *********** to ********** or rank materialism and in order to combat it successfully in order to build up an imperishable system of christian ********* it is necessary that you should thoroughly acquaint yourself with the natural sciences with ******** and all the socalled inherent forces of nature or what humboldt terms ********** necessity this ********** of dirt by such men as ********** ******* and ***** is the real ******* which though continually overthrown springs from mother earth with renewed vigor and after a little while some hercules of science will lift the ******* in his inexorable arms and crush him here mrs powell entered the room and edna rose and tied on her hat mr hammond will you go over to see huldah this afternoon poor little thing she is in great distress about her father i fear he cannot live many days i went to see him yesterday morning and would go again with you now but have promised to ******* two children this evening edna was opening the gate when gertrude called to her from a shaded corner of the yard and turning she saw her playing with a fawn about whose neck she had twined a long spray of honeysuckle do come and see the beautiful present mr murray sent me several days ago it is as gentle and playful as a kitten and seems to know me already gertrude patted the head of her pretty pet and continued i have often read about ******** eyes and i wonder if these are not quite as lovely very often when i look at them they remind me of yours there is such a soft sad patient expression as if she knew perfectly well that some day the hunters would be sure to catch and kill her and she was meekly ****** her time to be turned into venison steak i never will eat another piece the dear little thing edna do you know that you have the most beautiful eyes in the world except mr murrays his glitter like great stars under long long black silk fringe by the way how is he i have not seen him for some days and you can have no idea how i do want to look into his face and hear his voice which is so wonderfully sweet and low i wrote him a note thanking him for this little spotted darling but he has not answered ***** not come near me and i was afraid he might be sick gertrude stole one arm around her companions neck and nestled her golden head against the orphans shoulder mr murray is very well at least appears so i saw him at breakfast does he ever talk about me no i never heard him mention your name but once and then it occurred incidentally oh edna is it wrong for me to think about him so constantly dont press your lips together in that stern hard way dearie put your arms around me and kiss me oh if you could know how very much i love him how happy i am when he is with me edna how can i help it when he touches my hand and smiles down at me i forget everything else i feel as if i would follow him to the end of the earth he is a great deal older than i am but how can i remember that when he is looking at me with those wonderful eyes the last time i saw him he ******** something very sweet and i was sure he loved me and i leaned my head against his shoulder but he would not let me touch him he pushed me away with a terrific frown that wrinkled and blackened his face oh it seems an age since then edna kissed the lovely coral lips and smoothed the bright curls that the wind had blown about the exquisitely moulded cheeks gertrude when he asks you to love him you will have a right to indulge your affection but until then you ought not to allow him to know your feelings or permit yourself to think so entirely of him but do you believe it is wrong for me to love him so much that is a question which your own heart must answer edna felt that her own lips were growing cold and she disengaged the girls clasping arms edna i know you love me will you do something for me please give him this note i am afraid that he did not receive the other or that he is offended with me she drew a dainty ************* envelope from her pocket no gertrude i can be a party to no clandestine correspondence i have too much respect for your uncle to assist in ********* letters in and out of his house beside your mother would not sanction the course you are pursuing oh i showed her the other note and she only laughed and patted my cheek and said why ******** he is old enough to be your father this note is only to find out whether he received the other i sent it by the servant who brought this ****** dear me just see what a hole the pretty little wretch has nibbled in my new swiss muslin dress wont mamma scold there do go away pet i will feed you presently indeed edna there is no harm in your taking the note for i give you my word mamma does not care do you think i would tell you a story please edna it will reach him so much sooner if you carry it over than if i were to drop it into the postoffice where it may stay for a week and uncle allan has no extra servants to run around on errands for me gertrude are you not deceiving me are you sure your mother read the other note and sanctions this certainly you may ask her if you doubt me there i must hurry in mamma is calling me dear edna if you love me yes mamma i am coming edna could not resist the pleading of the lovely face pressed close to hers and with a sigh she took the tiny note and turned away more than a week had elapsed since mr hammond and mrs powell had written recommending her for the situation in mrs andrewss ****** and with feverish impatience she awaited the result during this interval she had not exchanged a word with mr ********* spent much of her time in writing down in her notebook such ********** from the library as she required in her ms and while estelle seemed unusually highspirited mrs murray watched in silence the orphans preparations for departure absorbed in very painful reflections the girl walked on rapidly till she reached the cheerless home of the blacksmith and knocked at the door come in mr murray edna pushed open the door and walked in it is not mr murray this time oh edna i am so glad you happened to come he would not let me tell you he said he did not wish it known but now you are here you will stay with me wont you till it is over huldah was kneeling at the side of her fathers cot and edna was startled by the look of eager breathless anxiety printed on her white trembling face what does she mean mr reed poor little lamb she is so excited she can hardly speak and i am not strong enough to talk much huldah daughter tell miss edna all about it mr murray heard all i said to you about praying to have my eyes opened and he went to town that same evening and telegraphed to some doctor in philadelphia who cures blindness to come on and see if he could do anything for my eyes mr murray was here this morning and said he had heard from the doctor and that he would come this afternoon he said he could only stay till the cars left for chattanooga as he must go back at once you know ****** there there i hear the carriage now oh edna pray for me pa pray for my poor eyes the sweet childish face was colorless and tears filled the filmy hazel eyes as huldah clasped her hands her lips moved rapidly though no sound was audible edna stepped behind the door and peeped through a crack in the planks mr murray entered first and beckoned to the stranger who paused at the threshold with a case of instruments in his hand come in hugh here is your patient very much frightened too i am afraid huldah come to the light he drew her to the window lifted her to a chair and the doctor bent down pushed back his spectacles and cautiously examined the childs eyes dont tremble so huldah there is nothing to be afraid of the doctor will not hurt you oh it is not that i fear to be hurt edna are you praying for me edna is not here answered mr murray glancing round the room yes she is here i did not tell her but she happened to come a little while ago edna wont you hold one of my hands oh edna edna reluctantly the orphan came forward and without lifting her eyes took one of the little outstretched hands firmly in both her own while mr murray silently appropriated the other huldah whispered please both of you pray for me the doctor raised the eyelids several times peered long and curiously at the ******** and opened his case of instruments this is one of those instances of ********** cataract which might have been relieved long ago a slight operation will remove the difficulty st elmo you asked me about the probability of an instantaneous restoration and i had begun to tell you about that case which ******* mentions of a woman blind from her birth till she was fortysix years of age she could not distinguish objects for several days oh sir will i see will i see my father her fingers closed spasmodically over those that clasped them and the agonizing suspense written in her countenance was pitiable to contemplate yes my dear i hope *** think so you know murray the eye has to be trained but ****** mentions a case of a nobleman who saw distinctly at various distances immediately after the cataract was removed from the **** of vision now my little girl hold just as still as possible i shall not hurt you skilfully he cut through the ******** and drew it down then held his hat between her eyes and the light streaming through the window some seconds elapsed and suddenly a cry broke from the childs lips oh something shines there is a light i believe mr murray threw his handkerchief over her head caught her in his arms and placed her on the side of the cot the first face her eyes ever look upon shall be that which she loves ******* fathers as he withdrew the handkerchief mr reed feebly raised his arms toward his child and whispered my little ******** daughter can you see me she stooped put her face close to his swept her small fingers repeatedly over the emaciated features to convince herself of the identity of the new sensation of sight with the old and reliable sense of touch then she threw her head back with a wild laugh a scream of delight oh i see thank god i see my fathers face my dear pa my own dear pa for some moments she hung over the sufferer kissing him murmuring brokenly her happy tender words and now and then ********* to the old sense of touch while edna wiped away tears of joyful sympathy which she strove in vain to restrain she glanced at mr murray and wondered how he could stand there watching the scene with such bright dry eyes seeming suddenly to remember that there were other countenances in the world beside that tearstained one on the pillow huldah slipped down from the cot turned toward the group and shaded her eyes with her fingers oh edna ant you glad for me where are you i knew jesus would hear me what things ****** ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them i did believe and i see i see i prayed that god would send down some angel to touch my eyes and he sent mr murray and the doctor after a pause during which the oculist prepared some bandages huldah added which one is mr murray will you please come to me my ears and my fingers know you but my eyes dont he stepped forward and putting out her hands she grasped his and turned her untutored eyes upon him before he could suspect her design she fell at his feet threw her arms around his knees and exclaimed how good you are how shall i ever thank you enough how good she clung to him and sobbed hysterically edna saw him lift her from the floor and put her back beside her father while the doctor bandaged her eyes and waiting to hear no more the orphan glided away and hurried along the road ere she had proceeded far she heard the quick trot of the horses the roll of the carriage leaning out as they overtook her mr murray directed the driver to stop and swinging open the door he stepped out and approached her the doctor ***** at le bocage will you take a seat with us or do you as usual prefer to walk alone thank you sir i am not going home now i shall walk on he bowed and was turning away but she drew the delicately perfumed envelope from her pocket mr murray i was requested by the writer to hand you this note as she feared its predecessor was lost by the servant to whom she entrusted it he took it glanced at the small cramped ************* handwriting smiled and thrust it into his vest pocket saying in a low earnest tone this is indeed a joyful surprise you are certainly more reliable than henry accept my cordial thanks which i have not time to ********* i generally prefer to owe my happiness entirely to gertrude but in this instance i can bear to receive it through the medium of your hands as you are so prompt and trusty i may trouble you to carry my answer the carriage rolled on leaving a cloud of dust which the evening sunshine converted into a glittering track of glory and seating herself on a grassy bank edna leaned her head against the body of a tree and all the glory passed swiftly away and she was alone in the dust as the sun went down the pillared forest aisles stretching westward filled first with golden haze then glowed with a light ****** than ********* wine poured from the burning ****** of the sun and only the mournful cooing of doves broke the solemn silence as the pine organ whispered its low ******** for the dead day and the cool shadow of coming night crept ************* ************** down the forest glades oh if i had gone away a week ago before i knew there was any redeeming charity in his sinful nature if i could only despise him utterly it would be so much easier to forget him ah god pity me god help me what right have i to think of gertrudes ************** husband i ought to be glad that he is nobler than i thought but i am not oh i

stood listening to the distant whistle of a *********** the plaint of the lonely dove nestled among the pine boughs high above her and gradually a holy calm stole over her face fixing it as the

round ocean and the living air and the blue sky tis her privilege through all the years of this our life to lead from joy to joy for she can so inform the mind that is within us so impress with ********* and beauty and so feed with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men nor greetings where no kindness ***** all the dreary intercourse of daily

she sought for strength to fulfill her fathers ********* and into her pitying starry eyes looked stricken ****** from those dreary rocks where love held faithful vigil guarding the bleaching bones of

edna rose and took her hat from the study table and mr hammond asked do you intend to travel alone i shall be compelled to do so as i know of no one who is going on to new york of course i dislike very much to travel alone but in this instance i do not see how i can avoid it do not put on your ******* and spend the evening with me thank you sir i want to go to the church and practice for the last time on the organ after tomorrow i may never sing again in our dear choir perhaps i may come back after awhile and stay an hour or two with you during the past year she had accustomed herself to practising every saturday afternoon the hymns selected by mr hammond for the services of the ensuing day and for this purpose had been furnished by the sexton with a key which enabled her to enter the church whenever inclination prompted the churchyard was peaceful and silent as the pulseless dust in its numerous ********** a beautiful redbird sat on the edge of a marble vase that crowned the top of one of the monuments and leisurely drank the water which yesterdays clouds had poured there and a rabbit nibbled the leaves of a cluster of ***** growing near a childs grave edna entered the cool church went up into the gallery and sat down before the organ for some time the low solemn tones whispered among the fluted columns that supported the gallery and gradually swelled louder and fuller and richer as she sang cast thy burden on the lord her sweet welltrained voice faltered more than once and tears fell thick and fast on the keys finally she turned and looked down at the sacred spot where she had been baptized by mr hammond and where she had so often knelt to receive the sacrament of the lords supper the church was remarkably handsome and certainly justified the pride with which the ********* exhibited it to all strangers the massive mahogany ******** were elaborately carved and surmounted by small crosses the tall arched windows were of superb stained glass representing the twelve ******** the floor and balustrade of the altar and the grand ****** pillared pulpit were all of the purest white marble and the capitals of the airy elegant columns of the same material that supported the organ gallery were ornamented with rich ********* moulding while the large window behind and above the pulpit contained a figure of christ bearing his ****** noble copy of the great painting of ******* at berlin as the afternoon sun shone on the glass a flood of ruby light fell from the garments of jesus upon the glittering marble beneath and the ****** that ******** around the crown of thorns caught a glory that was dazzling with a feeling of adoration that no language could adequately express edna had watched and studied this costly painted window for five long years had found a marvellous fascination in the pallid face stained with purplish ********** in the parted lips quivering with human pain and anguish of spirit in the ************ divine eyes that pierced the veil and rested upon the fathers face not all the sermons of ******* or chalmers or ****** taylor or melville had power to stir the great deeps of her soul like one glance at that pale ************ christ who looked in voiceless woe and sublime resignation over the world he was dying to redeem today she gazed up at the picture of ******** till her eyes grew dim with tears and she leaned her head against the mahogany railing and murmured sadly and he that ****** not his cross and ********* after me is not worthy of me strengthen me o my saviour so that i neither faint nor stagger under mine the echo of her words died away among the arches of the roof and all was still in the sanctuary the swaying of the trees outside of the windows threw now a golden shimmer then a violet shadow over the gleaming altar pavement and the sun sunk lower and the ****** faded and the wan christ looked ghastly and ********* edna my darling my darling the pleading cry the tremulous tender voice so full of pathos rang startlingly through the silent church and the orphan sprang up and saw mr murray standing at her side with his arms extended toward her and a glow on his face and a look in his eyes which she had never seen there before she drew back a few steps and gazed wonderingly at him but he followed threw his arm around her and despite her resistance strained her to his heart did you believe that i would let you go did you dream that i would see my darling leave me and go out into the world to be buffeted and sorely tried to struggle with ********** to suffer alone oh silly child i would part with my own life sooner than give you up of what value would it be without you my pearl my sole hope my only love my own pure edna such language you have no right to utter and i none to hear it is dishonorable in you and insulting to me gertrudes lover can not and shall not address such words to me ****** your arms instantly let me go she struggled hard to free herself but his clasp tightened and as he pressed her face against his bosom he threw his head back and laughed gertrudes lover knowing my history how could you believe that possible am i think you so meek and forgiving a

i know that you love her and i know too that she fully returns your affection if you do not wish me to despise you utterly leave me at once he laughed again and put his lips close to her ear saying softly ********** how tenderly upon my honor as a gentleman i solemnly swear that i love but one woman that i love her as no other woman ever was loved with a love that passes all language a love that is the only light and hope of a wrecked cursed unutterably miserable life and that idol which i have set up in the lonely gray ruins of my heart is edna earl i do not believe you you have no honor with the touch of gertrudes lips and arms still on yours you come to me and dare to ******* yourself oh mr murray mr murray i did not believe you capable of such despicable dissimulation in the catalogue of your sins i never counted deceit i thought you too proud to play the hypocrite if you could realize how i ****** and abhor you you would get out of my sight you would not waste time in words that sink you deeper and deeper in shameful duplicity poor gertrude how entirely you mistake your lovers character how your love will change to scorn and detestation in vain she endeavored to wrench away his arm a band of steel would have been as flexible but st elmos voice hardened and edna felt his heart throb fiercely against her cheek as he answered when you are my wife you will repent your rash words and blush at the remembrance of having told your husband that he was devoid of honor you are piqued and jealous just as i intended you should be but darling i am not a patient man and it ***** me to feel you struggling so desperately in the arms that henceforth will always enfold you be quiet and hear me for i have much to tell you dont turn your face away from mine your lips belong to me i never kissed gertrude in my life and so help me god i never will hear no i will hear nothing your touch is *********** i would sooner go down into my grave out there in the churchyard under the granite slabs than become the wife of a man so unprincipled i am neither piqued nor jealous for your affairs cannot affect my life i am only astonished and mortified and grieved i would sooner feel the coil of a serpent around my waist than your arms instantly they fell away he crossed them on his chest and his voice sank to a husky whisper as the wind ****** itself just before the storm breaks edna god is my witness that i am not deceiving you that my words come from the great troubled depths of a wretched heart you said you knew nothing of my history i find it more difficult to believe you than you to credit my declarations answer one question has not your pastor taught you to distrust me can it be possible that no hint of the past has fallen from his lips not one unkind word not one syllable of your history has he uttered i know no more of your past than if it were buried in ******** mr murray placed her in one of the cushioned chairs designed for the use of the

go back with me over the scorched and blackened track of an accursed and sinful life it is a hideous waste i am inviting you to traverse will you i will hear you mr murray but nothing that you can say

my slaughtered manhood my lazarus has ******** the grave for nearly twenty years and comes forth at my bidding a grinning skeleton you may or may not know that my father paul murray died when i was an infant leaving my mother the sole guardian of my property and person i grew up at le bocage under the training of mr hammond my tutor and my only associate my companion from earliest recollections was his son murray who was two years my senior and named for my father the hold which that boy took upon my affection was wonderful inexplicable he wound me around his finger as you wind the silken threads with which you ********* we studied read played together i was never contented out of his sight never satisfied until i saw him liberally supplied with everything that gave me pleasure i believe i was very precocious and made extraordinary strides in the path of learning at all events at sixteen i was considered a remarkable boy mr hammond had six children and as his salary was rather meagre i insisted on paying his sons expenses as well as my own when i went to yale i could not bear that my ***** my jonathan should be out of my sight i must have my idol always with me his father was educating him for the ministry and he had already commenced the study of ******** but no i must have him with me at yale and so to yale we went i had fancied myself a christian had joined the church was zealous and faithful in all my religious duties in a fit of pious enthusiasm i planned this ************* it built the cost was enormous and my mother objected but i intended it as a shrine for the apple of my eye and where he was concerned what mattered the expenditure of thousands was not my fortune quite as much at his disposal as at mine i looked forward with fond pride to the time when i should see my ********** *************** in yonder shining pulpit ha at this instant it is filled with a hideous spectre i see him there his form and features mocking me daring me to forget handsome as apollo treacherous as apollyon he paused pointing to the pure marble pile where a violet flame seemed flickering and then with a groan bowed his head upon the railing when he spoke again his face wore an ashy hue and his stern mouth was unsteady hallowed days of my blessed boyhood ah they rise before me now like holy burning stars breaking out in a stormy howling night making the blackness blacker still my short happy springtime of life so full of noble aspirations of glowing hopes of philanthropic schemes of all charitable projects i would do so much good with my money my heart was brimming with generous impulses with warm sympathy and care for my fellowcreatures every needy sufferer should find relief at my hands as long as i possessed a dollar or a crust as i look back now at that dead self and remember all that i was all the purity of my life the nobility of my character the tenderness of my ****** do not wonder that people who knew me then predicted that i would prove an honor a blessing to my race mark you that was st elmo ******** nature fashioned him before man spoiled gods handiwork back back to your shroud and sepulchre o lazarus of my youth and when i am called to the final judgment rise for me stand in my place and confront those who slaughtered you my affection for my chum murray increased as i grew up to manhood and there was not a dream of my brain a hope of my heart which was not confided to him i reverenced i trusted i ********* i quite worshipped him when i was only eighteen i began to love his cousin whose father was pastor of a church in new haven and whose mother was mr hammonds sister you have seen her she is beautiful even now and you can imagine how lovely agnes hunt was in her girlhood she was the belle and pet of the students and before i had known her a month i was her accepted lover i loved her with all the devotion of my chivalric ardent boyish nature and for me she professed the most profound attachment her parents favored our wishes for an early marriage but my mother refused to sanction such an idea until i had completed my education and visited the old world i was an obedient affectionate son then and yielded respectfully but as vacation approached i prepared to come home hoping to prevail on mother to consent to my being married just before we sailed for europe the ensuing year after i left yale murray was my confidant and adviser in his sympathizing ears i poured all my fond hopes and he insisted that i ought to take my lovely bride with me it would be cruel to leave her so long and beside he was so impatient for the happy day when he should call me his cousin he declined coming home on the plea of desiring to prosecute his theological studies with his uncle mr hunt well do i recollect the parting between us i had left agnes in ***************** because of my departure and i flew to murray for words of consolation when i bade him goodbye my eyes were full of tears and as he passed his arm around my shoulders i whispered murray take care of my angel agnes for me watch over and comfort her while i am away ah as i stand here today i hear again ringing over the ruins of the past twenty years his loving musical tones answering my dear boy trust her to my care st elmo for your dear sake i will steal time from my books to cheer her while you are absent but hurry back for you know i find *********** more attractive than ******** god bless you my precious friend write to me constantly since then i always shudder involuntarily when i hear parting friends bless each ********

unexpectedly the night was bright with moonshine my heart was bright with hope and too eager to see agnes whose letters had breathed the most tender solicitude and attachment i rushed up the steps and was told that she was walking in the little flowergarden down the path i hurried and stopped as i heard her silvery laugh blended with murrays then my name was pronounced in tones that almost petrified me under a large appletree in the *************** they sat on a wooden bench and only the tendrils and branches of an isabella grape vine divided us i stood there grasping the ***********

and depth and marvellous strength of my love for that man passes comprehension but their scorn their sneers at my weak credulity their bitter ridicule of my awkward overgrown ********** stung me to desperation i wondered if i were insane or dreaming or the victim of some horrible delusion my veins ran fire as i listened to the tingling of her silvery voice with the rich melody of his and i turned and left the garden and walked back toward the town the moon was full but i staggered and groped my way like one blind to the college buildings i knew where a pair of pistols was kept by one of the students and possessing myself of them i wandered out on the road leading to the parsonage i was aware that murray intended coming into the town and at last i reeled into a shaded spot near the road and waited for him oh the mocking glory of that cloudless night to this day i hate the cold glitter of stars and the golden sheen of midnight moons for the first time in my life i cursed the world and all it held cursed the contented ******* singing in the grass at my feet cursed the blood in my arteries that beat so thick and fast i could not listen for the footsteps i was waiting for at last i heard him whistling a favorite tune which all our lives we had whistled together as we hunted through the woods around le bocage and as the familiar sound of the ***** of ********** drew nearer and nearer i sprang up with a cry that must have rung on the night air like the yell of some beast of prey of all that passed i only know that i cursed and insulted and maddened him till he accepted the pistol which i thrust into his hand we moved ten paces ******** a couple of students who happened accidentally to pass along the road and heard our altercation stopped at our request gave the word

memoriam of murdered confidence until now edna had listened breathlessly with her eyes upon his but here a groan escaped her and she shuddered violently and hid her face in her hands mr murray came nearer stood close to her and hurried on my last memory of my old idol is as he lay with his handsome treacherous face turned up to the moon and the hair which agnes had been ********* ******* with dew and the blood that oozed down from his side when i recovered my consciousness murray hammond had been three weeks in his grave as soon as i was able to travel my mother took me to europe and for five years we lived in paris naples or wandered to and fro then she came home and i plunged into the heart of **** after two years i returned to paris and gave myself up to every species of dissipation i drank ******* and my midnight ********* would ****** your soul were i to paint all their *********** you have read in the scriptures of persons possessed of devils a savage mocking

************* derided all holy things oh edna my darling it is impossible to paint all the awful wretchedness of that period when i walked in the world seeking victims and finding many verily theres not a crime but takes its proper change out still in crime if once rung on the counter of this world let sinners look to it ah upon how many lovely women have i visited agness sin of hypocrisy into how many ears have i poured tender words until fair hands were as good as offered to me and i turned their love to mockery i hated and despised all womanhood and even in paris i became notorious as a heartless ******* with the affections i won and trampled under my feet whenever a brilliant and beautiful woman crossed my path i attached myself to her train of admirers until i made her acknowledge my power and give public and unmistakable manifestation of her preference for me then i left **** target for the laughter of her circle it was not vanity oh no no that springs from selflove and i had

quitted her side for that of another belle and never visited her again on the day when she bade adieu to the world i was among the spectators and as her mournful but lovely eyes sought mine i laughed and gloried in the desolation i had wrought sick of europe i came home and to a part i come where no light shines my tempting fiend pointed to one whose suffering would atone for much of my misery edna i withhold nothing there is much i might conceal but i scorn to do so during one terribly fatal winter ************ had deprived mr hammond of four children leaving him an only ****************

sixteen very pretty very attractive after murrays death i never spoke to mr hammond never crossed his path but i met his daughter without his knowledge and finally i made her confess her love for me i offered her my hand she accepted it a day was appointed for an ********* and marriage the hour came she left the parsonage but i did not meet her here on the steps of this church as i had promised and she received a note that announced my inability to fulfill the engagement two hours later her father found her insensible on the steps and the marble was dripping with a hemorrhage of blood from her lungs the dark stain is still there you must have noticed it i never saw her again she kept her room from that day and died three months after when on her deathbed she sent for me but i refused to obey the summons as i stand here i see through the window the gray granite vault overgrown with ivy and the marble slab where sleep in untimely death murray and annie hammond the victims of my insatiable revenge do you wonder that i doubted you when you said that afflicted father allan hammond had never uttered one unkind word about me mr murray pointed to a quiet corner of the churchyard but edna did not lift her face and he heard the halfsmothered shuddering moan that struggled up as she listened to him he put his hand on hers but she shivered and shrank away from him years passed i grew more and more savage the very power of loving seemed to have died out in my nature my mother endeavored to drag me into society but i was ********* sick of the ********* of my own excesses and gradually i became a recluse a surly *********** how often have i laughed bitterly over those words of mills yet nothing is more certain than that improvement in human affairs is wholly the work of the *********** characters my indescribable my tormenting discontent daily ****** his ******** my mother is a woman of stern integrity of character and sincerity of purpose but she is worldly and ambitious and inordinately proud and for her religion i had lost all respect again i went abroad solely to kill time was absent two years and came back i had ransacked the world and was disgusted hopeless prematurely old a week after my return i was attacked by a very malignant fever and my life was ********* of but i exulted in the thought that at last i should find oblivion i refused all remedies and set at defiance all medical advice hoping to hasten the end but death cheated me i rose from my bed of sickness cursing the mockery realizing that indeed the good die first and they whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to the socket some months after my recovery while i was out on a ******** you were brought to le bocage and the sight of you made me more vindictive than ever i believed you selfishly designing and i could not bear that you should remain under the same roof with me i hated children as i hated men and women but that day when you defied me in the park and told me i was sinful and cruel i began to notice you closely i weighed your words watched you when you little dreamed that i was present and often concealed myself in order to listen to your conversation i saw in your character traits that annoyed me because they were noble and unlike what i had believed all womanhood or girlhood to be i was aware that you dreaded and disliked me i saw that very clearly every time i had occasion to speak to you how it all came to pass i can not ***** know notand it has always been a mystery even to me but edna after the long lapse of years of sin and reckless dissipation my heart stirred and turned to you child though you were and a strange strange invincible love for you sprang from the bitter ashes of a dead affection for agnes hunt i wondered at myself i sneered at my idiocy i cursed my mad folly and tried to believe you as unprincipled as i had found others but the singular fascination strengthened day by day finally i determined to tempt you hoping that your duplicity and deceit would wake me from the second dream into which i feared there was danger of my falling thinking that at your age curiosity was the strongest emotion i carefully arranged the interior of the taj mahal so that it would be impossible for you to open it without being discovered and putting the key in your hands i went abroad i wanted to satisfy myself that you were unworthy and believed you would betray the trust for four years i wandered restless impatient scorning myself more and more because i could not forget your sweet pure haunting face because despite my jeers i knew that i loved you at last i wrote to my mother from egypt that i should go to central persia and so i intended but one night as i sat alone smoking amid the ruins of the ******** at ****** a vision of le bocage rose before me and your dear face looked at me from the ************ columns of the ancient temple i forgot the hate i bore all mankind i forgot every thing but you your pure calm magnificent eyes and the longing to see you my ********** yearning to look into your eyes once more took possession of me i sat there till the great golden ******* dawn of the desert fell upon egypt and then came a struggle long and desperate i laughed and swore at my folly but far down in the ******* of my distorted nature hope had kindled a little feeble flickering ray i tried to smother it but its flame clung to some crevice in my heart and would not be crushed while i debated a pigeon that dwelt somewhere in the crumbling temple fluttered down at my feet cooed softly looked in my face then perched on a mutilated red granite sphinx immediately in front of me and after a moment rose circled above me in the pure ******** air and flew westward i accepted it as an omen and started to america instead of to persia on the night of the tenth of december four years after i bade you goodbye at the park gate i was again at le bocage silently and undiscovered i stole into my own house and secreted myself behind the curtains in the library i had been there one hour when you and gordon leigh came in to examine the targum oh edna how little you dreamed of the eager hungry eyes that watched you during that hour that you two sat there bending over the same book i became thoroughly convinced that while i loved you as i never expected to love any one gordon also loved you and intended if possible to make you his wife i contrasted my worn haggard face and grayish locks with his so full of manly hope and youthful beauty and i could not doubt that any girl would prefer him to me edna my retribution began then i felt that my devil was mocking me as i had long mocked others and made me love you when it was impossible to win you then and there i was tempted to spring upon and ******** you both before he triumphantly called you his at last leigh left and i escaped to my own rooms i was pacing the floor when i heard you cross the rotunda and saw the glimmer of the light you carried hoping to see you open the little taj i crawled behind the sarcophagus that holds my two mummies crouched close to the floor and peeped at you across the gilded ****** that covered them my eyes i have often been told possess magnetic or mesmeric power at all events you felt my eager gaze you were restless and searched the room to discover whence that feeling of a human presence came darling were you superstitious that you avoided looking into the dark corner where the mummies lay presently you stopped in front of the little tomb and swept away the ********* and took the key from your pocket and as you put it into the lock i almost shouted aloud in my savage triumph i absolutely panted to find leighs future wife as unworthy of confidence as i believed the remainder of her sex but you did not open it you merely drove away the spider and rubbed the marble clean with your handkerchief and held the key between your fingers then my heart seemed to stand still as i watched the light streaming over your beautiful holy face and warm crimson dress and when you put the key in your pocket and turned away my groan almost betrayed me i had taken out my watch to see the hour and in my suspense i clutched it so tightly that the gold case and the crystal within all crushed in my hand you heard the tingling sound and wondered whence it came and when you had locked the door and gone i raised one of the windows and swung myself down to the terrace do you remember that night yes mr murray her voice was tremulous and almost inaudible i had business in tennessee no matter now what or where and i went on that night after a week i returned that afternoon when i found you reading in my sittingroom still i was sceptical and not until i opened the tomb was i convinced that you had not betrayed the trust which you supposed i placed in you then as you stood beside me in all your noble purity and touching girlish ******** you looked up half reproachfully half defiantly at **** cost me a terrible effort to master ******** abstain from clasping you to my heart and telling you all that you were to me oh how i longed to take you in my arms and feed my poor famished heart with one touch of your lips i dared not look at you lest i should lose my selfcontrol the belief that gordon was a successful rival sealed my lips on that occasion and ah the dreary wretchedness of the days of suspense that followed i was a starving beggar who stood before what i coveted above everything else on earth and saw it labelled with another mans name and beyond my reach the daily sight of that emerald ring on your finger maddened me and you can form no adequate idea of the bitterness of feeling with which i noted my mothers earnest efforts and manoeuvres to secure for gordon ******* sell to himthe little hand which her own son would have given worlds to claim in the sight of god and man continually i watched you when you least expected me i strewed infidel books where i knew you must see them i tempted you more than you dreamed of i teased and tormented and wounded you whenever an opportunity offered for i hoped to find some flaw in your character some defect in your temper some inconsistency between your professions and your practice i knew leigh was not your equal and i said bitterly she is poor and unknown and will surely marry him for his money for his ********** agnes would have married me but you did not and when i knew that you had positively refused his fortune i felt that a great dazzling light had broken suddenly upon my darkened life and for the first time since i parted with murray hammond tears of joy filled my eyes i ceased to struggle against my ***** gave myself up to it and only asked how can i overcome her aversion to me you were the only tie that linked me with my race and for your sake i almost felt as if i could forget my hate but you shrank more and more from me and my punishment overtook me when i saw how you hated clinton ******** ************ hands and with what unfeigned horror you regarded his career when you declared so vehemently that his fingers should never touch ******* it was the fearful apprehension of losing you that made me catch your dear hands and press them to my aching heart i was stretched upon a rack that taught me the full import of isaac taylors grim words remorse is mans dread prerogative believing that you knew all my history and that your aversion was based upon it i was too proud to show you my affection douglass manning was as much my friend as i permitted any man to be we had travelled together through arabia and with his handwriting i was familiar suspecting your literary schemes and dreading a rival in your ambition i wrote to him on the subject discovered all i wished to ascertain and requested him for my sake to reconsider and examine your ms he did so to oblige me and i insisted that he should treat your letters and your ms with such severity as to utterly crush your literary aspirations oh child do you see how entirely you fill my mind and heart how i scrutinize your words and actions oh my darling he paused and leaned over her putting his hand on her head but she shook off his touch and exclaimed but gertrude gertrude be patient and you shall know all for as god reigns above us there is no recess of my heart into which you shall not look it is perhaps needless to tell you that estelle came here to marry me for my fortune it is not agreeable to say such things of ones own cousin but today i deal only in truths and facts sustain me she ********* to love me has absolutely avowed it more than once in days gone by whether she really loves anything but wealth and luxury i have never troubled myself to find out but my mother fancies that if estelle were my wife i might be less cynical once or twice i tried to be affectionate toward her solely to see what effect it would have upon you but i discovered that you could not easily be deceived in that ************ mask was too transparent and beside the game disgusted me i have no respect for estelle but i have a shadowy traditional reverence for the blood in her veins which forbids my flirting with her as she deserves the very devil himself brought agnes here she had married a rich old banker only a few months after murrays death and lived in ease and splendor until a short time since when her husband failed and died leaving her without a cent she knew how utterly she had blasted my life and imagined that i had never married because i still loved her with unparalleled effrontery she came here and trusting to her wonderfully preserved beauty threw herself and her daughter in my way when i heard she was at the parsonage all the old burning hate leaped up strong as ever i fancied that she was the real cause of your dislike to me and that night when the game of ********* ended i went to the parsonage for the first time since murrays death oh the ghostly thronging memories that met me at the gate ******* after me up the walk and hovered like vultures as i stood in the shadow of the trees where my idol and i had chatted and ****** and shouted and whistled in the far past in the sinless bygone unobserved i stood there and looked once more after the lapse of twenty years on the face that had caused my crime and ruin i listened to her clear laugh silvery as when i heard it chiming with murrays under the appletree on the night that branded me and drove me forth to wander like cain and i resolved if she really loved her daughter to make her suffer for all that she had inflicted on me the first time i met gertrude i could have sworn my ******** love was restored to me she is so entirely the image of what agnes was to possess themselves of my home and property is all that brought them here and whether as my wife or as my motherinlaw i think agnes cares little the first she sees is impracticable and now to make me wed gertrude is her aim like mother like daughter oh no no visit not her mothers sins on her innocent head gertrude is true and affectionate and she loves you dearly edna spoke with a great effort and the strange tones of her own voice frightened her loves me ha ha just about as tenderly as her mother did before her that they do both dearly ****** purse i grant you hear me out agnes threw the girl constantly and adroitly in my way the demon here in my heart prompted revenge and above all i resolved to find out whether you were indeed as utterly indifferent to me as you seemed i know that jealousy will make a woman betray her affection sooner than any other cause and i deliberately set myself to work to make you believe that i loved that pretty cheat over yonder at the ************* frolicsome ******* who would rather play with a kitten than talk to ****** who ********** me almost daily to favor me with manifestations of devotion and shows me continually that i have only to put out my hand and take her to rule over my house and trample my heart under her pretty feet when you gave me that note of hers a week ago and looked so calmly so coolly in my face i felt as if all hope were dying in my heart for i could not believe that if you had one atom of affection for me you could be so generous so unselfish toward one whom you considered your rival that night i did not close my eyes and had almost decided to ******* south america but next morning my mother told me you were going to new ******** all entreaties had failed to shake your resolution then once more a hope cheered me and i believed that i understood why you had determined to leave those whom i know you love ********** quit the home my mother offered you and struggle among strangers yesterday they told me you would leave on monday and i went out to seek you but you were with mr hammond as usual and instead of you i ******* curse of my ********* face to face at last with my ********* ***** oh it was a scene that made ******* down in *********** she plead for her childs *********** ha ********** me most pathetically to love her gertrude as well as gertrude loved me and that my happiness would make me forget the unfortunate past she would willingly give me her daughter for did she not know how deep how lasting how deathless was my affection i had gertrudes whole heart and i was too generous to trifle with her tender love edna darling i will not tell you all she ******* would blush for your sisterhood but my vengeance was complete when i declined the honor she was so eager to force upon me when i overwhelmed her with my scorn and told her that there was only one woman whom i respected or trusted only one woman upon the broad earth whom i loved only one woman who could ever be my wife and her name ******* earl his voice died away and all was still as the dead in their grassy graves the orphans face was concealed and after a moment st elmo murray opened his arms and said in that low winning tone which so many women had found it impossible to resist come to me now my pure noble edna you whom i love as only such a man as i have shown myself to be can love no mr murray gertrude stands between us gertrude do not make me swear here in your ********** not ****** me by repeating her name i tell you she is a silly child who cares no more for me than her mother did before her nothing shall stand between us i love you the god above us is my witness that i love you as i never loved any human being and i will noti swear i will not live without you you are mine and all the legions in hell shall not part us he stooped snatched her from the chair as if she had been an infant and folded her in his strong arms mr murray i know she loves you my poor little trusting friend you trifled with her warm heart as you hope to trifle with mine but i know you you have shown me how utterly heartless *********** unprincipled you are you had no right to punish gertrude for her mothers sins and if you had one spark of honor in your nature you would marry her and try to atone for the injury you have already done by pretending to give her a heart which belongs entirely to you if i wished to deceive you now think you i would have told all that hideous past which you can not abhor one half as much as i do your heart is not mine it belongs to sin or you could not have so maliciously deceived poor gertrude you love nothing but your ignoble revenge and the gratification of your selflove you take care do not rouse me be reasonable little darling you doubt my love well i ought not to wonder at your ********** after all you have heard but you can feel how my heart throbs against your cheek and if you will look into my eyes you will be convinced that i am fearfully in earnest when i beg you to be my wife **************** if you will only let me send for a minister or a magistrate you are you asked annie to be your wife and hush hush look at me edna raise your head and look at me she tried to break away and finding it impossible pressed both hands over her face and hid it against his shoulder he laughed and whispered my darling i know what that means you dare not look up because you cannot trust your own eyes because you dread for me to see something there which you want to hide which you think it your duty to conceal he felt a long shudder creep over her and she answered resolutely do you think sir that i could love a murderer a man whose hands are red with the blood of the son of my best friend look at me then he raised her head drew down her hands took them firmly in one of his and placing the other under her chin lifted the burning face close to his own she dreaded the power of his lustrous mesmeric eyes and instantly her long silky lashes swept her flushed cheeks ah you dare not you can not look me steadily in the eye and say st elmo i never have ******* notand never can love you you are too truthful your lips can not ********* i know you do not want to love me your reason your conscience forbid it you are struggling to crush your heart you think it your duty to despise and hate me but my own ****** darling my darling you do love me you know you do love me though you will not confess it my proud darling he drew the face tenderly to his own and kissed her quivering lips repeatedly and at last a moan of anguish told how she was wrestling with her heart do you think you can hide your love from my eager eyes oh i know that i am unworthy of you i feel it more and more every day every hour it is because you seem so ******* ****** my eyes that i reverence while i love you you are so far above all other ******* glorified in your pure consistent ********* you only have the power to make my future ********** the wretched

do you know that since this church was finished i have never entered it until a month ago when i followed you here and crouched **************** behind one of the pillars and heard your sacred songs your hymns so full of grandeur so full of pathos that i could not keep back my tears while i listened since then i have come every saturday afternoon and during the hour spent here my unholy nature was touched and softened as no sermon ever touched it oh you wield a power over ****** all my future which ought to make you tremble the first generous impulse that has stirred my callous bitter soul since i was a boy i owe to you i went first to see poor reed in order to discover what took you so often to that cheerless place and my interest in little huldah arose from the fact that you loved the child oh my darling i know i have been sinful and cruel and blasphemous but it is not too late for me to atone it is not too late for me to do some good in the world and if you will only love me and trust me and help me his voice faltered his tears fell upon her forehead and stooping he kissed her lips softly reverently as if he realized the presence of something sacred my precious edna no oath shall ever soil my lips again the touch of yours has purified them i have been **** think for many many years and i loath my past life but remember how sorely i was tried and be merciful when you judge me with your dear little hand in mine to lead me i will make amends for the ruin and suffering i have wrought and my ****** own wife shall save me before the orphans mental vision rose the picture of gertrude the trembling coral mouth the childish wistful eyes the lovely head nestled down so often and so lovingly on her shoulder and she saw too the bent figure and white locks of her beloved pastor as he sat in his old age in his childless desolate home facing the graves of his murdered children oh mr murray you can not atone you can not call your victims from their tombs you can not undo what you have done what amends can you make to mr hammond and to my poor little confiding gertrude i can not help you i can not save you hush you can you shall do you think i will ever give you up have mercy on my lonely life my wretched darkened soul lean your dear head here on my heart and say st elmo what a wife can do to save her erring sinful husband i will do for you if i am ever

bound she sprang from his embrace and lifted her arms toward the christ who seemed to shudder as the flickering light of fading day fell through waving foliage upon it look yonder to jesus bleeding only his blood can wash away your guilt mr murray i can never be your wife i have no confidence in you knowing how systematically you have deceived others how devoid of conscientious scruples you are i should never be sure that i too was not the victim of your heartless cynicism beside i hush hush to your keeping i commit my conscience and my heart no no i am no ********** of an outraged and insulted god i put no faith in any man whose conscience another keeps from the species of fascination which you exert i shrink with unconquerable dread and aversion and would almost as soon entertain the thought of marrying lucifer himself oh your perverted nature shocks repels ********** grieves me i can neither respect nor trust you mr murray have mercy upon yourself go yonder to jesus he only can save and purify you edna you do not you can not intend to leave me darling he held out his arms and moved toward her but she sprang past him down the steps of the gallery out of the church and paused only at sight of the dark dull spot on the white steps where annie hammond had lain insensible an hour later st elmo murray raised his face from the mahogany railing where it had rested since edna left him and looked around the noble pile which his *********** had erected a full moon eyed him pityingly through the stained glass and the gleam of the marble pulpit was chill and ghostly and in that weird light the christ was threatening wrathful appalling as st elmo stood there alone confronting the ****************** the ********** like the witch of ***** called up visions of the departed that were more terrible than the ******* form of ******* prophet and the proud hopeless man bowed his haughty head with a cry of anguish that rose mournfully to the vaulted ceiling of the sanctuary it went up single ******** my god i am forsaken the weather was so inclement on the following day that no service was held in the church but notwithstanding the heavy rain edna went to the parsonage to bid adieu to her pastor and teacher when she ascended the steps mr hammond was walking up and down the portico with his hands clasped behind him as was his habit when engrossed by earnest thought and he greeted his pupil with a degree of mournful tenderness very soothing to her sad heart leading the way to his study where mrs powell sat with an open book on her lap he said gently agnes will you be so kind as to leave us for a while this is the last interview i shall have with edna for a long time perhaps forever and there are some things i wish to say to her alone you will find a better light in the diningroom where all is quiet as mrs powell withdrew he locked the door and for some seconds paced the floor then taking a seat on the ************* lounge beside his pupil he said eagerly st elmo was at the church yesterday afternoon are you willing to tell me what passed between you mr hammond he told me his melancholy history i know all ******* why he shrinks from meeting you whom he has injured so cruelly know all his guilt and your desolation the old man bowed his white head on his bosom and there was a painful silence when he spoke his voice was scarcely audible the punishment of *** has fallen heavily upon me and there have been hours when i thought that it was greater than i could ******** it would utterly crush me but the bitterness of the curse has passed away and i can say truly of that meekest angel of god the angel of patience he walks with thee that angel kind and gently whispers be resigned bear up bear on the end shall tell the dear lord ******** all things well i tried to train up my children in the fear and admonition of the lord but i must have failed signally in my duty though i have never been able to discover in what respect i was ********* one of the sins of my life was my inordinate pride in my only ***** gifted gifted handsome son my love for murray was almost idolatrous and when my heart throbbed with proudest hopes and aspirations my idol was broken and laid low in the dust and like david mourning for his rebellious child ******* i cried out in my affliction my son my son would god i had died for thee murray hammond was my precious diadem of earthly glory and suddenly i found myself ********* and sackcloth and ashes were my portion why did you never confide these sorrows to me did you doubt my earnest sympathy no my child but i thought it best that st elmo should lift the veil and show you all that he wished you to know i felt assured that the time would come when he considered it due to himself to acquaint you with his sad history and when i saw him go into the church yesterday i knew that the hour had arrived i did not wish to prejudice you against him for i believe that through your agency the prayers of twenty years would be answered and that his wandering embittered heart would follow you to that cross before which he bowed in his boyhood edna it was through my sons sin and duplicity that st elmos noble career was blasted and his most admirable character perverted and i have hoped and believed that through your influence my beloved pupil he would be redeemed from his reckless course my dear little edna you are very lovely and winning and i believe he would love you as he never loved any one else oh i have hoped everything from your influence far far beyond all computation is the good which a pious consistent christian wife can accomplish in the heart of a husband who truly loves her oh mr hammond you pain and astonish me surely you would not be willing to see me marry a man who ****** at the very name of religion who wilfully ******** and trifles with the feelings of all who are sufficiently credulous to trust his hollow **************** hands are red with the blood of your children what hope of happiness or peace could you indulge for me in view of such a union i should merit all the wretchedness that would inevitably be my lifelong portion if knowing his crimes i could consent to link my future with his he would not deceive you my child if you knew him as well as i do if you could realize all that he was before his tender loving heart was stabbed by the two whom he almost adored you would judge him more ********* edna if i whom he has robbed of all that made life *********** i standing here in my lonely old age in sight of the graves of my murdered ********** i can forgive him and pray for him and as god is my witness love him you have no right to visit my injuries and my sorrows upon him edna looked in amazement at his troubled earnest countenance and exclaimed oh if he knew all your noble charity your unparalleled magnanimity surely surely your influence would be his salvation his stubborn bitter heart would be melted but sir i should have a right to expect annies sad fate if i could forget her sufferings and her wrongs mr hammond rose and walked to the window and after a time when he resumed his seat his eyes were full of tears and his wrinkled face was strangely pallid my darling annie my sweet fragile flower my precious little daughter so like her sainted mother ah it is not surprising that she could not resist his fascinations but edna he never loved my pet lamb do you know that you have become almost as dear to me as my own dead child she deceived me she was willing to forsake her father in his old age but through long years you have never once betrayed my perfect confidence the old man put his thin hand on the orphans head and turned the countenance toward him my dear little girl you will not think me impertinently curious when i ask you a question which my sincere affection for and interest in you certainly sanction do you love st elmo mr hammond it is not love for esteem respect confidence belong to love but i can not deny that he ****** a very singular a wicked fascination over me i dread his evil influence i avoid his presence and know that he is utterly unworthy of any womans trust and ****** ***** sir i feel that i am very weak and i fear that i am unwomanly but i can not despise i can not hate him as i ought to do is not this feeling on your part one of the causes that hurry you away to new york that is certainly one of the reasons why i am anxious to go away as early as possible oh mr hammond much as i love much as i owe you and mrs murray i sometimes wish that i had never come here never seen le bocage and the mocking ******* man who owns it try to believe that somehow in the mysterious divine economy it is all for the best in reviewing the apparently accidental circumstances that placed you among us i have thought that because this was your appointed field of labor god in his wisdom brought you where he designed you to work does mrs murray know that her son offered to make you his wife no no i hope she never will for it would ******* her exceedingly to know that he could be willing to give his proud name to one of whose lineage she is so ignorant how did you know it i knew what his errand must be when he forced himself to visit a spot so fraught with painful memories as my church edna i shall not urge you but ponder well the step you are taking for st elmos future will be colored by your decision i have an abiding and comforting faith that he will yet lift himself out of the ***** of sinful dissipation and scoffing ********** and your hand would aid him as none other human can mr hammond it seems incredible that you can plead for him oh do not tempt me do not make me believe that i could restore his purity of faith and life do not tell me that it would be right to give my hand to a blasphemous murderer oh my own heart is weak enough already i know that i am right in my estimate of his unscrupulous character and i am neither so vain nor so blind as to imagine that my feeble efforts could accomplish for him what all your noble magnanimity and patient endeavors have entirely failed to effect if he can obstinately resist the influence of your life he would laugh mine to scorn it is hard enough for me to leave him when i feel that duty demands it oh my dear mr hammond do not attempt to take from me the only staff which can carry me firmly ****** not make my trial even more severe i must not see his face for i will not be his wife instead of weakening my resolution by holding out flattering hopes of reforming him pray for me oh pray for me that i may be strengthened to flee from a great temptation i will marry no man who is not an earnest humble ******** in the religion of our lord jesus christ rather than become the wife of a sacrilegious ******* such as i know mr murray to be i will so help me god live and work alone and go down to my grave edna earl the minister sighed heavily bear one thing in mind it has been said that in ********** guardianship we sometimes slaughter **** you can not understand my interest in st elmo remember that if his wretched soul is lost at last it will be required at the hands of my son in that dread ******* **** dies ******** we shall stand at the final judgment do you wonder that i struggle in prayer and in all possible human endeavor to rescue him from ruin so that when i am called from earth i can meet the spirit of my only boy with the blessed tidings that the soul he *********** and wellnigh wrecked has been redeemed is safe anchored once more in the faith of christ but i will say no more your own heart and conscience must guide you in this matter it would pour a flood of glorious sunshine upon my sad and anxious heart as i go down to my grave if i could know that you whose life and character i have in great degree moulded were instrumental in saving one whom i have loved so long so well and under such ********** circumstances as my poor st elmo to the mercy of his maker and the intercession of his saviour i commit him as for me i go my way onward upward a short silence ensued and at last edna rose to say goodbye do you still intend to leave at four oclock in the morning i fear you will have bad weather for your journey yes sir i shall certainly start tomorrow and now i must leave you oh my best friend how can i tell you goodbye the minister folded her in his trembling arms and his silver locks mingled with her black hair while he solemnly blessed her she sobbed as he pressed his lips to her forehead and gently put her from him and turning she hurried away anxious to escape the sight of gertrudes accusing face for she supposed that mrs powell had repeated to her daughter mr murrays ******** words since the previous evening she had not spoken to st elmo who did not appear at breakfast but when she passed him in the hall an hour later he was talking to his mother and took no notice of her bow now as the carriage approached the house she glanced in the direction of his apartment and saw him sitting at the window with his elbow resting on the sill and his cheek on his hand she went at once to mrs murray and the interview was long and painful the latter wept freely and insisted that if the orphan grew weary of teaching as she knew would happen she should come back immediately to le bocage where a home would always be hers and to which a true friend would welcome her at length when estelle harding came in with some letters which she wished to submit to her aunts inspection edna retreated to her own quiet room she went to her bureau to complete the packing of her clothes and found on the marble slab a box and note directed to her mr murrays handwriting was remarkably graceful and edna broke the seal which bore his motto **** me ****** ******** edna i send for your examination the contents of the little tomb which you guarded so faithfully read the letters written before i was betrayed the locket attached to a ribbon which was always worn over my heart and the miniatures which it contains are those of agnes hunt and murray hammond read all the record and then judge me as you hope to be judged i sit alone amid the mouldering blackened ruins of my youth will you not listen to the prayer of my heart and the halfsmothered pleadings of your own and come to me in my desolation and help me to build up a new and noble life oh my darling you can make me what you will while you read and ponder i am praying aye praying for the first time in twenty years praying that if god ever hears prayer he will influence your decision and bring you to me edna my darling i wait for you your own st elmo ah how her tortured heart writhed and bled how piteously it pleaded for him and for itself edna opened the locket and if gertrude had stepped into the golden frame the likeness could not have been more startling she looked at it until her lips blanched and were tightly compressed and the memory of gertrude became paramount murray hammonds face she barely glanced at and its extraordinary beauty stared at her like that of some avenging angel with a shudder she put it away and turned to the letters that st elmo had written to agnes and to murray in the early happy days of his engagement tender beautiful loving letters that breathed the most devoted attachment and the purest piety letters that were full of lofty aspirations and religious fervor and generous schemes for the assistance and enlightenment of the poor about le bocage and especially for my noble matchless murray among the papers were several designs for charitable buildings a house of industry an asylum for the blind and a free *********** in an exquisite ivory casket containing a splendid set of diamonds and the costly betrothal ring bearing the initials edna found a sheet of paper around which the blazing necklace was twisted disengaging it she saw that it was a narration of all that had stung him to desperation on the night of the murder as she read the burning taunts the insults the ridicule heaped by the two under the appletree upon the fond faithful generous absent friend she felt the indignant blood gush into her face but she read on and on and two hours elapsed ere she finished the package then came a trial a long fierce agonizing trial such as few women have ever been called upon to pass through such as the world believes no woman ever triumphantly endured girded by prayer the girl went down resolutely into the flames of the furnace and the ordeal was terrible indeed but as often as love showed her the figure of mr murray alone in his dreary sittingroom waiting watching for her she turned and asked of duty the portrait of gertrudes sweet anxious face the picture of dying annie the mournful countenance of a man shut up by iron bars from gods beautiful world from the home and the family who had fondly cherished her in her happy girlhood ere st elmo trailed his poison across her sunny path after another hour the orphan went to her desk and while she wrote a pale cold rigidity settled upon her features which told that she was calmly deliberately shaking hands with the expelled the departing hagar of her hearts hope and happiness to the mercy of god and the love of christ and the judgment of your own conscience i commit you henceforth we walk different paths and after tonight it is my wish that we meet no more on earth mr murray i cannot lift up your darkened soul and you would only drag mine down for your final salvation i shall never cease to pray till we stand face to face before the bar of god edna earl ringing for a servant she sent back the box and even his own note which she longed to keep but would not trust herself to see again and dreading reflection and too miserable to sleep she went to mrs murrays room and remained with her till three oclock then mr murrays voice rang through the house calling for the carriage and as edna put on her bonnet and shawl he knocked at his mothers door it is raining very hard and you must not think of going to the train as you intended but my son the carriage is close and i can not permit you to expose yourself so unnecessarily and in short i will not take you so there is an end of it of course i can stand the weather and i will go over with edna and put her under the care of some one on the train as soon as possible send her down to the carriage i shall order her trunks strapped on he was very pale and stern and his voice rang coldly clear as he turned and went downstairs the parting was very painful and mrs murray followed the orphan to the front door st elmo i wish you would let me go i do not mind the rain impossible you know i have an unconquerable horror of scenes and i do not at all fancy witnessing one that threatens to last until the train leaves go upstairs and cry yourself to sleep in ten minutes that will be much more sensible come edna are you ready the orphan was folded in a last embrace and mr murray held out his hand drew her from his mothers arms and taking his seat beside her in the carriage ordered the coachman to drive on the night was very dark the wind sobbed down the avenue and the rain fell in such torrents that as edna leaned out for a last look at the stately mansion which she had learned to love so well she could only discern the outline of the bronze monsters by the glimmer of the light burning in the hall she shrank far back in one corner and her fingers clutched each other convulsively but when they had passed through the gate and entered the main road mr murrays hand was laid on ******* cold fingers were unlocked gently but firmly and raised to his lips she made an effort to withdraw them but found it useless and the trial which she had fancied was at end seemed only beginning edna this is the last time i shall ever speak to you of myself the last time i shall ever allude to all that has passed it is entirely useless for one to ask you to reconsider if you have no pity for me have some mercy on yourself you can not know how i dread the thought of your leaving me and being roughly handled by a cold selfish ruthless world oh it ******* me when i think of your giving your precious life which would so ******* my home and gladden my desolate heart to a public who will trample upon you if possible and if it can not entirely crush you will only value you as you deserve when with ruined health and withered hopes you sink into the early grave malice and envy will have dug for you already your dear face has grown pale and your eyes have a restless troubled look and shadows are gathering about your young pure fresh spirit my darling you are not strong enough to wrestle with the world you will be trodden down by the masses in this conflict upon which you enter so eagerly do you not know that literati means literally the branded the ******** slave oh if not for my sake at least for your own reconsider before the hot irons **** your brow and hide it here my love keep it white and pure and ********** here in the arms that will never weary of sheltering and clasping you close and safe from the burning brand of fame literati a bondage worse than roman slavery help me to make a proper use of my fortune and you will do more real good to your race than by all you can ever accomplish with your pen no matter how successful it may prove if you were selfish and heartless as other women adulation and celebrity and the praise of the public might satisfy you but you are not and i have studied your nature too thoroughly to mistake the result of your ambitious career my darling ambition is the mirage of the literary desert you are anxious to traverse it is the **** ******* the ****** water which will ever recede and mock your thirsty ********* soul dear little pilgrim do not ****** your feet and wear out your life in the hot blinding sands struggling in vain for the constantly fading vanishing ***** of happy literary celebrity ah the sahara

indeed hard to resist no mr murray my decision is unalterable if you do really love me spare me spare me further entreaty before we part there are some things i should like to say and i have little time left will you hear me he did not answer but tightened his arm drew her head to his bosom and leaned his face down on hers mr murray i want to leave my bible with you because there are many passages marked which would greatly comfort and help you it is the most precious thing i possess for grandpa gave it to me when i was a little girl and i could not bear to leave it with any one but you i have it here in my hand will you look into it sometimes if i give it to you he merely put out his hand and took it from her she paused a few seconds and as he remained silent she continued mr hammond is the best friend you have on earth yesterday having seen you enter the church and suspecting what passed he spoke to me of you and oh he pleaded for you as only he could he urged me not to judge you too harshly not to leave you and these were his words edna if i whom he has robbed of all that life made beautiful if i standing here alone in my old age in sight of the graves of my murdered darlings if i can forgive him and pray for him and as god is my witness love him you have no right to visit my injuries and my sorrows upon him mr murray he can help you and he will if you will only permit him if you could realize how dearly he is interested in your happiness you could not fail to reverence that religion which enables him to triumph over all the natural feelings of resentment mr murray you have declared again and again that you love me oh if it be true meet me in heaven i know that i am weak and sinful but i am trying to correct the faults of my character i am striving to do what i believe to be my duty and i hope at last to find a home with my god for several years ever since you went abroad i have been praying for you and while i live i shall not cease to do so oh will you not pray for yourself mr murray i believe i shall not be happy even in heaven if i do not see you there on earth we are ********** crimes divide us but there there oh for my sake make an effort to redeem yourself and meet me there she felt his strong frame tremble and a heavy shuddering sigh broke from his lips and swept across her cheek but when he spoke his words contained no hint of the promise she longed to receive edna my shadow has fallen across your heart and i am not afraid that you will forget me you will try to do so you will give me as little thought as possible you will struggle to crush your aching heart and endeavor to be famous but amid your ******** the memory of a lonely man who loves you infinitely better than all the world for which you forsook him will come like a breath from the sepulchre to wither your bays and my words my pleading words will haunt you rising above the ****** of your public worshippers when the laurel crown you covet now shall become a ******* of thorns piercing your temples or a band of iron that makes your brow ache you will think mournfully of the days gone by when i prayed for the privilege of resting your weary head here on my heart you can not forget me sinful and unworthy as i confess myself i am conqueror i triumph now even though you never permit me to look upon your face again for i believe i have a place in my darlings heart which no other man which not the whole world can usurp or fill you are too proud to acknowledge it too truthful to deny it but my pure pearl my heart feels it as well as yours and it is a comfort of which all time can not rob me without it how could i face my future so desolate sombre lonely edna the hour has come when in accordance with your own decree we part for twenty years no womans lips except my mothers have touched mine until yesterday when they pressed yours perhaps we may never meet again in this world and ah do not shrink away from me i want to kiss you once more my darling my darling i shall wear it on my lips till death ******** them and i am not at all afraid that any other man will ever be allowed to touch lips that belong to me alone that i have made and here seal all my own goodbye he strained her to him and pressed his lips twice to hers then the carriage stopped at the railroad station he handed her out found a seat for her in the cars which had just arrived arranged her wrappings comfortably and went back to attend to her trunks she sat near an open window and though it rained heavily he buttoned his coat to the throat and stood just beneath it with his eyes bent down twice she pronounced his name but he did not seem to hear her and edna put her hand lightly on his shoulder and said do not stand here in the rain in a few minutes we shall start and i prefer that you should not wait please go home at once mr murray he shook his head but caught her hand and leaned his cheek against the soft palm passing it gently and caressingly over his haggard face the engine whistled mr murray pressed a long warm kiss on the hand he had taken the cars moved on and as he lifted his hat giving her one of his imperial graceful bows edna had a last glimpse of the dark chiselled repulsive yet handsome face that had throws its baleful image deep in her young heart and defied all her efforts to expel it the wind howled around the cars the rain fell heavily beating a dismal tattoo on the glass the night was mournfully dreary and the orphan sank back and lowered her veil and hid her face in her hands henceforth she felt that in obedience to her own decision and fiat they stood aloof the scars remaining like cliffs that had been rent asunder a dreary sea now flows between but neither heat nor frost nor thunder shall wholly do away i **** the marks of that which once hath been as day dawned the drab clouds blanched broke up in ******* masses the rain ceased the wind sang out of the west heralding the coming blue and gold and at noon not one pearly vapor sail dotted the sky during the afternoon edna looked anxiously for the first glimpse of lookout but a trifling accident detained the train for several hours and it was almost twilight when she saw it a purple spot staining the clear beryl horizon spreading rapidly shifting its ****** mantle for gray robes and at length the rising moon silvered its rocky crest as it towered in silent majesty over the little village nestled at its base the kind and gentlemanly conductor on the cars accompanied edna to the hotel and gave her a parcel containing several late papers as she sat in her small room weary and yet sleepless she tried to divert her thoughts by reading the journals and found in three of them notices of the last number of magazine and especial mention of her essay keeping the vigil of st martin under the pines of ****** the extravagant ********** of this article surprised her and she saw that while much curiosity was indulged concerning the authorship one of the editors ventured to attribute it to a celebrated and very able writer whose genius and erudition had lifted him to an enviable eminence in the world of american letters the criticisms were excessively flattering and the young author gratified at the complete success that had crowned her efforts cut out the friendly notices intending to enclose them in a letter to mrs murray unable to sleep giving audience to memories of her early childhood she passed the night at her window watching the constellations go down behind the dark frowning mass of rock that lifted its parapets to the midnight sky and in the morning light saw the cold misty **** drawn over the venerable hoary head the village had changed so materially that she could scarcely recognize any of the old landmarks and the people who kept the hotel could tell her nothing about peter wood the miller after breakfast she took a box containing some flowers packed in wet cotton and walked out on the road leading in the direction of the blacksmiths shop very soon the trees became familiar she remembered every turn of the road and bend on the fences and at last the grove of oak and chestnut shading the knoll at the intersection of the roads met her eye she looked for the forge and ******* for the anvil and ******** but shop and shed had fallen to decay and only a heap of rubbish overgrown with rank weeds and vines marked the spot where she had spent so many happy hours the glowing yellow chestnut leaves dropped down at her feet and the oaks tossed their gnarled arms as if welcoming the wanderer whose head they had shaded in infancy and stifling a moan the orphan hurried on she saw that the timber had been cut down and fences enclosed cultivated fields where forests had stood when she went away at a sudden bend in the narrow irregular road when she held her breath and leaned forward to see the old house where she was born and reared a sharp cry of pain escaped her not a vestige of the homestead remained save the rocky chimney standing in memoriam in the centre of a cornfield she leaned against the low fence and tears trickled down her cheeks as memory rebuilt the ******** and placed the ************* rockingchair on the porch in front and filled it with the figure of a whitehaired old man with his pipe in his hand and his blurred eyes staring at the moon through the brown ********** she could see the gaping mouth of the well now partly filled with rubbish and the wreaths of scarlet cypress which once fringed the shed above it and hung their flaming trumpets down until they almost touched her childish head as she sang at the well where she scoured the cedar ****** were bereft of all support and trailed helplessly over the ground close to the fence and beyond the reach of plough and hoe a yellow ********** with closed flowers marked the location of the little garden and one tall ******** leaned against the fence sole ******** of the blue pets that edna had loved so well in the early years she put her fingers through a crevice broke the ***** spray and as she pressed it to her face she dropped her head upon the rails and gave herself up to the flood of painful yet inexpressibly precious memories how carefully she had worked and ****** this little **** how proud she once was of her ******** and ***** her double ******** poppies her ************ ********** how eagerly she had transplanted wood violets and purple phlox from the forest how often she had sat on the steps watching for her grandfathers return and stringing those ********** blossoms into golden crowns for her own young head and how gayly she had sometimes swung them over brindles horns when she went out to milk her ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawns the earliest pipe of ************ birds to dying ears when unto dying eyes the ******** slowly grows a glimmering square so sad so strange the days that are no more with a sob she turned away and walked in the direction of the buryingground for there certainly she would find all unchanged graves at least were permanent the little spring bubbled as of yore the brush creepers made a tangled tapestry around it and crimson and blue convolvulus swung their velvety ********* chalices above it as on that june morning long ago when she stood there filling her bucket waiting for the sunrise she took off her gloves knelt down beside the spring and dipping up the cold sparkling water in her palms drank and wept and drank again she bathed her aching eyes and almost cheated herself into the belief that she heard again ***** fierce bark ringing through the woods and the slow drowsy tinkle of brindles bell turning aside from the beaten track she entered the thick grove of chestnuts and looked around for the grave of the dents but the mound had disappeared and though she recognized the particular tree which had formerly overhung it and searched the ground carefully she could discover no trace of the hillock where she had so often scattered flowers a squirrel leaped and ******* in the boughs above her and she startled a rabbit from the thick grass and fallen yellow leaves but neither these nor the ******* of gossiping ******* nor the harsh hungry cry of a ******** told her a syllable of all that had happened in her absence she conjectured that the bodies had probably been *********** by friends and removed to georgia and she hurried on toward the hillside where the neighborhood graveyard was situated the rude unpainted paling still enclosed it and rows of ********** stretched away among grass and weeds but whose was that shining marble shaft standing in the centre of a neatly arranged square around which ran a handsome iron railing on that very spot in years gone by had stood a piece of pine board sacred to the memory of aaron hunt an honest blacksmith and true christian who had dared to disturb his bones to violate his last restingplace and to steal his grave for the interment of some wealthy stranger a cry of horror and astonishment broke from the orphans trembling lips and she shaded her eyes with her hand and tried to read the name inscribed on the monument of the sacrilegious interloper but bitter scalding tears of indignation blinded her she dashed them away but they gathered and fell faster and ********* the gate she entered the enclosure and stepped close to the marble these gilded words were traced on the polished surface of the pure white ******* and on each corner of the square pedestal or base stood beautifully carved vases from which drooped glossy tendrils of ivy as edna looked in amazement at the glittering shaft which rose twenty feet in the autumn air as she rubbed her eyes and reread the golden inscription and looked at the ****** walks and the *********** evergreens which told that careful hands kept the lot in order she sank down at the base of the beautiful monument and laid her hot cheek on the cold marble oh grandpa grandpa he is not altogether wicked and callous as we once thought him or he could never have done this forgive your poor little pearl if she can not help loving one who for her sake honors your dear name and memory oh grandpa if i had never gone away from here if i could have died before i saw him again before this great pain fell upon my heart she knew now where st elmo murray went that night after he had watched her from behind the sarcophagus and the mummies knew that only his hand could have erected this noble pillar of record and most fully did she appreciate the delicate feeling which made him so proudly reticent on this subject he wished no element of gratitude in the love he had endeavored to win and scorned to take advantage of her devoted affection for her grandfather by touching her heart with a knowledge of the tribute paid to his memory until this moment she had sternly refused to permit herself to believe all his protestations of love had tried to think that he merely desired to make her acknowledge his power and confess an affection flattering to his vanity but today she felt that all he had avowed was true that his proud bitter heart was indeed entirely hers that this assurance filled her own heart with a measureless joy a rapture that made her eyes sparkle through their tears and brought a momentary glow to her cheeks hour after hour passed she took no note of time and sat there pondering her past life thinking how the dusty heart deep under the marble would have throbbed with fond pride if it could only have known what the world said of her writings that she should prove competent to teach the neighbors children had been aaron hunts loftiest ambition for his darling and now she was deemed worthy to speak to her race through the columns of a periodical that few women were considered able to fill she wondered if he were not really cognizant of it all if he were not watching her struggles and her triumph and she asked herself why he was not allowed in token of tender sympathy to drop one palmleaf on her head from the fadeless branch he waved in heaven oh how far how far and safe god dost thou keep thy saints when once gone from us we may call against the lighted windows of thy fair june heaven where all the souls are happy and not one not even my father look from work or play to ask who is it that cries after us below there in the dark the shaft threw a long slanting shadow eastward as the orphan rose and taking from the box the fragrant exotics which she had brought from le bocage arranged them in the damp soil of one of the vases and twined their ********** petals among the dark green ivy leaves one shining wreath she broke and laid away tenderly in the box a hallowed souvenir of the sacred spot where it grew and as she stood there looking at a garland of poppy leaves chiselled around the inscription neither flush nor tremor told aught that passed in her mind and her sculptured features were calm as the afternoon sun showed how pale and fixed her face had grown she climbed upon the broad base and pressed her lips to her grandfathers name and there was a mournful sweetness in her voice as she said aloud pray god to pardon him grandpa pray christ to comfort and save his precious soul oh grandpa pray the holy spirit to melt and sanctify his suffering heart it was painful to quit the place she lingered and started away and came back and at last knelt down and hid her face and prayed long and silently then turning quickly she closed the iron gate and without trusting herself for another look walked away she passed the spring and the homestead ruins and finally found herself in sight of the millers house which alone seemed unchanged as she lifted the latch of the gate and entered the yard it seemed but yesterday that she was driven away to the depot in the millers covered cart an ancient appletree that she well remembered stood near the house and the spreading branches were bent almost to the earth with the weight of *********** apples round and ripe the shaggy black dog that so often ********* with grip in the days gone by now lay on the step ******** at the sun and the flies that now and then buzzed over the golden ****** whose crimson seed glowed in the evening sunshine over the rocky well rose a rude arbor where a *********** vine clambered and hung its rich luscious brown clusters and here with a pipe between her lips and at her feet a basket full of red ********** which she was busily engaged in stringing sat an elderly woman she was clad in blue and yellow plaid homespun and wore a white apron and a snowy muslin cap whose ******* ruffles pressed caressingly the grizzled hair combed so smoothly over her temples presently she laid her pipe down on the top of the mossy well where the dripping bucket sat and lifted the scarlet wreath of ******* eyed it satisfactorily and as she resumed her work began to hum auld lang syne should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind should auld acquaintance be forgot and days o lang syne the countenance was so peaceful and earnest and honest that as edna stood watching it a warm loving light came into her own beautiful eyes and she put out both hands unconsciously and stepped into the little arbor her shadow fell upon the ******** face and the woman rose and courtesied good evening miss will you be seated there is room enough for two on my bench the orphan did not speak for a moment but looked up in the brown wrinkled face and then pushing back her bonnet and veil she said eagerly mrs wood dont

but tired from my journey and from walking all about the old place and like enough youve cried a deal your eyes are heavy you know honey the old house burnt down one ******* night in march and so we

never did i see a child grieve so mrs wood who keeps the walks so clean and the evergreens so nicely cut my willis to be sure the gentleman that came here and fixed everything last december paid

his name mr murray and he has been very kind to me but edna i thought you went to the factory to work do tell me how you fell into the hands of such rich people edna briefly acquainted her with what had occurred during her long absence and informed her of her plans for the future and while she listened mrs wood lighted her pipe and resting her elbow on her knee dropped her face on her hands and watched her visitors countenance finally she nodded to her daughter saying do you hear that ***** she can write for the papers and get paid for it and she is smart enough to teach well well that makes me say what i do say and i stick to it where theres a will theres a way and where theres no hearty will all the ways in creation wont take folks to an education some children cant be kicked and kept

some for another jerusalem ********** wont bear **** and persimmons dont grow on ********** she put her brawny brown hand on ednas forehead and smoothed the bands of hair and sighed heavily mrs wood i should like to see brindle once more lord bless your soul honey she has been dead these three years why you forget cows dont hang on as long as ********** and brindle was no yearling when we took her she ***** down in the swamp back of the millpond and before we could find her she was dead but her calf is as pretty a young thing as ever you saw speckled all over most as thick as a guinea and the children call her speckle willis step out and see if the ****** is in sight edna ant you going to stay with me tonight thank you mrs wood i should like very much to do so but have not time and must get back to chattanooga before the train leaves for i am obliged to go on tonight well any how lay off your bonnet and stay and let me give you some supper and then we will all go back with you that is if you ant too proud to ride to town in our cart we have got a new cart but it is only a millers cart and may be it wont suit your fine fashionable clothes i shall be very glad to stay and i only wish it was the same old cart that took me to the depot more than five years ago please give me some water mrs wood rolled up her sleeves put away her pretty ******* and talking vigorously all the time prepared some refreshments for her guest a table was set under the appletree a snowy cotton cloth spread over it and yellow butter tempting as ******* and a loaf of fresh bread and honey ********* and buttermilk and ***** and ****** pears and a dish of ripe red apples crowned the board the air was laden with the fragrance it stole in crossing a ******** beyond the road the bees darted in and out of their ***** and a peacock spread his iridescent feathers to catch the level yellow rays of the setting sun and from the distant millpond came the ****** of geese as the noisy fleet ******** the ripples speckle who had been driven to the gate for ednas inspection stood close to the paling thrusting her pearly horns through the cracks and watching the party at the table with her large liquid beautiful earnest eyes and afar off lookout rose solemn and sombre edna you eat nothing what ails you child they say too much ********* is not healthy and i reckon you study too hard better stay here with me honey and run around the woods and get some red in your face and churn and spin and drink buttermilk and get plump and go ************ with my children goodness knows they are

will give speckle to you thank you dear mrs wood i wish i could but the lady who engaged me to teach her children wrote that i was very much needed and consequently i must hurry on speckle is a perfect little beauty but i would not be so selfish as to take her away from you clouds began to gather in the southwest and as the covered cart was brought to the gate a distant mutter of thunder told that a storm was brewing mrs wood and her two children accompanied the orphan and as they drove through the woods myriads of fireflies starred the gloom it was dark when they reached the station and willis brought the trunks from the hotel and found seats for the party in the cars which were rapidly filling with passengers presently the ********* from knoxville came thundering in and the usual rush and bustle ensued mrs wood gave the orphan a hearty kiss and warm embrace and bidding her be sure to write soon and say how you are getting along the kindhearted woman left the cars wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron at last the locomotive ********* that all was ready and as the train moved on edna caught a glimpse of a form standing under a lamp leaning with folded arms against the ***** form strangely like mr murrays she leaned out and watched it till the cars swept round a curve and lamp and figure and village vanished how could he possibly be in chattanooga the conjecture was absurd she was the victim of some ******* illusion with a long ************ sigh she leaned against the *********** and looked at the dark mountain mass looming behind her and after a time when the storm drew nearer she saw it only now and then as a vivid vindictive and serpentine flash ***** the darkness and shore it across with a gash in one of those brownstone palatial houses on fifth avenue which make the name of the street a synonym for almost royal luxury and magnificence sat mrs andrewss new governess a week after her arrival in new york her reception though cold and formal had been ************* courteous and a few days sufficed to give the stranger an accurate insight into the characters and customs of the family with whom she was now ************ though goodnatured intelligent and charitable mrs andrews was devoted to society and gave to the demands of fashion much of the time which had been better expended at home in training her children and making her hearthstone rival the attractions of the club where mr andrews generally spent his leisure hours she was much younger than her husband was handsome gay and ambitious and the polished hauteur of her bearing often reminded edna of mrs murray while mr andrews seemed immersed in business during the day and was rarely at home except at his meals felix the eldest of the two children was a ******* spoiled exacting boy of twelve years of age endowed with a remarkably active intellect but pitiably dwarfed in body and hopelessly lame in consequence of a deformed foot his sister hattie was only eight years old a bright pretty affectionate girl over whom felix tyrannized unmercifully and whom from earliest recollection had been accustomed to yield both her rights and privileges to the fretful invalid the room occupied by the governess was small but beautifully furnished and as it was situated in the fourth story the windows commanded a view of the trees in a neighboring park and the waving outline of long island on the day of her arrival mrs andrews entered into a minute analysis of the characters of the children indicated the course which she wished pursued toward them and impressing upon edna the grave responsibility of her position the mother gave her children to the strangers guardianship and seemed to consider her maternal duties fully discharged edna soon ascertained that her predecessors had found the path intolerably thorny and abandoned it in consequence of felixs uncontrollable fits of ********** and passion ****** and *********** had quickly ********** and as the cripple finally declared he would not tolerate the former his mother resolved to humor his caprice in the choice of a teacher fortunately the boy was exceedingly fond of his books and as the physicians forbade the constant use of his eyes the governess was called on to read aloud at least one half of the day from eight oclock in the morning till eight at night the whole care of these children devolved on edna who ate talked drove with them accompanied them wherever their inclination led and had not one quiet moment from breakfast until her pupils went to sleep sometimes felix was restless and wakeful and on such occasions he insisted that his governess should come and read him to sleep notwithstanding the boys imperious nature he possessed some redeeming traits and edna soon became much attached to him while his affection for his new keeper astonished and delighted his mother for a week after ednas arrival inclement weather prevented the customary daily drive which contributed largely to the happiness of the little cripple but one afternoon as the three sat in the schoolroom felix threw his latin grammar against the wall and exclaimed i want to see the swans in central park and i mean to go even if it does rain hattie ring for patrick to bring the ***** round to the door miss earl dont you want to go yes for there is no longer any danger of rain the sun is shining beautifully and besides i hope you will be more amiable when you get into the open air she gave him his hat and crutches took his gray shawl on her arm and they went down to the neat carriage drawn by a handsome chestnut horse and set apart for the use of the children as they entered the park edna noticed that the boys eyes brightened and that he looked eagerly at every passing face now hattie you must watch on your side and i will keep a good lookout on mine i wonder if she will come this evening for whom are you both looking asked the teacher oh for little lila bro felixs sweetheart laughed hattie glancing at him with a mischievous twinkle in her bright eyes no such thing never had a sweetheart in my life dont be silly hattie mind your window or i guess we shant see her well any how i heard uncle gray tell mamma that he kissed his sweethearts hand at the party and i saw bro felix kiss ***** last week i didnt miss earl cried the cripple ********* as he spoke oh he did miss earl stop ******** me bro felix my arm is all black and blue now there she is look here on my side here is red ********** edna saw a little girl clad in scarlet and led by a grave middleaged nurse who was walking leisurely toward one of the lakes felix put his head out of the window and called to the woman hannah are going to feed the swans good evening yes we are going there now well we will meet you there what is the childs name asked edna lila manning and she is deaf and dumb we talk to her on our fingers they left the carriage and approached the groups of children gathered on the edge of the water and at sight of felix the little girl in scarlet sprang to meet him moving her slender fingers rapidly as she conversed with him she was an exceedingly lovely but fragile child apparently about hatties age and as edna watched the changing expression of her delicate features she turned to the nurse and asked is she an orphan yes miss but she will never find it out as long as her uncle lives he makes a great pet of her what is his name and where does he live mr douglass g manning he boards at ************* street but he spends most of his time at the office no matter what time of night he comes home he never goes to his own room till he has looked at lila and kissed her goodnight master felix please dont ***** her hat the wind will blow her hair all out of curl for some time the children were much amused in watching the swans and when they expressed themselves willing to resume their drive an arrangement was made with hannah to meet at the same place the ensuing day they returned to the carriage and felix said dont you think lila is a little beauty yes i quite agree with you do you know her uncle no and dont want to know him he is too cross and sour i have seen him walking sometimes with lila and mamma has him at her parties and dinners but hattie and i never see the company unless we peep and above all things i hate peeping it is ********* and vulgar only poor people peep mr manning is an old bachelor and very ******* so my uncle grey says he is the editor of themagazine that mamma declares she cant live without look look hattie there goes mamma this minute stop patrick uncle grey uncle grey hold up wont you and let me see the new horses an elegant phaeton drawn by a pair of superb black horses drew up close to the ***** and mrs andrews and her only brother mr grey chilton leaned forward and spoke to the children while mr chilton who was driving teased hattie by touching her head and shoulders with his whip uncle grey i think the bays are the handsomest which proves you utterly incapable of judging ********** for these are the finest horses in the city i presume this is miss earl though nobody seems polite enough to introduce us he raised his hat slightly bowed and drove on is this the first time you have met my uncle asked felix yes does he live in the city why he lives with us havent you seen him about the house you must have heard him romping around with hattie for they make noise enough to call in the police i think my uncle grey is the handsomest man i ever saw except edwin booth when he plays hamlet what do you say as i had barely a glimpse of your uncle i formed no opinion felix button your coat and draw your shawl over your shoulders it is getting cold when they reached home the children begged for some music and placing her hat on a chair edna sat down before the piano and played and sang while felix stood leaning on his crutches gazing earnestly into the face of his teacher the song was *********** rainy day and when she concluded it the cripple laid his thin hand on hers and said sing the last verse again i feel as if i should always be a good boy if you would only sing that for me every day into each life some rain must fall yes lameness fell into mine while she complied with his request edna watched his sallow face and saw tears gather in the large sad eyes and she felt that henceforth the boys evil spirit could be exorcised miss earl we never had a governess at all like you they were old and cross and ugly and didnt love to play chess and could not sing and i hated them but i do like you and i will try to be good he rested his head against her arm and she turned and kissed his pale broad forehead halloo felix flirting with your governess this is a new phase of school life you ought to feel quite honored miss earl though upon my word i am sorry for you the excessive amiability of my nephew has driven not less than six of your predecessors in confusion from the field leaving him victorious i warn you he is an incipient ******* and the schoolroom is the ******* comte of his campaigns mr chilton came up to the piano and curiously scanned ednas face but taking her hat and veil she rose and moved toward the door saying i am disposed to believe that he has been quite as much ****** against as ******* come children it is time for your tea from that hour her influence over the boy strengthened so rapidly that before she had been a month in the house he yielded implicit obedience to her wishes and could not bear for her to leave him even for a moment when more than usually fretful and inclined to ********* over hattie or speak disrespectfully to his mother a warning glance or word from edna or the soft touch of her hand would suffice to restrain the threatened outbreak her days were passed in teaching reading aloud and talking to the children and when released from her duties she went invariably to her desk devoting more than half the night to the completion of her ms as she took her meals with her pupils she rarely saw the other members of the household and though mr chilton now and then sauntered into the schoolroom and ********* with hattie his visits were coldly received by the teacher who met his attempts at conversation with very discouraging ************ replies his manner led her to suspect that the goodlooking ******* was as vain and heartless as he was frivolous and she felt no inclination to listen to his trifling sans ***** chatter consequently when he thrust himself into her presence she either picked up a book or left him to be entertained by the children one evening in november she sat in her own room preparing to write and pondering the probable fate of a sketch which she had finished and dispatched two days before to the office of the magazine the principal aim of the little tale was to portray the horrors and sin of duelling and she had written it with great care but well aware of the vast powerful current of popular opinion that she was bravely striving to stem and fully conscious that it would subject her to severe animadversion from those who defended the custom she could not ****** herself of apprehension lest the article should be rejected the door bell rang and soon after a servant brought her a card mr ** manning to see miss earl flattered and frightened by a visit from one whose opinions she valued so highly edna smoothed her hair and with trembling fingers changed her collar and cuffs and went downstairs feeling as if all the blood in her body were beating a tattoo on the drum of her ears as she entered the library into which he had been shown mrs andrews having guests in the parlor edna had an opportunity of looking unobserved at this critical ogre of whom she stood in such profound awe douglass manning was forty years old tall and well built wore slender *********** spectacles which somewhat softened the light of his keen cold black eyes and carried his slightly bald head with the haughty air of one who habitually hurled his gauntlet in the teeth of public opinion he stood looking up at a pair of bronze griffins that crouched on the top of the rosewood bookcase and the gaslight falling full on his face showed his stern massive features which in their ******** cast reminded edna of those egyptian *************** serene ********** there were no furrows on cheek or brow no beard veiled the lines and angles about the mouth but as she marked the chilling repose of the countenance so indicative of conscious power and wellregulated strength why did memory travel swiftly back among the stones of venice repeating the description of the ******** on ******* cathedral a perfect ***** of may had this man petrified in his youth before the steady ****** of time left on his features that subtle tracery which passing years engrave on human faces the motto of his magazine ******* sine ********* ruled his life and putting aside the lenses of passion and prejudice he coolly quietly relentlessly judged men and women and their works neither loving nor hating pitying nor ********* his race looking neither to right nor left laboring steadily as a thoroughly ************ a marvellously perfect intellectual automaton good evening mr manning i am very glad to meet you for i fear my letters have very inadequately expressed my gratitude for your kindness her voice trembled slightly and she put out her hand he turned bowed offered her a chair and as they seated themselves he examined her face as he would have searched the ********* of some new book for an insight into its contents when did you reach new york miss earl six weeks ago i was not aware that you were in the city until i received your note two days since how long do you intend to remain probably the rest of my life if i find it possible to support myself comfortably is mrs andrews an old friend no sir she was a stranger to me when i entered her house as governess for her children miss earl you are much younger than i had supposed your writings led me to imagine that you were at least thirty whereas i find you almost a child will your duties as governess conflict with your literary labors no sir i shall continue to write you appear to have acted upon my suggestion to abandon the idea of a book and confine your attention to short sketches no sir i adhere to my original purpose and am at work upon the manuscript which you advised me to destroy he fitted his glasses more firmly on his nose and she saw the gleam of his strong white teeth as a half smile moved his lips miss earl my desk is very near a window and as i was writing late last night i noticed several large moths beating against the glass which fortunately barred their approach to the flame of the gas inside perhaps inexperience whispered that it was a cruel fate that shut them out but which ***** ******* disappointed curiosity or singed wings mr manning why do you apprehend more danger from writing a book than from the preparation of magazine articles simply because the peril is inherent in the nature of the book you contemplate unless i totally misunderstand your views you indulge in the rather extraordinary belief that all works of fiction should be eminently ******** and ********* not only sound morality but scientific theories herein permit me to say you entirely misapprehend the spirit of the age people read novels merely to be amused not educated and they will not tolerate technicalities and abstract speculation in lieu of exciting plots and ************ *********** persons who desire to learn something of astronomy ******* chemistry philology etc never think of finding what they require in the pages of a novel but apply at once to the textbooks of the respective sciences and would as soon hunt for a lovers sentimental dialogue in newtons ********* or spicy ********* in ***** ******** as expect an ******* of modern science in a work of fiction but sir how many habitual novel readers do you suppose will educate themselves thoroughly from the textbooks to which you refer a modicum i grant you yet it is equally true that those who merely read to be amused will not ****** the scientific dishes you set before them on the contrary far from appreciating your charitable efforts to elevate and ******* their range of vision they will either sneer at the authors pedantry or **** over every passage that ************ thought to comprehend it and rush on to the next page to discover whether the heroine miss ******* ******** penelope brown wore blue or pink ******** to her first ball or whether on the day of her ********* the indignant papa succeeded in preventing the consummation of her felicity with mr ********** ******** nebuchadnezzar smith i neither ******* nor dwarf i merely state a simple fact but mr manning do you not regard the writers of each age as the ********** of its tastes as well as its morals certainly not they simply reflect and do not mould public taste shakespeare ******* ******** ********* men and things as they found them not as they might could would or should have been was sir peter **** responsible for the style of dress

where an author may concentrate all the erudition he can obtain and ********* it ************ for review writers now serve the public in much the same capacity that ********** did royalty in ancient days and they are expected to taste strong liquors as well as sweet ******** and sour light wines moreover a certain haze of sanctity ******** the precincts of maga whence the ********* we thunders

ignominiously with the tide of degenerate opinion that depends altogether on the earnestness of your desire for martyrdom by drowning i have seen stronger ******** than you go down after desperate efforts to keep their heads above water edna folded her hands in her lap and looked steadily into the calm cold eyes of the editor then shook her head and answered i shall not drown at all events i will risk it i would rather sink in the effort than live without attempting it when you require ointment for singed wings i shall have no sympathy with which to ****** them for like most of your sex i see you mistake blind obstinacy for rational heroic firmness the next number of the magazine will contain the contribution you sent me two days since and while i do not accept all your views i think it by far the best thing i have yet seen from your pen it will of course provoke controversy but for that result i presume you are prepared miss earl you are a stranger in new york and if i can serve you in any way i shall be glad to do so thank you mr manning i need some books which i am not able to purchase and can not find in this house if you can spare them temporarily from your library you will confer a great favor on me certainly have you a list of those which you require no sir but here is a pencil and piece of paper write down the titles and i will have them sent to you in the morning she turned to the table to prepare the list and all the while mr mannings keen eyes scanned her countenance dress and figure a halfsmile once more stirred his grave lips when she gave him the paper over which he glanced indifferently miss earl i fear you will regret your determination to make literature a profession for your letters informed me that you are poor and doubtless you remember the ********* concerning the republic of letters which contained not a sovereign your friend mr murray appreciated the obstacles you are destined to encounter and i am afraid you will not find life in new york as agreeable as it was under his roof when did you hear from him i received a letter this morning and you called to see me because he requested you to do so i had determined to come before his letter arrived he noticed the incredulous smile that flitted across her face and after a moments pause he continued i do not wish to discourage you on the contrary i sincerely desire to aid you but mill has analyzed the subject very ably in his political economy and declares that on any rational calculation of chances in the existing competition no writer can hope to gain a living by books and to do so by magazines and reviews becomes daily more difficult yes sir that passage is not encouraging but i comfort myself with another from the same book in a national or universal point of view the labor of the ****** or speculative thinker is as much a part of production in the very ********* sense as that of the inventor of a practical art the *************** telegraph was the wonderful and most unexpected consequence of the experiments of ******* and the mathematical investigations of ****** and the modern art of navigation is an ********* ********* from the purely speculative and apparently meekly curious inquiry by the ************** of alexandria into the ********** of three curves formed by the intersection of a plane surface and a **** no limit can be set to the importance even in a purely productive and material point of view of mere thought sir the economic law which ********* the wages of mechanics should operate correspondingly in the realm of letters your memory is remarkably accurate not always sir but when i put it on its honor and trust some special treasure to its guardianship it rarely proves treacherous i think you can command better wages for your work in new york than anywhere else on this continent you have begun well permit me to say to you be careful do not write too rapidly and do not despise adverse criticism if agreeable to you i will call early next week and accompany you to the public libraries which contain much that may interest you i will send you a note as soon as i ******** when i can command the requisite leisure and should you need my services i hope you will not hesitate to claim them goodevening miss earl he bowed himself out of the library and edna went back to her own room thinking of the brief interview and ********** her disappointment in the conversation of this most dreaded of critics he is polished as an ****** and quite as cold he may be very accurate and astute and profound but certainly he is not half so brilliant as she did not complete the parallel but compressed her lips took up her pen and began to write on the following morning mrs andrews came into the schoolroom and after kissing her children turned blandly to the governess miss earl i believe mr manning called upon you last evening where did you know him i never saw him until yesterday but we have corresponded for some time indeed you are quite honored he is considered very fastidious he is certainly ************* yet i have found him kind and gentlemanly even courteous our correspondence is entirely attributable to the fact that i write for his magazine mrs andrews dropped her ivory ************* and sat for a moment the picture of ******** amazement is it possible i had no idea you were an author why did you not tell me before what have you written edna mentioned the titles of her published articles and the lady of the house exclaimed oh that vigil of ****** is one of the most beautiful things i ever read and i have often teased mr manning to tell me who wrote it that ********** to the thirty confederates is so mournfully grand that it brings tears to my eyes why miss earl you will be famous some day if i had your genius i should never think of plodding through life as a governess but my dear madam i must make my bread and am compelled to teach while i write i do not see what time you have for writing i notice you never leave the children till they are asleep and you must sleep enough to keep yourself alive are you writing anything at present i finished an article several days ago which will be published in the next number of the magazine of course i have no leisure during the day but i work till late at night miss earl if you have no objection to acquainting me with your history i should like very much to know something of your early life and education while edna gave a brief account of her childhood felix nestled his hand into hers and laid his head on her knee listening eagerly to every word when she concluded mrs andrews mused a moment and then said henceforth miss earl you will occupy a different position in my house and i shall take pleasure in introducing you to such of my friends as will appreciate your talent i hope you will not confine yourself exclusively to my children but come down sometimes in the evening and sit with me and moreover i prefer that you should dine with us instead of with these nursery folks who are not quite capable of appreciating you how do you know that mamma i can tell you one thing i appreciated her before i found out that she was likely to be famous before i knew that mr manning condescended to notice her we nursery folk judge for ourselves we dont wait to find out what other people think and i shant give up miss earl she is my governess and i wish you would just let her alone there was a touch of scorn in the boys impatient tone and his mother bit her lip and laughed ************* really felix who gave you a bill of sale to miss earl she should consider herself exceedingly fortunate as she is the first of all your teachers with whom you have not quarrelled most shamefully even fought and scratched and because she is sweet and good and pretty and i love her you must interfere and take her off to entertain your company she came here to take care of hattie and me and not to go downstairs to see visitors she cant go mamma i want her myself you have all the world to talk to and i have only her dont meddle mamma you are very selfish and *********** my poor little boy and i am heartily ashamed of you if i am it is because hush felix edna laid her hand on the pale curling lips of the cripple and luckily at this instant mrs andrews was summoned from the room scarcely waiting till the door closed after her the boy exclaimed passionately felix dont call me felix that means happy lucky and she had no right to give me such a name i am ******* nobody loves me nobody cares for me except to pity me and i would rather be strangled than pitied i wish i was dead and at rest in greenwood i wish somebody would knock my brains out with my crutch and save me from hobbling through life even my mother is ashamed of my ********* she ought to have treated me as the ******** did their dwarfs she ought to have thrown me into the east river before i was a day old i wish i was dead oh i do i do felix it is very wicked to i tell you i wont be called felix whenever i hear the name it makes me feel as i did one day when my crutches slipped on the ice and i fell on the pavement before the door and some newsboys stood and laughed at me ******* andrews i want that written on my tombstone when i am buried he trembled from head to foot and angry tears dimmed his large flashing eyes while hattie sat with her elbows resting on her knees and her chin in her hands looking sorrowfully at her brother edna put her arm around the boys shoulder and drew his head down on her lap saying tenderly your mother did not mean that she was ashamed of her son but only grieved and mortified by his ungovernable temper which made him disrespectful to her i know that she is very proud of your fine intellect and your ambition to become a thorough scholar and oh yes and of my handsome body and my pretty feet my dear little boy it is sinful for you to speak in that way and god will punish you if you do not struggle against such feelings i dont see how i can be punished any more than i have been already to be a lame dwarf is the worst that can happen suppose you were poor and ************ orphan with no one to care for you suppose you had no dear good little sister like hattie to love you now felix i know that the very fact that you are not as strong and ********* as most boys of your age only makes your mother and all of us love you more tenderly and it is very ungrateful in you to talk so bitterly when we are trying to make you happy and good and useful look at little lila shut up in silence unable to speak one word or to hear a bird sing or a baby laugh and yet see how merry and goodnatured she is how much more afflicted she is than you are suppose she was always fretting and complaining looking miserable and sour and out of humor do you think you would love her half as well as you do now he made no reply but his thin hands covered his sallow face hattie came close to him sat down on the carpet and put her head thickly crowned with yellow curls on his knee her uncle grey had given her a pretty ring the day before and now she silently and softly took it from her own finger and slipped it on her brothers felix you and hattie were so delighted with that little poem which i read to you from the journal of ******* de guerin that i have tried to set it to music for you the tune does not suit it exactly but we can use it until i find a better one she went to the piano and sang that pretty nursery ballad ****** the angel of the playthings hattie clapped her hands with delight and felix partly forgot his woes and grievances now i want you both to learn to sing it and i will teach hattie the accompaniment on felixs birthday which is not very distant you can surprise your father and mother by singing it for them in gratitude to the author i think every little child should sing it and call it ******** angel song hattie it is eleven oclock and time for you to practice your *********** the little girl climbed upon the ********** and began to count aloud and after a while edna bent down and put her hand on felixs shoulder you grieved your mother this morning and spoke very disrespectfully to her i know you regret it and you ought to tell her so and ask her to forgive you you would feel happier all day if you would only acknowledge your fault i hear your mother in her own room will you not go and kiss her he averted his head and muttered i dont want to kiss her but you ought to be a ******* son and you are not and your mother has cause to be displeased with you if you should ever be so unfortunate as to lose her and stand as i do motherless in the world you will regret the pain you gave her this morning oh if i had the privilege of kissing my mother i could bear almost any sorrow patiently if it ********* you to acknowledge your bad behavior it is the more necessary that you should humble your pride felix sometimes i think it requires more nobility of soul to ask pardon for our faults than to resist the temptation to commit them she turned away and busied herself in correcting his latin exercise and for some time the boy sat sullen and silent at length he sighed heavily and taking his crutches came up to the table where she sat suppose you tell my mother i am sorry i was disrespectful felix are you really sorry yes well then go and tell her so and she will love you a thousand times more than ever before the confession should come from your own lips he stood irresolute and sighed again i will go if you will go with me she rose and they went to mrs andrews room the mother was superbly dressed in visiting costume and was tying on her bonnet when they entered mrs andrews your son wishes to say something which i think you will be glad to hear indeed well felix what is it ****** ******** know i was very ******** disrespectful to youand oh mamma i hope you will forgive me he dropped his crutches and stretched out his arms and mrs andrews threw down the diamond cluster with which she was fastening her ribbons and caught the boy to her bosom my precious child my darling of course i forgive you gladly my dear son if you only knew half how well i love you you would not grieve me so often by your passionate temper my darling she stooped to kiss him and when she turned to look for the girlish form of the governess it was no longer visible mother and son were alone during the first few months after her removal to new york edna received frequent letters from mrs murray and mr hammond but as winter advanced they wrote more rarely and hurriedly and finally many weeks elapsed without bringing any tidings from le bocage st elmos name was never mentioned and while the girls heart ached she crushed it more ruthlessly day by day and in retaliation imposed additional and unremitting toil upon her brain mr manning had called twice to escort her to the libraries and art galleries and occasionally he sent her new books and english and french periodicals but his chill imperturbable calmness oppressed and embarrassed edna and formed a barrier to all friendly worth in their intercourse he so completely ******** her that in his august presence she was unable to do herself justice and felt that she was not gaining ground in his good opinion the brooding serenity of his grave ******* face was not contagious and she was conscious of a vague disquiet a painful restlessness when in his company and under his cold ********** eyes one morning in january as she sat listening to felixs recitations mrs andrews came into the schoolroom with an open note in one hand and an exquisite bouquet in the other miss earl here is an invitation for you to accompany mr manning to the opera tonight and here too is a bouquet from the same considerate gentleman as he does me the honor to request my company also i came to confer with you before sending a reply of course you will go yes mrs andrews if you will go with me edna bent over her flowers and recognizing many favorites that recalled the hothouse at le bocage her eyes filled with tears and she hastily put her lips to the snowy cups of an oxalis how often she had seen just such fragile petals nestling in the buttonhole of mr murrays coat i shall write and invite him to come early and take tea with us now miss earl pardon my candor i should like to know what you intend to wear you know that mr manning is quite ******** here and you will have to face a terrific battery of eyes and ********** for everybody will stretch his or her neck to find out first who you are and secondly how you are dressed now i think i understand rather better than you do what is comme il faut in these matters and i hope you will allow me to dictate on this occasion moreover our distinguished escort is extremely fastidious concerning ladies toilettes here are my keys mrs andrews examine my wardrobe and select what you consider appropriate for tonight on condition that you permit me to supply any deficiencies which i may discover come to my room at six oclock and let ********* dress your hair let me see i expect a la **** will best suit your head and face edna turned to her pupils and their books but all day the flowers in the vase on the table ******** of days gone by of purple ******* streaming through golden starred acacia boughs of long languid luxurious southern afternoons dying slowly on beds of heliotrope and jasmine spicy geraniums and gorgeous ************ of dewy delicious summer mornings for ever and ever past when standing beside a quivering ******** of ******** roses she had watched tamerlane and his gloomy rider go down the shadowy avenue of elms the monotonous hum of the childrens voices seemed thin and strange and far far off jarring the sweet bouquet babble and still as the hours passed and the winter day waned the flower fugue swelled on and on through the cold and dreary chambers of her heart now rising stormy and passionate like a *********** from the deep orange trumpet of a ******** and now whispering and sobbing and pleading from the pearly white lips of hallowed oxalis when she sat that night in mr mannings box at the academy of music the editor raised his ********** swept the crowded house scanning the lovely beaming faces wreathed with smiles and then his grave piercing glance came back and dwelt on the countenance at his side the cherry silk lining and puffing on her ********** threw a delicate stain of color over her exquisitely moulded cheeks and in the braid of black hair which rested like a ******* on her polished brow burned a scarlet ******* her long lashes drooped as she looked down at the bouquet between her fingers and listening to the fugue which memory played on the petals she sighed involuntarily miss earl is this your first night at the opera no sir i was here once before with mr andrews and his children i judge from your writings that you are particularly fond of music yes sir i think few persons love it better than i do what style do you prefer sacred ************** rather than operas the orchestra began an overture of ****** and ednas eyes went back to her flowers presently mrs andrews said eagerly look miss earl yonder in the box directly opposite is the celebrated sir roger percival the english nobleman about whom all ****** is running mad if he has not more sense than most men of his age his head will be completely turned by the flattery heaped upon him what a commentary on republican americans that we are so dazzled by the glitter of a title however he really is very agreeable i have met him several times dined with him last week at the ******* he has been watching us for some minutes ah there is a bow for me and one i presume for you mr manning yes i knew him abroad we spent a month together at dresden and his brain is strong enough to bear all the adulation new yorkers offer his title edna looked into the opposite box and saw a tall **************** man with huge ******** and a glittering ********** and then as the curtain rose on the first act of ****** she turned to the stage and gave her entire attention to the music at the close of the second act mrs andrews said pray who is that handsome man down yonder in the ******* fanning himself with a ******** i do not think his eyes have moved from this box for the last ten minutes he is a stranger to me she turned her fan in the direction of the person indicated and mr manning looked down and answered he is unknown to me ednas eyes involuntarily wandered over the sea of heads and the editor saw her start and lean forward and noticed the sudden joy that flashed into her face as she met the earnest upward gaze of gordon leigh an acquaintance of yours miss earl yes sir an old friend from the south the door of the box opened and sir roger percival came in and seated himself near mrs andrews who in her cordial welcome seemed utterly to forget the presence of the governess mr manning sat close to edna and taking a couple of letters from his pocket he laid them on her lap saying these letters were directed to my care by persons who are ignorant of your name and address if you will not consider me ************ curious i should like to know the nature of their contents she broke the seals and read the most flattering ************* of her magazine sketches the most cordial thanks for the pleasure derived from their perusal but the signatures were unknown to her a sudden wave of crimson surged into her face as she silently put the letters into mr mannings hand and watched his grave fixed *************** features while he read refolded and returned them to her miss earl i have received several documents of a similar character asking for your address do you still desire to write ********* or do you wish your name given to your admirers that is a matter which i am willing to leave to your superior judgment pardon me but i much prefer that you determine it for yourself then you may give my name to those who are sufficiently interested in me to write and make the inquiry mr manning smiled slightly and lowered his voice as he said sir roger percival came here tonight to be introduced to you he has expressed much curiosity to see the author of the last article which you contributed to the magazine and i told him that you would be in my box this evening shall i present him now mr manning was rising but edna put her hand on his arm and answered hurriedly no no he is engaged in conversation with mrs andrews and moreover i believe i do not particularly desire to be presented to him here comes your friend i will vacate this seat in his favor he rose bowed to gordon leigh and gave him the chair which he had occupied edna how i have longed to see you once more gordons hand seized hers and his handsome face was eloquent with feelings which he felt no inclination to conceal the sight of your countenance is an unexpected pleasure in new york mr leigh when did you arrive this afternoon mr hammond gave me your address and i called to see you but was told that you were here how are they all at home do you mean at le bocage or the parsonage i mean how are all my friends mrs murray is very well miss estelle ditto mr hammond has been sick but was better and able to preach before i left i brought a letter for you from him but unfortunately left it in the pocket of my travelling coat edna you have changed very much since i saw you last in what respect mr leigh the crash of the orchestra filled the house and people turned once more to the stage standing with his arms folded mr manning saw the earnest look on gordons face as with his arm resting on the back of ednas chair he talked in a low eager tone and a pitying smile partly curved the editors granite mouth as he noticed the expression of pain on the girls face and heard her say coldly no mr leigh what i told you then i repeat now time has made no change the opera ended the curtain fell and an enthusiastic audience called out the popular prima donna while bouquets were showered upon her mr manning stooped and put his hand on ednas shall i throw your tribute for you she hastily caught the bouquet from his fingers and replied oh no thank you i am so selfish i can not spare it i shall call at ten oclock tomorrow to deliver your letter said gordon as he stood hat in hand i shall be glad to see you mr leigh he shook hands with her and with mr manning to whom she had introduced him and left the box sir roger percival gave his arm to mrs andrews and the editor drew ednas cloak over her shoulders took her hand and led her down the steps as her little gloved fingers rested in his the feeling of awe and restraint melted away and looking into his face she said mr manning i do not think you will ever know half how much i thank you for all your kindness to an unknown ********** i have enjoyed the music very much indeed how is lila tonight a slight tremor crossed his lips the petrified ******** was quivering into life she is quite well thank you pray what do you know about her i was not aware that i had ever mentioned her name in your presence my pupil felix is her most devoted knight and i see her almost every afternoon when i go with the children to central park they reached the carriage where the englishman stood talking to mrs andrews and when mr manning had handed edna in he turned and said something to sir roger who laughed lightly and walked away during the drive mrs andrews talked ******* of the foreigners ease and elegance and fastidious musical taste and mr manning listened courteously and bowed coldly in reply when they reached home she invited him to dinner on the following thursday to meet sir roger percival as the editor bade them goodnight he said to edna go to sleep at once do not sit up to work tonight did she follow his sage advice ask of the stars that watched her through the long winter night and the dappled dawn that saw her stooping wearily over her desk at the appointed hour on the following morning mr leigh called and after some desultory remarks he asked rather abruptly has st elmo murray written to you about his last whim i do not correspond with mr murray everybody wonders what droll freak will next seize him reed the blacksmith died several months ago and to the astonishment of our people mr murray has taken his orphan huldah to le bocage has adopted her i believe at all events is educating her ednas face grew radiant oh i am glad to hear it poor little huldah needed a friend and she could not possibly have fallen into kinder hands than mr murrays there certainly exists some diversity of opinion on that subject he is rather too grim a guardian i fancy for one so young as huldah reed is mr hammond teaching huldah oh no herein consists the wonder murray himself hears her lessons so estelle told my sister a ****** rumor announces the approaching marriage of the cousins my sister informed me that it would take place early in the spring do you allude to mr murray and miss harding i do they will go to europe immediately after their marriage gordon looked searchingly at his companion but saw only a faint incredulous smile cross her calm face my sister is estelles ********** so you see i speak advisedly i know that her trousseau has been ordered from paris ednas fingers closed spasmodically over each other but she laughed as she answered how then dare you betray her confidence mr leigh how long will you remain in new york i shall leave tomorrow unless i have reason to hope that a longer visit will give you pleasure i came here solely to see you he attempted to ******* her fingers but she shook off his hand and said quickly i know what you are about to say and i would rather not hear what would only distress us both if you wish me to respect you mr leigh you must never again allude to a subject which i showed you last night was exceedingly painful to me while i value you as a friend and am rejoiced to see you again i should regret to learn that you had prolonged your stay even one hour on my account you are ungrateful edna and i begin to realize that you are utterly heartless if i am at least i have never trifled with or deceived you mr leigh you have no heart or you certainly could not so coldly reject an affection which any other woman would proudly accept a few years hence when your insane ambition is fully satiated and your beauty fades and your writings pall upon public taste and your ************* ********** forsake your shrine to bow before that of some new and more popular idol then edna you will rue your folly she rose and answered quietly the future may contain only disappointments for me but however lonely however sad my lot may prove i think i shall never fall so low as to regret not having married a man whom i find it impossible to love the sooner this interview ends the longer our friendship will last my time is not now my own and as my duties claim me in the schoolroom i must bid you goodbye edna if you send me away from you now you shall never look upon my face again in this world mournfully her tearful eyes sought his but her voice was low and steady as she put out both hands and said solemnly farewell dear friend god grant that when next we see each others faces they may be overshadowed by the shining white plumes of our angel wings in that city of god where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest never again in this world ah such words are dreary and funereal as the dull fall of clods on a ********* but so be it thank god time brings us all to one inevitable ***** before the great white throne he took the hands bowed his forehead upon them and groaned then drew them to his lips and left her with a slow weary step she turned and went up to her room and read mr hammonds letter it was long and kind full of affection and wise counsel but contained no allusion to mr murray as she refolded it she saw a slip of paper which had fallen unnoticed on the carpet and picking it up she read these words it grieves me to have to tell you that after all i fear st elmo will marry estelle harding he does not love her she can not influence him to redeem himself his future looks hopeless indeed edna my child what have you done oh what have you done her heart gave a sudden wild bound then a spasm seemed to seize it and presently the fluttering ceased her pulses stopped and a chill darkness fell upon her her head sank heavily on her chest and when she recovered her memory she felt an intolerable sensation of suffocation and a sharp pain that seemed to stab the heart whose throbs were slow and feeble she raised the window and leaned out panting for breath and the freezing wind powdered her face with fine snowflakes and sprinkled its fairy ************** over her hair the outer world was chill and dreary the leafless limbs of the trees in the park looked ghostly and weird against the dense dun clouds which seemed to stretch like a smoke mantle just above the sea of roofs and dimly seen through the white mist ********* heights and ******* hills were huge outlines monstrous as ******* physical pain blanched ednas lips and she pressed her hand repeatedly to her heart wondering what caused those keen pangs at last when the bodily suffering passed away and she sat down exhausted her mind reverted to the sentence in mr hammonds letter she knew the words were not lightly written and that his *********** appeal had broken from the depths of his aching heart and was intended to rouse her to some action i can do nothing say nothing must sit still and wait ******************** today if i could put out my hand and touch mr murray and bind him to me for ever i would not no no not a finger must i lift even between him and estelle but he will not marry her i knowi feel that he will not though i never look upon his face again he belongs to me he is mine and no other woman can take him from me a strange mysterious shadowy smile settled on her pallid features and faintly and dreamily she repeated and yet i know past all doubting ****** knowledge greater than grief can **** know as he loved he will love me duly *** better *** better than i love him and as i walk by the vast calm river the awful river so dread to see i say thy breadth and thy depth for ever are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me her lashes drooped her head fell back against the top of the chair and she lost all her woes until felixs voice roused her and she saw the frightened boy standing at her side shaking her hand and calling piteously upon her oh i thought you were dead you looked so white and felt so cold are you very sick shall i go for mamma for a moment she looked in his face with a perplexed bewildered expression then made an effort to rise i suppose that i must have fainted for i had a terrible pain here and she laid her hand over her heart felix let us go downstairs i think if your mother would give me some wine it might strengthen me notwithstanding the snow mrs andrews had gone out but felix had the wine brought to the schoolroom and after a little while the blood showed itself shyly in the ********** white lips and she took the boys latin book and heard him recite his lesson the day appeared wearily long but she omitted none of the appointed tasks and it was nearly nine oclock before felix fell asleep that night softly ********** his thin fingers which clung to her hand she went up to her own room feeling the full force of those mournful words in ******* de

reluctantly the governess prepared to meet a formidable party of strangers when mrs andrews presented sir roger percival he bowed rather haughtily and with a distant politeness which assured edna that he was cognizant of her refusal to make his acquaintance at the opera during the early part of dinner he divided his gay words between his hostess and a pretty miss morton who was evidently laying siege to his heart and carefully flattering his vanity but whenever edna his ******* looked toward him she invariably found his fine brown eyes scrutinizing her face mr manning who sat next to edna engaged her in an animated discussion concerning the value of a small volume containing two essays by buckle which he had sent her a few days previous something which she said to the editor with reference to ******* extravagant estimate of mill brought a smile to the englishmans lip and bowing slightly he said pardon me miss earl if i interrupt you a moment to express my surprise at hearing mill denounced by an american his books on representative government and liberty are so essentially democratic that i expected only gratitude and eulogy from his readers on this side of the atlantic despite her efforts to control it embarrassment unstrung her nerves and threw a quiver into her voice as she answered i do not presume sir to denounce a man whom buckle ranks above all other living

two purple pigeons with rainbow necklaces cooed and fluttered up and down from the church belfry and close under the projecting roof of the granite vault a pair of meek brown wrens were building their

against the door of the vault where fine ************* mosses were weaving their green arabesque *********** in a mournfully measured yet tranquil tone he said aloud ah truly throughout all the years

gray beard sweeping over his bosom his bare silvered head bowed and his mild peaceful blue eyes resting on his sons tomb mr hammond stood listening to the music and when the strains ceased his thoughts travelled onward and upward till they crossed the sea of crystal before the throne and in imagination he heard the song of the four and twenty elders from this brief reverie some slight sound aroused him and lifting his eyes he saw a man clad in white linen garments wearing oxalis clusters in his coat standing on the opposite side of the monumental slab st elmo my poor suffering wanderer oh st elmo come to me once more before i die the old mans voice was husky and his arms trembled as he stretched them across the grave that intervened mr murray looked into the tender tearful pleading countenance and the sorrow that seized his own making his features writhe beggars language he instinctively put out his arms then drew them back and hid his face in his hands saying in low broken almost inaudible tones i am too unworthy dripping with the blood of your children i dare not touch you the pastor tottered around the tomb and stood at mr murrays side and the next moment the old mans arms were clasped around the tall form and his white hair fell on his pupils shoulder god be praised after twenty years separation i hold you once more to the heart that even in its hours of deepest sorrow has never ceased to love you st elmo he wept aloud and strained the prodigal convulsively to his breast after a moment mr murrays lips moved twitched and with a groan that shook his powerful frame from head to foot he asked will you ever ever forgive me god is my witness that i freely and fully forgave you many many years ago the dearest hope of my lonely life has been that i might tell you so and make you realize how ceaselessly my prayers and my love have followed you in all your dreary wanderings oh i thank god that at last at last you have come to me my dear dear boy my poor proud prodigal a magnificent ******** swelled triumphantly through church and churchyard as if the ******** up in the gallery knew what was happening at murray hammonds grave and when the thrilling music died away st elmo broke from the encircling arms and knelt with his face shrouded in his hands and pressed against the marble that covered his victim after a little while the pastor sat down on the edge of the slab and laid his shrunken fingers softly and caressingly upon the bowed head do not dwell upon a past that is fraught only with bitterness to you and from which you can draw no balm throw your painful memories behind you and turn resolutely to a future which may be rendered noble and useful and holy there is truth precious truth in george herberts words for all may have if they dare choose a glorious life or grave and the years to come may by the grace of god more than cancel those that have gone by what have i to hope ***** time of eternity oh none but almighty god can ever know the dreary blackness and wretchedness of my despairing soul the keen sleepless pain of my remorse my utter loathing of my accursed distorted nature and his pitying eyes see all and christ stretches out his hands to lift you up to himself and his own words of loving sympathy and pardon are spoken again to you come unto me all ye weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest throw all your galling load of memories down at the foot of the cross and the peace that passeth all understanding shall enter your sorrowing soul and abide there for ever st elmo only prayer could have sustained and soothed me since we parted that bright summer morning twenty long long years ago prayer took away the sting and sanctified my sorrows for the good of my soul and my dear dear boy it will extract the poison and the bitterness from yours that god answers prayer and comforts the afflicted among men i am a living attestation it is by his grace only that i am what i am erring and unworthy i humbly own but patient at least and fully resigned to his will the only remaining cause of disquiet passed away just now when i saw that you had come back to me st elmo do you ever pray for yourself for some weeks i have been trying to pray but my words seem a mockery they do not rise they fall back hissing upon my heart i have injured and insulted you i have cursed you and yours have robbed you of your peace of mind have murdered your children hush hush we will not ******** the dead my peace of mind you have today given back to me and the hope of your salvation is dearer to me than the remembered faces of my darlings sleeping here beside us oh st elmo i have prayed for you as i never prayed even for my own murray and i know i feel that all my wrestling before the throne of grace has not been in vain sometimes my faith grew faint and as the years dragged on and i saw no melting of your haughty bitter spirit i almost lost hope but i did not thank god i did not i held on to the precious promise and prayed more frequently and blessed be his holy name at last just before i go hence the answer comes as i see you kneeling here at my murrays grave i know now that your soul is snatched as a brand from the burning oh bless my merciful god that in that day when we stand for final judgment and your precious soul is required at my sons hands the joyful cry of the recording angel shall be saved saved for ever and ever through the blood of the lamb overwhelmed with emotion the pastor dropped his white head on his bosom and once more silence fell over the darkening cemetery one by one the birds hushed their ******* and went to rest and only the soft cooing of the pigeons floated down now and then from the lofty belfry on the eastern horizon a thin fleecy scarf of clouds was silvered by the rising moon the west was a huge shrine of beryl whereon burned ruby flakes of vapor watched by a solitary vestal star and the sapphire arch overhead was beautiful and mellow as any that ever vaulted above the sculptured marbles of ***** campo santo mr murray rose and stood with his head uncovered and his eyes fixed on the ******* *********** that glowed like ********** mr hammond your magnanimity ****** me and if your words be true i feel in your presence like a leper and should lay my lips in the dust crying ******* ******* for all that i have inflicted on you i have neither apology nor defence to offer and i could much better have borne curses from you than words of sympathy and affection you amaze me for i hate and scorn myself so thoroughly that i marvel at the interest you still indulge for me i can not understand how you can endure the sight of my features the sound of my voice oh if i could atone if i could give annie back to your arms there is no suffering no torture that i would not gladly embrace no penance of body or soul from which i would shrink my dear boy for such you still seem to me notwithstanding the lapse of time let my little darling rest with her god she went down early to her long home and though i missed her sweet laugh and her soft tender hands about my face and have felt a chill silence in my house where music once was she has been spared much suffering and many trials and i would not recall her if i could for after a few more days i shall gather her back to my bosom in that eternal land where the ********* dew of death never falls where ****** and farewells are a sound unknown atone ah st elmo you can atone save your soul redeem your life and i shall die blessing your name look at me in my loneliness and infirmity i am childless you took my idols from me long long ago you left my heart desolate and now i have a right to turn to you to stretch out my feeble empty arms and say come be my child fill my sons place let me lean upon you in my old age as i once fondly dreamed i should lean on my own murray st elmo will you come will you give me your heart my son my son he put out his trembling hands and a yearning tenderness shone in his eyes as he raised them to the tall stern man before him mr murray bent eagerly forward and looked wonderingly at him do you can you mean it it appears so impossible and i have been so long sceptical of all nobility in my race will you indeed shelter murrays murderer in your generous loving heart i call my god to witness that it has been my dearest hope for dreary years that i might win your heart back before i die it is but a wreck a hideous ruin black with sins but such as i am my future my all i lay at your feet if there is any efficacy in bitter repentance and remorse if there is any mercy left in my ****** hands if there be saving power in human will i will atone i will atone the strong man trembled like a ********** reed as he sank on one knee at the ministers feet and buried his face in his arms and spreading his palms over the drooped head mr hammond gently and solemnly blessed him for some time both were silent and then mr murray stretched out one arm over the slab and said brokenly kneeling here at murrays tomb a strange incomprehensible feeling creeps into my heart the fierce burning hate i have borne him seems to have passed away and something ah something mournfully like the old yearning toward him comes back as i look at his name oh idol of my youth hurled down and crushed by my own savage hands for the first time since i destroyed him since i saw his handsome face whitening in death i think of him kindly for the first time since that night i feel ********* can forgive him murray murray you wronged me you wrecked me but oh if i could give you back the life i took in my madness how joyfully would i forgive you all my injuries his blood dyes my hands my heart my soul the blood of jesus will wash out those stains the law was fully satisfied when he hung on calvary there ample atonement was made for just such sins as yours and you have only to claim and plead his sufferings to secure your salvation st elmo bury your past here in murrays grave and give all your thoughts to the future half of your life has ebbed out and yet your ******** remains undone untouched you have no time to spend in looking over your ********** years bury my past impossible even for one hour i tell you i am chained to it as the ******* were chained to the pillars of ******** and the croaking fiend that will not let me sleep in memory memory of sins ******** avenge your wrongs old man that goad me sometimes to the very verge of suicide do you know ha how could you possibly know shall i tell you that only one thought has often stood between me and selfdestruction it was not the fear of death no no no it was not even the dread of facing an outraged god but it was the horrible fear of meeting murray not all eternity was wide enough to hold us both the hate i bore him made me shrink from a deed which i felt would instantly set us face to face once more in the land of souls ah a change has come over me now if i could see his face i might learn to forget that look it wore when last i gazed upon it time bears healing for some natures to mine it has brought only poison it is useless to bid me forget memory is earths retribution for mans sins i have bought at a terrible price my conviction of the melancholy truth that he who touches the weapons of nemesis effectually ********** his own peace of mind and ********** her maledictions from which there is no escape in my insanity i said vengeance is mine i will repay and in the hour when i ******** grasped the prerogative of god his curse smote me mr hammond friend of my happy youth guide of my innocent boyhood if you could know all the depths of my ********* you would pity me indeed my miserable heart is like the crater of some extinct volcano the flames of sin have burned out and left it rugged rent blackened i do not think that st elmo do not upbraid yourself so bitterly sir your words are kind and noble and full of christian charity they are well meant and i thank you but they cannot comfort me my desolation my utter wretchedness ******* me from the sympathy of my race whom i have despised and trampled so relentlessly yesterday i read a passage which ******* so accurately my dreary isolation that i have been unable to expel it i find it creeping even now to my lips o misery and mourning i have ******* i have felt like some deserted world that god hath done with and had cast aside to rock and stagger through the ***** of space he never looking on it any more ******** no use no pleasure not desired nor lighted on by angels in their flight from heaven to happier ******* and the race that once hath dwelt on it withdrawn or dead could such a world have hope that some blest day god would remember her and fashion her anew yes my dear st elmo so surely as god reigns above us he will ********* it and make the light of his ********* love and the refreshing dew of his grace fall upon it and the waste places shall bloom as sharon and the ******** vineyards shame ****** and the lilies of peace shall lift up their stately heads and the voice of the ****** shall be heard in the land have faith grapple yourself by prayer to the feet of god and he will **** and lift up and guide you mr murray shook his head mournfully and the moonlight shining on his face showed it colorless haggard hopeless the pastor rose put on his hat and took st elmos arm come home with me this spot is fraught with painful associations that open afresh all your wounds they walked on together until they reached the parsonage gate and as the minister raised the latch his companion gently disengaged the arm clasped to the old mans side not tonight after a few days i will try to come st elmo tomorrow is sunday and he paused and did not speak the request that looked out from his eyes it cost mr murray a severe struggle and he did not answer immediately when he spoke his voice was unsteady yes i know what you wish once i swore i would tear the church down scatter its dust to the winds leave not a stone to mark the site but i will come and hear you preach for the first time since that sunny sabbath twenty years dead when your text was cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days ****** and bitter and worthless from the long tossing in the great deep of sin it drifts back at last to your feet and instead of stooping tenderly to gather up the useless fragments i wonder that you do not ***** the stranded ruin from you yes i will come thank god oh what a weight you have lifted from my heart st elmo my son there was a long lingering clasp of hands and the pastor went into his home with tears of joy on his furrowed face while his smiling lips whispered to his grateful soul in the morning *** thy seed and in the evening withhold not thy hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good mr murray watched the stooping form until it disappeared and then went slowly back to the silent burying ground and sat down on the steps of the church hour after hour passed and still he sat there almost as motionless as one of the monuments while his eyes dwelt as if spellbound on the dark dull stain where annie hammond had rested in days long long past and remorse more powerful than ******* evoked from the ******* house the sweet girlish features and fairy figure of the early dead his pale face was propped on his hand and there in the silent watches of the *********** midnight he held communion with god and his own darkened spirit what hast thou wrought for right and truth for god and man from the golden hours of brighteyed youth to lifes ******* his almost ******* pride was laid low as the dead in their mouldering shrouds and all the giant strength of his perverted nature was gathered up and hurled in a new direction the dead sea past moaned and swelled and bitter waves surged and broke over his heart but he silently buffeted them and the moon rode in ********* when he rose went around the church and knelt and prayed with his forehead pressed to the marble that covered murray hammonds last restingplace oh that the mist which ******* my to come would so dissolve and yield unto mine eyes a worthy path id count not wearisome long toil nor enterprise but strain to reach it ** with ********** stout is there such a path already made to fit the measure of my foot it shall atone for much if i at length may light on it and know it for mine own on how grand and beautiful it is whenever i look at it i feel exactly as i did on ************ when i went to the cathedral to hear the music it is a solemn feeling as if i were in a holy place miss earl what makes me feel so felix stood in an art gallery and leaning on his crutches looked up at ******* heart of the andes you are impressed by the solemnity and the holy repose of nature for here you look upon a pictured cathedral built not by mortal hands but by the architect of the universe felix does it not recall to your mind something of which we often speak the boy was silent for a few seconds and then his thin sallow face brightened yes indeed you mean that splendid description which you read to me from modern painters how fond you are of that passage and how very often you think of it let me see whether i can remember it slowly but accurately he repeated the eloquent tribute to mountain glory from the fourth volume of modern painters felix you know that a celebrated english poet keats has said a thing of beauty is a joy forever and as i can never hope to express my ideas in half such beautiful language as mr ruskin uses it is an economy of trouble to quote his words some of his expressions are like certain songs which the more frequently we sing them the more valuable and eloquent they become and as we rarely learn a fine piece of music to be played once or twice and then thrown aside why should we not be allowed the same privilege with verbal melodies last week you asked me to explain to you what is meant by ****** perspective and if you will study the atmosphere in this great picture mr church will explain it much more clearly to you than i was able to do yes miss earl i see it now the eye could travel up and up and on and on and never get out of the sky and it seems to me those birds yonder would fly entirely away out of sight through that air in the picture but miss earl do you really believe that the ********** in south america is as grand as mr ******* i do not because i have noticed that pictures are much handsomer than the real things they stand for mamma carried me last spring to see some paintings of scenes on the hudson river and when we went travelling in the summer i saw the very spot where the artist stood when he sketched the hills and the bend of the river and it was not half so pretty as the picture and yet i know god is the greatest painter is it the faroff look that everything wears when painted yes the faroff look as you call it is one cause of the effect you wish to understand and it has been rather more elegantly expressed by campbell in the line tis distance ***** enchantment to the view i have seen this fact exemplified in a very singular manner at a house in georgia where i was once visiting from the front door i had a very fine prospect or view of lofty hills and a dense forest and a pretty little town where the steeples of the churches glittered in the sunshine and i stood for some time admiring the landscape but presently when i turned to speak to the lady of the house i saw in the glass ********** of the door a miniature reflection of the very same scene that was much more beautiful i was puzzled and could not comprehend how the mere fact of diminishing the size of the various objects by increasing the distance could enhance their loveliness and i asked myself whether all faroff things were handsomer than those close at hand in my perplexity i went as usual to mr ruskin wondering whether he had ever noticed the same thing and of course he had and has a noble passage about it in one of his books on architecture i will see if my memory *********** it as it deserves are not all natural things it may be asked as lovely near as far away nay not so look at the clouds and watch the delicate ********* of their alabaster sides and the rounded lustre of their magnificent rolling they are meant to be beheld far away they were shaped for this place high above your head approach them and they fuse into vague mists or whirl away in fierce fragments of thunderous vapors and here felix your question about ********** is answered look at the crest of the **** from the faraway plains over which its light is cast whence human souls have communion with it by their myriads the child looks up to it in the dawn and the ********** in the burden and heat of the day and the old man in the going down of the sun and it is to them all as the celestial city on the worlds horizon dyed with the depths of heaven and clothed with the calm of eternity there was it set for holy dominion by him who marked for the sun his journey and bade the moon know her going down it was built for its place in the faroff sky approach it and the glory of its aspect fades into blanched *********** its purple walls are rent into ****** rocks its silver ******** saddened into wasting snow the *********** of ages are on its breast the ashes of its own ruin lie solemnly on its white raiment felix in rambling about the fields you will frequently be reminded of this i have noticed that the meadow in the distance is always ******* and more velvety and seems more thickly studded with flowers than the one i am crossing or the hillside far away has a golden gleam on its rocky slopes and the shadow spots are softer and cooler and more purple than those i am climbing and panting over and i have hurried on and after a little turning to look back lo all the glory i saw beckoning me on has flown and settled over the meadow and the hillside that i have passed and the halo is behind perfect beauty in scenery is like the mirage that you read about yesterday it fades and ***** out of your grasp as you travel toward it when we go home i will read you something which emerson has said concerning this same lovely ***** ****** for i can remember only a few words what splendid distance what recesses of ineffable pomp and loveliness in the sunset but who can go where they are or lay his hand or plant his foot thereon off they fall from the round world forever felix i suppose it is because we see all the ************* and ************ of objects close at hand put the fairy film of air like a silvery mist hides these when it a distance and we are charmed with the heightened beauties which alone are visible ednas eyes went back to the painting and rested there and little hattie who had been gazing up at her governess in curious perplexity pulled her brothers sleeve and said bro felix do you understand all that i guess i dont for i know when i am hungry and seems to me i always am why when i am hungry the closer i get to my dinner the nicer it looks and then there was that hateful spiteful old miss **** ******** that mamma would have to teach you ugh i have watched her many a time coming up the street you know she never would ride in stages for fear of *********** and she always looked just as ugly as far off as i could see her as when she came close to me a hearty laugh cut short hatties observation and coming forward sir roger percival put his hand on her head saying how often children tumble down the step from the sublime to the ridiculous and drag staid dignified folks after them miss earl i have been watching your little party for some time listening to your incipient ********** you americans are queer people and when i go home i shall tell mr ruskin that i heard a little boy *********** the heart of the andes and quoting from modern painters felix as i wish to be accurate will you tell me your age the poor sensitive cripple imagined that he was being ridiculed and he only reddened and frowned and bit his thin lips edna laid her hand on his shoulder and answered for him just thirteen years old and though mr ruskin is a distinguished exception to the rule that prophets are not without honor save in their own country i think he has no reader who loves and admires his writings more than felix andrews here the boy raised his eyes and asked why is it that prophets have no honor among their own people is it because they too have to be seen from a great distance in order to seem grand i heard mamma say the other day that if some book written in america had only come from england everybody would be raving about it some other time felix we will talk of that problem hattie you look sleepy i think it will be lunch time before we get home replied the yawning child sir roger took her by her shoulders and shook her gently saying come wake up little sweetheart how can you get sleepy or hungry with all these handsome pictures staring at you from the walls the goodnatured child laughed but her brother who had an unconquerable aversion to sir rogers huge ******** curled his lips and exclaimed scornfully hattie you ought to be ashamed of yourself hungry indeed you are almost as bad as that english lady who when her husband was admiring some beautiful lambs and called her attention to them answered yes lambs are *************** desirous of ************ him sir roger replied when you and hattie come to see me in england i will show you the most beautiful lambs in the united kingdom and your sister shall have boiled lamb three times a day if she wishes it miss earl you are so fond of paintings that you would enjoy a european tour more than any lady whom i have met in this country i have seen miles of canvas in boston new york and philadelphia but very few good pictures and yet sir when on exhibition in europe this great work here before us received most extravagant praise from ************* critics who are very loath to accord merit to american artists if i am ever so fortunate as to be able to visit europe and cultivate and improve my taste i think i shall still be very proud of the names of allston west church ********* ******* and ******* she turned to quit the gallery and sir roger said i leave tomorrow for canada and may possibly sail for england without returning to new york will you allow me the pleasure of driving you to the park this afternoon two months ago you refused a similar request but since then i flatter myself we have become better friends thank you sir roger i presume the children can spare me and i will go with pleasure i will call at five oclock he handed her and hattie into the ***** tenderly assisted felix and saw them driven away presently felix laughed and exclaimed oh i hope miss morton will be in the park this evening it would be glorious fun to see her meet you and sir roger why felix oh because she ******* i heard uncle grey tell mamma that she was making desperate efforts to catch the englishman and that she turned up her nose tremendously at the idea of his visiting you when uncle grey told her how often he came to our house she bit her lips almost till the blood spouted sir roger drives very fine horses uncle says and miss morton hints outrageously for him to ask her to ride but she cant manage to get the invitation so she will be furious when she sees you this afternoon yonder is ******* let us stop and have a look at those new engravings mamma told us about yesterday hattie you can curl up in your corner and go to sleep and dream of boiled lamb till we come back later in the day mrs andrews went up to ednas room and found her correcting an exercise at work as usual you are incorrigible any other woman would be so charmed with her conquest that her head would be quite turned by a certain pair of brown eyes that are considered irresistible come get ready for your drive it is almost five oclock and you know foreigners are too polite too thoroughly wellbred not to be punctual no no miss earl not that hat on the peril of your life where is that new one that i ordered sent up to you two days ago it will match this delicate white shawl of mine which i brought up for you to wear and come no scruples if you please stand up and let me see whether its folds hang properly you should have heard madame de ***** she put it around my shoulders for the first time ***** **** madame andrews you are a greek statue miss earl put your hair back a little from the left temple there now the veins show where are your gloves you look charmingly my dear only too pale too pale if you dont contrive to get up some color people will swear that sir roger was ****** the ghost of a pretty girl there is the bell just as i told you he is punctual five oclock to a minute she stepped to the window and looked down at the equipage before the door what superb horses you will be the envy of the city there was something in the appearance and manner of sir roger which often reminded edna of gordon leigh and during the spring he visited her so constantly sent her so frequently baskets of elegant flowers that he succeeded in ********** her reticence and established himself on an exceedingly friendly footing in mrs andrewss house now as they drove along the avenue and entered the park their spirits rose and sir roger turned very often to look at the fair face of his companion which he found more and more attractive each day he saw too that under his earnest gaze the faint color deepened until her cheeks glowed like ********* and when he spoke he bent his face much nearer to hers than was necessary to make her hear his words they talked of books flowers music mountain scenery and the green lanes of merry england edna was perfectly at ease and in a mood to enjoy everything they dashed on and the sunlight disappeared and the gas glittered all over the city before sir roger turned his horses heads homeward when they reached mrs andrewss door he dismissed his carriage and spent the evening at eleven oclock he rose to say goodbye miss earl i hope i shall have the pleasure of renewing our acquaintance at an early day if not in america in europe the brightest reminiscences i shall carry across the ocean are those that cluster about the hours i have spent with you if i should not return to new york will you allow me the privilege of hearing from you occasionally his clasp of the girls hand was close but she withdrew it and her face flushed painfully as she answered will you excuse me sir roger when i tell you that i am so constantly occupied i have not time to write even to my old and dearest friends passing the door of felixs room on her way to her own apartment to boy called to her miss earl are you very tired oh no do you want anything my head aches and i cant go to sleep please read to me a little while he raised himself on his elbow and looked up fondly at her ah how very pretty you are tonight kiss me wont you she stooped and kissed the poor parched lips and as she opened a volume of the ******* novels he said did you see miss morton yes she was on horseback and we passed her twice glad of it she does not like you i guess she finds it as hard to get to sleep tonight as i do edna commenced reading and it was nearly an hour before felixs eyes closed and his fingers relaxed their grasp on hers softly she put the book back on the shelf extinguished the light and stole upstairs to her desk that night as sir roger tossed restlessly on his pillow thinking of her recalling all that she had said during the drive he would not have been either comforted or flattered by a knowledge of the fact that she was so entirely engrossed by her ms that she had no thought of him or his impending departure when the clock struck three she laid down her pen and the mournful expression that crept into her eyes told that memory was busy with the past years when she fell asleep she dreamed not of sir roger but of le bocage and its master of whom she would not permit herself to think in her waking hours the influence which mr manning exerted over edna increased as their acquaintance ripened and the admiring reverence with which she regarded the editor was exceedingly flattering to him with curious interest he watched the expansion of her mind and now and then warned her of some error into which she seemed inclined to plunge or wisely advised some new branch of research so firm was her confidence in his nature and dispassionate judgment that she yielded to his opinions a deferential homage such as she had scarcely paid even to mr hammond gradually and unconsciously she learned to lean upon his strong clear mind and to find in his society a quiet but very precious happiness the antagonism of their characters was doubtless one cause of the attraction which each found in the other and furnished the ************ which both required ednas intense and dreamy ******** demanded a check which the ********** of the editor supplied and his extensive and rigidly accurate information on almost all scientific topics constituted a valuable treasury of knowledge to which he never denied her access his faith in christianity was like his conviction of the truth of mathematics more an intellectual process and the careful deduction of logic than the result of some emotional impulse his religion like his ********** was cold consistent irreproachable unanswerable never seeking a controversy on any subject he never shunned one and during its continuance his demeanor was invariably courteous but unyielding and even when severe he was rarely bitter very early in life his intellectual seemed to have swallowed up his emotional nature as ****** rod did those of the ********* of pharaoh and only the absence of ********* and the habitual suavity of his manner atoned for his unbending obstinacy on all points ednas fervid and beautiful enthusiasm surged and chafed and broke over this mans stern ****** ******* like the warm blue waters of the gulf stream that throw their silvery spray and foam against the glittering walls of sapphire icebergs sailing slowly southward her glowing imagery fell upon the bristling points of his close ******* of arguments as gorgeous tropical garlands caught and ******* by bayonets until they faded merciless as an ********** lecturer he would smilingly take up one of her metaphors and ******* it and over the pages of her mss for maga his gravely spoken criticisms fell withering as **** frost they differed in all respects yet daily they felt the need of each others society the frozen man of

attacking all ****** whether political scientific or ethical all ***************** in manners and ******** in letters he commanded the confidence and esteem of all and became in great degree the centre around which the savants and literati of the city revolved through his influence edna made the acquaintance of some of the most eminent scholars and artists who formed this clique and she found that his friendship and recommendation was an open sesame to the charmed circle one saturday she sat with her bonnet on waiting for mr manning who had promised to accompany her on her first visit to greenwood and as she put on her gloves felix handed her a letter which his father had just brought up recognizing mrs murrays writing the governess read it immediately and while her eyes ran over the sheet an expression first of painful then of joyful surprise came into her countenance my dear child doubtless you will be amazed to hear that your quondam lover has utterly driven your image from his fickle heart and that he ******* your existence as completely as if you were buried twenty feet in the ruins of *********** last night gordon leigh was married to gertrude powell and the happy pair

which will take place ere long poor gordon will rue his rashness and before the year ******* he will arrive at the conclusion that he is an unmitigated fool and has simply performed with great success an operation familiarly known as cutting off ones nose to spite ones face your rejection of his renewed offer piqued him beyond expression and when he returned from new york he was in exactly the most accommodating frame of mind which mrs powell could desire she immediately laid siege to him gertrudes undisguised preference for his society was extremely soothing to his vanity which you had so severely wounded and in fine the indefatigable manoeuvres of the wily mamma and the continual flattery of the girl who is really very pretty accomplished the result i once credited gordon with more sense than he has manifested but each year ********* me more firmly of the truth of my belief that no man is proof against the subtle and persistent flattery of a beautiful woman when he announced his engagement to me we were sitting in the library and i looked him full in the face and answered indeed engaged to miss powell i thought you swore that so long as edna earl remained unmarried you would never relinquish your suit he pointed to that lovely statuette of pallas that stands on the mantelpiece and said bitterly edna earl has no more heart than that marble ****** whereupon i replied take care gordon i notice that of late you seem inclined to deal rather too freely in ********* ednas heart may resemble the rich veins of gold which in some mines run not near the surface but deep in the masses of ****** because you can not obtain it you have no right to declare that it does not exist you will probably live to hear some more fortunate suitor shout ****** over the treasure he turned pale as the pallas and put his hand over his face then i said gordon my young friend i have always been deeply interested in your happiness tell me frankly do you love this girl gertrude he seemed much embarrassed but finally made his confession mrs murray i believe i shall be fond of her after a while she is very lovely and deeply deeply attached to me vanity you see edna and i am grateful for her affection she will brighten my lonely home and at least i can be proud of her rare beauty but i never expect to love any woman as i loved edna earl i can pet gertrude i should have worshipped my first love my proud gifted peerless edna oh she will never realize all she threw away when she coldly dismissed me poor gordon well he is married but his bride might have found cause of disquiet in his restless abstracted manner on the evening of his wedding what do you suppose was st elmos criticism on this matrimonial ******** poor devil before a year rolls over his head he will feel like plunging into the atlantic with plymouth rock for a necklace leigh deserves a better fate and i would rather see him tied to wild horses and dragged across the andes these pique marriages are terrible mistakes so my dear i trust you will duly repent of your cruelty to poor gordon as edna put the letter in her pocket she wondered whether gertrude really loved her husband or whether chagrin at mr murrays heartless desertion had not goaded the girl to accept mr leigh perhaps after all mr murray was correct in his estimate of her character when he said that she was a mere child and was capable of no very earnest affection i hope *** hope so edna sighed as she tried to assure herself of the probability that the newly married pair would become more attached as time passed and her thoughts returned to that paragraph in mrs murrays letter which seemed intentionally mysterious i know of a third instance which will take place ere long did she allude to her son and her niece edna could not believe this possible and shook her head at the suggestion but her lips grew cold and her fingers locked each other as in a clasp of steel when mr manning called and assisted her into the carriage he observed an unusual ************ of mind but after a few desultory remarks she rallied gave him her undivided attention and seemed engrossed by his conversation it was a fine sunny day bright but cool with a fresh and stiffening west wind ******* the waters of the harbor the week had been one of unusual trial for felix was sick and even more than ordinarily fretful and exacting and weary of writing

who slept *********** in the costly ********** which they paused to examine and admire and when at last he directed the driver to return edna sank back in one corner of the carriage and said some morning i will come with the children and spend the entire day she closed her eyes and her thoughts travelled swiftly to that pure white ******* standing in the shadow of lookout and melancholy memories brought a sigh to her lips and a slight cloud to the face that for two hours past had been singularly bright and animated the silence had lasted some minutes when mr manning who was gazing abstractedly out of the window turned to his companion and said you look pale and badly today i have not felt as strong as usual and it is a great treat to get away from the schoolroom and out into the open air which is bracing and delightful i believe i have enjoyed this ****** more than any i have taken since i came north and you must allow me to tell you how earnestly i thank you for your considerate remembrance of me miss earl what i am about to say will perhaps seem premature and will doubtless surprise you but i beg you to believe that it is the result of mature deliberation he paused and looked earnestly at her you certainly have not decided to give up the ********** of maga as you spoke of doing last winter it would not survive your desertion six months my allusion was to yourself not to the magazine which i presume i shall **** as long as i live miss earl this state of affairs cannot continue you have no regard for your health which is suffering materially and you are

write would exhaust a constitution of steel or brass you are probably not aware of the great change which has taken place in your appearance during the last three months hitherto circumstances may have left you no alternative but one is now offered you my property is sufficient to render you comfortable i have already purchased a pleasant home to which i shall remove next week and i want you to share it with **** share my ********* that i have you have known me scarcely a year but you are not a stranger to my character or position and i think that you repose implicit confidence in me notwithstanding the unfortunate disparity in our years i believe we are becoming mutually dependent on each other and in your society i find a charm such as no other human being possesses though i have no right to expect that a girl of your age can derive equal pleasure from the companionship of a man old enough to be her father i am not demonstrative but my feelings are warm and deep and however incredulous you may be i assure you that you are the first the only woman i have ever asked to be my wife i have known many who were handsome and intellectual whose society i have really enjoyed but not one until i met you whom i would have married to you alone am i willing to ******* the education of my little lila she was but six months old when we were wrecked off ******** and in attempting to save his wife my brother was lost with the child in my arms i clung to a **** and finally swam ashore and since then regarding her as a sacred treasure committed to my guardianship i have faithfully endeavored to supply her fathers place there is a singular magnetism about you edna earl which makes me wish to see your face always at my hearthstone and for the first time in my life i want to say to the world this woman wears my name and belongs to me for ever you are inordinately ambitious i can lift you to a position that will fully satisfy you and place you above the necessity of daily ****** position of happiness and ease where your genius can properly develop itself can you consent to be douglass mannings wife there was no more tremor in his voice than in the measured beat of a base drum and in his granite face not a feature moved not a muscle twitched not a nerve quivered so entirely unexpected was this proposal that edna could not utter a word the idea that he could ever wish to marry anybody seemed incredible and that he should need her society appeared utterly absurd for an instant she wondered if she had fallen asleep in the soft luxurious corner of the carriage and dreamed it all completely bewildered she sat looking wonderingly at him miss earl you do not seem to comprehend me and yet my words are certainly very explicit once more i ask you can you put your hand in mine and be my wife he laid one hand on hers and with the other pushed back his glasses withdrawing her hands she covered her face with them and answered almost inaudibly let me ******** you astonish me take a day or a week if necessary for consideration and then give me your answer mr manning leaned back in the carriage folded his hands and looked quietly out of the window and for a half hour silence reigned brief but sharp was the struggle in ednas heart probably no womans literary vanity and ambition has ever been more fully gratified than was hers by this most unexpected offer of marriage from one whom she had been taught to regard as the noblest ornament of the profession she had selected thinking of the hour when she sat alone shedding tears of mortification and bitter disappointment over his curt letter rejecting her ms she glanced at the stately form beside her the mysteriously calm commanding face the large white finely moulded hands waiting to clasp hers for all time and her triumph seemed complete to rule the destiny of that strong man whose intellect was so influential in the world of letters was a conquest of which until this hour she had never dreamed and the blacksmiths darling was after all a mere woman and the honor dazzled her to one of her peculiar temperament wealth offered no temptation but douglass manning had climbed to a grand eminence and looking up at it she knew that any woman might well be proud to share it he filled her ideal he came fully up to her lofty moral and mental standard she knew that his superior she could never hope to meet and her confidence in his integrity of character was boundless she felt that his society had become necessary to her peace of mind for only in his presence was it possible to forget her past either she must marry him or live single and work and ******** to a girl of nineteen the latter alternative seems more appalling than to a woman of thirty whose eyes have grown strong in the gray cold ******* light of confirmed ************* even as the vision of those who live in dim caverns requires not the lamps needed by newcomers fresh from the dazzling outer world edna was weary of battling with precious memories of that reckless fascinating cynic whom without trusting she had learned to love and she thought that perhaps if she were the wife of mr manning whom without loving she fully trusted it would help her to forget st elmo she did not deceive herself she knew that despite her struggles and stern ********** she loved him as she could never hope to love any one else impatiently she said to herself mr murray is as old as mr manning and in the estimation of the public is his inferior oh why can not my weak wayward heart follow my strong cleareyed judgment i would give ten years of my life to love mr manning as i love she compared a swarthy electrical face scowling and often *********** harsh with one cloudless and noble over which brooded a solemn and perpetual peace and she almost groaned aloud in her chagrin and ************ as she thought surely if ever a woman was ******************* by an evil ******* certainly am in attempting to institute a parallel between the two men one seemed serene majestic and pure as the vast ******** of ****** glittering in the chill light of ***************** suns the other fiery thunderous

the church memory as if ******* with satan brought up the image of mr murray as he stood pleading for himself for his future she heard once more his thrilling passionate cry oh my darling my darling come to me and pressing her face to the lining of the carriage to stifle a groan she seemed to feel again the close clasp of his arms the throbbing of his heart against her cheek the warm tender lingering pressure of his lips on hers when they had crossed the ferry and were rattling over the streets of new york edna took her hands from her eyes and there was a rigid ******** in her face and a mournful hollowness in her voice as she said almost sorrowfully no mr manning we do not love each other and i can never be your wife it is useless for me to assure you that i am flattered by your preference that i am inexpressibly proud of the distinction you have generously offered to confer upon me sir you can not doubt that i do most fully and gratefully appreciate this honor which i had neither the right to expect nor the presumption to dream of my reverence and admiration are i confess almost boundless but i find not one atom of love and an examination of my feelings ********* me that i could never yield you that homage of heart that devoted affection which god demands that every wife should pay her husband you have quite as little love for me we enjoy each others society because our pursuits are similar our tastes congenial our aspirations identical in pleasant and profitable companionship we can certainly indulge as heretofore and it would greatly pain me to be deprived of it in future but this can be ours without the sinful mockery of a *********** such i hold a loveless union i feel that i must have your esteem and your society but your love i neither desire nor ever expect to possess for the sentiments you cherish for me are precisely similar to those which i entertain toward you mr manning we shall always be firm friends but nothing more an expression of surprise and disappointment drifted across but did not settle on the editors quiet countenance turning to her he answered with grave gentleness judge your own heart edna and accept my verdict with reference to mine do you suppose that after living single all these years i would ultimately marry a woman for whom i had no affection you spoke last week of the mirror of john ******** ******** which showed his beloved ********* her own image and though i am a proud and reticent man i beg you to believe that could you look into my heart you would find it such a mirror permit me to ask whether you intend to accept the love which i have reason to believe mr murray has offered you mr manning i never expect to marry any one for i know i shall never meet your superior and yet i can not accept your most flattering offer you fill all my requirements of noble christian manhood but after today this subject must not be alluded to are you not too hasty will you not take more time for reflection is your decision mature and final yes mr ************ ************ but do not throw me from you i am very very lonely and you surely will not forsake me there were tears in her eyes as she looked up pleadingly in his face and the editor sighed and paused a moment before he replied edna if under any circumstances you feel that i can aid or advise you i shall be exceedingly glad to render all the assistance in my power rest assured i shall not forsake you as long as we both shall live call upon me without hesitation and i will respond as readily and promptly as to the claims of my little lila in my heart you are associated with her you must not tax yourself so ************* or you will soon ruin your constitution there is a weariness in your face and a ******* in your manner mournfully prophetic of failing health either give up your situation as governess or abandon your writing i certainly recommend the former as i can not spare you from maga here the carriage stopped at mrs andrewss door and as he handed her out mr manning said edna my friend promise me that you will not write tonight thank you mr manning i promise she did not go to her desk but felix was restless feverish querulous and it was after midnight when she laid her head on her pillow the ******* in their noisy carts were clattering along the streets next morning before her heavy eyelids closed and she fell into a brief troubled slumber over which flitted a **** ******* of dreams where the central figure was always that tall one whom she had seen last standing at the railroad station with the

toiled to render it worthy of its noble theme had spared neither time nor severe trains of thought by day and by night she had searched and pondered she had prayed fervently and ceaselessly and worked ********* ************ to accomplish this darling hope of her heart to embody successfully this ambitious dream and at last the book was finished the manuscript was a mental tapestry into which she

book and now at last she could fold her tired hands and rest her weary brain but outraged nature suddenly swore vengeance and her overworked nerves rose in fierce rebellion refusing to be calm she had so long anticipated this hour that its arrival was greeted by emotions beyond her control as she contemplated the possible future of that pile of ms her heart bounded madly and then once more a fearful agony seized her and darkness and a sense of suffocation came upon her rising she strained her eyes and groped her way toward the window but ere she reached it fell and lost all consciousness the sound of the fall the crash of a china vase which her hand had swept from the table echoed startlingly through the silent house and aroused some of its inmates mrs andrews ran upstairs and into felixs room saw that he was sleeping soundly and then she hastened up another flight of steps to the apartment occupied by the governess the gas burned dazzlingly over the table where rested the roll of ms and on the floor near the window lay edna ringing the bell furiously to summon her husband and the servants mrs andrews knelt raised the girls head and rubbing her cold hands tried to rouse her the heart beat faintly and seemed to stop now and then and the white rigid face was as ghastly as if the dread kiss of ****** had indeed been pressed upon her still lips finding all her restoratives ineffectual mrs andrews sent her husband for the family physician and with the assistance of the servants laid the girl on her bed when the doctor arrived and questioned her she could furnish no clew to the cause of the attack save by pointing to the table where pen and paper showed that the sufferer had been at work edna opened her eyes at last and looked around at the group of anxious faces but in a moment the spasm of pain returned twice she muttered something and putting his ear close to her mouth the doctor heard her whispering to herself never mind it is done at last now i can rest an hour elapsed before the paroxysms entirely subsided and then with her ********* hands clasped and thrown up over her head the governess slept heavily *********** for two days she remained in her own apartment and on the morning of the third came down to the schoolroom with a slow weary step and a bloodless face and a feeling of hopeless helplessness she dispatched her ms to the publisher to whom she had resolved to offer it and leaning far back in her chair took up felixs greek grammar since the days of ********* ***** it had probably never appeared so tedious so intolerably tiresome as she found it now and she felt relieved almost grateful when mrs andrews sent for her to come to the library where dr howell was waiting to see her seating himself beside her the physician examined her countenance and pulse and put his ear close to her heart miss earl have you had many such attacks as the one whose effects have not yet passed away this is the second time i have suffered so severely though very frequently i find a disagreeable fluttering about my heart which is not very painful what mode of treatment have you been following none sir i have never consulted a physician humph is it possible he looked at her with the keen incisive eye of his profession and pressed his ear once more to her heart listening to the irregular and rapid ********** miss earl are you an orphan yes sir have you any living relatives none that i ever heard of did any of your family die suddenly yes i have been told that my mother died while apparently as well as usual and engaged in spinning and my

solved for the ********** of youth the hideous riddle scrawled on the walls dr howell can you do nothing for me her voice had sunk to a whisper and she leaned eagerly forward to catch his answer miss earl do you know what is meant by *********** of the heart yes yes i know she shivered slightly whether you inherited your disease i am not prepared to say but certainly in your case there are some grounds for the belief presently she said abstractedly but grandpa lived to be an old man the doctors eyes fell upon the mosaic floor of the library and then she knew that he could give her no hope when at last he looked up again he saw that she had dropped her face in her palms and he was awed by the deathlike repose of her figure the calm fortitude she evinced miss earl i never deceive my

writings with great pleasure and watched your brightening career with more interest than i ever felt in any other female author and god knows it is exceedingly painful for me to tear away the veil from your eyes from the first time you were pointed out to me in church i saw that in your countenance which distressed and alarmed me for its marble pallor whispered that your days were numbered frequently i have been tempted to come and expostulate with you but i knew it would be useless you have no reader who would more earnestly deplore the loss of your writings but for your own sake i beg you to throw away your pen and rest she raised her head and a faint smile crept feebly across her face rest rest if my time is so short i can not afford to rest there is so much to do so much that i

instead of treating me like a child you have frankly told me all more than once i have had a singular feeling a shadowy presentiment that i should not live to be an old woman but i thought it the

the possibility of crowding into two years the work which she had designed for twenty to tell the girl to rest was a mockery the tides of thought ebbed and flowed as ceaselessly as those of ocean and

she was earnestly striving to forget and she continually paced as far off as her shackles would permit sternly refusing to sit down meekly at the foot of the stake she worked late at night until her body was exhausted because she dreaded to lie awake tossing helplessly on her pillow haunted by precious recollections of days gone by forever her name was known in the world of letters her reputation was already enviable extravagant expectations were entertained concerning her future and to maintain her hold on public esteem to climb higher had become necessary for her happiness through mr mannings influence and friendship she was daily making the acquaintance of leading men in literature and their letters and conversation stimulated her to renewed exertion yet she had never stooped to conciliate popular prejudices had never written a line which her conscience did not dictate and her religious convictions sanction had bravely attacked some of the pet vices and shameless follies of society and had never penned a page without a prayer for guidance from on high now in her path rose gods reaper swinging his shining sickle threatening to cut off and lay low her budding laurel wreath while she stood silent and motionless in the quiet library the womans soul was wrestling with god for permission to toil a little while longer on earth to do some good for her race and to assist in saving a darkened soul almost as dear to her as her own she never knew how long that struggle for life lasted but when the prayer ended and she lifted her face the shadows and the sorrowful dread had

impartiality which gave such value to his ****************** it as if it had been written by an utter stranger he analyzed it thoroughly and while pointing out some serious errors which had escaped all eyes but his he bestowed upon a few passages praise which no other american writer had ever received from him and predicted that they would live when those who attempted to ridicule them were utterly forgotten in their graves the young author was told that she had not succeeded in her grand aim because the subject was too vast for the limits of a novel and her acquaintance with the mythologies of the world was not sufficiently extensive or intimate but she was encouraged to select other themes more in accordance with the spirit of the age in which she lived and the assurance was given to her that her writings were destined to exert a powerful influence on her race some faults of style were gravely reprimanded some beauties most cordially ********* and held up for the admiration of the world edna had as little literary conceit as personal vanity she saw and acknowledged the errors pointed out by mr manning and resolved to avoid them in future she felt that some objections urged against her book were valid but knew that she was honest and earnest in her work and could not justly be accused of trifling gratefully and joyfully she accepted mr mannings verdict and turned her undivided attention upon her new manuscript while the critics ******* the mass of readers warmly approved and many who did not fully appreciate all her arguments and illustrations were at least cleareyed enough to perceive that it was their misfortune not her fault gradually the book took firm hold on the affections of the people and a few editors came boldly to the rescue and ably

and today listening to low tones that traveled to her from le bocage edna looked out over the everchanging wrinkled face of the ocean and fell into a reverie silence reigned in the sittingroom hattie

shook the muslin curtains till light and shadow chased each other like waves over the noble ****** engraving of ******** vision of ******* which hung just above the piano after a while felix took his

it ***** roger hattie ran out to meet her mother who had been to new york and felix frowned took up his crutches and put on his hat edna turned and went to her own room and in a few moments hattie brought her a package of letters and a message from mrs andrews desiring her to come back to the sittingroom glancing over the directions the governess saw that all the letters were from strangers except one from mrs murray which she eagerly opened the contents were melancholy and unexpected mr hammond had been very ill for weeks was not now in immediate danger but was confined to his room and the physicians thought that he would never be well again he had requested mrs murray to write and beg edna to come to him and remain in his house mrs powell was in europe with gertrude and gordon and the old man was alone in his home mrs murray and her son having taken care of him thus far at the bottom of the page mr hammond had scrawled almost ********* my dear child i need you come to me at once mrs murray had added a postscript to tell her that if she would telegraph them upon what day she could arrange to start mr murray would come to new york for her edna put the letter out of sight and girded herself for a desperate battle with her famishing heart which bounded wildly at the tempting joys spread almost within ***** the yearning to go back to the dear old parsonage to the revered teacher to cheer and brighten his declining days and above all to see mr murrays face to hear his voice once more oh the temptation was strong indeed and the cost of resistance bitter beyond precedent having heard incidentally of the reconciliation that had taken place she knew why mr hammond so earnestly desired her presence in a house where mr murray now spent much of his time she knew all the arguments all the pleadings to which she must listen and she dared not trust her heart enter not into temptation was the warning which she uttered again and again to her own soul and though she feared the pastor would be pained she felt that he would not consider her ************** that his warm tender heart would understand hers though she had always studiously endeavored to expel mr murray from her thoughts there came hours when his image conquered when the longing the intense wish to see him was overmastering when she felt that she would give ten years of her life for one long look into his face or for a picture of him now when she had only to say come and he would be with her she sternly denied her starving heart and instead of bread gave it stones and serpents she took her pen to answer the letter but a pang which she had learned to understand told her that she was not now strong enough and swallowing some medicine which dr howell had prescribed she snatched up a crimson scarf and went down to the beach the serenity of her countenance had broken up in a fearful tempest and her face writhed as she hurried along to overtake felix just now she dreaded to be alone and yet the only companionship she could endure was that of the feeble cripple whom she had learned to love as woman can love only when all her early idols are in the dust wait for me felix the boy stopped turned and limped back to meet her for there was a strange pleading intonation in her mournfully sweet voice what is the matter miss earl you look troubled i only want to walk with you for i feel lonely this evening miss earl have you seen sir roger percival no no why should i see him felix my darling my little brother do not call me miss earl any longer call me edna ah child i am utterly alone i must have somebody to love me my heart turns to you she passed her arm around the boys shoulders and leaned against him while he rested on his crutches and looked up at her with fond pride edna i have wanted to call you so since the day i first saw you you know very well that i love you better than every thing else in the world if there is any good in me i shall have to thank you for it if ever i am useful it will be your work i am wicked still but i never look at you without trying to be a better boy you do not need meyou who are so great and gifted whose writings everybody reads and admires whose name is already famous oh you can not need any one and least of all a poor little helpless cripple who can only worship you and love the sound of your voice better than all the music that ever was played if i thought that you miss ********* book all the world is talking ******* i thought you really cared for **** edna edna i believe my heart would be too big for my poor little body felix we need each other do you suppose i would have followed you out here if i did not prefer your society to that of others something has happened since you sang the three ******* and sat looking out of the window an hour ago your face has changed what is it edna cant you trust me yes i received a letter which troubles me it announces the feeble health of a dear and noble friend who writes begging me to

now you can understand why i did not wish to be alone she leaned her cheek down on the boys head and both stood silent looking over the wide heaving waste of immemorial waters a glowing orange sky overarched an orange ocean which slowly became in turn ruby and rose and violet and pearly gray powdered with a few dim stars as the rising waves broke along the beach the stiffening breeze bent the spray till it streamed like silvery plumes and the low musical murmur swelled to a monotonous moan that seemed to come over the darkening waters like wails of the lost from some far far isles of the sea awed by the mysterious solemnity which ever broods over the ocean felix slowly repeated that dirge of tennysons break break break and when he commenced the last verse ednas voice low and quivering joined his out of the eastern sea up through ***** ********* rose the moon round radiant almost full shaking off the mists ********** the waves with a ghostly lustre the wind rose and fluttered ednas

beach i hope you will show sir roger all its beauties i commit him to your care she went toward the house with her boy and as sir roger took ednas hand and bent forward looking eagerly into her face she saw a pained and startled expression cross his own miss earl did you receive a letter from me written immediately after the perusal of your book yes sir roger and your cordial congratulations and

********** designing as apprentices on the sands of time that which as master builders we shall surely erect on the jasper pavements of eternity so let us all heed the noble words she seemed talking rather to herself or to the surging sea where her eyes rested than to sir roger and as he noticed the passionless pallor of her face he sighed and put his hands on hers come walk with me on the beach and let me tell you why i came back to new york instead of sailing from canada as i once intended a half hour elapsed and mrs andrews who was sitting alone on the piazza saw the governess coming slowly up the walk as she ascended the steps the lady of the house exclaimed where is sir roger he has gone well my dear pardon me for anticipating you but as i happen to know all about the affair accept my congratulations you are the ******** woman in america mrs andrews put her arm around ednas waist but something in the countenance astonished and disappointed her mrs andrews sir roger sails tomorrow for england he desired me to beg that you would excuse him for not coming to bid you goodbye sails tomorrow when does he return to america probably never edna earl you are an idiot you may have any amount of genius but certainly not one grain of common sense i have no patience with you i had set my heart on seeing you his wife but unfortunately for me i could not set my heart on him i am very sorry i wish we had never met for indeed i like sir roger but it is useless to discuss what is past and irremediable where are the children asleep i suppose after all show me a gifted woman a genius and i will show you a fool mrs andrews bit her lip and walked off and edna went upstairs to felixs room the boy was sitting by the open window watching gray clouds trailing across the moon ********** the face of the mighty deep now with shadow now with sheen so absorbed was he in his communing with the mysterious spirit of the sea that he did not notice the entrance of the governess until he felt her hand on his shoulder ah have you come at last edna i was wishing for you a little while ago for as i sat looking over the waves a pretty thought came into my mind and i want to tell you about it last week you remember we were reading about ****** and cleopatra and just now while i was watching a large star yonder making a shining track across the sea a ragged ************* cloud crept up and nibbled at the edge of the star and swallowed it and i called the cloud cleopatra swallowing her pearl edna looked wonderingly into the boys bright eyes and drew his head to her shoulder my dear felix are you sure you never heard that same thought read or quoted it is beautiful but this is not the first time i have heard it think my dear little boy try to remember where you saw it written indeed edna i never saw it anywhere i am sure i never heard it either for it seemed quite new when it ******* into my mind just now who else ever thought of it mr ******* **** an english poet whose writings are comparatively unknown in this country his works i have never seen but i read a review of them in an english book which contained many extracts and that pretty ******** which you used just now was among them is that review in our library no i am sure it is not but you may have seen the lines quoted somewhere else edna i am very certain i never heard it before do you recollect how it is written in the englishmans poem if you can repeat it i shall know instantly because my memory is very good i think i can give you one stanza for i read it when i was in great sorrow and it made an impression upon me the clouds like grim black faces come and go one tall tree stretches up against the sky it lets the rain through like a trembling hand pressing thin fingers on a watery eye the moon came but shrank back like a young girl who has burst in upon funereal sadness one star ***************** the night swallowed this one pearl in a fit of madness well felix you are a truthful boy and i can trust you i never heard the poetry before and i tell you edna the idea is just as much mine as it is mr ****** i believe you such coincidences are rare and people are very loath to admit the possibility but that they do occasionally occur i have no doubt perhaps some day when you write a noble poem and become a shining light in literature you may tell this circumstance to the world and bid it beware how it idly throws the charge of ********** against the set teeth of earnest honest workers edna i look at my twisted feet sometimes and i feel thankful that it is my body not my mind that is deformed if i am ever able to tell the world anything it will be how much i owe you for i trace all holy thoughts and pretty ideas to you and your music and your writings they sat there awhile in silence watching heavy masses of cloud darken the sea and sky and then felix lifted his face from ednas shoulder and asked timidly did you send sir roger away he goes to europe tomorrow i believe poor sir roger i am sorry for him i told mamma you never thought of him that you loved nothing but books and flowers and music how do you know that i have watched you and when he was with you i never saw that great shining light in your eyes or that strange moving of your lower lip that always shows me when you are really glad as you were that sunday when the music was so grand or that rainy morning when we saw the pictures of the two marys at the sepulchre i almost hated poor sir roger because i was afraid he might take you to england and then what would have become of me oh the world seems so different so beautiful so peaceful as long as i have you with me everybody praises you and is proud of you but nobody loves you as i do he took her hand passed it over his cheek and forehead and kissed it tenderly felix do you feel at all sleepy not at all tell me something more about the animalcula that cause the *************** ************ the top of each wave look like a

hear me call come to me quickly i must write a letter before i sleep sit here will you till i come back for the first time in her life she shrank from the thought of suffering alone and felt the need of a human presence edna let me call mamma i saw this afternoon that you were not well no it may pass off and i want nobody about me but you only a narrow passage divided her room from his and leaving the door open she sat down before her desk to answer mr hammonds appeal as the night wore on the wind became a gale the fitful bluish glare of the lightning showed fearful ranks of ******** waves scowling over each others shoulders a roar as of universal thunder shook the shore and in the ************* cathedral of the great deep wrathful ocean played a wild and weird fugue felix waited patiently listening amid the dead ******** of wind and wave for the voice of his governess but no sound came from the opposite room and at last alarmed by the ******* silence he took up his crutches and crossed the passage the muslin curtains blown from their ribbon ********** streamed like signals of distress on the breath of the tempest and the lamplight flickered and leaped to the top of its glass chimney on the desk lay two letters addressed respectively to mr hammond and mrs murray and beside them were scattered half a dozen notes from unknown correspondents asking for the autograph and photograph of the young author edna knelt on the floor hiding her face in the arms which were crossed on the lid of the desk the cripple came close to her and hesitated a moment then touched her lightly edna are you ill or are you only praying she lifted her head instantly and the blanched weary face reminded the boy of a picture of gethsemane which having once seen he could never recall without a shudder forgive me felix i forgot that you were ************* that i asked you to sit up she rose took the thin little form in her arms and whispered i am sorry i kept you up so long the

looking neither to the right nor left but keeping her eyes fixed upon that day when she should be called to render an account to him who would demand his own with interest instead of becoming flushed with success she grew daily more cautious more timid lest ************ or haste should betray her into errors consequently as the months rolled away each magazine article seemed an improvement on the

render so many of that class unpopular and ridiculous she felt that she was a target at which observers aimed random shafts and while devoting herself to study she endeavored to give due attention to

her pictures and autographs were eagerly sought after and the little barefooted tennessee child had grown up to celebrity sometimes when a basket of flowers or a handsome book or a letter of thanks and cordial praise was received from an unknown reader the young author was so overwhelmed with grateful appreciation of these little tokens of kindness and affection that she wept over them or prayed tremulously that she might make herself more worthy of the good opinion entertained of her by strangers mr manning whose cold searching eye was ever upon her could detect no exultation in her manner she was earnestly grateful for every kind word uttered by her friends and admirers for every favorable sentence penned about her writings but she seemed only gravely glad and was as little changed by praise as she had been by severe animadversion the sweet patient expression still rested on her face and her beautiful eyes beamed with the steady light of resignation rather than the starry sparkle of extravagant joy sometimes when the editor missed her at the literary reunions where her presence always contributed largely to the enjoyment of the evening and sought her in the schoolroom he was often surprised to find her seated beside felix reading to him or listening to his conversation with a degree of interest which she did not always offer to the *********** who visited her her power over the cripple was boundless his character was as clay in her hands and she was faithfully striving to model a noble hallowed life for she believed that he was destined to achieve distinction and

lustre upon his country and with this trust spurring her ever one she became more and more absorbed in her schemes for developing his intellect and sanctifying his heart people wondered how the lovely

day several months after their return from the seaside edna and felix sat in the library the boy had just completed ********* philip ii and the governess had promised to read to him ********* don ****** and goethes ****** in order to impress upon his memory the great actors of the netherland revolution she took up the copy of don ****** and crossing his arms on the top of his crutches as was his habit the pupil fixed his eyes on her face the reading had continued probably a halfhour when felix heard a whisper at the door and looking over his shoulder saw a stranger standing on the threshold he rose the movement attracted the attention of the governess and as she looked up a cry of joy rang through the room she dropped the book and sprang forward with open arms oh mrs murray dear friend for some moments they stood locked in a warm embrace and as felix limped out of the room he heard his governess sobbing mrs murray held the girl at arms length and as she looked at the wan thin face she exclaimed my poor edna my dear little girl why did not you tell me you were ill you are a mere ghost of your former self my child why did you not come home long ago i should have been here a month earlier but was detained by estelles marriage edna looked vacantly at her benefactress and her lips whitened as she asked did you say ********** married yes my dear she is now in new york

she met in europe edna what is the matter my child she found that she could not rouse her and in great alarm called for assistance mrs andrews promptly resorted to the remedies advised by dr howell but it was long before edna fully recovered and then she lay with her eyes closed and her hands clasped across her forehead mrs murray sat beside the sofa weeping silently while mrs andrews briefly acquainted her with the circumstances attending former attacks when the latter was summoned from the room and all was quiet edna looked up at mrs murray and tears rolled over her cheeks as she said i was so glad to see you the great joy and the surprise overcame me i am not as strong as i used to be in the old happy days at le bocage but after a little i shall be myself it is only occasionally that i have these attacks of faintness put your hand on my forehead as you did years ago and let me think that i am a little child again oh the unspeakable happiness of being with you once more hush do not talk now you are not strong enough mrs murray kissed her and tenderly smoothed the hair back from her blueveined temples where the blood still fluttered irregularly for some minutes the girls eyes wandered eagerly over her companions countenance tracing there the outlines of another and far dearer face and finding a resemblance between mother and son which she had never noticed before then she closed her eyes again and a half smile curved her trembling mouth for the voice and the touch of the hand seemed indeed mr murrays edna i shall never forgive you for not writing to me telling me frankly of your failing health oh scold me as much as you please it is a luxury to hear your voice even in ******* i knew mischief would come of this separation from me you belong to me and i mean to

end to such nonsense mrs murray why have you not mentioned mr hammond i almost dread to ask about him because you do not deserve to hear from him a grateful and affectionate pupil you have proved to be sure oh edna what has come over you child are you so intoxicated with your triumphs that you utterly forget your old friends who loved you when you were unknown to the world at first i thought so i believed that you were heartless like all of your class and completely wrapped up in ambitious schemes but my little darling i see i wronged you your poor white face reproaches me for my injustice and i feel that success has not spoiled you that you are still my little ****** sweet ******* daughter be quiet now and listen to me and try to keep that flutter out of your lips mr hammond is no worse than he has been for many months but he is very feeble and can not live much longer you know very well that he loves you tenderly and he says he can not die in peace without seeing you once more every day when i go over to the parsonage his first question is ellen is she ********** you heard from her i wish you could have seen him when st elmo was reading your book to him it was the copy you sent and when we read aloud the joint dedication to him and to myself the old man wept and asked for his glasses and tried to read it but could not he edna put out her hand with a mute gesture which her friend well understood and she paused and was silent while the governess turned her face to the wall and wept softly trying to compose herself ten minutes passed and she said please go on now mrs murray and tell me all he said you can have no idea how i have longed to know what you all at home thought of my little book oh i have been so hungry for home praise i sent the very earliest copies to you and to mr hammond and i thought it so hard that you never mentioned them at all my dear it was my fault and i confess it freely mr hammond of course could not write but he trusted to me to thank you in his name for the book and the dedication i was really angry with you for not coming home when i wrote for you and i was jealous of your book and would not praise it because i knew you expected it but because i was silent do you suppose i was not proud of my little girl if you could have seen the tears i shed over some of the ******** pronounced upon you and heard all the ugly words i could not avoid uttering against some of your critics you could not doubt my thorough appreciation of your success my dear it is impossible to describe mr hammonds delight as we read your novel to him often he would say st elmo read that passage again i knew she was a gifted child but i did not expect that she would ever write such a book as this when we read the last chapter he was completely overcome and said repeatedly god bless my little edna it is a noble book it will do ******** good to me it seems almost incredible that the popular author is the same little lame crushed orphan whom i lifted from the grass at the railroad track seven years ago edna had risen and was sitting on the edge of the sofa with one hand supporting her cheek and a tender glad smile shining over her features as she listened to the commendation of those dearer than all the world beside mrs murray watched her anxiously and sighed as she continued if ever a woman had a ********** you certainly possess one in huldah

as an ogre and the childs affection for him seems incomprehensible to those who only see the rough surface of his character she never saw a frown on his face or heard a harsh word from him for he is strangely tender in his treatment of the little thing sometimes it makes me start when i hear her merry laugh ringing through the house for the sound carries me far back into the past when my own children ****** and shouted at le bocage you were always a quiet demure and rather solemn child but this huldah is a gay little ****** st elmo is so astonishingly patient with her that estelle *******

blessing mrs murray sobbed and edna bent her own head lower in her palms for some seconds both were silent mrs murray seated herself close to the governess and clasped her arms around her edna why did you not tell me all why did you leave me to find out by accident that which should have been confided to me the girl trembled and a fiery spot burned on her cheeks as she pressed her forehead against mrs murrays bosom and said hastily to what do you allude why did you not tell me that my son loved you and wished to make you his wife i never knew what passed between you until about a month ago and then i learned it from mr hammond although i wondered why st elmo went as far as chattanooga with you on your way north i did not suspect any special interest for his manner betrayed none when after his return he merely said that he found no one on the train to whose care he could commit you now i know ******* why you left le bocage and i know too that in gods hands you have been the instrument

discuss with you why not my child can you not trust the mother of the man you love edna unwound the arms that clasped her and rising walked away to the mantelpiece leaning heavily against it she stood for some time with her face averted and beneath the veil of long floating hair mrs murray saw the slight figure sway to and fro like a reed shaken by the breeze edna i must talk to you about a matter which alone brought me to new york my sons happiness is dearer to me than my life and i have come to plead with you for his sake if not for your own at least to it is useless do not mention his name

enough to allow themselves to be trifled with moreover i shall not deny that at one period of his life he was ********** dissipated but all that happened long ago before you knew him how many young

troubled soul until then let us pray patiently flush and tremor had passed away the features were locked in rigid whiteness and the unhappy mother saw that further entreaty would indeed be fruitless she rose and paced the floor for some moments at last edna said how long will you remain in new york two days edna i came here against my sons advice in opposition to his wishes to intercede in his behalf and to prevail on you to go home with me he knew you better it seems than i did for he predicted the result and desired to save me from mortification but i obstinately clung to the belief that you cherish some feeling of affectionate gratitude toward me you have ********** me mr hammond is eagerly expecting you and it will be a keen disappointment to the old man if i return without you is

you will come to the hotel to see her and we will start homeward day after tomorrow evening she turned toward the door but edna caught her dress mrs murray kiss me before you go and tell me you forgive the sorrow i am obliged to cause you today my burden is heavy enough without the weight of your displeasure but the proud face did not relax the mother shook her head disengaged her dress and left the room an hour after felix came in and approaching the sofa where his governess rested said vehemently is it true edna are you going south with mrs murray yes i am going to see a dear friend who is probably dying oh edna what will become of me i shall be absent only a few weeks i have a horrible dread that if you go you will never come back dont leave me nobody needs you half as much as i

and hid his face on the back of his chair it was in vain that she endeavored by promises and caresses to reconcile him to her temporary absence he would not be comforted and his tearstained woebegone

so unexpectedly that hopes were entertained of his entire restoration and he spoke confidently of being able to reenter his pulpit on easter sunday the society of his favorite pupil seemed to render him completely happy and his countenance shone in the blessed light that gladdened his heart after a long dark stormy day the sun of his life was preparing to set in cloudless peace and glory into all of ednas literary schemes he entered eagerly she read to him the ms of her new book as far as it was written and was gratified by his perfect satisfaction with the style plot and aim mrs murray came every day to the parsonage but edna had not visited le bocage and though mr murray spent two mornings of each week with mr hammond he called at stated hours and she had not yet met him twice she had heard his voice in earnest conversation and several times she had seen his tall figure coming up the walk but of his features she caught not even a glimpse st elmos name had never been mentioned in her presence by either his mother or the pastor but huldah talked ceaselessly of his kindness to her knowing the days on which he came to the parsonage edna always ******** herself from the invalids room until the visit was over one afternoon she went to the church to play on the organ and after an hour of mournful enjoyment in the gallery so fraught with precious reminiscences she left the church and found tamerlane tied to the iron gate but his master was not visible she knew that he was somewhere in the building or yard and denied herself the pleasure of going there a second time neither glance nor word had been exchanged since they parted at the railroad station eighteen months before she longed to know his opinion of her book for many passages had been written with special reference to his perusal but she would not ask and it was a sore trial to sit in one room hearing the low indistinct murmur of his voice in the next and yet never to see him few women could have withstood the temptation but the orphan dreaded his singular power over her heart and dared not trust herself in his presence this evening as she sat with the firelight shining on her face thinking of the past she could not realize that only two years had elapsed since she came daily to this quiet room to recite her lessons for during that time she had suffered so keenly in mind and body that it seemed as if weary ages had gone over her young head involuntarily she sighed and passed her hand across her forehead a low tap at the door diverted her thoughts and a servant entered and gave her a package of letters from new york every mail brought one from felix and now opening his first a tender smile parted her lips as she read his passionate importunate appeal for her speedy return and saw that the closing lines were blotted with tears the remaining eight letters were from persons unknown to her and contained requests for autographs and photographs for short sketches for papers in different sections of the country and also various inquiries concerning the time when her new book would probably be ready for press all were kind friendly gratifying and one was eloquent with thanks for the good effect produced by a magazine article on a dissipated irreligious husband and father who after its perusal had resolved to reform and wished her to know the beneficial influence which she exerted at the foot of the page was a line penned by the rejoicing wife invoking heavens choicest blessings on the authors head is not the laborer worthy of his hire edna felt that her wages were munificent indeed that her coffers were filling and though the thank god was not audible the great joy in her uplifted eyes attracted the attention of the pastor who had been silently watching her and he laid his hand on hers what is it my dear the reward god has given me she read aloud the contents of the letter and there was a brief silence broken at last by mr hammond edna my child are you really happy so happy that i believe the wealth of california could not buy this sheet of paper which assures me that i have been instrumental in bringing sunshine to a darkened household in calling the head of a family from haunts of vice and midnight ****** back to his wife and children back to the shrine of prayer at his own hearthstone i have not lived in vain for through my work a human soul

step which you took one evening yonder in my church no sir i do not regret it i often thank god that i was able to obey my conscience and take that step suppose that in struggling up the steep path of

from ******** nook at this moment the ******** rang and soon after the servant brought in a telegraphic dispatch addressed to mr hammond it was from gordon leigh announcing his arrival in new york and stating that he and gertrude would reach the parsonage some time during the ensuing week edna went into the kitchen to superintend the preparation of the ministers supper and when she returned and placed the waiter on the table near his chair she told him that she must go back to new york immediately after the arrival of gordon and gertrude as her services would no longer be required at the parsonage and her pupils needed her two days passed without any further allusion to a subject which was evidently ********* in mr hammonds mind on the morning of the third mrs murray said as she rose

clara inge promised me that she would stay with you until evening edna get your bonnet i shall be entirely alone today for st elmo has carried huldah to the plantation and they will not get home until late so my dear we shall have the house all to ourselves the orphan could not deny herself the happiness offered she knew that she ought not to go but for once her strength failed her she yielded to the temptation during the drive mrs murray talked cheerfully of various things and for the first time laid aside entirely the haughty constraint which had distinguished her manner since they travelled south from new york they entered the avenue and edna gave herself up to the rushing recollections which were so mournfully sweet as they went into the house and the servants hurried forward to welcome her she could not repress her tears she felt that this was her home her hearts home and as numerous familiar objects met her eyes mrs murray saw that she was almost overpowered by her emotions i wonder if there is any other place on earth half so beautiful murmured the governess several hours later as they sat looking out over the lawn where the deer and sheep were browsing certainly not to our partial eyes and yet without you my child it does not seem like home it is the only home where you will ever be happy yes i know it but it cannot be mine mrs murray i want to see my own little room certainly you know the way i will join you there presently nobody has occupied it since you left for i feel toward your room as i once felt toward the empty cradle of my dead child edna went upstairs alone and closed the door of the apartment she had so long called hers and looked with childish pleasure and affection at the rosewood furniture turning to the desk where she had written much that the world now praised and loved she saw a vase containing a superb bouquet with a card attached by a strip of ribbon the hothouse flowers were arranged with exquisite taste and the orphans cheeks glowed suddenly as she recognized mr murrays handwriting on the card for edna earl when she took up the bouquet a small envelope similarly addressed dropped out for some minutes she stood irresolute fearing to trust herself with the contents then she drew a chair to the desk sat down and broke the seal my darling will you not permit me to see you before you leave the parsonage knowing the peculiar circumstances that brought you back i cannot take advantage of them and thrust myself into your presence without your consent i have left home today because i felt assured that much as you might desire to see le bocage you would never come here while there was a possibility of meeting me you who know something of my wayward sinful impatient temper can perhaps imagine what i suffer when i am told that your health is wretched that you are in the next room and yet that i must not shall not see ***** own edna do you wonder that i almost grow desperate at the thought that only a *****

and yet can never surprise the watching angel of wrath and have to stand shivering outside and see my eden only by the flashing of the sword that bars my entrance looking at the handwriting so different from any other which she had ever examined her thoughts were irresistibly carried back to that morning when at the shop she saw this handwriting for the first time on the blank leaf of the dante and she recalled the shuddering aversion with which her grandfather had glanced at it and advised her to commit it to the flames of the forge how many such notes as this had been penned to annie and gertrude and to that wretched woman shut up in an italian convent and to others of whose names she was ignorant mrs murray opened the door looked in and said come i want to show you something really beautiful edna put the note in her pocket took the bouquet and followed her friend downstairs through the rotunda to the door of mr murrays sittingroom my son locked this door and carried the key with him but after some search i have found another that will open it come in edna now look at that large painting hanging over the sarcophagus it is a copy of ******* christ crowned with thorns the original of which is in a ***** church i believe while st elmo was last abroad he was in genoa one afternoon when a boat was ******** being a fine ******* he sprang into the water where several persons were struggling and saved the lives of two little children of an english gentleman who had his hands quite full in ******** his wife two of the party were drowned but the father was so grateful to my son that he has written him several letters and last year he sent him this picture which though of course much smaller than the original is considered a very fine copy i begged to have it hung in the parlor but fearing i suppose that its history might possibly be discovered you know how he ******** anything like a parade of good deeds st elmo insisted on bringing it here to this egyptian museum where unfortunately people can not see it for some time they stood admiring it and then ednas eyes wandered away to the taj mahal to the cabinets and bookcases her lip began to quiver as every article of furniture babbled of the ******** the happy evenings spent ****** that hour when the idea of authorship first seized her mind and determined her future mrs murray walked up to the arch over which the curtains fell touching the floor and laying her hand on the folds of silk said hesitatingly i am going to show you something that my son would not easily forgive me for betraying for it is a secret he guards most jealously no i would rather not see it i wish to learn nothing which mr murray is not willing that i should know you will scarcely betray me to my son when you see what it is and beside i am determined you shall have no room to doubt the truth of some things he has told you there is no reason why you should not look at it do you recognize that face yonder over the mantelpiece she held the curtains back and despite her reluctance to glancing into the inner room edna raised her eyes timidly and saw in a ************ oval frame hanging on the opposite wall a ******** portrait of herself we learned from the newspapers that some fine photographs had been taken in new york and i sent on and bought two st elmo took one of them to an artist in charleston and superintended the painting of that portrait when he returned just before i went north he brought the picture with him and with his own hands hung it yonder i have noticed that since that day he always keeps the curtains down over the arch and never leaves the house without locking his rooms edna had dropped her crimsoned face in her hands but mrs murray raised it forcibly and kissed her i want you to know how well he loves ****** necessary you are to his happiness now i must leave you for i see mrs *********** carriage at the door you have a note to answer there are writing materials on the

features were so like those of an angel of death sometimes sculptured on ********* that mrs murray uttered a cry of alarm as she bent over her edna opened her arms and said in a feeble spent tone take

away as soon as possible oh i am ashamed of my weakness she rose and her pale lips writhed as her sad eyes wandered in a farewell glance around the room she put the unsealed note in mrs murrays hand and turned toward the door edna my daughter you have not refused st elmos request my mother pity me i could not grant it they have come i hear gertrudes ******* voice the words had scarcely passed mr

all to myself why you pale darling what a starved ghost you are not half as substantial as my shadow is she gordon oh edna how i have longed to see you to tell you how i enjoyed your dear delightful grand noble book to tell you what a great woman i think you are and how proud of you i am a gentleman who came over in the steamer with us asked me how much you paid me per ***** to puff you he was a

believe that he would marry his cousin but thank god he was wiser than i feared mr hammond are you sure that gertrude loves mr leigh oh yes my dear of that fact there can be no doubt why do you question it she told me once that mr murray had won her heart it was the first time edna had mentioned his name since her return and it brought a faint flush to her cheeks that was a childish whim which she has utterly forgotten a woman of her temperament never remains attached to a man from whom she is long separated i do not suppose that she remembered st elmo a month after she ceased to meet him i feel assured that she loves gordon as well as she can love any one she is a remarkably sweettempered unselfish ******** woman but is not capable of very deep lasting feeling i will go away at

and asked permission to come and plead his suit in person as edna hurriedly glanced over the pages and put them in her pocket gertrude said gayly shame on you gordon do you mean to say or rather to

but her old associates in the choir insisted that before she returned to new york she should sing with them once more thus far she had declined all invitations but on the morning of the last day of her visit the ******** called to say that a distinguished divine from a distant state would fill mr hammonds pulpit and as the best and leading soprano in the choir was disabled by severe cold and could not be present he begged that edna would take her place and sing a certain solo in the music which he had selected for an opening piece mr hammond who was pardonably proud of his choir was anxious that the stranger should be greeted and inspired by fine music and urged ednas compliance with the request reluctantly she consented and for the first time duty and love seemed to signal a truce to shake hands over the preliminaries of a treaty for peace as she passed through the churchyard and walked up the steps where a group of sabbathschool children sat talking her eyes involuntarily sought the dull brown spot on the marble over it little herbert inge had spread his white handkerchief and piled thereon his testament and catechism laying on the last one of those ************ and handsome pictorial cards containing a verse from the scriptures which are frequently distributed by sabbathschool teachers edna stooped and looked at the picture covering the bloodstain it represented our saviour on the mount delivering the sermon and in golden letters were printed his words judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye **** it shall be measured to you again the eyes of the divine preacher seemed to look into hers and the outstretched hand to point directly at her she trembled and hastily kissing the sweet red lips which little herbert held up to her she went in and up to the gallery the congregation assembled slowly and as almost all the faces were familiar to edna each arrival revived something of the past here the flashing silk flounces of a young belle brushed the straight black folds of widows weeds on the back of one seat was stretched the rough brown hand of a poor laboring man on the next lay the dainty fingers of a matron of wealth and fashion who had entirely forgotten to draw a glove over her sparkling diamonds in all the splendor of velvet feathers and ******** ***** mrs montgomery sailed proudly into her pew ********* her daughter maud who was smiling and whispering to her escort and just behind them came a *********** but happy young mechanic a

pictures on the windows when mr leigh and gertrude entered there was a general stir a lifting of heads and twisting of necks in order to ascertain what new styles of bonnet lace and mantle prevailed in paris a moment after mrs murray walked slowly down the aisle and ednas heart seemed to stand still as she saw mr murrays powerful form he stepped forward and while he opened the door of the pew and waited for his mother to seat herself his face was visible then he sat down closing the door the minister entered and as he ascended the pulpit the organ began to breathe its solemn welcome when the choir rose and commenced their chorus edna stood silent with her book in her hand and her eyes fixed on the murrays pew the strains of triumph ceased the organ only sobbed its sympathy to the ************ christ struggling along the via ******** and the orphans quivering lips parted and she sang her solo as her magnificent voice rose and rolled to the arched roof people forgot propriety and turned to look at the singer she saw mrs murray start and glance eagerly up at her and for an instant the grand pure voice faltered slightly as edna noticed that the mother whispered something to the son but he did not turn his proud head he only leaned his elbow on the side of the pew next to the aisle and rested his temple on his hand when the preliminary services ended and the minister stood up in the shining pulpit and commenced his discourse edna felt that st elmo had at last enlisted angels in his behalf for the text was contained in the warning whose gilded letters hid the ********* judge not that ye be not judged as far as two among his ******** were concerned the preacher might as well have addressed his sermon to the mossy slabs visible through the windows both listened to the text and neither heard any more edna sat looking down at mr murrays massive ************ head and she could see the profile contour of features regular and dark as if carved and bronzed during the next halfhour her vivid imagination sketched and painted a vision of ************* what might have been if that motionless man below there in the **************** pew had only kept his soul from grievous sins a vision of a happy proud young wife reigning at le bocage shedding the warm rosy light of her love over the lonely life of its master adding to his strong clear intellect and ripe experience the silver flame of her genius borrowing from him broader and more profound views of her race on which to base her ideal aesthetic structures softening refining his nature strengthening her own helping him to help humanity loving all good being good doing good serving and worshipping god together walking hand and hand with her husband through earths wide valley of **** with peaceful faces full of faith looking heavenward god pity them both and pity us all who vainly the dreams of youth recall for of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been at last with a faint moan which reached no ear but that of him who never slumbers edna withdrew her eyes from the spot where mr murray sat and raised them toward the pale christ whose wan lips seemed to murmur be of good cheer he that ********** shall inherit all things what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter the minister standing beneath the picture of the master whom he served closed the bible and ended his discourse by hurling his text as a thunderbolt at those whose upturned faces watched him finally brethren remember under all circumstances the awful admonition of jesus judge not that ye be not judged the organ peals and the ******** were concluded the benediction fell like gods dew alike on sinner and on saint and amid the solemn moaning of the gilded pipes the congregation turned to quit the church with both hands pressed over her heart edna leaned heavily against the railing tomorrow i go away for ever i shall never see his face again in this world oh i want to look at it once more as he stepped into the aisle mr murray threw his head back slightly and his eyes swept up to the gallery and met hers it was a long eager ************** gaze she saw a countenance more fascinating than of old for the sardonic glare had gone the bitterness the ******* ********* daredevil expression had given place to a stern mournfulness and the softening shadow of deep contrition and manly sorrow hovered over features where scoffing cynicism had so long scowled the magnetism of st elmos eyes was never more marvellous than when they rested on the beautiful white face of the woman he loved so well whose calm holy eyes shone like those of an angel as they looked sadly down at his in the mystic violet light with which the rich stained glass flooded the church that pallid suffering face sublime in its meekness and resignation hung above him like one of ********* saints over kneeling ********* worshippers as the moving congregation bore him nearer to the door she leaned farther over the mahogany balustrade and a snowy ****** which she wore at her throat snapped its brittle stem and floated down till it touched his shoulder he laid one hand over it holding it there and while a prayer burned in his splendid eyes hers smiled a melancholy farewell the crowd swept the tall form forward under the arches beyond the fluted columns of the gallery and the long gaze ended ah well for us all some sweet hope lies deeply buried from human eyes and in the hereafter angels may roll the stone from its grave away i am truly thankful that you have returned

she had at least ensconced herself securely in a citadel whence she could smilingly defy all ********** the warm hearts of her noble countrywomen safely sheltered in their sincere and devoted love she cared little for the shafts that rattled and broke against the rocky ramparts and recoiling dropped out of sight in the moat below so with many misgivings and much hope and great patience she worked on assiduously and early in summer her book was finished and placed in the publishers hands in the midst of her anxiety concerning its reception a new and terrible apprehension took possession of her for it became painfully evident that felix whose health had never been good was slowly but steadily declining mrs andrews and edna took him to sharon to saratoga and to various other favorite ******* for invalids but with no visible results that were at all encouraging and at last they came home almost disheartened dr howell finally prescribed a ********* and a sojourn of some weeks at **** bonne in the ******** as those waters had effected some remarkable cures as the doctor quitted the parlor where he held a conference with mr and mrs andrews the latter turned to her husband saying it is useless to start anywhere with felix unless miss earl can go with us for he would fret himself to death in a week really louis it is astonishing to see how devoted they are to each other feeble as that woman is she will always sit up whenever there is any medicine to be given during the night and while he was ill at sharon she did not close her eyes for a week i cant help feeling jealous of his affection for her and i spoke to her about it he was asleep at the time with his hand grasping one of hers and when i told her how trying it was for a mother to see her childs whole heart given to a stranger to hear morning noon and night edna always edna never once mamma i wish you could have seen the strange suffering expression that came into her pale face her lips trembled so that she could scarcely speak but she said meekly oh forgive me if i have won your childs heart but i love him you have your husband and daughter your brother and sister but *** i have only felix i have nothing else to cling to in all this world then she kissed his poor little fingers and wept as if her heart would break and wrung her hands and begged me again and again to forgive her if he loved her best she is the strangest woman i ever knew sometimes when she is sitting by me in church i watch her calm cold white face and she makes me think of a snow statue but if felix says anything to arouse her feelings and call out her affection she is a volcano it is very rarely that one finds a beautiful woman distinguished by her genius admired and courted by the reading public devoting herself as she does to our dear little crippled darling while i confess i am jealous of her her kindness to my child makes me love her more than i can express louis she must go with us poor thing she seems to be failing almost as fast as felix and i verily believe if he should die it would kill her did you notice how she paced the floor while the doctors were consulting in felixs room she loves nothing but my precious lame boy certainly kate she must go with you i quite agree with you my dear that felix is dependent upon her and would not derive half the benefit from the trip if she remained at home i confess she has cured me to a great extent of my horror of literary characters she is the only one i ever saw who was really lovable and not a walking ****** on her own writings you would be surprised at the questions constantly asked me about her habits and temper people seem so curious to learn all the routine of her daily life last week a member of our club quoted something from her writings and said that she was one of the few authors of the day whose books without having first examined he would put into the hands of his daughters he remarked i can trust my girls characters to her training for she is a true woman and if she **** at all in any direction it is the right one only a little too rigidly followed i am frequently asked how she is related to me for people can not believe that she is merely the governess of our children kate will you tell her that it is my desire that she should accompany you speak to her at once that i may know how many ********** i shall engage on the steamer come with me louis and speak to her yourself they went upstairs together and paused on the threshold of felixs room to observe what was passing within the boy was propped by pillows into an upright position on the sofa and was looking curiously into a small basket which edna held on her lap she was reading to him a touching little letter just received from an invalid child who had never walked who was confined always to the house and wrote to thank her in sweet childish style for a story which she had read in the magazine and which made her very happy the invalid stated that her chief amusement consisted in tending a few flowers that grew in pots in her windows and in token of her gratitude she had made a ******* of mignonette ******* and geranium leaves which she sent with her ********* letter in conclusion the child asked that the woman whom without having seen she yet loved would be so kind as to give her a list of such books as a little girl ought to study and to write her just a few lines that she could keep under her pillow to look at now and then as edna finished reading the note felix took it to examine the small indistinct characters and said dear little thing dont you wish we knew her ***** lawrence of course you will answer it edna yes immediately and tell her how grateful i am for her generosity in sparing me a portion of her pet flowers each word in her sweet little letter is as precious as a pearl for it came from the very depths of her pure heart oh what a blessed thing it is to feel that you are doing some good in the world that little ***** says she prays for you every night before she goes to sleep what a comfort such letters must be to you edna how happy you look but there are tears shining in your eyes they always come when you are glad what books will you tell her to study i will think about the subject and let you read my answer give me the ******* i want to put it away securely among my treasures how *********** fragrant the flowers are only smell them felix here my darling i will give them to you and write to the little ***** how happy she made two people she lifted the delicate bouquet so daintily fashioned by fairy ************ inhaled the perfume and as she put it in the thin fingers of the cripple she bent forward and kissed his ************ lips at this instant felix saw his parents standing at the door and held up the flowers triumphantly oh mamma come smell this mignonette why cant we grow some in boxes in our window mr andrews leaned over his sons pillows softly put his hand on the boys forehead and said my son miss earl ********* to love you very much but i doubt whether she really means all she says and i am determined to satisfy myself fully just now i can not leave my business but mamma intends to take you to europe next week and i want to know whether miss earl will leave all her admirers here and go with you and help mamma to nurse you do you think she will mrs andrews stood with her hand resting on the shoulder of the governess watching the varying expression of her childs countenance i think ***** hope she will i believe she he paused and struggling up from his pillows he stretched out his poor little arms and exclaimed oh edna you will go with me you promised you would never forsake me tell papa you will go his head was on her shoulder his arms were clasped tightly around her neck she laid her face on his and was silent mr andrews placed his hand on the orphans bowed head miss earl you must let me tell you that i look upon you as a member of my family that my wife and i love you almost as well as if you were one of our children and i hope you will not refuse to accompany kate on the tour she ************ let me take your own fathers place and i shall

hope for felix thank you mr andrews i appreciate your generosity and i prize the affection and confidence which you and your wife have shown me i came an utter stranger into your house and you kindly made me one of the family circle i am alone in the world and have become strongly attached to your children felix is not merely my dear pupil he is my brother my companion my little darling i can not be separated from him next to his mother he belongs to me oh i will travel with him anywhere that you and mrs andrews think it best he should go i will never never leave him she disengaged the boys

it to my countrywomen the queens who reign thereon the aim of the book was to discover the only true and ********* and womanly sphere of feminine work and though the theme was threadbare she

upon good ground and promised an abundant harvest many who called to bid her goodbye on the day before the steamer sailed found it impossible to disguise their apprehensions that she would never return and some who looked ********* into her face and whispered godspeed thought they saw the dread signet of death set on her white brow to edna it was inexpressibly painful to cross the atlantic while mr hammonds health was so feeble and over the long farewell letter which she sent him with a copy of her new book the old man wept mrs murray had seemed entirely estranged since that last day spent at le bocage and had not written a line since the orphans return to new york but when she received the new novel and the affectionate mournful meek note that accompanied it mrs murray laid her head on her sons bosom and sobbed aloud dr howell and mr manning went with edna aboard the steamer and both laughed heartily at her efforts to disengage herself from a ************ young ********** who with his arms full of copies of her own book stopped her on deck and ******* extolled its merits insisting that she should buy one to while away the tedium of the voyage dr howell gave final directions concerning the treatment of felix and then came to speak to the governess even now sadly as you have abused your constitution i shall have some hope of seeing gray hairs about your temples if you will give yourself unreservedly to relaxation of mind you have already accomplished so much that you can certainly afford to rest for some months at least read nothing write nothing except long letters to me study nothing but the aspects of nature in european scenery and you will come back improved to the country that is so justly proud of you disobey my *********** and i shall soon be called to mourn over the announcement that you have found an early grave far from your native land and among total strangers god bless you dear child and bring you safely back to us as he turned away mr manning took her hand and said i hope to meet you in rome early in february but something might occur to veto my programme if i should never see you again in this world is there anything that you wish to say to me now yes mr manning if i should die in europe have my body brought back to america and carried to the ******* own dear south that i love so ******* bury me close to grandpa where i can sleep quietly in the cool shadow of old lookout and be sure please be sure to have my name carved just below grandpas on his monument i want that one marble to stand for us both i will is there nothing else thank you my dear good kind friend nothing else edna promise me that you will take care of your precious life i will try mr manning he looked down into her worn weary face and sighed then for the first time he took both her hands kissed them and left her swiftly the steamer took its way seaward through the narrows past the lighthouse and the wind sang through the rigging and the purple hills of jersey faded from view proving ********* a misnomer one by one the passengers went below and edna and felix were left on deck with stars burning above and blue waves bounding beneath them as the cripple sat looking over the solemn moaning ocean awed by its brooding gloom did he catch in the silvery starlight a second glimpse of the rosecolored veils and snowy ****** and *********** robes of the ****** spinning and singing as they followed the ship across the sobbing sea he shivered and clasping tightly the hand of his governess said edna we shall never see the ********* again god only knows dear felix his will be done how silvery the echoes run thy will be ******* will be done worthy no no unworthy most unworthy but was thomas worthy to tend the wandering sheep of him whom face to

had persecuted and slaughtered if the repentance of peter and paul availed to purify their hands and hearts and sanctify them to the service of christ ah god knows my contrition has been bitter and lasting enough to fit me for future usefulness eight months ago when the desire to become a minister seized me so tenaciously i wrestled with it tried to crush it arguing that the knowledge of my past life of ********** would prevent the world from trusting my professions but those who even slightly understand my character must know that i have always been too utterly indifferent to too unfortunately contemptuous of public opinion to stoop to any deception in order to conciliate it moreover the world will realize that in a mere worldly point of view i can possibly hope to gain nothing by this step if i were poor i might be accused of wanting the loaves and fishes of the profession if unknown and ambitious of seeking eminence and popularity but when a man of my wealth and social position after spending half of his life in luxurious ease and sinful indulgence voluntarily subjects himself to the rigid ************** and selfsacrificing requirements of a ministerial career he can not be suspected of hypocrisy after all sir i care not for the discussion of nine days gossip and wonder the gibes and comments my course may occasion i am ********** to the counsel of my conscience i am obeying the dictates of my heart feeling that my god accepts me it matters little that men may reject me my remorse my repentance has been inexpressibly bitter but the darkness has passed away and today thank god i can pray with all the fervor and faith of my boyhood when i knew that i was at peace with my maker oblivion of the past i do not expect and perhaps should not desire i shall always wear my melancholy memories of sin as ********* wear their ****** or pallas a continual memento of death because i have proved so fully the inadequacy of earthly ********** to satisfy the demands of a soul because i tried the alluring pleasures of sin and was satiated ah utterly sickened i turned with panting eagerness to the cool quiet peace which reigns over the life of a true christian pastor i want neither fame nor popularity but peace peace i must have i have hunted the world over and over i have sought it everywhere else and now thank god i feel that it is descending slowly slowly but surely upon my lonely ************ heart thank god i have found peace after much strife and great weariness mr murray could no longer control his voice and as he stood leaning against the mantelpiece at the parsonage he dropped his head on his hand st elmo the purity of your motives will never be questioned for none who knows you could believe you capable of *********** in this matter and my heart can scarcely contain its joy when i look forward to your future so bright with promise so full of usefulness the marked change in your manner during the past two years has prepared this community for the important step you are to take today and your influence with young men will be incalculable once your stern bitterness rendered you an object of dread now i find that you are respected and people here watch your conduct with interest and even with anxiety ah st elmo i never imagined earth held as much pure happiness as is my portion today to see you one of gods ******** to see you ministering in the temple oh to know that when i am gone to rest you will take my place guard my flock do your own work and poor murrays and finish mine this this is indeed the crowning blessing of my old age for some minutes mr hammond sobbed and lifting his face mr murray answered as i think of the coming years consecrated to christ passed peacefully in endeavoring to atone for the injury and suffering i have inflicted on my fellowcreatures oh as the picture of a calm useful holy future rises before me i feel indeed that i am unworthy most unworthy of my peace but thank god oh i see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set ancient ****** of inspiration well through all my fancy yet it was a beautiful sabbath morning just one year after ednas departure and the church was crowded to its utmost capacity for people had come for many miles around to witness a ceremony the announcement of which had given rise to universal comment as the hour approached for the ordination of st elmo murray to the ministry of jesus christ even the doors were filled with curious spectators and when mr hammond and st elmo walked down the aisle and the old man seated himself in a chair within the altar there was a general stir in the congregation the *********** minister had come from a distant city to perform a ceremony of more than usual interest and when he stood up in the pulpit and the organ thundered through the arches st elmo bowed his head on his hand and sat thus during the hour that ensued the ordination sermon was solemn and eloquent and preached from the text in romans for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life then the minister having finished his discourse came down before the altar and commenced the services but mr murray sat motionless with his countenance concealed by his hand mr hammond approached and touched him and as he rose led him to the altar and presented him as a candidate for ordination there before the shining marble pulpit which he had planned and built in the early years of his life for the idol of his youth stood st elmo and the congregation especially those of his native village looked with involuntary admiration and pride at the erect powerful form clad in its suit of ******* the nobly proportioned head where gray locks were visible but if there be any of you who ******* any impediment or crime for the which he ought not to be received into this holy ministry let him come forth in the name of god and show what the crime or impediment is the preacher paused the echo of his words died away and perfect silence reigned suddenly st elmo raised his eyes from the railing of the altar and turning his face slightly looked through the eastern window at the ********* vault where slept murray and annie the world was silent but conscience and the dead accused him an expression of intolerable pain crossed his handsome features then his hands folded themselves tightly together on the top of the marble balustrade and he looked appealingly up to the pale jesus staggering under his cross at that instant a spotless white pigeon from the belfry found its way into the church through the open doors circled once around the building fluttered against the window hiding momentarily the crown of thorns and frightened and confused fell upon the fluted pillar of the pulpit an electric thrill ran through the congregation and as the minister resumed the services he saw on st elmos face a light a great joy such as human countenances rarely wear this side of the grave when mr murray knelt and the ********* hands were laid upon his head a sob was heard from the pew where his mother sat and the voice of the preacher faltered as he delivered the bible to the kneeling man saying take thou authority to preach the word of god and to administer the holy ********** in the congregation there were no dry eyes in the entire assembly save two that looked out coldly blue from the pew where mrs powell sat like a statue between her daughter and gordon leigh mr hammond tottered across the altar and knelt down close to mr murray and many who knew the history of the pastors family wept as the gray head fell on the broad shoulder of st elmo whose arm was thrown around the old mans form and the ********* minister with tears rolling over his face extended his hands in benediction above them the peace of god which passeth all understanding keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of god and of his son jesus christ our lord and the blessing of god almighty the father the son and the holy ghost be among you and remain with you ***** and all hearts and lips present whispered amen and the organ and the choir broke forth in a grand ****** in ******** standing there at the chancel purified consecrated henceforth unreservedly to christ mr murray looked so happy so noble so worthy of his high calling that his proud fond mother thought his face was fit for an ********** wings many persons who had known him in his boyhood came up with tears in their eyes and wrung his hand silently at last huldah pointed to the white pigeon that was now beating its wings against the gilded pipes of the organ and said in that singularly sweet solemn hesitating tone with which children approach sacred things oh mr murray when it fell on the pulpit it nearly took my breath away for i almost thought it was the holy ghost tears which till then he had bravely kept back dripped over his face as he stooped and whispered to the little orphan huldah the holy spirit the comforter came indeed but it was not visible it is here in my heart the congregation dispersed mrs murray and the preacher and huldah went to the carriage and leaning on mr murrays arm mr hammond turned to follow but observing that the church was empty the former said after a little i will come the old man walked on and mr murray went back and knelt resting his head against the beautiful glittering balustrade within which he hoped to officiate through the remaining years of his earthly career once the sexton who was waiting to lock up the church looked in saw the man praying alone there at the altar and softly stole away when st elmo came out the churchyard seemed deserted but as he crossed it going homeward a woman rose from one of the tombstones and stood before himthe yellowhaired ******* with sapphire eyes and soft treacherous red lips who had goaded him to madness and blasted the best years of his life at sight of her he recoiled as if a ***** had started up in his path st elmo my beloved in the name of other days stop and hear me by the memory of our early love i entreat you she came close to him and the alabaster face was *********** beautiful in its expression of *********** sweetness st elmo can you never forgive me for the suffering i caused you in my giddy girlhood she took his hand and attempted to raise it to her lips but shaking off her touch he stepped back and steadily they looked in each others eyes agnes i forgive you may god pardon your sins as he has pardoned mine he turned away but she seized his ********** and threw herself before him standing with both hands clasping his arm if you mean what you say there is happiness yet in store for us oh st elmo how often have i longed to come and lay my head down on your bosom and tell you all but you were so stern and harsh i was afraid today when i saw you melted when the look of your boyhood came dancing back to your dear eyes i was encouraged to hope that your heart had softened also toward one who so long possessed it is there hope for your poor agnes hope that the blind

his shoulder but he resisted and put her at arms length from him holding her there he looked at her with a cold scorn in his eyes and a heavy shadow darkening the brow that five minutes before had been so calm so bright agnes how dare you attempt to deceive me after all that has passed between us oh woman in the name of all true womanhood i could blush for you she struggled to free herself to get closer to him but his stern grasp was relentless and as tears poured down her cheeks she clasped her hands and sobbed out you do not believe that i really love you oh do not look at me so harshly i am not deceiving you as i hope for pardon and rest for my ****** i hope to see my fathers face in ******* am not deceiving you i *** do love you when i spoke to you about gertrude it cost me a

a stimulating potion and arranged his head comfortably ere long his heavy breathing told her that he slept and stealing from his side she sat down in a large chair near the head of his bed and watched him for many months he had been failing and they had travelled from place to place hoping against hope that each change would certainly be beneficial day and night edna had nursed him had devoted every thought almost every prayer to him and now her heart seemed centred in him scenery music painting rare mss all were ignored she lived only for that poor dependent boy and knew not a moment of peace when separated from him she had ceased to study aught but his comfort and happiness had written nothing save letters to friends and notwithstanding her anxiety concerning the cripple the frequent change of air had surprisingly improved her own health for six months she had escaped the attacks so much dreaded and began to believe her restoration complete though the long banished color obstinately refused to return to her face which seemed unable to recover its rounded outline still she was very grateful for the ******** from suffering especially as it permitted more unremitting attendance upon felix she knew that his life was flickering out gently but surely and now as she watched the pale pinched features her own quivered and she clasped her hands and wept and stifled a groan she had prayed so passionately and continually that he might be spared to her but it seemed that whenever her heartstrings wrapped themselves around an idol a jealous god tore them loose and snatched away the dear object and left the heart to bleed if that boy died how utterly desolate and lonely she would be nothing left to care for and to cling to nothing to claim as her own and ****** with the tender love of her warm heart she had been so intensely interested in the expansion of his mind had striven so tirelessly to stimulate his brain and soften and purify his heart she had been so proud of his rapid progress and so ambitious for his future and now the mildew of death was falling on her fond hopes ah she had borne patiently many trials but this appeared unendurable she had set all her earthly happiness on a little ******** life of a helpless cripple and as she gazed through her tears at that shrunken sallow face so dear to her it seemed hard hard that god denied her this one blessing what was the praise and admiration of all the world in comparison with the loving light in that childs eyes and the tender pressure of his lips the womans ambition had long been fully satisfied and even exacting conscience jealously guarding its shrine saw daily sacrifices laid thereon and smiled *********** upon her but the womans hungry heart cried out and fought fiercely ************ for its last vanishing morsel of human love and sympathy verily these ********** of the heart are fearful things and crucified consciences too often mark their track the little figure on

threw up her clenched hands and prayed ********* my father spare the boy to me i will dedicate anew my life and his to thy work i will make him a minister of thy word and he shall save precious souls oh do not take him away if not for a lifetime at least spare him a few years even one more year o my god she walked to the window rested her forehead against the stone facing and looked out and the wonderful witchery of the solemn night wove its spell around her great golden stars clustered in the clear heavens and were reflected in the calm blue pavement of the mediterranean where not a ripple shivered their shining images a waning crescent moon swung high over the eastern crest of the apennines and threw a weird light along the ****** marble palace and down on the silver gray olives on the glistening ************ ************ with fragrant bloom and in that wan mysterious and most melancholy light the old miraculous mountains heaved in sight one straining past another along the shore the way of grand dull ******** ghosts ******* to drink the cool blue wine of seas and stare on ******** from some lofty ********* in a distant section of the silent city sounded the ******* bell and from the deep shadow of olive vine and myrtle that clothed the amphitheatre of hills the convent bells caught and reechoed it nature comes sometimes and says i am ambassador for god and the splendor of the italian night spoke to ednas soul as the glory of the sunset had done some years before when she sat in the dust in the pine glades at le bocage and she grew calm once more while out of the blue depths of the ******* sea came a sacred voice that said to her aching heart peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid the cup was not passing away but courage to drain it was given by him who never calls his faithful children into the gloom of gethsemane without having first stationed close at hand some strengthening angel the governess went back to the bed and there on the pillow rested the moth which at her approach flew away with a humming sound and disappeared after another hour she saw that a change was stealing over the boys countenance and his pulse fluttered more feebly against her cold fingers she sprang into the next room shook his mother and hastened back trying to rouse the dying child and give him some stimulants but though the large black eyes opened when she raised his head there was no recognition in their fixed gaze for the soul was preparing for its final flight and was too busy to look out of its windows in vain they resorted to the most powerful restoratives he remained in the heavy stupor with no sign of animation save the low irregular breath and the weak flutter of the threadlike pulse mrs andrews wept aloud and wrung her hands and hattie cried passionately as she stood in her long white nightgown at the side of her brothers bed but there were no tears on ednas cold gray face she had spent them all at the foot of gods throne and now that he had seen fit to deny her petition she silently looked with dry eyes at the heavy rod that smote her the night waned the life with it now and then the breathing seemed to cease but after a few seconds a faint gasp told that the clay would not yet forego its hold on the soul that struggled to be free the poor mother seemed almost beside herself as she called on her child to speak to her once more sing something edna oh perhaps he will hear it might rouse him the orphan shook her head and dropped her face on his he would not hear me no no he is listening to the song of those whose golden harps ring in the new jerusalem out of the whitening east rose the new day radiant in bridal garments wearing a star on its pearly brow and the sky flushed and the sea glowed while silvery mists rolled up from the purple mountain gorges and rested awhile on the ******* of the apennines and sunshine streamed over the world once more the first rays flashed into the room kissing the withered flowers on the bosom of the cripple and falling warm and bright on the cold eyelids and the pulseless temples ednas hand was pressed to his heart and she knew that it had given its last throb knew that felix andrews had crossed the sea of glass and in the dawn of the eternal day wore the promised *********** and stood in peace before the sun of righteousness during the two days that succeeded the death of felix edna did not leave her room and without her knowledge mrs andrews administered ******* that ********* her late on the morning of the third she awoke and lay for some time trying to collect her thoughts her mind was clouded but gradually it cleared and she strained her ears to distinguish the low words spoken in the apartment next to her own she remembered as in a feverish dream all that passed on the night that felix died and pressing her hand over her aching forehead she rose and sat on the edge of her bed the monotonous sounds in the neighboring room swelled louder for a few seconds and now she heard very distinctly the words and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth she shivered and wrapped around her shoulders a bright blue shawl that had been thrown over the foot of the bed walking across the floor she opened the door and looked in the boys body had been embalmed and placed in a coffin which rested in the centre of the room and an english clergyman a friend of mr mannings stood at the head of the corpse and read the burial service mrs andrews and hattie were weeping in one corner and mr manning leaned against the window with his hand on ***** curls as the door swung open and edna entered he looked up her dressing gown of gray merino trailed on the marble floor and her bare feet gleamed like ivory as one hand caught up the soft merino folds sufficiently to enable her to walk over the blue shawl streamed her beautiful hair making the wan face look even more ghastly by contrast with its glossy jet masses she stood irresolute with her calm mournful eyes riveted on the coffin and mr manning saw her pale lips move as she staggered toward it he sprang to meet and intercept her and she stretched her hands in the direction of the corpse and smiled strangely murmuring like one in a troubled dream you need not be afraid little darling there is no night there she reeled and put her hand to her heart and would have fallen but mr manning caught and carried her back to her room for two weeks she hovered on the borders of eternity and often the anxious friends who watched her felt that they would rather see her die than endure the suffering through which she was called to pass she bore it silently meekly and when the danger seemed over and she was able to sleep without the aid of ********* mrs andrews could not bear to look at the patient white face so hopelessly calm no allusion was made to felix even after she was able to sit up and drive but once when mr manning brought her some flowers she looked sorrowfully at the snowy ************** whose strong perfume made her turn paler and said faintly i shall never love them or violets again take them away hattie out of my sight put them on your brothers grave they smell of death from that day she made a vigorous effort to rouse herself and the boys name never passed her lips though she spent many hours over a small manuscript which she found among his books directed to her for revision tales for little ******** was the title he had given it and she was surprised at the beauty and pathos of many of the sentences she carefully revised and ******* it adding a brief sketch of the young writer and gave it to his mother about a month after felixs death the governess seemed to have recovered her physical strength and mrs andrews announced her intention of going to germany mr manning had engagements that called him to france and on the last day of their stay at genoa he came as usual to spend the evening with edna a large ****** of letters and papers had arrived from america and when he gave her the package containing her share she glanced over the directions threw them unopened into a heap on the table and continued the conversation in which she was engaged concerning the architecture of the churches in genoa mrs andrews had gone to the vault where the body of her son had been temporarily placed and edna was alone with the editor you ought to look into your papers they contain very gratifying intelligence for you your last book has gone through ten ******** and your praises are chanted all over your native land surely if ever a woman had adulation enough to render her perfectly happy and pardonably proud you are the fortunate individual already your numerous readers are inquiring when you will give them another book she leaned her head back against her chair and the little hands caressed each other as they rested on her knee while her countenance was eloquent with humble gratitude for the success that god had permitted to crown her efforts but she was silent do you intend to write a book of travels embracing the incidents that have marked your tour i see the public expect it no sir it seems now a mere matter of course that all ********** who come to europe should afflict the reading world with an account of what they saw or failed to see so many noble books have been already published thoroughly describing this continent that i have not the temerity the presumption to attempt to ******* the grand old ************ at present i expect to write nothing i want to study some subjects that greatly interest me and i shall try to inform and improve myself and keep silent until i see some phase of truth neglected or some new aspect of error threatening mischief in society indeed i have great cause for gratitude in my

throwing crowns and laurel wreaths from her right hand while only thorns dropped in a sharp stinging shower from the other but after a time the wheel turned and now i feel only the soft pattering of the laurel leaves god knows i do most earnestly appreciate his abundant blessing upon what i have thus far striven to effect but until i see my way clearly to some subject of importance which a womans hand may touch i shall not take up my pen books seem such holy things to me destined to plead either for or against their creators in the final tribunal that i dare not lightly or hastily attempt to

public confidence i dare not even if i could dash off articles and books as the ***** shakes ********** from his oars and i humbly acknowledge that what success i may have achieved is owing to hard faithful work i have received so many kind letters from children that some time if i live to be wise enough i want to write a book especially for them i am afraid to attempt it just now for it requires more mature judgment and experience and greater versatility of talent to write successfully for children than for grown persons in the latter one is privileged to assume native intelligence and cultivation but the tender untutored minds of the former permit no such margin and this fact ************ clearness and simplicity of style and power of illustration that seem to me very rare as yet i am conscious of my ********** for the mission of preparing juvenile books but perhaps if i study closely the characteristics of young people i shall learn to understand them more thoroughly so

strangers and they greatly cheered and encouraged her but finally she opened one whose superscription had until this instant escaped her ******* glance it was from mr hammond and contained an account of mr murrays ordination she read and reread it with a ************** expression in her countenance for the joy seemed far too great for credence she looked again at the date and signature and passing

hopelessness and silent ************** most unexpected and glorious fruition of the prayers of many ******** so sudden and intoxicating that it completely unnerved her she could not bear this great

evening in each week for the reception of her numerous kind friends and of all strangers who desired to call upon her these reunions were brilliant and delightful and it was considered a privilege to

comprehending ednas abhorrence of double ******** and of the fashionable sans ***** style of conversation which was tolerated by many who really disliked but had not nerve enough to frown it down was not a secret to any one who read her writings or attended her receptions without ********* her rigid views of true womanly delicacy and decorum upon any one her deportment under all circumstances

different system of study which gave her more sleep and allowed her some hours of daylight for her literary labors in the industrial pursuits of her own sex she was intensely interested and spared no trouble in acquainting herself with the statistics of those branches of employment already open to them consequently she was never so happy as when the recipient of letters from the poor women of the land who thanked her for the words of hope advice and encouragement which she constantly addressed to them while the world honored her she had the precious assurance that her christian countrymen loved and trusted her she felt the painful need of mr mannings society and even his frequent letters did not fully satisfy her but as he had resolved to remain in europe at least for some years she bore the irreparable loss of his counsel and sympathy as she bore all other privations bravely and quietly now and then alarming symptoms of the old suffering warned her of the uncertainty of her life and after much deliberation feeling that her time was limited she commenced another book mr hammond wrote begging her to come to him as he was now hopelessly infirm and confined to his room but she shrank from a return to the village so intimately associated with events which she wished if possible to forget and though she declined the invitation she proved her affection for her venerable teacher by sending him every day a long cheerful letter since her departure from the parsonage mrs murray had never written to her but through mr hammonds and huldahs letters edna learned that mr murray was the *********** minister in the church which he had built in his boyhood and now and then the old pastor painted pictures of life at le bocage that brought happy tears to the orphans eyes

piano the guests took their ************ carriages rolled away mrs andrews ran up to her room and edna paused in the brilliantly lighted parlors to read a note which had been handed to her during the

lips stirred also and the low tone was full of pathos as she said how very grateful i ought to be how much i have to make me happy to encourage me to work diligently and faithfully how comforting it is to feel that parents have sufficient confidence in me to be willing to commit their children to my care what more can i wish my cup is brimmed with blessings ah why am i not entirely happy the note contained the signature of six wealthy gentlemen who requested her acceptance of a tasteful and handsome house on condition that she would consent to undertake the education of their daughters and permit them to pay her a liberal salary it was a flattering tribute to the clearness of her intellect the ********* of her judgment the extent of her acquirements and the purity of her heart while she could not accede to the proposition she appreciated most gratefully the generosity and good opinion of those who made it twisting the note between her fingers her eyes fell on the carpet and she thought of all her past of the sorrows struggles and ********** the sleepless nights and weary joyless ********* of adverse then of favorable criticism of toiling hoping dreading praying and now in the peaceful zenith of her triumph popularity and usefulness she realized that care and trial seem at last through ******* sunset air like mountain ranges ******** in purple distance fair the note fluttered to the floor the hands folded themselves together and she raised her eyes to utter an humble fervent thank god but the words froze on her lips for as she looked up she saw mr murray standing a few feet from her god has pardoned all my sins and accepted me as a laborer worthy to enter his vineyard is edna earl more righteous than the lord she ******** his face was almost as pale as hers and his voice trembled as he extended his arms toward her she stood motionless looking up at him with eyes that brightened until their joyful radiance seemed indeed unearthly and the faint delicate blush on her cheeks deepened and burned as with a quivering cry of gladness that told volumes she hid her face in her hands he came nearer and the sound of his low mellow voice thrilled her heart as no other music had ever done edna have you a right to refuse me forgiveness when the blood of christ has purified me from the guilt of other years she trembled and said brokenly mr ********* never wronged meand i have nothing to forgive do you still believe me an unprincipled hypocrite oh no no no do you believe that my repentance has been sincere and acceptable to my insulted god do you believe that i am now as faithfully endeavoring to serve him as a remorseful man possibly can i hope so mr murray edna can you trust me now some seconds elapsed before she answered and then the words were scarcely audible i trust you thank god there was a brief pause and she heard a ************ sigh escape him edna it is useless to tell you how devotedly i love you for you have known that for years and yet you have shown my love no mercy but perhaps if you could realize how much i need your help in my holy work how much more good i could accomplish in the world if you were with me you might listen without ******** yourself against me as you have so long done can you will you trust me fully can you be a ministers wife and aid him as only you can oh my darling my darling i never expect to be worthy of you but you can make me less unworthy my own darling come to me he stood within two feet of her but he ****** humble nay nay too proud to touch her without permission her hands fell from her crimson cheeks and she looked up at the countenance of her king in her fond eyes he seemed noble and sanctified and worthy of all confidence and as he opened his arms once more she glided into them and laid her head on his shoulder whispering oh i trust you i trust you fully standing in the close tender clasp of his strong arms she listened to a narration of his grief and loneliness his hopes and fears his desolation and struggles and prayers during their long separation then for the first time she learned that he had come more than once to new york solely to see her having exacted a promise from mr manning that he would not betray his presence in the city he had followed her at a distance as she wandered with the children through the park and once in the ramble stood so close to her that he put out his hand and touched her dress mr manning had acquainted him with all that had ever passed between them on the subject of his unsuccessful suit and during her sojourn in europe had kept him regularly advised of the state of her health at last when mr murray bent his head to press his lips again to hers he exclaimed in the old pleading tone that had haunted her memory for years edna with all your meekness you are wilfully proud you tell me you trust me and you ****** your dear head here on my *********** wont you say what you know so well i am longing ********* to hear why wont you say st elmo i love you the glowing face was only pressed closer my little darling oh mr murray could i be here well my stately miss earl i am waiting most respectfully to allow you an opportunity of expressing yourself no answer he laughed as she had heard him once before when he took her in his arms and dared her to look into his eyes when i heard your books extolled when i heard your praises from men women and children when i could scarcely pick up a paper without finding some mention of your name when i came here tonight and paced the pavement waiting for your admirers to leave the house whenever and wherever i have heard your dear name uttered i have been exultingly proud for i knew that the heart of the peoples pet was mine i gloried in the consciousness which alone strengthened and comforted me that despite all that the public could offer you despite the adulation of other men and despite my utter unworthiness my own darling was true to me that you never loved any one but s elmo murray and as god reigns above us his happy world holds no man so grateful so happy so proud as i am no man so resolved to prove himself worthy of his treasure edna looking back across the dark years that have gone so heavily over my head and comparing you my pure precious darling with that woman whom in my boyhood i selected for my ************* i know not whether i am most humble or grateful or proud ah i who am i that god hath saved me from the doom i did desire and crossed the lot myself had craved to set me higher what have i done that he should bow from heaven to choose a wife for me and what deserved he should ***** my home with thee as mr hammond was not able to take the fatiguing journey north and edna would not permit any one else to perform her marriage ceremony she sent mr murray home without her promising to come to the parsonage as early as possible mr and mrs andrews were deeply pained by the intelligence of her approaching departure and finally consented to accompany her on her journey the last day of the orphans sojourn in new york was spent at the quiet spot where felix slept his last sleep and it caused her keen grief to bid goodbye to his restingplace which was almost as dear to her as the grave of her grandfather their affection had been so warm so sacred that she clung fondly to his memory and it was not until she reached the old village depot where carriages were waiting for the party that the shadow of that day entirely left her countenance in accordance with her own request edna did not see mr murray again until the hour appointed for their marriage it was a bright beautiful afternoon warm with sunshine when she permitted mrs murray to lead her into the study where the party had assembled mr and mrs andrews hattie huldah and the whitehaired pastor were all there and when edna entered mr murray advanced to meet her and received her hand from his mother the orphans eyes were bent to the floor and never once lifted even when the trembling voice of her beloved pastor pronounced her st elmo murrays wife the intense pallor of her face frightened mrs andrews who watched her with suspended breath and once moved eagerly toward her mr murray felt her lean more heavily against him during the ceremony and now turning to take her in his arms he saw that her eyelashes had fallen on her ********* had lost all consciousness of what was passing two hours elapsed before she recovered fully from the attack and when the blood showed itself again in lips that were kissed so repeatedly mr murray lifted her from the sofa in the study and passing his arm around her said today i snap the fetters of your literary bondage there shall be no more books written no more study no more toil no more anxiety no more ********** and that dear public you love so well must even help itself and whistle for a new pet you belong solely to me now and i shall take care of the life you have nearly destroyed in your inordinate ambition come the fresh air will revive you they stood a moment under the honeysuckle arch over the parsonage gate where the carriage was waiting to take them to le bocage and mr murray asked are you strong enough to go to the church yes sir the pain has all passed away i am perfectly well again they crossed the street and he took her in his arms and carried her up the steps and into the grand solemn church where the soft holy violet light from the ************ glass streamed over gilded ********** and sculptured columns neither edna nor st elmo spoke as they walked down the aisle and in perfect silence both knelt before the shining altar and only god heard their prayers of gratitude after some moments mr murray put out his hand took ednas and holding it in his on the balustrade he prayed aloud asking gods blessing on their marriage and fervently dedicating all their future to his work the ****** flush of the dying day was reflected on the window high above the altar and burning through the red mantle of the christ fell down upon the marble shrine like sacred sacrificial fire edna felt as if her heart could not hold all its measureless joy it seemed a delightful dream to see mr murray kneeling at her side to hear his voice earnestly ************ their lives to the service of jesus christ she knew from the tremor in his tone and the tears in his eyes that his dedication was complete and now to be his companion through all the remaining years of their earthly pilgrimage to be allowed to help him and love him to walk heavenward with her hand in his ******** was the crowning glory and richest blessing of her life when his prayer ended she laid her head down on the ************ and sobbed like a child in the orange glow of a wintry sunset they came out and sat down on the steps while a pair of spotless white pigeons perched on the bloodstain and mr murray put his arm around edna and drew her face to his bosom darling do you remember that once in the dark days of my reckless ********** i asked you one night in the library at le bocage if you had no faith in me and you repeated so vehemently none mr murray oh sir do not think of it why recur to what is so painful and so long past forgive those words and forget them never was more implicit faith more devoted affection given to any human being than i give now to you mr murray you who are my first and my last and my only love she felt his arm tighten around her waist as he bowed his face to hers forgive ah my darling do you recollect also that i told you then that the time would come when your dear lips would ask pardon for what they uttered that night and that when that hour arrived i would take my revenge my wife my pure noble beautiful wife give me my revenge for i cry with the ************ roman oh a ******** as my exile sweet as my revenge he put his hand under her chin drew the lips to his and kissed them repeatedly down among the graves in the brown grass and withered leaves behind a tall shaft around which coiled a carved marble serpent with hooded ********* amid the dead crouched a womans figure with a stony face and blue ********* eyes that glared with murderous hate at the sweet countenance of the happy bride when st elmo tenderly kissed the pure lips of his wife agnes powell smothered a savage cry and nemesis was satisfied as the wretched woman fell forward on the grass sweeping her yellow hair over her eyes to shut out the vision that maddened her then and there for the first time as she sat ******** by her husbands arm edna felt that she could thank him for the monument erected over her grandfathers grave the light faded slowly in the west the pigeons ceased their fluttering about the belfry and as he turned to quit the church so dear to both mr murray stretched his hand toward the ******* vault and said solemnly i throw all mournful years behind me and by the grace of god our new lives commencing this hallowed day shall make noble amends for the wasted past loving each other aiding each other serving christ through whose atonement alone i have been saved from eternal ruin to thy merciful guidance o father we commit our future edna looked reverently up at his beaming countenance whence the shadows of hate and scorn had long since passed and as his splendid eyes came back to hers reading in her beautiful pure face all her love and confidence and happy hope he drew her closer to his bosom and laid his dark cheek on hers saying fondly and proudly my wife my life oh we will walk this world ***** in all exercise of noble end and so through those dark gates across the wild that no man knows my hopes and thine are one accomplish thou my manhood and ******* lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me
