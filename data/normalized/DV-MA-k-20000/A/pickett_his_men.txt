to my husband the noble leader of that band of heroes whose deeds are sparkling jewels set in the history of the great army of northern virginia i would gladly inscribe this book to him alone to whom my life has been dedicated but remembering how often in the humility of his great soul he has said i did not do it my men did it all i feel that he would be better pleased to know that the brave men whom he led through those four long dark years have held a high place in my thought as i have written hence to the men of picketts division who yet clasp hands with me in the friendship that was cemented in blood to grow stronger through all the passing years and to the memory of those who have gone from our sight to be ever present in our hearts and on the most glorious page of our countrys history this volume is lovingly dedicated why do i write this book to add my tribute to the memory of my hero husband and the noble men who followed him through the trials dangers and hardships of a four years war the impulse which moves me is love and i have endeavored that nothing should be written unworthy of that motive if anything expressed or implied shall give pain to any whether he wore the gray or the blue it is contrary to the purpose or the wishes of the author contrary to the chivalrous soul of the soldier and patriot george e pickett whose courage and constancy this work is intended to commemorate in the *********** of this record the reader must know that i could not bring personal witness to the events described they are based upon the official and other reports of ************ and participants in treating of the maneuvers and engagements herein mentioned i have excluded every *********** statement which the facts of history and justice to all participants would possibly permit i have purposely avoided reading histories of the conflict by authors on both sides and based my own narrative upon original material to avoid the possibility of traveling over ground already covered by others upon the battlefield i visited last year grew a wonderful wealth of white daisies piled drift upon drift like the banks of snow that glitter in the light of the winter sun so blossom the flowers of peace and love and hope in the hearts which yet fondly cherish the memory of the long gone days of darkness and of blood though the dream nation about which clustered so many beautiful visions will never take its place among the courts and powers of the world though the ideal which led the south through efforts of heroism not surpassed in all the records of the world will never be crystallized into that reality known to mortal eyes yet in that higher realm of thought where the ideal is the true real it dwells in transcendent glory which ********** into a golden veil of light the ********* by which it was enshrouded that dream nation did not crumble into ruins and fade away into naught the setting sun reflected from its gleaming minarets makes more radiant the light by which our united country marches on its way to national glory the bells in its towers ring out a ***** to swell the grand symphony which circles the world the gallant sons of heroic fathers who fell on battlefields of north and south now stand together to defend our common country side by side north and south are marching against the foe step by step they keep time to the mingled notes of the starspangled banner and dixie blending into the noblest ********** that ever thrilled the heart of soldier to deeds immortal three phases of loyalty sway the southern heart today loyalty to memory loyalty to present duty loyalty to hope there is no rivalry among these phases of the same noble sentiment together they work for the evolution of a *********** nation he who is untrue to the past is recreant to the present and faithless to the future when some one applied to president lincoln for a pass to go into richmond he gravely replied i dont know about that i have given passes to about two hundred and fifty thousand men to go there during the last two years and not one of them has got there yet some of those passes had been used and their bearers had arrived at last having made the slowest time on record since the first camel bore the pioneer traveler over an oriental desert the queen city of the south had fallen the story of the great nation which had hovered upon the horizon of our visions had been written out to its last sorrowful word on the morning of sunday april 2 in the holy calm of st pauls church we had assembled to ask the great father of heaven and earth to guard our loved ones and give victory to the cause so dear to us suddenly the glorious sunlight was dimmed by the heavy cloud of disappointment and the peace of god was broken by the ********** bells tolling the deathknell of our hopes there was mad haste to flee from the doomed city president davis and his cabinet officers were in the church and to them the news first came they hurried to the ********** to secure the confederate archives and retreat with them to some place of safety fear and dread fell over us all we were cut off from our friends and communication with them was impossible our soldiers might have fallen into the hands of the enemy we knew not they might have poured out their lifeblood on the battlefield we knew not in our helpless deserted condition all the world seemed to have been struck with sudden darkness the records having been secured an order was issued to general ewell to destroy the public buildings the one thing which could intensify the horrors of our position fire was added to our misfortunes general j c breckenridge our secretary of war with a wider humanity and a deeper sense of the rights of his people tried in vain to have this order countermanded knowing that its execution could in no way injure or impede the victorious army while it would result in the ruin of many of our own people the order was carried out with even a greater scope than was intended the shockoe warehouse was the first fired it being regarded as a public building because it contained certain stores belonging to france and england a breeze springing up suddenly from the south fanned the slowly flickering flames into a blaze and they mounted upward until they enwrapped the whole great building on the wings of the south wind they were carried to the next building and the next until when the noon hour struck ### the city between seventh and fifteenth streets and main street and the river was a heap of ashes still the flames raged on they leaped from house to house in mad revel they stretched out great burning arms on all sides and embraced in deadly clasp the stately mansions which had stood in lofty grandeur from the olden days of colonial pride soon they became towering masses of fire fluttering immense banners of flame wildly against the wind and fell sending up myriads of fiery points into the air sparkling like blazing stars against the dark curtain that shut out the sky a stormy sea of smoke wave upon wave surged over the town here a billow of blackness that seemed of suffocating ******* there a brilliant cloud shot through and through with arrows of crimson fire the cruel ********* on and the magnificent ocean of smoke and flame rolled before it in surges of destruction over the once fair and beautiful city of richmond the terrified cries of women and children arose in agony above the roaring of the flames the crashing of falling buildings and the trampling of countless feet piles of furniture and wares lay in the streets as if the city had struck one great ********* when everything was taken into the highways and left there to be trampled to pieces or buried in the mud the government stores were thrown out to be destroyed and a mob gathered around to catch the liquors as they ran in fiery rivers down the streets very soon was drunkenness added to the confusion and uproar which reigned over all the officers of the law terror stricken before the reckless crowd fled for their lives the firemen dared not make any effort to subdue the flames fearing an attack from the soldiers who had executed the order to burn the buildings through the night the fire raged the sea of darkness rolled over the town and crowds of men women and children went about the streets laden with what plunder they could rescue from the flames the drunken rabble shattered the plateglass windows of the stores and wrecked everything upon which they could seize the populace had become a frenzied mob and the kingdom of satan seemed to have been transferred to the streets of richmond about nine oclock monday morning a series of terrific explosions startled even ears which would seem to have endured every possible variety of painful sounds every window in our home was shattered and the old plateglass mirrors built into the walls were broken it seemed as if we were called upon to undergo a bombardment in addition to all our other misfortunes but it was soon ascertained that the explosions were from the government arsenal and laboratory which had now been caught by the flames fort darling and the rams were blown up every bank was destroyed the ********** had caught fire the war department was in ruins the offices of the ******** and dispatch had been reduced to ashes the county courthouse the american hotel and most of the finest stores of the city were ruined the presbyterian church had escaped the flames seemed instinctively to have avoided libby prison as if not even fire could add to the horrors of that gloomy place while the flames were raging in full force the colored troops of general weitzel who had been stationed on the north side of the james a few miles from richmond entered the city as i saw their black faces shining through the gloom of the ************** town i could not help thinking that they added the one feature needed if any there were to complete the demoniacal character of the scene they were the first colored troops i had ever seen and the weird effect produced by their black faces in that infernal environment was indelibly impressed upon my mind general weitzel sent major a h stevens of the fourth massachusetts cavalry and major e e graves of his staff at the head of a hundred mounted men to reconnoiter the richmond roads and works at the fortifications beyond the junction of the osborne turnpike and new market road they were met by a flag of truce waved from a dilapidated oldfashioned carriage drawn by a pair of ************ horses the truce party consisted of the mayor of richmond colonel mayo judge meredith of the supreme court judge lyons a representative man of virginia and at one time minister to england and a fourth whom i do not now recall the carriage was probably in the early part of the century what might have been called if the modern classic style of phraseology had prevailed at that time a tony rig at the period of which i write it had made so many journeys over the famous virginia roads that it had become a sepulchral wreck of its former self there may have been a time when the reminiscences of animals that dragged out from the burning capital the ruins of the stately chariot were a span of gay and gallant steeds arching their necks in graceful pride champing their bits in scorn of the idea that harness made by man could ******* their lofty spirits pawing the earth in disdain of its commonplace ********** if so the lapse of years and an extended term of confederate fare had reduced those noble ******** to shambling memories this dignified body thus borne in impressive manner along the highway had in custody a piece of parchment shall i say yes if i wish to preserve the historic ********* after the manner of my good friend judge lyons should i yield to the mandates of historic truth i should be compelled to state that it was a fragment of wallpaper what of it the chariot of state might be the wreck of former grandeur the horses might be the dimmest of recollections the official parchment might be but a torn bit of wallpaper turned wrong side out for convenience in writing was not judge lyons still judge lyons a member of old dominion aristocracy a former minister to the court of st james with all the cold and stately formality with which he might once have presented to the queen of england a representative of *** wealth and culture of his nation he had the honor to introduce his companions to major stevens and if there was any lack of dignity in the manner in which the aforesaid slip of wallpaper was conveyed to that probably astonished officer it was from no failure of duty on the part of him upon whom yet rested some shadow of the royal glory which pervaded the court of st james upon the ********* side of the wallpaper were inscribed these words it is proper to formally surrender to the federal authorities the city of richmond hitherto capital of the confederate states of america and the defenses protecting it up to this time major stevens courteously accepted the surrender on behalf of his commanding general to whom the document was transmitted and proceeded to reduce the newly acquired property to possession by valiantly fighting the flames which were ******** disputing ownership with him having utilized to good effect what little remnant of the fire department he could find he ordered the stars and stripes to be raised over the capitol two soldiers of the fourth massachusetts cavalry one from company e and one from company h mounted to the summit of the capitol and in a few moments for the first time in more than four years the national flag fluttered unmolested in the breezes of the south the stars of the union were saluted while our warriors banner took its flight to meet the warriors soul that flag which almost a century before had risen from the clouds of war like a star gleaming out through the darkness of a stormy night with its design accredited to both washington and john adams was raised over virginia by massachusetts in place of the one whose kinship and likeness to the old banner had never been entirely destroyed in march 1861 the confederate congress adopted the stars and bars three horizontal bars of equal width the middle one white the others red with a blue union of nine stars in a circle this was so like the national flag as to cause confusion in 1863 this flag was replaced by a banner with a white field having the battleflag a red field charged with a blue saltier on which were thirteen stars for a union it was feared that this might be mistaken for a flag of truce and was changed by covering the outer half of the field with a vertical red bar this was finally adopted as the flag of the confederate states of america richmond will testify that the soldiers of massachusetts were worthy of the honor of first raising the united states flag over the capitol of the confederacy and will also bear witness to the unvarying courtesy of major stevens and the fidelity with which he kept his trust it has seemed appropriate that i should begin my story with the burning city for fire has followed me all my life my story i say semmes has said to write history we must be a part of that history my story has been so closely allied with that of pickett and his division that it does not seem quite an intrusive ************* for me to appear in the record of that warrior band how could i tell the story and the way in which that story was written and not be apart of it kindled by the vandal hand of general butler in retaliation for the telegram which general grant sent to president lincoln pickett has bottled up butler at bermuda hundred fire destroyed our beautiful colonial home on the james the good old hero of appomattox was my husbands very dear friend and he would have been more economical with his telegrams had he known that his friend must pay so heavy a toll upon them the united states government was also charged enormously heavy rates upon that message for the ancestral home stood very far away from the line of war and butler coming from city point at an expense of many millions made a draft on the war fund out of all proportion to any beneficent result accomplished by the gratification of his personal spite in the burning of richmond all my bridal presents and my household furniture were consumed when the general was made president of southern agencies for the washington life insurance company we shut up our little cottage home on turkey island and took apartments at the spotswood hotel in richmond the following christmas we went to spend the sacred season with our dear grandmother her last christmastide on earth on our return the next night the general ordered the driver to take us to the spotswood the occupants of that part of the building where our rooms were located were burned to death though fire had again robbed us of our effects through a merciful providence our lives had been spared to my home in washington late one night came a poor man who asked for help he said that he was one of picketts men that he had come to the end of his rope and had nothing to eat and nowhere to sleep i went back to my sons room to get some money and thought i smelled something burning opening the door leading down into the basement just beneath my sons room a puff of smoke struck me in the face hurrying back to the porch where i had left the man standing i sent him to the nearest drugstore to give the alarm the engines came in time and for once by what seemed a mere accident i escaped the fate which has followed me with such unwavering persistence a flame of gas lit by a careless servant destroyed the oil portrait of the general given me by picketts men it hung upon my wall guarded on one side by the beautiful confederate flag presented to me by the philadelphia brigade and on the other by a handsome united states flag a treasured gift from my loved southland the two banners for which so much blood and treasure had been sacrificed were fastened together by a scarf of confederate gray and union blue the design of a deaf and dumb boy a son of one of picketts men and met above the pictured head of the soldier who had fought so bravely under them both when the flames were extinguished the portrait was a charred ruin and flags and scarf were a heap of ashes on the floor fire destroyed the first manuscript of the story of pickett and his men in the preparation of which thirteen years of labor had been spent let me hope that the only fire which will attach to my present effort to record the history of those gallant soldiers is the ************ out flames which surged over the unfortunate capital of the confederacy the fire revealed many things which i would like never to have seen and having seen would fain forget one of the most revolting sights was the amount of provisions and shoes and clothing which had been accumulated by the speculators who hovered like vultures over the scene of death and desolation taking advantage of their possession of money and their lack of both patriotism and humanity they had by an early corner in the market and by successful blockaderunning bought up all the available supplies with an eye to future gain while our soldiers and women and children were absolutely in rags and barefoot and starving not even war with its horrors and helplessness can divert such ******* from their accustomed methods of accumulating wealth at the expense of those of their fellow men who have spent their lives in less selfseeking ways all my own little store was a small quantity of flour and meal and a bag of beans no salt even to season them and i an officers wife how much worse it must have been for those less favored than i the general had left me in richmond when he went away to fight the battle of five forks telling me to stay until he returned or sent for me i shall surely ***** he said so like ********** i waited and not even the flames that lit the battles wreck should frighten me away though my husbands friend general breckenridge our secretary of war had in his thoughtfulness offered me the opportunity of leaving our dear old confederate capital with him and his family i remembered that general pickett had left me here and obediently determined to remain until he should come or send for me i gratefully thanked general breckenridge for his kindness but said i am like the boy who stood on the burning deck i can not go until the one voice calls me so my husbands good friend was regretfully forced to leave me the days were made up of fears and anguish unspeakable the clock struck only midnight hours for me rumors of the death of the general were credited i saw by the look in everybodys face though no word was said and i would not ask a question nor let anybody speak to me of him the last letter i had received from him had been dated the 30th of march at hatchers run the extreme right of the confederate line at that time most of the letter was written in chinook this is a quotation from it heavy rains roads and streams almost impassable while general lee was holding a conference with his chiefs this morning a message came from general fitz lee stating that through a prisoner he had learned that the federal cavalry fifteen thousand strong supported by heavy infantry were at or near ********* courthouse this decided the generals plans and he has placed general fitz lee in command of the whole cavalry rossers w h f lees and his own with orders to march upon five forks i am to support with my small force of artillery and infantry this movement and take command of the whole force the letter was in full faith of a short separation and that all would be well that he would surely return and implored me not to listen to or credit any rumors to the contrary and urged me in an added line to be brave and of good cheer to keep up a skookum tumtum this letter was brought to me by jaccheri a daring fearless italian in my husbands employ as a headquarters postmaster he was sagacious and loyal perfectly devoted to my husband and his cause and was trusted with letters of the strictest confidence and importance all through the war as i said before our people were on the verge of starvation the army had been living on rations of corn and beans with ********** of meat for weeks before we left camp a rat even had been considered a ****** bouche for months past the game had been ******* and killed throughout the whole country and my breakfast that morning had consisted of a few beans cooked in water no salt for salt had been a luxury for a long time in the confederacy all the old smokehouses had been moved that the earth might be dug up and boiled down to get the salt which in the many years it had absorbed john ********** my dear little brother nine years old was a great comfort to me in these days of trial he had just brought up my beans and was lovingly coaxing me to eat them when jaccheri came a plate was filled for jaccheri and after he had finished his meager breakfast seasoned with his adventures in getting to me swimming the river at one place with his clothes tied up in a bundle on his head etc he said he must go i added a few lines to my diary of all my acts which i always kept for the general and gave it to our faithful ************* to take back to him in a da days to come said jaccheri in his soft italian voice ina all ***** no matter mucha people mucha ***** ***** money no matter you find jaccheri here and here first putting his hand over his heart and then drawing from his boot and gracefully brandishing a shining blade ******* at the door he turned back and untying his cravat wiggled out five pieces of money three gold dollars and two ninepences he walked over on tiptoe to where our baby was sleeping crossed himself and kneeling by the cradle slipped into babys little closed hand two of the gold dollars and around his neck a much worn and soiled scapula dear faithful old jaccheri he would take no refusal so i let baby keep the money and used it to buy milk for him for i had not a penny in the world i was reading aloud lovingly and reverently the torn words on the ragged ********** scapula which jaccheri had given to baby cease the heart of jesus is with me when baby opened his sweet eyes and crowed over the little fortune which had come to him in his dreams and just then my little brother who had gone downstairs with jaccheri came rushing back his eyes wide open all excitement exclaiming sister sister theres a yankee downstairs come to see you but dont you go hide hide sister ill ******* the door and he ******** pass by me quick sister hide he said he was one of brother georges friends but dont you believe him sister he has killed brother george and now he wants to kill you oh no no my child i said reassuringly trying to soothe and calm him no no dont be such a little coward dear if he is one of your brother georges friends he is mine too and he would do me no hurt i am not in the least afraid and i will go down right away and see him you are not afraid of anything sister and you will get killed yet as sure as you are born and brother george told me to take care of you what will he say when he comes back and finds you dead and gone and nobody to bury you course ill nurse the poor baby for you if you will go but sister please marm dont go i shall be scared to death till you come back thats a sweet boy take care of the baby i said and kissing them both closed the door behind me as i entered the parlor a tall thin gentleman with the sweetest of smiles and the kindest of voices dressed in the uniform of a united states surgeon arose and said as he bowed holding his hat against his breast thus avoiding offering me his hand my name is george suckley madam i am one of george picketts friends although as soldiers we have been enemies in the field for more than three years that however does not interfere with us when we are not on duty i have heard that you southern women were very bitter and i did not know how you his wife you are picketts wife are you not madam would take a visit from me but i came nevertheless knowing pickett as well as i do i know he would appreciate my motive in coming your name is a very familiar one dr suckley i said i have often heard the general speak of you and remember many stories of your adventures your love for bugs and ******* for all natural history in fact i wished him to know that i remembered him and had not mistaken him for another and also that i had reason to wonder at seeing him in his present position he often spoke of your having been with him at fort bellingham bay and knowing how you felt when he left the old army he has often wondered at your remaining and going to the front i am a surgeon in grants army said dr suckley proudly ignoring and by his manner almost resenting my reference to his former sympathy with the south i love pickett and came as he would have come had our positions been reversed to see his wife and offer her my services i thanked this kindhearted gentleman and distinguished officer but was too bitter to accept the smallest courtesy at his hands even in my husbands name and though offered for loves sake so bitter that suffering was preferable to such obligation he bowed and was going when i said doctor is there any news of the army ours i mean the war is over madam you have my address if you should change your mind and will show me how i can serve you he bowed and left he too had heard that the general had been killed and believed it and i hated him worse because of his belief on the evening of the 3d of april i was walking the floor baby was asleep and my little brother was walking behind me when i heard grand victory at five forks pickett killed and his whole division captured it seemed very strange to me that in the streets of richmond my dear old home the capital of the confederacy the death of pickett and the capture of his whole division should be heralded as a grand victory how great a change had come in so short a time even the newsboys had gone over to the enemy tisnt so sister tisnt so dont you believe him said my little brother hush sir hush he excitedly called out of the window to the ******* hush this minute hallooing your big stories out loud and scaring everybody to death id like to stick those five forks through your old black ******* for you havent got any heart i know aint you ashamed of yourself you good ********** old ******** you there aint a word of truth in brother george being killed and you know it you old thing ill go down and **** his mouth for him and kick him to death for scaring you so my poor sister poor sister yes id just like to kill that boy sister deed i would but it isnt so my sister you trust in the lord i know brother george is not killed for he said he wouldnt get killed no it is not so you are right my darling your brother george is not killed i said yes he will ******** he will come back he said he would and he will i thanked god then and i thank god now for the sweet comfort of that precious little brother john t corbell my little confidant and friend and for his loyalty and love in all the succeeding years oh the sleepless nights that followed each other after that in monotonous ************** **** one morning i had mechanically dressed baby george and had taken him to the window to hear the spring sounds and breathe the spring balm and catch the ********* dripping gold wreathing the top of the quivering blossoms of the magnolia and ********** it was the time when the orchestra of the year is in perfect accord when all the world is vocal when the birds sing of love the buds and blossoms of joy the grains and grasses of hope and faith and when each rustle of wind makes a chime of vital resonance through the quiver and curl of leaves and perfume of flowers and soft undertone of ********* came the words whoa lucy whoa little girl oh those tones those words that voice thrilled my heart so that i wonder it did not burst from very gladness such joy such gratitude as flooded my soul only the giver of all good can know all the privation and starvation and *********** of the past four years and the woes and trials griefs and fears of those last dreadful days were swept away by those blessed precious words whoa lucy spoken in my husbands tender tones how i got down the stairs i do not know i do not remember with baby in my arms we were both of us in my husbands almost before lucy had been given into the hands of the ******* i do not know how to describe the peace the bliss of that moment it is too deep and too sacred to be translated into words i think that it is akin to the feeling that will come to me in the hereafter when i have gone through all these dark days of privation and of starvation of heart and soul here victorious and at last am safe within the golden gates and waiting and listening shall hear again the voice that said whoa lucy here bidding me welcome there all through the war lucy had brought the general to me spirited and beautiful she had many times carried him twenty miles in an evening to see me often through dangers greater than battle lucy was not the generals warhorse she was the little thoroughbred chestnut mare he always rode when he came to see me his *********** his ******** he called her and bob the generals valet referring to her would say the horse the general used in battle he called old black a steady ********** strong fearless animal that while obedient to the generals slightest touch or command allowed no one else on peril of death to mount her my fathers home was in chuckatuck nansemond county virginia about thirty miles from norfolk diagonally opposite newport news after the evacuation of norfolk by the confederate forces all that part of the country was neutral ground being occupied one day by federal troops and another by the confederates lying thus between the two lines a constant warfare was carried on by the scouts of both armies i had not been to my fathers home since i was married and was not prepared for the changes war had made our own home on the james had been burned to ashes at the command of butler and for awhile we had nowhere to go but to my fathers we had nothing we both knew however that a loving welcome awaited us therein my fathers home we knew that he had an abundance to eat natures great larder the chuckatuck ran but a stones throw from the back door supplying with but little labor terrapin fish oysters and crabs in abundance and bait was plentiful it was there then to my childhoods home that the general decided we should go but how there was no way of getting there no steamers running and the railroad was ******** for miles around then again there was no money my husband had not a penny in the world and our friends were no better off on the afternoon of the second day after the generals return while we were planning about going my little brother johnny came running in saying sister i saw riding by the door just now that same yankee who came here to see you the other day and who said he was brother georges friend he knew me and asked how you were and **** the baby oh i forgot i must tell you all about it i said and i then told the general of the visitor i had had before he came back when i had told him all his gray eyes filled with tears and looking down he said tenderly dear old suckley god bless him thats just like him where is his card find it for me please little one dear old suckley dear old fellow so true he said looking at the card i stooped down and took the generals dear head in both my hands and raising it up looked down searchingly into his earnest loving eyes to see how he could possibly speak so kindly and so affectionately of a yankee so you have that same kind of offduty feeling too i see that this yankee doctor spoke of having i said with surprise and rather disrespectfully for me too i am afraid i must find the dear old fellow the general said graciously overlooking my smallness of spirit and excusing himself and taking leave of baby and me he went out at once in a little while he came back saying it is very fortunate for us little one that i went out when i did suckley goes down the river tomorrow to norfolk in the surgeongenerals steamer and he has kindly invited us to go with him dear old bighearted ********** come let us lose no time let us hurry and get our little traps together and be ready we will not say anything about our plans to any one till tomorrow morning when we can announce our intentions and say our ******* simultaneously not only had this yankee officer in his offduty feeling for the general kindly volunteered to transport us to our home but to carry our trunks and horses in fact all we had which alas was very very little most of our worldly possessions all of our bridal presents linen library pictures silver furniture harp piano china everything except a few clothes had been stored at kent payne *** and had been burned in the awful fire the night of the evacuation of richmond the generals staff had one by one come in during the day from the field and camp and all breakfasted with us for the last time next morning in the old pickett home at the corner of sixth and leigh streets the military family had broken up at appomattox after lees surrender and the dear old headquarters confederate flag the general himself ********* tore into strips and divided among them such a happy family they had been the second social parting was sad too for they had taken me the child wife into their lives twenty months before and they all loved me and called me sister their pride in each other and in their command the perils that together they had endured the varied experiences of good times and bad had bound them together in links stronger than steel spite of the partings the loss of our cause our disappointment and poverty there was to me a sweet restful peaceful feeling of thankfulness in my heart and gratitude to god that the war was over that my husband had been spared and belonged now only to me that we **** going home and together free from intrusion could rest under the shade of our own trees the next morning at ten oclock dr suckley called in his headquarters ambulance to take us to the steamer just at the close of breakfast we had announced our intention of going there was to be a sudden breaking up and severing of old associations the staff were all en route to their respective homes except the adjutant general major charles pickett he and mrs dr *** well only brother and sister of my husband were to remain with their families for a time in the old pickett home we said our sad goodby in the great fruit and flower garden at the rear of the house and passing all alone through the large parlors and wide halls crept quietly out and softly closed the door behind us the only evidence of life in the dear old home as we looked back was dr burwells big dog which having escaped from the back yard howled mournfully within the gates the blinds and ************ had not been opened or raised since the federal forces had occupied the city as we boarded the steamer that morning i realized for the first time that our cause was lost never before in all the days of my dear married life but cheer after cheer had greeted us wherever we had gone salute from soldier or sailor whether on or off duty this morning these honors were replaced by stares of surprise of mingled curiosity and hate dr suckley recognized this feeling at once and with a quizzical smile at my ************ expression of rage put his arm in that of the general and with a haughty glance at the men walked boldly on board i was shown into the surgeongenerals stateroom in which there were many evidences of thoughtful care for my comfort we were soon under way the general and dr suckley called each other by their given names and laughed and talked as cordially as if they had loved the same dear cause and fought for it side by side at the table they drank to each others health and to the friends and memories of olden times a stranger could not have told which of the two soldiers had furled his banner they chatted of texas and the great annexation strife which had changed the political complexion of the nation away back in what seemed to my youthful view a remote antiquity they talked of mexico and the general recalled reminiscences of the battles in which he had fought in that wonderful tropical country they discussed the wild free fresh novel life of the faroff pacific coast the wealth of the ********* of california its luscious and abundant fruits and the friends they had known there they talked of the great northwest that was like a mythologic region to me of the chinook indians and of san juan island and the english officers who had occupied the island conjointly with the general i found myself wondering if it had been a dream and there had been no internecine strife just before reaching city point which is a few hours distance from richmond dr suckley came up to me and said we are going to stop for general ingalls who wishes to come on board to pay his respects to you and george i dont suppose there is any one in the wide world rufus ingalls loves more than he does your husband and i hope madam you will meet him with more cordiality than you did another of your husbands friends at least for the sake of their lifelong friendship you will not hurt him he turned for sympathy to my husband who looked ************* at him and beseechingly at me presently the general drew me to one side and whispered suckley voiced my wishes my little wife and i want you to meet my old friend just as cordially as you can put your little hand in his and forget everything except that he is one of your husbands oldest and dearest friends i promised my husband with all my heart to do what he asked and i really meant to do it i loved to do everything he bade me i liked him to make things hard for me sometimes that i might show him how sincere and loving my obedience was but when general ingalls came ******* was given a salute and received as became his rank with the honors the absence of which i had marked when my own general came i slipped my hand out of my husbands and ran back to my stateroom as fast as i could there i burst out crying and shook our baby waking him and told him how papa had been treated that poor papa had not had any honors paid him at all and that a dreadful old bad yankee general had come on board and taken them all and that when he grew up and was a big man he must fight and fight and fight and never surrender and never forgive the yankees no not even if his poor dethroned papa asked him to do so i told him how his papa had asked me to shake hands with this yankee general because he was his friend and that i was going to do it because papa wanted me to that i tried and could not and that he never must either never never i did not know there was a witness to all my bitterness till i heard a smothered chuckle and looking up saw my husband and his friend general rufus ingalls standing over me with a twinkle in his eye and in a voice full of suppressed laughter general ingalls said as he patted me on the head i dont blame you one bit little woman not a damn bit i should feel just as terrible about it as you do if i were in your place its all different with pickett and me you see we dont mind why do you know child we have slept under the same blanket fought under the same flag eaten out of the same mess pan dodged the same bullets scalped the same indians made love to the same girls aye pickett it wont do by jove to tell her all we have done together no no come shake hands i am dreadful sorry we have had this terrible ****** in the family and all this row and bloodshed but we are all americans damn it anyhow and your fellows have been mighty plucky to hold out as they have come thats a good child shake hands may i kiss her pickett no damn it i shant ask you there there here is a basket of trash i had the orderly rake together i dont know what it all is but i told the man to do the best he could here mr george junior with your bright eyes and your ******* mouth here is a green chip for a pair of red shoes general ingalls put into our babys hands his first greenback and it was the only money we had too every cent baby and i said goodby and he and the general went out on deck while i was peeping into the basket mr george junior tore the note in two i caught the pieces and stuck my ********* through them till i could paste them together one of the officers brought me some glue and i cut a hundreddollar confederate note in two to mend it with poor confederate money these verses were written on the back of a confederate note and for a time were ascribed to john esten cooke and to colonel ***** mumford they were afterwards attributed to colonel ***** babys first greenback was put up to dry and then i turned my attention to the big covered basket the sailor had brought in what an aladdin treat it was raisins the first i had seen in years and years coffee real ******* coffee sugar crushed sugar how nice we had had nothing but ************ sugar and sweet potato coffee for so long rice and prunes jamaica rum and candy french brandy and sherry and port oh me and figs nothing ever had tasted so good as that first fig and well the yankee general who gave them all to me the tones of his voice made more peace than his words eating the figs i repeated them over to baby saying never mind baby about hating this yankee he said papa and he had trailed after the same indians and smoked their venison at the same campfire and had drunk from the same flask he said you looked like your papa and he said you were a beautiful boy so you need not mind about hating just this one he said geography and politics had forced your papa and him to take opposite courses and it took four years to settle for their ************* and ambitions you must never be a politician and you may love this one yankee a tiny bit and may suck a piece of his beautiful candy dr suckley not only took us to norfolk which was the end of his route but he took us up the nansemond river thirty miles and up chuckatuck creek to my fathers wharf no one was expecting us they thought of course it was the yankees come again and had all run off and hidden except my father who came down to catch the ******** and welcome the travelers whoever they might be oh the joyful welcome of my great bighearted father soldiers and sailors one and all came and shook hands with us baby and my little brother johnny had made friends of them all for us baby knew no difference between those who wore the blue and those who wore the gray and some of them had little ones at home we said goodby with many a regret to our kind friend and benefactor dr suckley and to the sailors and officers and this time cheer after cheer went up for my noble hero husband as the little steamer hauled in the lines and puffed away and more names were added to the list of yankees for baby not to hate the general did not like to fight his battles over he said that the memories they revived were too bitter to be cherished the faces of the dead and dying soldiers on the field of battle were never forgotten the sorrow of widows and orphans shadowed all the glory for him in the presence of memory he was silent the deepest sorrow like the deepest joy is dumb we are both too worn and weary now for aught else but to rest and comfort each other he said we will lock out of our lives everything but its joys from adversity defeat and mourning shall spring calmness for the past strength for the present courage for the future now that in obedience to the command of general lee i have finished and sent off the report of the last fight of the old division the closing days of our dear lost cause we will put up the pen for awhile and lay aside our war thoughts we will rest and plan for peace and then after a time we will take up the pen again and write down our memories for our children and perhaps for the children of the old division we will build us a nest over the ashes of our once grand old colonial home on the james and plant a new grove in the place of the sturdy old oaks cut down the general possessed the greatest capacity for happiness and such dauntless courage and selfcontrol that to all appearances he could as cheerfully and buoyantly steer his way over the angry menacing tumultuous surges of life as over the waves that glide in tranquil smoothness and sparkle in the sunlight of a calm clear sky this sweet rest which we had planned for ourselves however was of but short duration we had been at my fathers home only a few days when a private messenger brought letters of warning from some of the generals old army friends two officers high in authority solicitous for his welfare advised that in the existing uncertain incendiary seditious condition of things he should absent himself for a while until calm reflection should take the place of wild impulse and time bring healing on its wings and make peace secure butler who had not yet recovered from the ******** up experience had instigated a movement to ****** the general for treason and was making bitter speeches against him in congress the people everywhere incensed and furious over the assassination of their beloved martyred president cried aloud for vengeance and blood and the revival of the law of moses the nation had gone mad with grief and rage the waves of passion rose ************ and from the awful storm the angels of justice mercy and peace took flight all that was bad in the hearts of men arose to the surface all that was good sank to the depths the first person who could be seized upon was regarded as the proper victim to the national fury the weakest and most defenseless was made the target of popular wrath because rage could thereby most quickly spend itself in vengeance mrs surratt was imprisoned and the ***** country was in a state of frenzy and on the verge of revolution the strictest secrecy was enjoined upon us only my father and mother were taken into our confidence lucy was ******* saddled and brought to the door i walked with my husband he holding the bridle to the upper gate it was ten oclock the moon was shining brightly and all was quiet and still the generals plan for me was that i should go next day to norfolk take the steamer to baltimore and visit his aunt whose husband had been in the old army and who had not left it to join the southern confederacy though his sons had fought on that side one of them having been detailed on duty at my husbands headquarters my aunt will welcome you he said and you will remain with her until a telegram shall come to you saying edwards is better edward was my husbands middle name that telegram would mean that he was safe and that i was to join him starting on the next train i was to telegraph to edwards from albany on my way to him sending the message to the point from which his telegram had been dated if his telegram should say there is still danger of contagion i was not to start but remain with his aunt until another message came cheer up the shadows will scatter soon already bright visions and happy ********* flit through my brain and thrill my heart so keep up a skookum tum tum little one and take care of yourself watch for the telegram edwards is better for it will surely come now keep up your courage and have faith for it will surely come god bless you i smiled up at him as he repeated the familiar old saying keep up a skookum tumtum a brave heart little one he had learned the phrase from an old chinook warrior on the pacific coast and in the darkest days of the illfated struggle when hope died in the heart and the sun seemed to have left the sky forever he would lift my face upward look down upon it with his kind eyes smile gently and say in a cheerful voice keep up a skookum tumtum dear one i listened to the sound of the footsteps of the horse his ********** dear old lucy away in the distance long after he was out of sight then i remembered a trick of my childhood which had been taught me by a ********** *********** and putting my ear to the ground i listened for the steps until the last echo was lost the ********* sighed with me as i walked back repeating keep up a skookum tumtum my pathway lay parallel with the chuckatuck creek a stones throw to the left the tide was high and still coming in the surging of its waves seemed to call out to me skookum tumtum skookum tumtum i could not be all desolate when the most beautiful forces of nature echoing his words called to me keep up a brave heart brave heart my precious old father had waited to have us say goodby alone and was now coming forward to meet me our baby awakened just as we got in i confided to baby the secret of the telegram and told him papa said it would surely come and papa always said what was true the stars were burning brightly in the midnight sky to light the traveler on his way as he went afar off could there be light on the pathway that led him from me had his face been turned southward with his eyes fixed joyfully upon the loved home where he would be welcomed when his journey was over what radiant glory would have flooded the way far up in the zenith i could see our star gleaming brilliantly seeming to reach out fingers of light to touch me in loving caress it was a pure white star that sent down floods of silvery radiance near it was a red star gleaming and beautiful but i did not love it it seemed to glow with the baleful fires of war my great loving tender white star was like a symbol of peace looking down with serenest compassion our star he had said as we stood together only one little evening before how long ago it seemed and gazed upward to find what comfort we might in its soft radiance wherever we may be we will look aloft into the night sky where it shines with steady light and feel that our thoughts and hearts are together i fell asleep saying softly in my heart gods lights to guide him there were no steamers and no railroads from my home to norfolk but my father secured a ***** a little ********** and the following day we baby and i started off my fathers heart was almost broken at parting from me so soon again i was going he knew not where but knowing that what god hath joined together no man should put asunder he could not say one word to keep me a storm came up just after we had gotten out of chuckatuck creek and we were delayed in arriving at norfolk we had hoped to be there some hours before the departure of the baltimore steamer but reached the wharf as the plank was about to be taken in so that my father barely had time to say goodby to me and put me on board alone except for baby george for the first time in all my seventeen years perhaps no timid little waif thrown out upon the deep sea of life ever felt more utterly desolate i stepped on board the baltimore steamer and was piloted into the saloon by a porter whose look and manner showed that he was perfectly cognizant of my ignorance and inexperience in the midst of my loneliness and the consciousness of my awkwardness and my real sorrows sympathy for myself revived my ********* compassion for poor david *********** whom *********** servant had made to feel so young and green so little did i know of traveling and the modes and manners of travelers that i sent for the captain of the steamer to buy my ticket and arrange for my stateroom and supper i wondered a little as i waited for him what he would think of my ************ and if he often had such helpless passengers and if he had what he did with them and if life was not sometimes made a burden to him because of them there was always an undercurrent though of realization of my position and of dread because of it i had one comforting reflection however the captain could not take me for a *********** my innocence was too genuine and embarrassing to be mistaken for assumed ************* i had been told on leaving my home that the slightest imprudence or careless word from me might cause my arrest and that in any event if it were known who i was it was more than possible that i might be held as a hostage for my husband after consideration it had been decided that i should travel not under my own name but under my maiden name the more i studied the subject the more bewildered i became how could i keep my precious secret i determined to be very silent and guard my tongue closely and answer in ************* that would discourage ********** i began to draw my face down and look serious and wise and assume an expression of profound abstraction then it occurred to me that this attitude would never do in the few novels i had read the people who had secrets were always silent and mysterious their demeanor said more plainly than words could have expressed behold the modern sphinx whose riddle can never be read every one would recognize immediately the fact that my mind was the repository of something dangerous then i thought i would cultivate a light and chatty style more in accordance with my natural character so i was soon in my thought in conversation with some imaginary person on home scenes and pleasures assuming an animation that ought to remove from the mind of the most suspicious person the fancy that i could possibly have anything to conceal i found that my mental allusions to what the general said and did were quite too frequent and enthusiastic to be in accordance with my assumed character of an unknown little wife and mother traveling for the innocent purpose of spending a few days with relations expecting her obscure husband to come for her after awhile from a little farm that he was industriously ******* if i could neither talk nor be silent what could i do while i wrestled with these perplexities my train of thought was interrupted by the ringing of a bell and aloud voice shouting passengers will please walk into the customhouse office and show their passports the laws were so strict that no one could leave any city in the south without a passport from the military authorities stationed there my grandmother had given me her oath of allegiance which everybody in those dread days immediately after the surrender of the army was compelled to take in order to purchase medicine food or clothing of any sort or for the transaction of any kind of business whatsoever it was a rare occurrence that a man was found who would take this ironclad oath for no matter how great the exigencies might be he was branded as a traitor if he yielded to them consequently the women who were most bitter too in their feelings were obliged to make a sacrifice of their convictions and principles and take this oath in order to alleviate or prevent the absolute suffering of their loved ones illness in the family and the urgent necessity for quinine and salt left my unselfish little grandmother no alternative and having taken this oath herself she found in it a kind of safety it had at any rate brought her relief and she wanted that i should have it with me as a sort of mascot or safeguard with carpetbag basket and baby i started into the customhouse office and explained to the officer in charge i am very sorry sir that i have no passport the steamer was about to sail as i reached norfolk i came from a little village thirty miles beyond where passports are not given i have an oath of allegiance if that will answer in its place the officer laughing said no never mind it is all right only register your name i remember you did come on board just as the whistle blew but was there not another passenger who came on with you a gentleman yes sir i said it was my precious father and he went back home on the little ******** there must have been something to excite suspicion in the way i wrote my name or else in my manner i boldly wrote out my given name and then as i started to write my last name i looked all around me confused and changed the letter p to c writing corbell then i began to erase corbell and write phillips the name in my oath of allegiance while there was really nothing very false in what i did i felt guilty and was frightened for i had been brought up to be strictly truthful and to keep faithfully even the word of promise i had not been long in the saloon when baby became restless and fretful i was impatiently awaiting the coming of the captain whom i had sent for when a man appeared he had short curly hair deep heavy eyebrows eyes sunken and close together as if they had to be ******* by his big hooked nose or they would not be able to see he was chewing alternately one end of his ******* moustache and one side of his thick red lip and was making a sucking noise with his tongue as he said madam you sent for the captain of the boat i believe yes sir what do you wish i want you to be kind enough to get my ticket and stateroom please my father had not time to see after me he barely had time to put me on board certainly with pleasure you stop in baltimore ***** dont know i said you have been there before i suppose oh no never i have been nowhere outside of virginia and north carolina most of my traveling before my marriage was in going to and from lynchburg where i was at school lynchburg is a hilly city it was founded by an irish ******** john lynch whose brother colonel charles lynch of revolutionary fame instituted the ******** colonel lynch was a great whig and too impatient to wait for the superfluous ceremony of legally administering justice upon the lawless ****** once i rode on horseback to the peaks of otter which are among the highest mountains of the south you cant imagine how glorious it was to be up there so far away from the earth when i first looked down from their lofty heights the sky and the earth seemed to be touching and presently the rain began to pour i could see the glimmering glittering drops but could not hear them fall i was above the clouds and the rain up in the sunshine and stillness the only audible sound a strange supernatural flapping it was the hawks and ******** flapping their wings suddenly the rain ceased the haze vanished and i saw below the rugged mountains and what seemed in the distance a vast ocean it was the level country below the words of john randolph echoed in my heart with this infinite mystery of nature he with only a servant had spent the night on those mighty rocks and in the morning as he was watching the glory of the sunrise having no one else to whom to express his thought he pointed upward with his long slender hand and charged his servant never from that time to believe anyone who said there was no god you have relatives in baltimore said the gentleman abruptly interrupting me otherwise feeling that geography and history were safe subjects i should have rattled on till i had told him all i knew yes sir said i i am going to visit them where were you from this morning i came from a little country village about thirty miles from norfolk chuckatuck a village in ***** **** county it used to be the capital city of a tribe of indians called the ********* i saw your father as he was leaving the steamer i was attracted to him because he made an appeal to all masons asking of them poor man with his hands raised to god their protection and care for his child and grandchild he thus was making himself known to any of us his brothers who might be aboard when he was lost sight of by the turn of the boat so you see you can safely confide in me and i will help you in any way i can thank you i said i know my dear dear papa s a mason i know he was anxious about me but i have nothing to confide nothing i only want a stateroom and my tickets and some milk for the baby i do not wish for any supper myself i am so lonesome i could not eat it is wicked to feel blue and downhearted with baby and all the kind friends to watch over me as you say and then too god is always near yes that is true did you lose your husband in the war no sir he was in the war though was he not yes sir a fear came into my heart that i was talking too much i did not want him to know anything concerning my husband whose rank i especially desired to keep secret i encouraged myself with the reflection that the end justified the means even though i might ******* slightly from the truth and said you could not have heard of him and he was not of sufficient rank to have made an impression upon you even if you had where is he now in the country and you are leaving him for a little while only then he talked of how much the southerners had lost and how much they had to forgive how easy it was to bear victory and how hard to bear defeat and said that if he had been born south he would have been a rebel and that his sympathies even now were with the southern people then a sudden suspicion came to me and i said i wish there had never been any rebels at all no not even the first rebel george washington and now sir please i do not want to talk about the war i am very weary and sleepy and would like to retire if you please sir will you get me my stateroom and ticket i am so tired so very tired baby was lying asleep on my lap hypnotized by the chandeliers the man looked down on him for a moment and then said of course i **** get them for you and was going **** an exconfederate officer one of my husbands old comrades and friends came up and cordially reaching out his hand said how do you do mrs pickett where is the general what are you doing here and where are you going he himself was returning to his home in the far south but had been called back to baltimore on business thank you general b i said my husband has gone to farming he has turned his sword into a plowshare and 1 am going to visit his aunt whom i have never seen he is to come to us after a little while could not leave conveniently just now he is very well i thank you i am so glad to have seen you he said will see you later on and was hobbling away on his crutches he saw by my manner that he had said something to embarrass me something hurtful to me and left with a pained look he was dressed in his old confederate gray the brass buttons had all been cut off in obedience to the order at the customhouse office for several moments not a word was spoken then i looked up and said my tickets and stateroom please i thought you said your name was corbell said he of the hooked nose as he held my money shaking in his hand i thought you said your husbands rank was not sufficient to have made an impression that in all probability i had never heard of him oh that ******** sound of jaw and tongue and that beak of a nose and those little black eyes which grew into siamese twins as they glared at me like a snake he did not move but said while an undefined fear of him made me tremble and grow cold your name was corbell and your husband was in the country he was an officer of low rank he repeated this more to himself than to me did i say that i said and with a face all honesty and truth i looked straight into those eyes divided by that vulture feature and told without blushing without a tremor in my voice the first deliberate falsehood i had ever told did i say so well my mind has been ********** my friends think by the way the war has ended and they are sending me from home to new scenes and new associations to divert me with the hope of making me well and strong again corbell was my maiden name but i do not know how i happened to say that my husbands rank was low for i was so proud of it i could not have been thinking wont you please be so good as to get my ticket i am so tired i dont know what i am saying he went away and the stateroom keys were brought to me by a ******** she unlocked the door for me i went in too frightened now to think of supper too frightened to sleep and wondering if in my imprudence i had hurt my husband and what would happen if i had all night long the noise of the wheel was to me the ax of the *********** all night long it rose and fell through seas not of water but of blood the hearts blood of valiant men of devoted women of innocent little children all night long it went up and down dripping from the awful sea dripping with my husbands blood with my fathers with the blood of all the friends i had known and loved then it seemed as if all the world but me had been slain to make that dread sea and i was doomed to move over it forever with the sound of the crushing wheels grinding my heart to powder and never consuming me why had i of the whole human race been left alone to go always up and down in that horrible waste of blood near morning i fell asleep and dreamed that it was i who had destroyed all that world of people whose lifeblood surged around me with a maddening roar and that i was destined to an eternity of remorse when i awoke the boat had landed i got up and dressed hurriedly starting to go out i found that the door was locked on the outside the chambermaid not answering my repeated call i beckoned to a sailor passing the window and begged that he would tell the chambermaid that i was locked in and ask her to come and let me out she came to the door and said you can not get out i do not understand i said are we not at baltimore an officer was with her who answered yes but you can not get off madam you are to be detained upon the boat until the authorities come and either release or ******** you you are supposed to be a suspicious character on a slip of paper i wrote a master masons wife and daughter in distress demands in their name that you will come to her i said to the chambermaid will you give this to the captain on her hesitating the officer said you might as well she went in a little while a very little while before i thought she could possibly have reached the captain while i was trying to hush the baby who was hungry a voice as kind and gentle as the benevolent face into which i looked said what can i do for you madam you sent for me no sir i said i sent for the captain of the boat but i am glad you came you seem so kind and may help me in some way in my trouble i am the captain of the boat he said what can i do for you you are not the gentleman who represented himself as the captain of the boat last night sir and bought for me my ticket he was short and dark as i was describing the ************* the gentleman interrupted me with he is a federal detective madam and has advised that you be detained on the steamer until his return with the authorities and warrant but i said he told me he had seen my father as he left the steamer make the sign of a master mason in distress placing me in the care not only of himself but of all masons on this steamer and he told me i was safe and protected in their care and he asked my confidence but i had none to give him he suspects me of what the captain said your father did make that sign your father did place you in our care his appeal was to all masons and in their protection he did leave you come i am captain of this steamer and a captain is king on his own boat where did you say you wished to go stand aside he said to the officer in charge giving me his arm he placed me and baby carpetbag and basket in a carriage and the driver was told to drive to 97 brenton street yis *** said the irishman 97 ******* strate shure god bless you and watch over you goodby little baby after driving some time the irishman impatiently told me there was no street by that name and i would have to get out but not until i had paid him for the two hours he had been hunting for the same i will pay you the money said i but there must be such a place come here is the letter and the instructions theres no place of the ***** an the letter is all wrong he said spelling it out an ***** to be done an where am i to be ****** you its to the ***** ive got to be afther going to now oh i dont know i said why did you not tell the captain of the steamer you did not know and have him tell you where to go shure i thought you would be afther ****** **** own ***** an theres no one knows the place ******* an the ****** of me an its there to be ******** i did not know enough to get out and go to a drugstore and hunt in the directory i was at my wits end if i had ever had any wits there was not a soul in the city that i knew i thought of the captain of the boat the only friend i had yet i was afraid to go back to seek him for fear the power he had would not be strong enough to protect me once i had left his boat i could think of no one else nowhere else to go and there was that in the captains voice and manner of daring and strength that made me willing to trust myself with him so i said drive me back to the captain of the boat please i dont know what else to do when i went on board the captain was not yet gone which was an unusual thing he had waited to see the officers before leaving i answered the smile that came into his face in spite of his kind heart by handing him my aunts letter who wrote not only a very peculiar hand but a very ********* one saying read captain and see if this is not brenton street the place my aunt has written me i must come go to 97 brenton street where my niece mrs c will bring you to my house he read it might be anything else as well as brenton he said it looks like brenton but i have lived here all my life and have never heard of such a street ill get my directory however and look no he said but it may be preston lets look but there are no c s living there you might try this house at any rate 97 preston street and if you do not find your friends living there then come to this number where my wife and i will be happy to have you as our guest you and the little lost bird till you can write to your friends and find out where they do want you to come off again i started with the irishman who had become interested in me by this time and had forgotten all about the depot here you are marm 97 ******* strate an a nice house it is marm shall i take **** things in marm no first take up my card if your horses will stand ** ****** marm an they will i wrote on my card does mrs c live here a niece of mrs s in a moment there were two or three faces at the windows and in another moment as many voices at the carriagedoor asking is this george picketts wife and child and i was so thankful to be once more where they knew george picketts wife and child besides the lovely people whose home it was there was with them on her way to her mothers a daughter of mrs s mrs general b who was one of the most charming women i ever met she had just returned from the south her husband too was in the confederate army the next day we both went out to her mothers my husbands aunts home the week i spent in hartford county maryland at the generals aunts reminded me of my childhood when i used to play that i was a princess or a beggar or ******** of the forty thieves or the white cat or whatever character it would please me to select to play for my heart and soul were separated from my body i was not what i pretended to be my body went to parties and receptions and dinners and received people and drove and paid calls while my soul waited with intense longing for the telegram edwards is better one day i had been out to dine and coming home found awaiting me the message for which eyes and heart had been looking for a time that seemed almost eternal that night i took the train for new york starting out all alone again baby and i i was tired and sleepy but there was such joy and gladness in my heart as i thought of so soon seeing my husband that i did not think of my discomforts i repeated the telegram edwards is better edwards is better over and over again i sang it as a lullaby putting baby to sleep to the measure of the happy words edwards is better i crooned it softly with shut lips lest some stranger should hear the precious words edwards is better only for baby and me was that sweet refrain when baby slept i leaned back and closed my eyes and saw a world of beauty and bloom as the glad words went dancing through my heart was there ever so sweet a *********** since babies were first invented to awaken the deepest melody of mother hearts i went to sleep with baby in my arms i had not money enough to get a berth just barely enough to buy my ticket and pay my expenses through to montreal canada from which point the telegram was dated when i awakened later i found that a homespun shawl had been placed under my head i never thought about who had been so kind nor why the ****# was there all my life long every one had been thoughtful of me things had been done for me courtesies had been extended tome and i had learned to accept kindnesses as only what i had a right to expect from the human race murmuring softly the comforting words edwards is better i turned my face over and went to sleep again on the shawl i slept until my baby became restless from the jolting we took the steamer up the hudson from new york to albany something made poor little baby sick i censured myself for having allowed him to catch cold on the train while i was sleeping he was teething and was very fretful he had been used too to his nurse his black mammy he missed her customary care and attention his cradle and rocking and was unhappy and could not understand it she used to give him his bath to sing to him her negro melodies and to dance him up and down in her strong arms only bringing him to me for his daily nourishment and kisses and my own enjoyment of him or when sometimes she wanted to go to her meals before thomas was ready to put him in his little wagon so in his discomfort he would reach out his hands and nod to anybody to take him he was tired of me and thought that i must in some way be the cause of all these privations and the pain and suffering he was then ************* philanthropic ladies on board the steamer seemed very much concerned and at a loss to understand why he was so unhappy with me and apparently preferred anybody and everybody else nurse why do you not take the child to its mother one would say and a look of incredulity would follow my assertion that i was its mother then why dont you quiet the child if you are and find out what is the matter with it and so on how indignant i was something in my manner must have made them believe that it was not all right with me and the child for they followed me about asking many intrusive questions and making many offensive remarks the crying of the baby was as disagreeable to them as it was distressing to me and i was walking the deck trying to quiet him all tired and worn out as i was when a gentleman came up to me on his shoulder i recognized the shawl that had been put under my head on the cars the night before it introduced one of the least of these he said madam excuse me but i do not think you have had any dinner and you must be worn out with hunger and fatigue from fasting and carrying the baby wont you let me hold him while you go down and eat something even though he carried the shawl which bespoke my faith i was afraid to trust him with so precious a treasure as my baby and would rather have starved than have permitted it to go out of my sight thank you very much but i could not think of troubling you i said no oh no then said he may i order something for you here i was hungry and was so glad for the open way he had found for me and said yes handing him twentyfive cents it was all i could afford to pay for dinner but as i looked at the tray when it was brought to me i thought how cheap things must be in new york for there was soup and fish a kind of yellow fish i had never seen before salmon i afterward learned it was ****** with green peas a bird some asparagus and potatoes icecream a cup of coffee and a glass of sherry upon his insisting that perhaps it would be restful to the baby i let him hold it while i ate my dinner i did not know how hungry i was nor how much i was in need of nourishment baby immediately became quiet in his arms whether it was the change or not i do not know but in a little while he was fast asleep i covered him up with the shawl to which the gentleman pointed finished eating my delicious dinner taking my time and enjoying it while he read his book and held my baby when the servant came and took away the tray i arose and thanking the stranger for his kindness said i will take the baby now if you please if you would rather he said yes but i think he will be more comfortable with me for awhile then too you might awaken him if you moved him let me hold him while you rest here is a sweet little book if you would like to read it i think however it would be better for you to rest to sleep if you could you look really fagged out the book he gave me was a childs book it may have been fern leaves i cant remember the name but written on the flyleaf in a childs irregular hand were these words little mary died on the 16th of may 1864 her fifth birthday i rested but thought of little mary as i watched my own baby who was sleeping so sweetly in this childless strangers arms till presently the waves brought back tome the days of my childhood the story of the sailor with his stolen mill grinding out salt forever and forever and the lost talisman lost still back to my grandmothers knee listening with wondereyes to why the sea is salt the while my soul anon chanted to music those all healing blissful words edwards is better gaining strength for the ********** trial i least dreamed of and the shadows rose to make place for one darker still my attention was attracted by a man in close conversation with the conductor i was evidently the object of it for they would look carefully over the paper they held and then at me as if comparing me with something therein described had i been a hardened criminal they would probably not have taken the risk of thus warning me of the fact that i was under suspicion as my appearance would seem to indicate that if a lawbreaker i was a mere tyro in vice they supposed they could safely take notes of me i was absolutely sure that i was the subject of the conversation and trembled with a presentiment of coming evil i tried in vain to turn my face toward the window but my eyes seemed fascinated a thousand preposterous fears passed in review through my mind though the real one never suggested itself i endeavored to dispel them each in turn arguing that the scrutiny of the men foreboded nothing because i seemed an object of curiosity to everybody and now as i recall my appearance i dont wonder for i was very ********** in the first place i was dressed so quaintly and looked so entirely unlike those around me and was all unconscious of any peculiarity or deficiency in my apparel being ********* in my very best the ************* etc in which i had been married and which had been bought and made under such difficulties and kept afterward with such scrupulous care so i was perfectly well satisfied with myself i wore a long ************ black silk ******** with three ruffles at the bottom while those around me were dressed in ************ short cloth jackets my bonnet was of gray straw plaited and dyed by the servants on the plantation at home and sewed into shape by our fashionable village milliner a poke shape extending far over the face a wreath of pink ************ on the inside tangled in with my darkbrown hair while it was trimmed on the outside with several clusters and bunches of grapes of a lighter shade of gray also ******** the grapes were formed of picked cotton covered with fleekskin and then tinted my collar was one of my bridal presents from our pastors wife made of tatting and embroidery about five inches wide and was pinned in front with a lava breastpin the prevailing collar worn by the fashionable world was made of linen very narrow only an edge of it showing while very small jaunty hats worn back on the head were the style the conductor seemed to be arguing with this man as i caught his eye and just then my baby sprang forward and snatched the newspaper from an old gentleman who was sitting reading it in front of me and shrieked when it was loosened from his baby hands while the old gentleman looked ******* in answer to my apologies but thank heaven when i looked again after this diversion the two men were gone i had just settled back a little unnerved and weak however when from behind me came a touch on my shoulder and turning around i saw the officer and the conductor the former said i have a warrant for your arrest madam and forthwith served it upon me there on the cars all alone miles away from home and friends two dollars and ten cents all my little store fleekskin is the thin covering of leaf **** i was arrested for stealing stealing my own child i could not read the warrant as it trembled in my hands i had never seen one before baby thought it was a compromise for the old gentlemans paper and it was with difficulty rescued from him as soon as my confused wits grasped the meaning of this i said this baby this baby sir it is mine mine it is named after its father it is mine i can prove it by everybody in the world and well well said the conductor kindly as his voice trembled thats all he wants lady you will only have to be detained in all probability till the next train but i must go on i said for my husband is looking for me and i could not stand staying away another minute longer than the time at which he expects me please everybody help me some were too refined even to look toward me others merely glanced over their glasses or looked up from their books and went on reading some kept their faces carefully turned toward the landscape and a few just as heartless and more vulgar gazed in openmouthed curiosity one womans good heart thank god redeemed them all she came forward her tender blue eyes moist with sympathy her black ***** veil thrown back from her lovely face and her waving hair with the silver threads among the gold all too soon and said in a voice so sweet that it might have come from the hearts of the lilies of the valley that she wore bunched at her swan white throat come i will stop off with you if it must be let me see the paper simultaneously with her the gentleman of the homespun shawl came from i dont know where and asked too to see the paper and both got off the train with me i was so weak i could hardly hold or carry my baby for all at once there came over me the sense of my utter helplessness to prove that my child was my own there was no one i could telegraph to without exposing who and what i was and where and perhaps why i was going a telegram to my friends at home not only might betray me but would alarm them a telegram to my husband would ********** his safety for he would surely come to me at once look look i said to the magistrate and officers as they read aloud the suspicions and accusations of the philanthropic ladies who were with me on board the albany steamer and who in their zeal to secure a right and correct a wrong without understanding the causes of my childs discomfort and unhappiness with me or the reasons for my rather suspicious manner and embarrassment had caused my arrest thus do the pure and holy ever keep guard over the sins of the world and throw the ********* of justice around the unregenerate to drag them perforce into the path of rectitude may they reap the reward to which their virtues entitle them look at its eyes and look at mine holding his little face up against my own cant you every one see that it is my child my very own child that may be but give us the name of some one to whom we may telegraph some tangible proof if it is all right there must be some one who knows you and who can testify in your behalf no no i said there is no one i have nobody to help me and if god does not show you all some way and your own hearts do not convince you i dont know what i shall do my poor little halfstarved ************ baby refused to be comforted the kind gentleman with the shawl could amuse him no longer he had dashed from him the keys and pushed the watch from his ear and demanded impatiently of me the rights of ********** the dear good woman beside me with the smile of the redeemed lighting up her face touched mine whispering in my ear while i held babys hands to prevent him in his impatience from tearing apart my mantle and untying my bonnetstrings do you nurse your baby yes i said and he is so hungry poor little thing then she stood up leaning on her cane for she was slightly lame and said in a voice clear and sweet gentlemen i have a witness my heart almost stood still here in the child who can not speak it is not always a proof of motherhood but with the circumstantial evidence and the youth of this mother this beyond peradventure is proof convincing the child is still nourished from her own body and she opened my mantle i who had never nursed my baby in the presence of even my most intimate friends bared my bosom before all those strange men and ***** and nursed him as proof that i was his mother while tears of gratitude to the sweet friend and to god flowed down my cheeks and dropped on babys face as he wonderingly looked up trying to pick off the tears with his little dimpled fingers and thankfully enjoyed the proof the men turned aside and tears flowed down more than one rugged face the kind stranger with the shawl lifted his eyes heavenward as if in thanksgiving and then turned them earthward and breathed a bitter curse deep and heartfelt perhaps the recording angel jotted down the curse on the credit side of the ledger with as great alacrity as he registered there the prayer of thanks i trust that the philanthropic ladies when the evidence was sent them were as surely convinced as all these people were that i had not stolen my child i hope they were pleased by this indication of the existence of some degree of innocence in the world outside of their own virtuous hearts but i dont know take thy ********* poor mother dove under thy trembling wings back to its nest and the father ********* i shall go a few miles further where i stop to see my baby said my new friend this little boy who brought me back to life is older than yours he is the child of my only son whose young life ebbed out on the battlefield of gettysburg and whose sweet spirit has joined that of his noble father my husband which in his very first battle was freed this baby blesses our lives the young mothers and the old mothers the train due twenty minutes before was signaled baby finished his proof on the car which was taking me faster and faster to the loving heart and protecting care that even this kind stranger saw how sadly i needed the friend so kind to me on the steamer succeeded in getting us seats though apart the cars were crowded with soldiers returning home after the war disbanded soldiers soldiers on furlough and the released prisoners with their pale cadaverous ******** faces and their long unkempt hair one from andersonville more emaciated and ragged than the others was selling his pictures and describing the horrors of his prison life and as he told of his sufferings and torture amid the groans of sympathy maledictions and curses were hurled against my people and once his long bony arm and hand seemed to be stretched menacingly toward me as he drew the picture of the martyred lincoln whose blood said he cries out for vengeance we follow his hearse let us swear a hatred to these people against whom he warred and as the cannon beats the hours with solemn *********** renew with each sound unappeasable hatred i crouched back into my seat almost holding my breath as i pressed my baby against my beating heart the sweet new friend touched my brow with her lips leaving there a kiss and a prayer put the lilies in my hand and was gone the cars moved on leaving a great void in my heart as i thought of my godgiven friend so lately found so swiftly lost all this was more than thirty years ago but one of the lilies yet lies in my prayerbook glorifying with the halo of a precious memory the page on which it rests a man not a soldier i think for brave soldiers are magnanimous and generous always stood up in a seat almost opposite mine and said when i think of the horrors of libby and andersonville and look at these poor sufferers i not only want to invoke the vengeance of a just god but i want to take a hand in it myself quarter should be shown to none every man woman and child of this accursed southern race should be made the ******** of his own slave for a specified length of time that they might know the curse of serfdom their lands should be confiscated and given to those whom they have so long and so cruelly wronged as he in detail related the story of their scanty allowance the filth and darkness of their cells i longed to ***** and plead for my people and tell how they too were without soap food or clothes that we had no medicines even except what were smuggled through the lines and that our own poor soldiers were barefooted and starving and that all the suffering of prisoners on both sides could have been avoided by carrying out the terms of the cartel proposed by the confederate government if i had only dared to raise the veil and reveal the truth sympathy would have tempered their bitterness the flame of divine kinship smoldering in their veins hidden as in a tomb would have ******* over the gulf of wrongs a bridge of holier feelings yet the memory of the woman whose son had been killed on the field of gettysburg and whose lily now browned and withered with the years i cherish with such tender care softened the words that were like blows to my ear and heart thus the power of one pure heart radiating its love upon the world as an odorous flower diffuses fragrance on the surrounding atmosphere ******* the sorrowful spirit and strengthens it to withstand the rude assaults of a vindictive world the official figures of secretary of war stanton and surgeongeneral barnes show that over three per cent more confederates perished in northern prisons than federals in southern prisons the report of mr stanton july 19 1866 says of the federal prisoners in confederate prisons during the war ##### died of confederate prisoners in federal prisons ##### died surgeon general barnes said that the confederate prisoners numbered ###### the federal prisoners ###### out of ###### federals more than ##### died of ###### confederates more than ##### died general grant in his letter to general butler from city general grant further said in his testimony before the committee on the conduct of the war february 1865 owing to the delay all the ********** in the lake champlain steamer had been taken and my little sick baby and its poor tired mother were very thankful when after the long dreary night they welcomed the dawn of day which counted them many miles nearer to their mecca i have forgotten the name of the place from which we took the train for montreal after leaving the steamer but i remember a fact of more consequence concerning it that it was the wrong place i received my first tariff lesson on reaching the canada side when the passengers were summoned to the customhouse office to have their baggage examined and i with my carpetbag basket and baby followed my fellow ******** when my turn came i handed the officer my keys and checks which after a glance he gave back to me saying with haste and indifference as if it might have been the most trivial of matters your luggage has been left on the states side your checks were not exchanged this was the last straw the camels back had been broken by #** clothes heroically i had borne up under dangers and hardships accusations and imminent tragedies but the loss of my wardrobe that greatest calamity which has ever been known to darken the career of mortal woman was too much and i wept aloud not that i had so large and so valuable an array of personal ********** the few clothes i had were intrinsically worthless except perhaps as so many curios there were gowns remodeled and *********** from court dresses over a hundred years old there were others entirely new as to texture and *********** original as to style woven on our crude looms made ******** and striped with our natural dyes trimmed with an improvised ************* made of ********** and other seeds and laces knit from ******** **** with buttons of carved and ornamented *********** then there was my *********** constructed after approved models somewhere in the unknown regions of the frozen north and ****** smuggled across the lines to me an unregenerate reprobate who ******** but artistically be it known put it on and went an *********** ******** of smuggled goods proudly to the altar positively ******** in villainy in the confederacy a new weddingdress was a rare and precious feature in ********* its introduction into a community was a social event of great importance its possession was a distinction which rendered its fortunate owner especially subject to the gracious law of noblesse oblige my ********** had draped the form of more than one fair maid since it had first eluded the vigilant eyes which guarded the federal line it was last worn by one of the most beautiful girls of the confederacy when she became the wife of a distinguished officer and was put away forever when a few hours later the groom was brought back to his bride wrapped in the white shroud of death the purity of the ********** gave place to the ********** of the widows weeds which for many years were faithfully worn in memory of her fallen hero my genuine grief for the loss of all my clothes touched the heart of the sturdy englishman into *********** the information that i would better return the checks for exchange and i would receive my luggage on the next train the delight consequent upon this information taken in connection with my previous grief may have impressed the british mind with the conviction that the missing trunks contained an entire outfit just from worth felix being at that time yet in the realm of the ********* taking the wrong train at the wrong point put me into montreal later than i was expected but i religiously followed instructions to remain on the train which stopped over at montreal until i should be claimed like a general delivery letter every passenger had left the coach and baby and i were alone i was ******* and watching breathlessly for my claimant when my hungry eyes caught sight of three gentlemen coming straight toward me it was with but a languid interest that i regarded them for i had preconceived convictions as to the appearance of the *** who should assert proprietary rights over me and neither of these newcomers seemed at first glance adapted to respond to those convictions the face of one seemed rather familiar but i was not sure so i drew my little baby closer to me and looked the other way i felt them coming and felt them stop right by my side what will you have of me i asked there were tears in the eyes of the gentleman whose face had seemed a familiar one and the next minute baby and i were in his great strong arms and his tender voice was reproachfully asking dont you know your husband little one i was looking for my general as i had been used to seeing him dressed in the dear old confederate uniform and with his hair long and curling the beautiful hair had been trimmed and while he was not subject to the limitations of samson in the matter of personal strength a critical observer might have detected variations in personal beauty an english civilian suit of rough brown cloth took the place of the old confederate gray the two gentlemen with him were mr corse a banker a brother of one of the generals brigadiers and mr symington of baltimore a refugee i noticed that these gentlemen called the general mr edwards and me mrs edwards which made me feel somewhat strange and unnatural but i reflected that i was in a foreign country and very far north of our old home and perhaps even peoples names were affected by political and climatic conditions knowing our poverty i had expected the general to take us to a quiet little room in some unpretentious boardinghouse but was too tired to voice my surprise when we were driven in a handsome carriage to a palatial home i remember the beautiful grounds the fountain and flowers the big english butler with sidewhiskers who opened the large carved doors and the pretty girl in a cap who took baby from my arms after that i remember only being tired so tired so very tired when i had rested enough to remember again i was on a sofa dressed in a pretty soft silken robe and i heard a kind voice saying the lady is better she will be all right let her sleep glancing up i saw a ***************** old gentleman and a pair of spectacles i closed my eyes and heard the gentleman with the familiar face say such beautiful such sweet pleasant things and his voice and touch thrilled my heart so that i kept my eyes shut and never wanted to open them again and presently the pretty girl with the cap on came in and baby was in her arms dressed in a beautiful robe ** petite ****** very much no hungry now he eat tres much *** he sleep he wash he dress he eat tres much he no hungry he eat some more tres much again he smile he now no very much hungry again some more was i in the land of fairies and was the gentleman with the familiar face the prince of fairies as he was the prince of lovers our babys outstretched arms and cry for me as he recognized me dispelled any such delusion but i was too tired to hold out my hands to him i soon felt his little face however nestling close against my own and felt too the touch of yet another face and heard the same voice which had made my heart thrill with bliss whisper again more things like unto those other things it had whispered but i was too tired and too happy to speak and my blessings seemed too sacred to open my eyes upon so i kept them closed when the old english physician came in the next day he said ah ha ah ha the lady is most well keep on feeding her and sleeping her she is halfstarved poor lady and ********* too by sleeplessness ah ha ah ha poor lady that will do feed her and sleep her feed her and sleep her ah ha ah ha thats all when the old doctor was gone i remember listening for the tread of the sentinel outside confusing the ah ha ah ha with the tramp tramp tramp and as i asked the question brought back the memory that the war was over the guns were stacked the camp was broken and the general was all my very own i looked around inquiringly and up into the familiar face for answer and he my general explained our pleasant surroundings his old friends mr and mrs james hutton he said had been suddenly summoned to england and had prayed him as a great favor to them to be their guest until their return as otherwise the delay to make the necessary arrangements for their going would prevent their catching the first steamer thus we had a beautiful home in which to rest to grow well and strong to forget all that could be forgotten of the past and to enjoy the present the first week in june the french maid came to our room with a telegram for mr edwards announcing that mr and mrs hutton would sail for home from england the following week my husband calculated about what time they would arrive and how soon we would be forced to give up the comforts of their beautiful and luxurious home which we were then enjoying we began to hunt for a place to live commencing with the hotels and larger ************** and winding up with the smaller ones after a week of varied and some very funny experiences we decided at last upon one house principally because of its attractive court and the pleasant verandas overlooking it with its glistening fountain and pretty shrubbery and flowers how nice for our baby i said how cool and refreshing the sound of the water and the glimpse of green so for babys sake the selection was made and our rooms engaged our landlady was a very dark brunette and prided herself upon being a french canadian but that man of mine she sorrowfully said is a soggy englishman and you would hardly believe it possible he could be the father of our two beautiful daughters both of them are going to do well but they dont take after their pa the oldest is engaged to be married to a stateser with nine businesses by the nine businesses and stateser i gathered from her explanation which she volunteered in answer to my puzzled look that the fortunate ************ was a yankee living in a small town in the state of vermont and owning a little country store where woolen and cotton goods silks and flannels pottery ********** hardware groceries grain and so forth were sold in her admiration of him after each alleged business she affixed the to her highsounding title of merchant the second daughter she told me was learning to sing she has a sweet voice but she dont take after her pa she said and the young preacher student in the next room to the right of the one you have chosen is very much taken with her and it looks like id get both girls off my hands before long she said she could not give me the use of the parlors when the girls wanted them the stateser comes a long ways you know and has to have it all to himself when he is here but she generously suggested that if none of them were using the parlor at the time when my company came she would let me entertain my visitors in it at the rate of a shilling a dozen which arrangement i considered a very good one for me as i did not expect to have more than a shillings worth of visitors perhaps in six months our meals were to be served in our own room except on sundays when we would have to dine in the public diningroom and do our own waiting like the others we did not exactly understand what that meant but one days experience proved it to be anything but comfortable the dinner had all been cooked on saturday and was cut up and piled on the table in the center of the room and we each had to serve ourselves i could not help thinking of the time when my general had been served by butlers and waiters each anxious to be the first to anticipate his wishes and all feeling amply rewarded for every effort by a pleasant word or an appreciative smile i wondered how any one of those obsequious attendants would feel to see us now the following menu was about the average dinner with the exception of course that on weekdays it was warm ****** beef mutton pie potato salad pickled ********* ********** tarts and milk our breakfast was always cold the first one was cold bread preserves a baked partridge which is the same as our pheasant and delicious coffee and butter our rooms had one discomfort we were awakened every morning by the young lady making love to the bird of her preacher beau while she arranged his room dear ittle birdie birdie dot a *** birdie dot a soul ittle birdie sings praises to ****** dear ittle birdie dot a dear ittle papa and dear ittle papa must *** him a dear dood ittle ***** dood ittle ******* ***** who will take **** of birdie and help him to make his people dood ******** and help birdie and ******* papa to sing praises too **** again ittle birdie a sound as of the door opening a rustling and a confused oh dear and then goodmorning was followed by the invariable excuse for not having finished ******* up the room and cage before he came because birdie and i are such friends aint we birdie and time slips so quickly dont it birdie i would know she was being forgiven though i could hear only the sounds of his deep low tones between the chirping to birdie of course neither my husband nor i meant to listen to these ********* to birdie of course and i always put my fingers in his ears at the sound of them after our breakfast was over and baby had been made comfortable i usually sent him out with annie for his walk and she was delighted at having him all to herself the rooms were comfortable and we found the long veranda where we spent our evenings and most of our mornings not only a very pleasant change but a source of amusement as well my curiosity was greatly excited concerning our neighbors on the left i was uncertain how many there were of them though i put them down in my mind as not less than half a dozen the first morning these lefthanders as i called them were as silent as the grave till about noon when all at once without any premonitory noises they commenced a most animated conversation interspersed with laughter mirthful and scornful then the tones of their voices would change from anger to reproach and then to grief so that at one time i was so full of sympathy with the poor man who was being driven out into the cold world that it was all i could do not to go in and plead for him but while i was hesitating all became quiet i supposed he was gone and all was over with him and involuntarily i offered up a prayer all the help i could give imagine if you can my surprise when the next morning at a little later hour 1 heard a repetition of the same painful scene the poor man had returned i reasoned taking them all together i thought they certainly were a most curious family and i determined to enlist my husbands interest as soon as he came in something had prevented my telling him the day before that evening as we were sitting on the veranda i carried my resolution into effect and though he listened with his usual sweet patience my description of the disturbance to my surprise excited in him more mirth than sympathy just as i had finished telling him our baby was brought in to be enjoyed and put to sleep the little pig went to market the mouse ran up the clock the cock horse was ridden to ******* cross and after innumerable ************ baby was ready and so were we for his bye baby bunting when his sweet little ****** accompanying ours grew fainter and fainter we began to sing in the chinook jargon the lords prayer which my husband had taught to so many of the indians on the pacific coast and which we always sang at the last to make babys sleep sound at the words kloshe mika tumtum kopa illahie kahkwa kopa ******** thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven from through the open door of the room to our left a voice clear and sweet joined in the same jargon with ours to our father and as the last invocation was chanted ***** **** kopa nesika ******* ********* kloshe kahkwa send away far from us all evil amen a handsome stranger stepped out and with outstretched hand said to the general with great cordiality ******** ***** ******** ***** how do you do friend give me your good hand then followed a conversation between them about the pacific coast fort vancouver san juan island puget sound the ********* tribe and their many mutual friends of the salmon ****** all the while i was wondering what could have become of the other family if they could have gone and yet now and then i caught a tone in his voice as he talked to my husband that sounded very similar to the tones of the man in trouble belonging to them though i did not see how it would be possible for any one to drive or wish to drive him out of their home when after awhile i came in for the compliments of the season my astonishment knew no bounds when i learned that he had been the sole occupant of that room since sunday night the clock in the court struck seven rising hastily and with many apologies this ************* man wrote something on his card and handing it to my husband said i am playing at the theater here tonight come and see me and was gone to this kind stranger william florence i was indebted for my first taste of the pleasures of the theater almost every evening he with our permission joined us on the veranda shared our play with baby cheered and entertained the general and kindly took us afterward to seethe play yet during the whole of his stay four days he never once in the most remote way intruded himself upon our confidence and though he knew there was some mystery in his innate delicacy he made no allusion to it on saturday evening when his engagement was over and he came to say goodby after lingering over the pleasant evenings we had passed together and putting great stress upon the benefit they had been to him he stopped abruptly saying confound it all forgive me if i put my foot in it but here is something to buy a rattle for the youngster i swear i absolutely have no use for it in fact i never had so much money at one time before in my whole life and it belongs by rights to the young rascal for if it had not been for the cats in the fiddle the cow jumping over the moon getting the poor dog a bone and our father who art in heaven i should have spent every red cent of it on the fellows please i insist he said as my husband refused i know you have had more money than you seem to be bothered with now take this though we were both very much touched by the kind generosity of this stranger in a strange land the general was firm in his refusal well goodby and good luck to you he said you are as obstinate as an ******** on the banks of the nile here it goes putting the fifty dollars back into his pocket and turning to me with a tone i so well remembered he wished me happiness goodby i said may our father who art in heaven and his little ones whom he says suffer to come unto me keep your heart thoughtful for others and gentle and kind all through this life believe in soul and be very sure of god in all the years that came afterward the friendship formed then between my husband and our first left ****** was never broken and to me it was a legacy the following week i noticed his rooms were taken by a very strangely acting lady and gentleman i saw there were two of them this time the second evening as i was putting baby who was unusually restless and fretful and would not be amused or comforted to sleep the queer lady with a *************************** ************* tone and manner said the child ****** or doth it need the rod withal whether the child needed the rod with all or mrs winslows soothing syrup he stopped crying at once and while she talked on never took his startled eyes from her face till he wearily closed them hypnotized to sleep hast thou a nurse one that thou ****** trustworthy she asked after i had put baby in his little bed yes madam i answered one whose love makes her so it is well she said and if thou dost not fear to leave the watch with her wilt thou and thy husband come as our guests to see our hamlet as we have conceived him to be it was the first of shakespeares plays i had ever seen and my blood ran cold as i breathlessly watched the ********* of it by these the most celebrated actors of their day charles kean and his wife ellen tree and with talents so versatile that i cried over the tragedy as if my heart would break and laughed with equal ********** over toodles the farce which followed at the close of the play the actress brought her husband into the box and introduced him unlike her he did all his acting on the stage while she stabbed her potatoes and said what no beans we accepted their kind invitation to share their carriage back to the house and enjoyed too some of the delicious supper prepared for them it was their last year on the stage and i never saw them again though i treasure their little keepsake given me in exchange for one not half so pretty and gratefully remember the pleasure they put into our lives during the days they were our lefthanders among others there came in time that king of ********* noble in mind as he was perfect in art joe jefferson he was accompanied by his wife a fascinating motherly little woman the second morning after meeting them i in compliment to her inquiries about my baby asked after their little dog to whom i had heard her husband talking as if it had been a child she laughed and explained schneider and told me the story which has since become the property of the newspapers about how the great ******** had been identified to the entire satisfaction of the ********** by means of this same schneider the most wonderful dog that ever existed in the human mind nor did this pleasant acquaintance end with our canadian experience the next time we saw joe jefferson was in richmond where he gave a performance and turned over the whole proceeds to a ********* confederate and all in such a quiet manner as to fulfill the spirit of the scriptural injunction regarding the right and left hands the kindness which was shown by the wealthy *********** the seeming favorite of fortune to the poor lad in the beginning of that career the distinction of which even then one could foretell was thus gracefully repaid a thousand times by the successful actor our landlady made a tour of inspection of all the rooms every friday but to us she made her visits longer each time showing a growing interest in our affairs she could not solve the mystery of our having come from such a palatial home to her boardinghouse then too one of my shilling visitors happening to be the governorgeneral and another an english officer they were also a cause of wonder she was so insistent in this unbounded curiosity that we were compelled to seek a larger house where we should be more lost sight of especially as just at this time two prominent southern gentlemen mr beverly tucker and mr beverly saunders had been gagged and taken through the lines though their release was immediately demanded by the english government much to my husbands relief i volunteered to assume the disagreeable task of notifying her which notice she seemed intuitively to have anticipated and determined to thwart by telling of her troubles all of which she laid at that johnsons her husbands door he is got so highminded now she said he refuses to blacken all the boots at night leaves the top floor ones till morning wants to set upstairs with me and the girls instead of staying down in the kitchen looking for ***** and to be

from stateser too and was that sly he was going to spend it on himself and i giving him all he needs taking advantage of her pause for sympathy i edged in my notice she immediately put all the blame of our going on that johnson and though i assured her that he had nothing whatever to do with it wailed you cant fool us you cant fool us he drives every boarder out of the house our next rooms opened

care come look at the soldiers i said as i saw a shadow in the generals smile and heard a sigh when the music almost under our very windows signaled the hour for *********** the ********* senseless ghost of despair vanished with my entreaties as we stood at the window and watched the soldiers keeping time with them to step and tune outwardly while hiding the muffled sound within each playing we were enjoying it without one marring thought of the ************** past trying to fool each other till we really fooled ourselves it was with thankfulness that i saw the general watch with unfeigned interest the maneuvers of the soldiers day after day and pleasantly welcome reveille and tattoo our baby learned to march almost before he walked while we were enjoying our congenial surroundings and each other spite of poverty fears for the future and grief for the past my husband became very ill in the crisis of his illness while he required all my attention our baby was seized with croup the kind old englishman recommended by my good friends was very attentive but failed to inspire me with my wonted faith the chief reason i think must have been that he was not called doctor but mister for two weeks he came once and sometimes twice a day going first to see and bring me news of baby who had been kindly taken by our friends to their home to be cared for i was a source of unending amusement an ********** mystery to the english doctor though we were very good friends during all this long illness i never once stopped to consider the cost of anything whether it were food medicines or delicacies of any kind if prescribed or suggested but purchased regardless of expense when the danger was past and our board bill was sent up i counted over our little store and found there was not enough left to meet it my husband was still too ill to be annoyed or troubled about anything and with the bill hidden away in my pocket i was making a plan of battle and *********** how i could fight my way out of the intrenchments when he noticed that i was looking pale and suggested that i go out for a little fresh air eagerly taking advantage of the excuse thus offered i put on my bonnet and went down to the office and took from my box in the safe an oldfashioned set of emeralds and asking the proprietor to direct me to the most reliable jeweler and to send some one to sit with my husband until my return i went out i had had very little experience in buying of merchants and none whatever in selling to them but i feigned great wisdom and dignity as i told the young man who stepped forward to wait upon me that my business was with the head of the firm he took me back to an inner office where an old man with *********** hair and a very moist countenance was looking intently through something which very much resembled a napkinring screwed into his right eye at some jewels lying on a tray before him he wore his teeth on the outside of his mouth and his upper lip was so drawn in the intensity of his look as to be almost hidden under his overreaching nose his face too was wrinkled up into a thousand gullies in his concentration upon his work we dont employ young women ere he said looking up and frowning as he suddenly became aware of my presence i came i explained taking out my emeralds and handing them to him to ask you if you would not please sir kindly buy some of these stones from me or at least advance me some money on them this is not a pawnbrokers shop neither mum he replied as he carefully examined the jewels and then suddenly popping the napkinring out of his eye turned both of the piercing little gray ********* upon me and said where did you get these emeralds from miss i was born with them sir i said indignantly either from my appearance or for some other cause he became suddenly suspicious and not only would not purchase them of me but refused to let me have them till i could prove my right to them i was too young and inexperienced to be anything but furious and the bitter scalding tears that anger sometimes ******* to relieve poor womans outraged feelings were still falling fast when i reached the hotel with the clerk whom the jeweler had sent back with me that i might prove by the proprietor my ownership of the jewels with which i was born he in his sympathy shared my anger and after expressing his sincere regret that i should have been subjected to such an indignity advised as he snatched the case from the clerk with a withering look of scorn translated into more emphatic language that i should look carefully over them to be sure that neither this hireling nor his master had abstracted any of the stones for his experience had been that suspicion was born of guilt as he again locked up my emeralds in his safe he kindly asked how much money i needed and begged that in the future i would permit him to advance for me if i should need any and furthermore as to the board and expenses here he said mr edwards and i will arrange all that when he is well entirely well through the goodness of god and the skill of my kind physician my loved ones were spared to me and one day some time after they were well as i was reading the paper to my husband i chanced across an advertisement for a teacher of latin in miss mcintoshs school the professor was going abroad and wanted some one to take his place during his absence the chuckle of delight which i involuntarily gave as i read it provoked from the general the remark that i was keeping something very good all to myself i slyly determined that this little suspicion should be verified and that i would make an application at once for the position then if i should fail i alone would suffer from the disappointment so just as soon as i could arrange it i donned my best clothes assumed a most dignified mien went to the number advertised and asked to see the professor i was shown into the primmest of parlors the kind of room one feels so utterly alone in without even the suspicion of a spirit around to keep your own spirit company each piece of furniture was placed with mathematical precision and all was ********** the ************ who came in response to my call seemed put up in much the same order she was tall and angular and her grizzly red hair was arranged in three large puffs like fortifications i thought on each side of her long thin face high ********** roman nose and eyes crowded up together under ********** spectacles as she held my card in her hand and looked at me with a *********** gaze piercing my inmost thoughts and with that discouraging well **************** expression i felt all my courage going my necessities aroused me from my cowardice and i said as bravely as i could i have had the good fortune to read your advertisement madam in the paper this morning and have come in answer to it may i see the professor looking curiously at my card and then over her glasses at me she said in a voice like an animated telephone through which some one was speaking at the other end the advertisement was for a teacher not for a pupil i am perfectly aware of that i answered and came in response to offer my services to the professor a most quizzical expression bunched up the corners of her mouth and wiggled across her little colorless eyes as she said i will send the professor down to you looking over her spectacles again as if for a verification of her first impression of me she was gone returning after a little while she said the professor requested me to ask if you would be so good as to come up into the ************** i saw as soon as i had entered that a description of me had preceded my coming and not a very flattering one either i judged from the faces of the professor and the pupils the class consisted of fourteen young ladies all of them apparently older than i was the professor finished the sentence he was translating on the board rubbed it out wiped his hands on the cloth replaced it came forward and was duly presented by miss mcintosh who remained in the room he had a pleasant round smooth face a bald head and large gray eyes was short and stout with a sympathetic cultured voice and manner miss mcintosh tells me you came in reply to my advertisement i have been forced to advertise in order to save time as my going abroad is unexpected and brooks no delay i am very glad you had no option but to advertise else it might not have been my good fortune to know of and respond to your wants sir and you have really come to apply for the position he asked i have sir the expression on miss mcintoshs face the nudging and suppressed ****** among the pupils which this answer brought forth was not calculated to lessen my embarrassment have you had any experience in teaching no sir i said may i ask where you were educated at home except for two years sir i answered then i went to lynchburg college where i was graduated is that in england oh no sir said i with astonishment at his ignorance and then recollecting myself just as i was about to inform him that lynchburg was the fifth town in population in virginia was on the south bank of the james river one hundred and sixteen miles from the capital of the state and within view of the blue ridge mountains and peaks of otter i stopped short embarrassed by my imprudence the professor taking no notice of my confusion went on to say and so you were graduated there my class here has just finished caesar do you remember how caesar commences yes sir i said and repeated ****** est ***** di **** in ****** **** you have the continental pronunciation i see he gave me several sentences to translate then an ode from horace and some selections from catullus and ******** by this time the pupils were silent and miss mcintoshs expression was changed he then asked me to write and parse a sentence which i did saying sotto voce as he took the chalk from me that was a catch question please translate and parse this said he without noticing my aside and he wrote in latin the president of the united states said nobody is hurt before he wrote any further instead of translating i looked up at him and said but oh sir somebody was hurt quickly he cleared the board put down the cloth wiped his hands turned his face to me and offering his hand said not to my surprise because i had faith in prayer but rather to that of miss mcintosh and the young ladies i will engage you mrs edwards and will be ****** ***** for you we then went down to the parlor and i gave him the names of the only friends i had in montreal of whom he could make inquiries regarding me the next day i gave my first lesson to the class i became very fond of them all and after my embarrassment of the first few days got along very well with them the general was very curious to know where i went every day but knowing it gave me great pleasure to be thus mysterious humored me and asked no questions my first months salary was spent in part payment on an overcoat for him and only our father and the angels know what joy filled my heart that with the work of my hands i could give him comfort their my secret was out i was sorry when the cold weather came the snows not only put an end to the military reviews but covered up the beautiful green there were very few diversions for us but i was just as happy as it was possible for me to be indeed those were the very happiest days of my whole life and i was almost sorry when general rufus ingalls wrote a letter to my husband inclosing a kind personal letter from general grant together with the following official assurance of his safety general grant also wrote that it had not been at all necessary for us to go away in the first place and that the terms of his cartel should have been respected even though it had necessitated another declaration of war we stopped in new york en route to virginia expecting to remain there only three or four days but we found that our board had been paid in advance for two weeks that a carriage had been put at our service for that length of time and that in our box was a pack of wine cards marked paid to this day i do not know how many peoples guests we were for a great many of general picketts old army friends were there at the time and they all vied with each other in making it pleasant and happy for us as soon as we could make our plans we went down to turkey island our plantation on the banks of the james river a rough cottage hastily built stood on the site of the grand old colonial mansion burned by butler around it were

which in the advantages it gave the commonwealth to some extent atoned to my general for the destruction of the pickett home diverting his troops for a time from wanton spoliation butler set them to digging a canal at dutch gap to connect the james and appomattox thereby shortening by seven miles the road to richmond and placing the state traffic under a permanent obligation to his memory to protect his men while they worked he stationed his prisoners in the trench beside them in order that the confederates might not yield to the otherwise irresistible temptation to fire upon them butler may not have been gifted with that fascinating suavity of demeanor which is necessary to render a man an ************* ornament to society but from a practical business point of view he was not wholly destitute of commendable qualities his dutch gap canal is not only a lasting monument to his progressive spirit but a benefit to commerce and an interesting feature which has attracted visitors from many nations out on a point of the plantation back from the river in a clump of trees the beginning of the big woods is still standing a most interesting monument the top of it was broken off by butlers troops in a search for hidden treasure it was erected by william and mary randolph in 1771 the following is a copy of the inscription on one of its sides the foundation of this pillar was laid in 1771 when all the great rivers of this country were swept by inundations never before experienced which changed the face of nature and left traces of their violence that will remain for ages my first visit to this monument is one of the sweetest memories of my turkey island life i had gone with my husband to hunt rabbits and birds a hunt more for the meat than for the sport in those povertystricken days when our larders were greatly dependent upon the water and the woods the day was fine and the dew was yet glistening as we came suddenly and without warning within touch of the

or wrong my country statesmen may argue soldiers must fight when in 1819 the united states in the exuberance of her territorial wealth voluntarily threw texas into the hands of spain as a bonus for

united states it lay like a smoldering fire half darkened under its ashes until a little wind of excitement would blow suddenly against it and fan it into a vivid flame to burn brightly till the breeze shifted to some other quarter and the flame would sink again into a fitful slumber it was claimed by the united states that the oregon country between fortytwo and fiftyfour forty was part of the louisiana cession made by napoleon in 1803 england refusing to recognize this claim the question remained unsettled until 1818 when a treaty of joint occupancy was agreed upon and renewed in #### the conditions of this treaty were that there should be equality between the two nations in their occupancy of this territory it is unnecessary to state that the equality if it ever existed soon disappeared there may come a time when the lion will lie down with the lamb on some other condition than the one predicted by a modern prophet that the lamb will be inside of the lion but the lion in the case will not be of that species known as the british lion this situation with all its discomforts continued until the presidential campaign of 1844 when the democratic platform sent the warcry of fiftyfour forty or fight resounding throughout the land this belligerent alternative was averted by the treaty of june 15 1846 which drew the line of division southward in such a way as to give the whole of vancouvers island to the english and reserve to the united states the archipelago of which san juan island is a part this concession was made by the united states to avoid cutting through vancouvers and thus depriving the british of a part of the island a few months later great britain manifested a desire to claim a line through rosario strait near the continent as the boundary thus throwing all the islands of the haro archipelago within british jurisdiction this attempt was promptly met by mr ******** then minister to england and for a time it was apparently abandoned in january 1848 mr crampton the british minister to the united states submitted a proposition which involved the ************ to great britain of all the islands in the haro archipelago in 1852 the territory of

invested with full powers the discussion of the boundary question was had with this understanding on the part of the united states commissioner as was to be expected the commissioners failed to agree on the subject of a satisfactory boundary it being somewhat difficult to interpret satisfactorily a treaty with some one who has in advance made up his mind and openly declared his intention as had the british commissioners to accept only that interpretation which will award to him the subjectmatter of contention a decision which shall in no way effect the claim of one of the parties to the

claimed rosario strait as the boundary on the ground that it coincided with what he called the very peculiar ******* of the treaty he assumed that the rosario strait answered to the requirement of the

science of diplomacy as his nation had drawn up the treaty and was therefore responsible for the peculiar ******* it was scarcely becoming in him to set forth that claim in violation of the law of nations which provides that a difficulty of construction shall not be decided in favor of the nation creating the obscurity being unable to support his claim he offered as a substitute a smaller channel which would include san juan in the british possessions the united states commissioner refused to accept this compromise the british commissioner had received rigid instructions and had no power to accept any line that would not give san juan to great britain he said beyond what i now offer i can no further go it was only reasonable to suppose that the nearest natural boundary which would avoid the necessity of cutting vancouvers island would be the one sought this boundary was the canal de haro in the communication by mr mclane who had been sent specially to great britain to aid in the negotiations to mr buchanan then secretary of state he specifically mentions the extension of the line by the canal de haro and the strait of **** to the ocean no reference being made to rosario he states that this proposition now made by lord ******** was suggested by his mr ******* immediate predecessor as one which his government might accept again he refers to the modified extension of the line as being adapted to avoid the southern cape of vancouvers island mr benton in a speech in the senate in favor of the treaty mentioned the slight deflection of the line with the object of avoiding the cutting of the south end of vancouvers island again he spoke of the line through the channel de haro and stated that it preserved for the united states that cluster of islands between the channel de haro and the continent even mr crampton the british minister did not claim that rosario was the channel meant but thought that it must refer to vancouvers channel erroneously supposing it to be the only one answering the description which had up to that time been surveyed and used it is a noticeable fact that the strait of rosario did not appear upon any map south of the fortyninth parallel until it was needed by the british government to ****** a piece of somebody elses land when it was hastily moved southward and dated back to a period ********** the treaty in 1853 the hudsons bay company sent an agent with a flock of sheep to take possession of san juan island a very peaceable purpose to which to devote a territory surrounded by such warlike associations as it

as the bold ******* one thousand nine hundred and forty strong looked from their five ships of war ********* through the dawn and beheld this slight force comfortable in the reflection that they had a

youth armed with but a *************** sling and stone later in the game they had yet more reason to remember the experience of that famous champion and draw discouraging parallels to a proposition from the english commander for a joint military occupation of san juan captain pickett replied as a matter of course i being here under orders from my government can not allow any joint occupation until so ordered by my commanding general the english captain said i have one thousand men on board the ships ready to land tonight captain you have the force to land but if you undertake it i will fight you as long as i have a man very well answered hornby i shall land them at once if you will give me fortyeight hours said captain pickett till i hear from my commanding officer my orders may be countermanded if you dont you must be responsible for the bloodshed that will follow not one minute was the english captains reply captain pickett gave orders for the drawing up of his men in lines on the hill facing the beach where the english would have to land we will make a bunker hill of it and dont be afraid of their big guns said pickett to his men the following is an extract from the report of general harney to general scott the following letter from general harney to captain pickett defines at length his purpose in transferring troops to san juan the following correspondence between captain pickett and the military officers and the agent of the hudsons bay company will sufficiently indicate the existing situation upon the island in november captain pickett was ordered to fort bellingham where he remained until april 10 when he was replaced in command at san juan of which order he was notified in the following from this time until the state of virginia was forced into the ranks of secession carrying her noblest sons with her captain pickett remained on the island of san juan then he resigned his commission and narrowly escaping arrest hastened south to cast in his fortunes with the struggling new dream nation the military leaders on the pacific coast had an ulterior purpose hidden from the world but lying close to the hearts of them all of far greater magnitude than the mere saving of a fragment of earth they had seen the little cloud no bigger than a mans hand drifting along the southern horizon and had read its threatening import they knew that within it were hidden the thunders and lightnings of war and they dreaded the moment when the storm should break over the land to avert this disaster they were ready to risk their lives at the mouths of british guns the elements of discord that had lain at the heart of all our national history since the adoption of the constitution and the division of parties into federalists and republicans had at last reached the point where an outbreak could be avoided only by a foreign war which would unite all parts of the country into one grand whole for the purpose of national defense if a war with england could be precipitated the danger of civil faction would be over all hearts would respond at once to the call of the nation for help the first british gun that should launch its thunder against the pacific coast would echo and ****** across a continent and send its reverberations to the remotest limits north south east and west the spirit of patriotism would awaken and the starspangled banner would float once more over a united nation the little waves of sectional strife that looked so stormy now would sink into the great sea of patriotic enthusiasm that would roll in majestic grandeur from the farthest ******** of minnesota to the sunny orange groves of florida from the islands that bathe themselves in the faroff atlantic waves to the golden gate that opens the way to the ********** of the pacific to this end captain pickett who had won his commission by gallant service under the old flag would gladly have given his life like many others who afterward fought as bravely against the national government as they had in happier times fought for it he loved the union every star in that flag which he had so often borne to victory shone upon his heart with the radiance of love and hope the white of its fluttering folds was like the purity of heaven toward which his soul ever aspired the red was as the wine of life that surged through his veins it is difficult for the reader to appreciate fully from this account the great responsibility resting upon captain pickett in his position on san juan upon his firmness and courage hung the honor of his country upon his coolness and discretion depended the lives of ****** thousands with millions of treasure in early manhood he measured up to the occasion and gave true prophecy of what he would afterward accomplish picketts west point appointment and military service in united states army george e pickett was appointed to west point through the political power and friendship of mr abraham lincoln by congressman john g stuart of the third illinois district mr lincoln was then associated in the practice of law with picketts uncle mr andrew johnston not andy johnson who was later of the firm of johnston williams ******** of richmond virginia and was one of the most successful prominent and wealthy lawyers of that city mr johnston was a great scholar and was highly esteemed by president lincoln who desired him to become governor of virginia and guide her in her return to the union naturally the great lawyer was desirous that his nephew should follow in his own footsteps and become a power in the legal world but a military bent of mind was hereditary in the pickett family and manifest destiny was not to be thwarted it so happened too that just at this time picketts martial ardor was stimulated by the appointment to west point of his cousins heth duke and morgan and several of his ************* mr lincoln was very fond of george pickett and when pickett confided to him his military aspirations he secretly determined they should be gratified and went at once systematically to work to secure his appointment from washington the great statesman wrote his young friend a letter from which the following is an extract in one of the letters which the young cadet received from mr lincoln soon after entering west point is the following passage at the close of the letter he said pickett remembered for there was not a drop of gall in his whole life short as was mr lincolns time when he passed through richmond after its surrender he came to the old pickett home to hunt up his friend and former partner the generals uncle he asked about the general himself and then for the generals wife i had seen the carriage and the guard and ******* but did not know who the visitors were in those suspicious times of trouble and anxiety we did not wait for formal ************* and we were following on after the servant who went to answer the bell when i heard the caller ask for george picketts wife i came forward with my baby in my arms i am george picketts wife i said and i am abraham lincoln the president no abraham lincoln georges old friend seeing babys outstretched arms mr lincoln took him and little george opened wide his mouth and gave his fathers friend a dewy baby kiss seeming to feel with the prescient infant instinct the tie that binds as i took my baby back again mr lincoln said in that deep and sympathetic voice which was one of his greatest powers over the hearts of men tell your father the rascal that i forgive him for the sake of your mothers smile and your bright eyes i had sometimes wondered at the generals reverential way of speaking of president lincoln but as i looked up at his honest earnest face and felt the warm clasp of his great strong hand i marveled no more that all who knew him should love him when but a few days later the wires flashed over the world the tragic message which enveloped our whole nation in mourning general pickett said my god my god the south has lost her best friend and protector the surest safest hand to guide and steer her through the breakers ahead again must she feel the smart of fanaticism the following is the official statement of picketts military services the commercial greed of england anchored the negro race upon america against the earnest protests of the colonists in 1620 when a dutch vessel landed twenty slaves at jamestown the enlightened sense of virginia quickly took alarm and laws against the wicked traffic were promptly passed for more than a century virginia fought most valiantly against the wrong which she foresaw would work irreparable injury not only to the south but to the whole country in #### the king commanded the governor under pain of highest displeasure to assent to no law by which the importation of slaves should be in any respect prohibited or obstructed two years later after a prolonged and earnest debate the assembly of virginia submitted to the king a memorial setting forth the inhumanity of the trade and its exceeding great danger to the existence of his american dominions and praying that the interests of the british dealers who would be financially benefited by the criminal traffic might not be permitted to take precedence of the welfare of the entire colonies as england has never been known to hold any colony with the smallest reference to the benefit of its inhabitants the petition was of course unavailing thus was forced upon virginia a gigantic evil which she bravely supported for generations and the wrongs of which she did all in her power to ameliorate in the winter of ###### oglethorpe returned to georgia from england carrying two acts of parliament which in the absence of testimony to the contrary indicate that their bearer must have been the champion ******** of his generation one of these parliamentary decrees prohibited the sale of ********** liquors the other forbade the holding of slaves the principal result of this moral effort was a frame of mind in the community succinctly set forth in the following dedication of a ************* pamphlet to the ********* of the period this soulful tribute to the lofty philanthropy of the pioneer ******** would seem to signify that the primitive georgian was not above the vice of sarcasm and appears to have had a demoralizing influence upon the ******** of colonial politics as a little later in history we find him in the character of a carolina slaveholder applying the profits of his new career of usefulness to the support of his georgia orphan asylum piously thanking god that his investment was profitable and finding fault with the tyrannical law which obliged him to have his slaves and his orphans on different sides of the dividing line whether he sought consolation for his misfortune in manhattan ********* or ******** is not recorded through the charitable efforts of this severe ******** slavery was fastened upon georgia and there was furnished an early illustration of the modern definition of vice as a virtue gone to seed many of the english sovereigns invested in slave ships and in 1776 slavery existed in all thirteen states a regular traffic was carried on between new england and africa virginia fought this revolting trade in the federal convention but new england voted with south carolina and georgia that for another twenty years this terrible crime should blot our escutcheon still the southern leaders fought and in 1790 the congress of the united states declared that it possessed no power to interfere with slavery or the treatment of slaves within the states in the meantime the northern states had discovered that it was not so lucrative to hold slaves in a rigorous climate as it was to catch them on the african coast and sell them into conditions more favorable to the tropical constitution and to the production of those crops to the management of which the african intelligence was best adapted consequently the north was seized upon by a severe spasm of virtue which demanded that she should for value received transfer her human possessions to the south after the manner of the enthusiastic young convert who announced in prayermeeting that her eyes had been graciously opened to see that her feathers and ribbons and laces were carrying her straight down to hell so she pulled them all off and gave them to her sister in 1820 when missouri was admitted into the union the first halt was effected the east was greatly opposed to the extension of the union toward the southwest and carried out its resolution that slavery should not be recognized as legal in the territories north of the parallel 30 30 patrick henry marshall jefferson henry clay and john quincy adams all recognized the great evil and fought for the remedy in 1829 henry clay said if i were to invoke the greatest blessing on earth which heaven in its mercy could now bestow on this nation it would be the separation of

of the ************ question of states rights a quarrel which had begun away back in the beginning of constitutional history when hamilton and jefferson separated on the question of ************** of power they laid out a long and circuitous route to a tragic ending of the dispute which began with the failure of the articles of confederation and led up to the dramatic exit of the southern members from the halls of congress more than half a century later article ii in the articles of confederation stipulated that each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence article iii specified that the said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other the great advocate of ********** alexander hamilton was among the first to appreciate the advantage which the state government possessed in the affections of the people he perceived that in a clash of state with national interests the state interests would receive the support of the people under the articles of confederation the states had shown more disposition to take back the powers which had been delegated to the general government than to give up any that might remain the state was the mother of the people the general government was an unsympathetic overbearing master the bond between the state and the individual had become a fixed habit of affection to rend the state government would be the act of a ********* it would even be selfdestruction should the general government fall to pieces in some sudden political earthquake life would according to the popular view go on much

personal interest than in the president and cabinet too far away to seem to hold any connection with the mass of the people one of the delegates to the federal convention had expressed his opinion that the people would be rather more attached to the national government as being more important in itself and more flattering to their pride hamilton stern old federalist though he was and somewhat

flow with the stream of state power so great was his apprehension of the power of the state over the popular mind that he was almost hopeless of uniting such varied and ************ interests into one republic of states he felt apprehensive that only the british form of government would hold together the diverse sentiments in america had public opinion permitted hamilton to extinguish the state governments in setting up the national government founded upon the constitution which owes its existence perhaps more to him than any one else there would have been no question of states rights to develop into the discordant element which it became in a few years after the adoption of the constitution as things remained the states adopted the constitution but the people continued true to the old state governments to which they were accustomed in 1783 after peace was established the states from time to time began to grow jealous of the powers of each other and in 1789 the federal government acted upon a basis of secession from the articles of confederation of 1781 virginia emphatically reserved the right to withdraw from the compact if she found it against her interest to remain in it as did the ten other states the constitution held each state to be selfgoverning this construction held until 1798 when the alien and sedition laws were passed kentucky and virginia denounced these laws as contrary to the constitution which was a compact between the states the celebrated virginia and kentucky resolutions followed declaring that when congress passed acts beyond its constitutional powers the states were not bound to obey and what was of far more moment that each state had the right to determine the question of constitutionality these resolutions possessed the greater power by reason of their authorship that of virginia was drawn up by madison one of the immortal three to whom the nation was indebted for its constitution and who might be supposed to know if any man could what that constitution meant the kentucky resolution was prepared by jefferson then vicepresident who may fairly be ranked as the founder of the doctrine of states rights in the original draft jefferson had written where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy every state has a natural right in cases not within the compact to

great political party the doctrine of states rights again threatened to reach its legitimate conclusion of secession president madison was denounced as a usurper of powers from which he was debarred by the constitution from the beginning massachusetts had denied the right of the government to call for troops holding as has since been held in somewhat notable instances that it was for the governor of the state and not for the president to decide whether there was sufficient reason for calling out state militia rhode island and connecticut refused to put their troops under the command of federal officers the latter declaring her sovereign independence and holding with unswerving tenacity the theory that the united states was a confederated republic not a nation the leaders of the federalist party were seriously contemplating the question of whether the union was a failure and considering the feasibility of withdrawing and setting up a new little union for themselves two years later the hartford convention called by the massachusetts legislature expressed the opinion that events may prove that the causes of our calamities are deep and permanent and when that shall appear a separation by equitable arrangement will be preferable to an alliance by constraint among nominal friends but real enemies inflamed by mutual hatred and jealousy and inviting by ********* divisions contempt and aggression from abroad in the return of peace the causes of controversy were forgotten and the vexed question was left to be decided in a different way and at a fearful cost in the first *********** of constitutional history there was no lack of opportunities for testing the prophetic insight of the great first consul as to what might be expected in the event of a clash of interests between the sections such a clash of interests arose in the late #** over the sale of public lands in the west and led to a war of words in which the subject of nullification was discussed as a possible way out of ************** difficulties in ### 1 the controversy over the protective tariff led the great apostle of states rights calhoun to make the assertion the great dissimilarity and as i must add as

most dear may we all remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the states and distributing equally the benefit and burden of the union the word nullification was first used by jefferson in the kentucky resolution of 1798 in 1832 mr clays bill providing for a reduction of duties upon foreign products except where they came in conflict with articles of domestic manufacture was regarded by the south as fixing upon the country the protective system a policy which was favorable to the manufacturers of the north but not to the agriculturists of the south on the 24th of november 1832 the convention called by the legislature of south carolina declared the tariff act to be null and void and that the state would be ******** from allegiance to the union if the government should attempt to enforce the act and would establish an independent government the threatened war was averted by the efforts of the great *********** clay who modified his tariff bill to meet the demands of south carolina and secession was once more postponed to the future the general opinion among the leaders of the south is thus illustrated by the following statement made by the great ********* nothing short of a negative absolute or in effect on the part of the government of a state can possibly protect it against the encroachments of the united government of the states whenever their powers come in conflict in the closing year of his long life that wise and ********** statesman madison wrote the visible susceptibility to the contagion of nullification in the southern states

incompatibility of interest which mr madison recognized as one of the leading elements of discord capable of resulting in nullification secession and farewell separation was impressively illustrated in the discussions of the commercial convention which met in 1838 at augusta georgia and afterward at charleston south carolina in this convention a comparison was made between the relative commercial conditions of north and south before and after the union in colonial times the commerce of the south was far superior to that of the north under the constitution the difference was very largely in favor of the north in #### the importations of virginia amounted to ###### pounds sterling and that of south carolina to ###### pounds sterling the imports of new york at the same period were only ###### of pennsylvania ###### and of all the new england colonies collectively only ###### pounds sterling in 1821 the imports into new york had risen to about seventy times its colonial import at an equal time before the adoption of the constitution those of south carolina were about the same as in #### in the nullification period of south carolina the difference had increased to an enormous extent new york had more than doubled virginia had fallen off onehalf south carolina twothirds there were natural and inherent causes for a difference in the commercial magnitude of the two sections but making due allowance for these the convention held that unfair legislation was the prevailing cause of their business depression the plan of the convention providing for the opening of the southern ports to trade with foreign countries failed this failure though partly the effect of northern advantages of navigation business aptitude and free labor was yet held by the south to be in great degree due to congressional legislation which had resulted in giving commercial success to the north in preference to the south the undeniable facts still remained that in colonial days the south was the seat of power and that she had now fallen to a minor place again in ###### massachusetts and ohio proposed a peaceful dissolution of the union as preferable to remaining a part of a commonwealth which included texas in its territory the next year the american antislavery party announced that it was their duty to withdraw from the union and repudiate a constitution which tolerated slavery in 1844 when the discussion of the annexation of texas was raging hotly the question of secession again arose in the south a meeting was held at ****** south carolina to unite the southern states in support of annexation and to invite the president to ******* congress to arrange terms of separation if texas should not be admitted one of the resolutions passed at that meeting was that such dissolution could not be peaceably and calmly effected evidently did not occur to any member of the convention according to the doctrine of states rights to which they had been trained there was no valid reason for making objection to such an arrangement at beaufort in the same state it was resolved that we will dissolve this union sooner than abandon texas at a large meeting in the williamsburg district it was resolved that we hold it to be better and more to the interest of the southern and southwestern portions of this confederacy to be out of the union with texas than in it without her for the time this movement was suppressed by ********** views earnestly promoted in other parts of the south but the subject was only postponed to break out later in a more violent form thus all the history of the united states north and south since the adoption of the constitution pointed toward secession as the remedy for all sectional wrongs and misfortunes the young men of martial instincts went to west point and learned the doctrine of states rights under the fostering care of the united states government from the same textbooks from which they absorbed the art of war soon after the new england states had threatened to secede unless the war with great britain was adjusted satisfactorily to them a northern lawyer named rawle prepared a work known as rawle on the constitution in this book the right of secession was clearly set forth as one guaranteed by the constitution of the united states in view of the circumstances this work may fairly be supposed to represent the sentiment of the north on the subject of states rights when calhoun was secretary of war he caused this book to be included in the course of study as pursued at west point where it remained until it was superseded in 1861 by some other textbook which presented a different view of the vexed question for nearly half a century the only treatise on the constitution ever seen by a west point cadet was ****** commentaries on the constitution from which they were taught the principle that at a later period became a political crime politicians followed the lead of that greatest of all southern statesmen calhoun the unparalleled champion of states rights what wonder that when the vital crisis came the south should resort once more to that course which had served her so well in the past secession abraham lincolns avowed principle was that if slavery was wrong for the north it was wrong for the south and that the federal union must be all slave or all free territory when in 1860 he was elected president the southern states looked upon the union as substantially broken and the cotton states wanted to secede at once they summoned conventions in accordance with the precedent of 1787 in the adoption of the federal constitution through these conventions they revoked the assent of each commonwealth to the federal compact and as sovereign ************* they formed a new federal compact as the southern confederacy the border states were bitterly opposed to secession taking no part in the movement anxiously and prayerfully awaiting the policy of president lincoln but alas they interpreted his inaugural speech as a declaration of war after his cabinet meeting march 29 1861 he ordered a naval expedition to be in readiness to move on to sumter and pickens on april 12 1861 beauregard in opposition to this armed invasion opened fire and mr lincoln further verified the interpretation of his address by issuing an official call for seventyfive thousand volunteers to overcome combinations too powerful to be suppressed by judicial proceedings the border states who had heretofore been for peace at once put on their ******** virginia who but a month before had by a vote of ninety to fortyfive rejected the ordinance of secession now immediately passed it north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed in hot haste thus north and south each charging

island on the pacific coast when his state seceded and the following letter to one of his loved ones written on his way back to offer his services to his beloved virginia will show the contending feelings of his brave and loving heart the war between the states has now been over thirty three years the falsehoods and misrepresentations as to the causes which led up to that gigantic struggle

right of secession as shown in the historical facts set forth in this chapter has at different periods been claimed by every section of this country to deny this is to deny history in his speech in congress on the spot resolutions mr lincoln said we see that secession had been acknowledged as aright by all parts of the country when at the hartford convention new england threatened to secede because she felt that her interests were prejudiced by the war with england she asserted her faith in the doctrine of the right of states to protect that which most nearly concerned their own citizens though they had no such legal cause of secession as the south had mr lincoln was elected on a platform which directly assailed the rights of our people granted by the constitution thus he violated the constitution adopted for a more perfect union and thereby made the first assault upon the integrity of the union sections 7 and 8 of the platform set forth not only the rights of slavery were attacked in the republican platform but the right of occupancy to territory won in great part by the blood and treasure of our people was denied the states therefore which had contributed so much to the formation protection and extension of the american union were made to feel that they no longer had any part in a government for which when treated with justice and fairness they would gladly have died thus thousands of brokenhearted patriotic union loving men bade farewell to a union in which their rights and privileges were forcibly wrested from them under the southern flag there were no traitors no rebels to state the reverse of this proposition is to ******* history to charge it is a crime the bravest truest survivors who wore the gray are as ready to defend our country as any man who wore

virginia the nineteenth virginia regiment was commanded by colonel j r strange and was recruited in albemarle county the twentyeighth regiment was commanded by colonel robert t preston and was recruited in roanoke county the first movement of the brigade after general pickett assumed command was the occupation of the peninsula in front of yorktown under general joseph e johnston where it maintained the line of defense in several severe skirmishes with the federal forces under general george b mcclellan of the four ways in which the army of the potomac might have advanced toward richmond mcclellan chose the one by fortress monroe into the peninsula and up between the james and york rivers thus the ground which had been made famous less than a hundred years before by the

jacksons division was left at mount jackson ewells on the rap pahannock longstreets at orange courthouse and g w smiths at fredericksburg reports from general magruder at yorktown indicating that mcclellans whole army was moving toward richmond majorgeneral longstreet and general smith were ordered to richmond the latter leaving a portion of his troops in front of fredericksburg with his small force general magruder opposed the march of the federals with the design of delaying them until his army could be reinforced which he so far succeeded in doing as to impress mcclellan with the idea that the confederate forces were much larger than they really were in the conference which took place about this time between president davis and his leading generals johnston urged a consolidation of all the available forces in front of richmond to receive the impending attack of mcclellan and repel it with such vigor as to destroy the army of the potomac thus hoping to end the war at a stroke longstreet wished to attack washington thereby compelling mcclellan to turn his attention to affairs nearer home as davis and lee opposed johnstons suggestion lest it might dangerously weaken other important points and longstreet was not permitted to elaborate his plan a succession of small engagements took place decisive of nothing in particular unless it might be of the value of on to richmond as a warcry the first of these was the siege of yorktown which began the 5th of april and was in progress on the 17th when joseph e johnston took command of the army of the peninsula upon the arrival of smith and longstreet the confederate forces amounted to fifty thousand magruders division forming the right wing longstreets the center d h hills the left smiths the reserve there was some

the division of d h hill which had gone forward to return to longstreets assistance in his official account of the engagement general johnston says the action gradually increased in magnitude until about three oclock when general longstreet commanding the rear requested that a part of majorgeneral hills troops might be sent to his aid upon this i rode upon the field but found myself compelled to

made it almost impregnable directly in front of the cliff separated from it by a deep gorge was a low level field of about eight hundred acres this field was partly covered with a heavy crop of oats which together with a rank natural growth of broomsedge afforded concealment to mcclellans sharpshooters and lines of skirmishers the confederates in order to make an attack upon the stronghold on which mcclellan stood at bay were obliged to advance over this field a distance of about six hundred yards in direct line of approach the cliff was defended by three tiers of field artillery and a heavy infantry support the battle was fought june 27 1862 it was the turningpoint of the seven days battles around richmond for months on to richmond had been the warcry of the federals no event of the memorable campaign which had followed that ****** was more important in its results than this desperate conflict picketts brigade was ordered to the front and formed in line of battle just under the brow of the hill on the edge of the field with its luxuriant covering of oats and sedge kempers brigade was stationed near picketts jacksons column was supposed to be somewhere on the left though as yet nothing had been heard from him he having been delayed by the obstructions which the federals in passing had taken the precaution to put in his way lee had given a general order to make an attack in front upon hearing jacksons musketry open upon the enemy the federal forces were under command of general fitz john porter and extended over two miles from the chickahominy to cold harbor upon the dominant points of the field he had posted sixty cannon near the noon hour the battle in all its fury was on the hills trembled under the roar of one hundred and twenty pieces of artillery

away troops from the right near sunset lee sent word to longstreet that all other efforts had failed and unless he could do something the day was lost whereupon pickett and anderson were ordered to assault and kemper was called as reserve whiting having lost his commander jackson asked to be put into battle and was placed with his and hoods brigades on the left of pickett and anderson pickett directed withers colonel of the eighteenth regiment to throw out a line of skirmishers to feel the enemy pickett had noticed that on the right of his line partially concealed in a clump of trees was a force of the federals he at once detached the eighth and eighteenth regiments from the right of his line and advanced with them in person to rout them from that point at this time there was no appearance or sign of the enemy in his front as pickett moved out of cover with the two regiments commanded respectively by eppa hunton and robert e withers the sudden puffs of smoke and simultaneous sharp *********** from the field of oats and sedge revealed to him that the enemy were not only concealed there but were watching and were cognizant of his every movement pickett had temporarily

pickett had but just crossed over when major ******* longstreets adjutantgeneral brought the order to advance the nineteenth regiment commanded by colonel strange was now on the right being the center

enemys works in the teeth of a tempest of deathdealing projectiles of every description across this field of oats and sedge pickett simultaneously moved down with the other two regiments from the extreme right the five regiments were again united in the center of the field and charged in full line of battle brigade front pickett leading his men and cheering them on the skirmish line was soon driven in the fire from the federal batteries and small arms was something terrific the brigade pushed on on through a continuous rain of shot and the roar of guns whiting says the enemy concealed in the woods and protected by the ravine poured a destructive fire upon the advancing line for a quarter of a mile and many brave officers and men fell near the crest in front of us and lying down appeared the fragments of a brigade men were skulking from the front in a shameful manner the woods on our left and rear were full of troops in safe cover from which they never stirred but on the right of the third a brigade picketts was moving manfully up still further on the extreme right our troops appeared to be falling back colonel robert e withers commanding the eighteenth regiment and colonel peyton slaughter leading the fiftysixth were shot down both mortally wounded it was alleged at the time though their lives were spared it was their last battle they were too badly wounded ever to return to the service so terrific was the fusillade so incessant so concentrated and at such close range that the escape of any one of them seemed miraculous once the brave old brigade wavered under the heavy fire upon its shattered depleted ranks it was just before they reached the deep ravine and then only for a moment for at this crisis r h anderson came up with his brave south carolina brigade with the rebel yell mingling with the deathsounds and echoing and reverberating these two brigades picketts and andersons rushed together into the ravine and charged the death dealing

was repelled the check had given the artillery time to open a fire which for a time made gaps in the lines of the assailants the gunners however soon abandoned their guns and fled leaving twentytwo

the scene from an adjacent height said that never on any battlefield was there witnessed a more gallant action or a more glorious sight he not only made special mention of general pickett paying him the highest encomiums but wrote him a most appreciative personal letter which i hold as a legacy for the george e picketts of the future in whitings report he says in the meantime my division steadily

could probably never be a sadder commentary on the horrors of warfare than the true history of the retreat of mcclellans army to the protection of the gunboats on the james river if any mind possessed of a germ of humanity could realize the terrors of that death march it would never again be able to contemplate the possibility of war without a shudder of revulsion all the ambulances which could be

richmond every hospital was filled with our wounded and two hundred unfortunate sufferers taken by colonel estvan into the city were in the first moments of confusion and dismay obliged to be sheltered in an open warehouse until such time as the friendly doors of the private homes could be opened to supplement the overcrowded hospitals as soon however as the good people of richmond realized the sad condition of these brave men who in defense of the beautiful homes in the capital city had suffered hunger thirst heat and faced death in its most fearful form they were unsparing in their efforts to alleviate their miseries and to give them every comfort within their power this fight the battle of gainess mill was altogether decisive of mcclellans change of base the loss was heavy and nothing but the courage and valor of pickett and anderson and their brave virginians and south carolinians could have won the fight hoods gallant texas brigade distinguished themselves upon the right flank of mcclellans position but they did not pass over the bloody field that attack in front at gainess mill was made by george e *********** r h andersons brigades alone general longstreet in a letter to general robert e lee written a year after the close of the war says of this battle general pickett was severely wounded and was kept out of the field until september of that year when he joined his brigade at martinsburg virginia though even then he was unable to wear the sleeve of his coat upon that arm immediately upon his return to the field general pickett was assigned to the command of a division and on the loth of october 1862 was promoted majorgeneral general picketts severe wound necessarily obliging him to leave the field after the battle of gainess mill june 27 1862 the command of picketts brigade devolved for a few days upon colonel eppa hunton of the eighth regiment in spite of his ill health at that time on the 30th of june the battle of fraziers farm glendale was fought it began with an artillery duel between jackson and franklin during the progress of which longstreets division was drawn up in line of battle waiting for jackson to cross the white oak swamp and for huger to come up along the charles city road jackson not being able to cross the swamp and huger being detained down the road by slocums battery they did not reach the field as expected hearing the sound of cannon toward the charles city road longstreet supposed that huger was approaching and returned the supposed signal this drew fire from the federal batteries which barely missed president davis who had come upon the field to consult with his generals as the president was not prepared to take an active part in the fight he was carried off with all possible speed to a place of safety colonel jenkins with his battalion of sharpshooters being nearest the impetuous battery was ordered to silence it as halfway measures did not lie within the possibilities of the dashing jenkins he charged upon and captured the offending battery and the battle was opened picketts brigade under command of hunton was brought up in line of battle where it was exposed to a furious cannonade hunton becoming separated from his command because of exhaustion consequent upon his feeble condition colonel john b strange of the nineteenth virginia took command and under his leadership the brigade charged upon and captured a battery which was afterward turned with good effect upon its former owners longstreet had been sustaining the attack of mccall sedgwick kearny slocum and hooker in the expectation that huger would attack the federal right and jackson come up in the rear while hill was to bring fresh troops in support as neither jackson nor huger appeared hill was called to relieve longstreet and together they held the ground until night came to close the contest mccall endeavored to recover his lost ground but was separated from his command in the dusk and was captured by the fortyseventh virginia regiment led by colonel robert mayo longstreet says of this general he was more tenacious of his battle than any one who came within my experience during the war if i except d h hill at sharpsburg the next day meeting surgeon ***** of mccalls division who had remained upon the field to tend the wounded longstreet said well mccall is safe in richmond and if his division had not offered the stubborn resistance it did on this road we would have captured your whole army never mind we will do it yet it was in this fight at fraziers farm three days after the battle of gainess mill in which general pickett had been wounded that his only brother his plucky fearless assistant adjutantgeneral major charles pickett was almost fatally wounded though major pickett narrowly escaped death and reported for duty at a period far in advance of the expectation of the most sanguine of those who knew of his terrible wound he was made lame for life major pickett and captain w stuart symington aide decamp volunteered on huntons staff for the finish of the seven days fight notwithstanding picketts order that both should report to him in richmond as members of his personal staff which order they disobeyed captain symington was the only officer who went into the battle mounted his horse was shot seven times and finally killed under him for his brave and meritorious action in this battle at fraziers farm major charles pickett received not only the highest praise from his comrades but favorable official mention from his ranking officers in his report of the battle colonel strange says the battle the little major fought down at fraziers farm the soldiers called it at the time and they still cherish in their hearts the glorious memory of that brilliant fight major pickett was the best loved officer in the brigade and every soldier there would willingly have followed him to death happily the major did not die under the flag he so loved that death would have been welcome if sheltered by its folds he yet lives to gladden the hearts of his comrades by the touch of his friendly hand and the sound of the voice which cheered them on to valiant deeds in the old heroic days at the battle of malvern hill picketts brigade with the rest of longstreets corps was held in reserve this was the last of the seven days battles which had resulted as general lee in his return of thanks to his army july 7 expressed it in the relief of richmond from a state of siege the rout of the great army that so long menaced its safety the taking of many thousand prisoners including officers of high rank the capture or destruction of stores to the value of millions and the acquisition of thousands of arms and forty pieces of superior artillery some one has said that the first battle of bull run gave such great satisfaction to the audience that an encore was demanded the federal government prepared for a successful repetition of the piece as first presented by assigning general pope to the command of the newly formed army of virginia thereby securing his services as leading man and appointing halleck generalinchief of the federal armies thus making him stagemanager these preliminary arrangements were completed in the latter part of june and near the close of august the curtain rose upon the second presentation of that martial drama on the 22d of august the dashing stuart effected his bold ride around the lines of pope and secured the papers which revealed to lee the intended movements of his opponent and lees line of march was modified in accordance with that information he divided his army and sent part of it under jackson to cut off pope from washington picketts brigade under the leadership of eppa hun ton was a part of longstreets corps which held waterloo bridge against pope while jackson crossed the rap pahannock having safely passed the river jackson among the articles taken from popes tent was a sword belonging

near salem and on the next day passed the bull run mountains through thoroughfare gap and in the evening was at bristoe station between pope and the federal capital with him were the cavalry brigades of robertson and fitzhugh lee led by j e b stuart from here he sent a detachment to capture supplies at manassas junction taking possession of a large number of prisoners horses and tents and great quantities of stores all the supplies which could not be used were burned a force which was sent to recapture them was repulsed and their leader general taylor mortally wounded jackson went on to manassas junction and left ewells division with the fifth virginia cavalry at bristoe station where they repelled a federal attack new troops arriving it became evident that pope had learned the situation and had directed his whole force against jackson ewell then drew back and rejoined jackson at manassas junction and they withdrew west of the warrenton and alexandria turnpike to unite with the approaching force of longstreet on the 28th the divisions of hill ewell and taliaferro halted near the old battlefield of bull run the federals moving down toward alexandria were attacked by jackson and driven back among the wounded were majorgeneral ewell who lost a leg and brigadier general taliaferro longstreet had followed on after jackson being detained upon the way by demonstrations of federal cavalry he having no cavalry with which to reconnoiter when he reached thoroughfare gap he found it strongly defended and was forced to fight his way through at ten oclock the next morning the federal artillery opened upon jacksons right the design being to destroy him before the arrival of longstreet when that officer reached the field he was placed on the right of jackson picketts brigade was on longstreets right with the remainder of kempers division it was one of the brigades supporting the advance of hood and evans which resulted in the victory for that day a piece of artillery several regimental standards and a number of prisoners being taken the morning of the 30th was given to a heavy artillery combat between colonel s d lee and the federal artillery in which colonel lee was as successful as he had been on the previous day in the afternoon picketts brigade was a part of the force which received and repelled the onset of fitz john porter in the magnificent charge which finally cleared the field and won victory for the confederate arms picketts men proved their valor as loyally as they had done when they followed their own leader who was faraway his gallant soul chafing under the sad necessity which kept him off the field lee again sent jackson to secure a position between pope and the capital but pope having foreseen this movement fell back to chantilly where he was attacked by jackson on the 1st of september here the federal army lost the brilliant general philip kearny who rode within the confederate lines and was shot in attempting to escape kearny had been a ******** ******** in algeria where his bravery won for him the cross of the legion of honor he had lost an arm at the siege of mexico he had fought with the french army in the battles of magenta and solferino and had again received from emperor napoleon iii the decoration of the legion of honor he was an old comrade of lee in the united states army and the day after the battle the confederate leader sent his body under a flag of truce to general pope thinking as he said in a kind note that it might be a consolation to his family thus is the battlefield sometimes glorified by the gentleness of the truly chivalrous heart general lee having won the second battle of manassas pushed on into maryland with his whole army arriving at frederick city on the 8th of september the next day he issued order no 191 afterward known as the lost order this order directed jackson to go through sharpsburg cross the potomac capture martinsburg and help take harpers ferry longstreet was to remain at boonsboro with the trains mclaws was to station his command on the heights of harpers ferry and capture the force in the town assisted by walker and guarded in the rear by d h hill after these movements had been effected the commands were to meet again at boonsboro or hagerstown this was a welllaid plan and lee had carefully prepared the order for the guidance of his own generals and not for the instruction of the federal commander a copy was sent from headquarters to d h hill who having been transferred to jacksons command received his order from the hand of his new chief the copy which was intended for him served the useful purpose of a cigar wrapper until it chanced to be left behind in camp where it was found by a prowling federal soldier on the morning of september 13th it was placed in the hands of mcclellan and in the afternoon he was on the way to the pass in south mountain on the boonsboro and fredericksburg road franklins corps was ordered to pass through ***** tons gap and attack mclaws thereby relieving harpers ferry while burnside with the commands of reno and hooker were sent to turners gap the second of the two principal roads through the south mountain a northern writer has said of this movement that it was quick for mcclellan but not quite quick enough for the emergency he did not reach the passes until the morning of the 14th when jackson was already knocking vigorously at the gates of harpers ferry supported on the right by walker and on the left by mclaws and r h anderson having sent a p hill with his division to martinsburg lee had learned of mcclellans movement and had ordered hill to guard turners gap supported by longstreet who was recalled from hagerstown for the purpose on the long hot march longstreet had lost half his number from exhaustion picketts brigade led by general garnett had been marched and countermarched under conflicting orders until after twentythree miles of wearisome effort it reached the battle exhausted having lost heavily on the way it took position under a heavy fire of artillery which opened upon it as soon as it came in sight upon gaining its post it was immediately attacked by a force many times as great as its own under the fierce assault the left fell back the right being unsupported was forced to retire when the contest was renewed in the rear but the darkness prevented objects from being *************** as jenkins advanced to the attack garnett was ordered to bring off his brigade he had been in command only a few days in his report garnett says we have to mourn in this

their removal to sharpsburg the battle was lost but the delay suffered by mcclellan in winning it had enabled jackson to take possession of harpers ferry at noon of the next day lee received the following note from jackson through gods blessing harpers ferry and its garrison are to be surrendered at that moment lee resolved to stand and meet the enemy at sharpsburg had lee made a battlefield

longstreet when picketts brigade led by garnett reached the field it was posted under a heavy fire on the southeast of sharpsburg in a hollow at the rear of the washington artillery to support some batteries here it was for some hours exposed to a severe fire of shot and shell losing a number of its men mcclellans advance was delayed by a meeting with fitzhugh lees cavalry when he reached the

with the first corps was on the right at two oclock hooker crossed the creek at williamsport bridge and attacked longstreets left brigades as he advanced to the charge his muskets flashing brilliantly in the last rays of the sun he was received and repelled by hood and the batteries of s d lee when the crossing of hooker was reported to general lee he sent jackson to command the entire battle of the left wing at the east wood hookers skirmishers met mclaws veterans and were driven back to the edge of the wood as they retired the curtain of night fell slowly over the scene and the soft rain descended as if nature with gentle hand would wash away the stains of war the 17th of september 1862 makes its crimson mark upon the page of history as the bloodiest day yet of the long struggle between north and south of the conflict which raged on the banks of the antietam on that gloomy day mcclellan telegraphed to halleck we are in the midst of the most terrible battle of the war perhaps of history the little stream of antietam ********** ******** between its grassgrown banks started to sudden life with the tide of brave hot blood which flowed into it and went rushing on its way to the sea as impetuously as if the blood of north and south were even yet waging tempestuous warfare in the night mcclellan had ordered mansfield to cross by the upper bridge to support hookers attack upon jackson at early dawn the assault was made assisted by doubleday who swept down the hagerstown turnpike and struck the center of jacksons division across the river to and fro the guns hurled their deadly missiles and space was filled with flying balls and fragments of shell and heavy clouds of smoke and the air was shivered with the thunderous reports jones who led the stonewall division was wounded and the command devolved upon starke who in a short time was killed grigsby sprang to the command rallied the men and dashed upon doubleday who retreated the federal lines were several times repulsed but were heavily reinforced and flung themselves so impetuously upon jackson that his forces fell back and took a strong post in the rear the cornfield which had been so beautiful in the september sun shook under the fearful storm that swept over it and its promise of golden harvest went down forever under the rush of murderous feet lawton leading ewells division was wounded and most of the fieldofficers were killed or wounded as lawton was carried off the field hoods brigades came dashing up from the church leaving their ********** breakfast to the tender mercies of the campfire at the same time three of d h hills brigades came through the confederate center and attacked ricketts before this onslaught hooker retreated to the protection of his guns leaving about onefourth of his men on the field mansfield led out his two divisions in an effort to regain the ground which hooker had lost the battle in the corn raged anew and mansfield went to swell the roll of the fallen early who had taken the place of the wounded lawton held the position left vacant by jacksons division which had been withdrawn at seven oclock hood who had returned to the field joined with early and held the ground under a heavy fire of a force far greater than their own at half past eight sumner crossed the antietam and entered east wood followed by sedgwick as he turned with his six thousand toward the west wood he was met by a storm of shells from stuarts guns and a shower of canister from jacksons batteries behind the ledges of rock stood grigsby and his three hundred and from their points of vantage they held sumner in check until his way to destruction was prepared hoods division had been shattered but mclaws had reached the field and with anderson and walker came to the support of grigsby and early and sumner was swept away in a storm of fire this was followed by a heavy attack on the center which was hurled back by g b anderson and rodes of d h hills division and part of walkers command with a few pieces of artillery frenchs brigades took refuge behind the crest of a hill from which they kept up a desultory fire an attack by richardson was then repulsed through mistake rodess brigade was withdrawn from position and the federals took advantage of the gap thus formed to break through g b andersons line anderson being mortally wounded general r h anderson and general wright were also wounded and taken from the field the object of all this display by hooker was to enable burnside to effect a crossing at the rohrersville turnpike over the bridge since known as burnsides bridge opposite the right wing of longstreet the western end of this bridge was held by toombs with three georgia regiments and one of jenkinss south carolina regiments supported by batteries stationed among the trees upon this bridge sturgis led a bayonet charge supported by a heavy cannonade but was forced to retreat by the concentrated fire of longstreets gun and the rifles there were just six hundred of toombss gallant riflemen brave as the dashing six hundred who have charged down the highway of history ever since balaklava and four times they sent the storming party back across the east end of the bridge there was a sheltered ford below the bridge and rodmans division made a doublequick charge across it and reached the west bank this rendered the position at the bridge untenable and a little later burnsides corps crossed the bridge and climbed the heights attacking longstreet and driving back the brigades of drayton kemper and garnett picketts brigade joness division broke and retreated to sharpsburg burnside had been successful against longstreet but a p hill came upon the field with three thousand four hundred men ready to descend upon burnsides brigades notwithstanding a march of seven hours in which time they had made seventeen miles a flood of fire poured from the batteries on the height and the federals retreated to their guns on the other side of the antietam when night brought silence to this terrible field of the civil war mcintoshs battery taken when a p hill first arrived upon the scene had been regained and the ground lost by longstreet had been recovered when picketts brigade had been for some hours in rear of the artillery it was ordered forward to the crest of the hill to dislodge the federal skirmishers and protect the artillery eastward shortly after s d lees battalion took the place of the washington artillery and the fifty sixth regiment under captain ******* colonel william d stuart being ill was sent back to protect the movement when burnside crossed the river the brigade again took position in front in a cornfield the fiftysixth regiment being recalled to the left wing of the main body here it opened fire on a large number of skirmishers and drove them back from the woods of antietam a moving wall of bayonets bore down upon the little band only two hundred of the gallant virginians were left but with two rifled pieces they bravely held their ground after an hour of heavy work the right began to yield a number of federal flags were seen upon a hill in rear of sharpsburg the only

apparently because both sides were too much exhausted to go on lee had gained advantages of position and mcclellan had lost very many men who would have been saved but for his sending his army out in detachments to be killed in detail instead of subjecting lees army to that process as he had previously claimed that he would do he had held back all his reserves he and porter agreeing in the opinion that reserves are articles of luxury not to be utilized in the practical affairs of life if the battle was indecisive from a military point of view it had political significance of great importance

celebrated stonewall brigade when the ammunition was exhausted at the battle of kernstown garnett retired his brigade thereby incurring the displeasure of jackson who claimed that but for garnetts action he could have won the battle the offending officer was arrested and temporarily relieved from duty the sensitive mind of the brave general who was as courageous on the field as he was honorable in the performance of all the duties of a soldiers life never recovered from what he regarded as a stigma upon his military reputation this feeling was probably at least in part the cause of his insisting upon leading his brigade at gettysburg when he was so ill as to be scarcely able to sit upon his horse his magnanimity is attested by the fact that no more sincere a mourner followed the great leader stonewall to his untimely grave than the man in whose heart still rankled the wound which would be healed only when the gallant soul had passed into that higher phase of life where all the hurts of this narrow existence pass away garnett commanded picketts brigade in the absence of its leader while wounded and when pickett was promoted to the command of a division the brigade was placed permanently under garnett who led it with distinguished success winning the respect and affection of officers and men it was at the head of this grand old brigade that he rode down into the

that rigid institution as to result in the smashing of jubal earlys head with a plate although it is not the avowed intention of that conservatory of war to repress the heroic soul yet in this particular case it was deemed best that the belligerent instincts should be permitted to develop in a less restricted atmosphere and so the scholastic career of the future confederate leader was suddenly terminated in 1839 armistead was appointed secondlieutenant in the sixth regiment of infantry then in general zachary taylors command he served in the florida war under his father general w k

armistead held the line of battle in the wood which secured the field and after bringing on the action in the most gallant manner by repulsing an attack of a heavy body of the enemys skirmishers skilfully lent support to the contending troops in front when it was required it was at the head of this brigade that he stormed up the deadly slope of cemetery hill broke the union lines and with his

of the change the southern leaders were of the opinion that the removal of mcclellan was fortunate for their cause the army of the potomac through all its disastrous career had never lost faith in little mac as it fondly called him if securing and retaining the confidence of his men is a proof of military ability no american leader had ever been more fitted for his responsible position than was

with the intention of crossing the rap pahannock near fredericksburg and securing a position between lees army and richmond designing to cut off communication and prevent the southern army from gaining access to their capital on the 15th he began to put this plan into operation attempting to conceal it by a demonstration on gordonsville lee was not thus to be deluded and on the same day the

of howards division the confederate commander general cobb was killed at the same time general cooke was seriously wounded ransoms brigade came to the relief of cookes mclaws sent kershaw to the assistance of cobbs troops pickett and the troops posted at the south angle of maryes hill were keeping up a lively fire with sturgis and getty who were also subjected to a crossfire from hood and mclaws the battle which had been practically won weeks before when longstreet first posted his men on maryes hill was now dedicated to the confederates by a chrism of fire but burnside would not believe it from beyond the river he viewed the contest ignorant of the ground knowing nothing of the insurmountable obstacles to a successful attack on the height and unwilling to believe what was told him by those who had survived the attempt saying to hooker that crest must be carried tonight hooker knew that it was impossible and hancock french and the other officers including the fiery sumner agreed with him but burnside had determined upon another assault and was immovable for the first time in his military career ********* joe was averse to living up to the ********** which he had won by gallant deeds on the field resolved upon saving his men if possible and at least throwing off the responsibility for their sacrifice he adopted the strong measure of making a personal appeal to the commander of the army of the potomac pleasanton saw him ride up on his white steed and said that when hooker dismounted he was the maddest man he ever saw he made the air blue with adjectives burnside bent upon selfdestruction would not yield and hooker went back with the old order ringing in his ears that crest must be carried tonight in the *********** shadows of the night hooker began a fire of artillery hoping as he said to make a hole sufficiently large for a forlorn hope to enter with no more impression than if it had been made against a mountain of rock the confederate artillery on the crest had ceased firing through failure of ammunition at sunset humphreys with four thousand men pushed onward ignorant of the sunken road before him where a line of infantry four deep was ranged protected from view and from attack by the ********** road a short distance from this road the union column fell before a solid sheet of flame and bullets that burst forth from the confederate front and there before maryes hill were piled the union dead and wounded hooker ******** with grim sarcasm finding that i had lost as many men as my orders required i suspended the attack in making this assault hooker knew that he was ********* one of napoleons most important rules of warfare never do anything which the enemy wishes you to do as in addition to having learned lees wishes by a sad experience he burnside and sumner had all been informed that morning of the desire of lee in regard to the attack being under orders he could do nothing but push on it had taken burnside less than ninety days to plan and lose the battle of fredericksburg to efface the glory of his own military career and to project a yet further assault upon the victorious confederates which would have resulted in a demoralization of the army of the potomac from which it would probably never have recovered fortunately for him and the north the strong opposition of his generals prevented his carrying into effect this crowning blunder which he had carefully planned for the 14th longstreet has said they fully expected burnside would renew the battle the next day they knew that another day would nearly ruin the army of the potomac if burnside would attack such a strongly fortified position it was reasonable to suppose that he would repeat his folly the next day this would seem to indicate that lee and his generals had a realizing sense of the military acumen of their adversary lee himself was too astute to leave his strong position and descend to the open plain to attack upon a level a beaten foe who might suddenly change from conquered to conqueror so the two armies watched each other in sullen silence until the night of the 15th when the army of the potomac recrossed the ********* of war in leash picketts division was composed of garnetts **** steads kempers and corses virginia brigades and jenkinss formerly r h andersons south carolina brigade the division as a division was on a field of battle for the first time december 13 1862 at the battle of fredericksburg where it held in reserve the center of longstreets corps and though it was eager and impatient to be allowed to take part in the fight it was never fully reached general longstreet gave instructions to his division commanders pickett and hood simply to hold their ground in defense unless they should see an opportunity to attack the enemy while engaged with a p hill on the right pickett saw this opportunity when franklins column advanced on the extreme right just a little beyond their front thus leaving the enemys flank open and pointing it out to hood suggested that it was the opportune time and that they should at once turn their forces upon franklins column in the open field through which they were forced to pass general pickett in person made the suggestion to hood pointing out the advantages of the movement and the eagerness of the men in leash to be allowed to take apart and urged that they should avail themselves of the optional privileges of the directions left them by longstreet hood perfectly agreed with pickett as to the ************* and advantages of the attack but being more cautious and chary of assuming responsibility than pickett insisted upon first sending a brief of their intentions to general longstreet who was with general lee in another part of the field watching the progress of the battle asking him if in the detailed circumstances they should not at once push in with their divisions any delay at such a moment was of course disastrous and before the assent of general longstreet was obtained and the order given the opportunity was lost the strength of the division at the time of its formation was about nine thousand though only a part of one brigade of the division kempers was actively engaged in this their first battle as a division the battle of fredericksburg the casualties of the battle as a division were of course trifling but enough alas to make many a heart ache many a hearthstone desolate about forty seven wounded dead and dying were found near the stone fence at maryes hill the fearless federal commander burnside was bold determined and fierce in his attack and had he been drawn still deeper into the toils which had been set for him on this field of battle by our general lee it is more than probable that his whole army would have been destroyed general lees position was so strongly and so thoroughly protected that general burnsides attack was repulsed with great loss at every point only a portion of lees first line near hamiltons crossing was driven back by franklins daring assault upon it but even that ground lee at once recovered picketts division remained bivouacked in the rear ********* the rappahannock river below fredericksburg then it was removed to the left to meet burnsides attempted crossing at bankss ford in the early part of february 1863 it started out on longstreets expedition to suffolk virginia and north carolina marching to richmond and thence to the breastworks around petersburg where it made but a short stay and then pushed ahead to further the end conceived by the wise practical brain and great tender heart of old peter their stern but humane commander to procure food for his men it was hard winter weather cold inclement and trying and during their continued march of ten days the ground was covered with sleet and snow hundreds of the men were without shoes blankets or hats many were shod with improvised ********* of raw ******** the wives mothers sisters and friends of picketts men could scarcely have recognized in these ********** muddy ragged men the trim dainty *********** whom they had sent out from their homes to win fame and glory two years before dressed then in their new uniforms with shining equipments with knapsacks and haversacks well stuffed by loving hands and almost every man taking with him cook and valet they had won fame and glory beyond the most sanguine conception and that they were heroes and warriors showed in their ********* and endurance in the moral firmness with which without halt or straggling they passed through richmond and all along the lines of their homes receiving the cheers and hurried greetings of their many relatives and friends whom they had not seen for months and might never see again even now they could give to those dear ones only a fleeting recognition from the ranks a passing smile of grateful thanks for the loving note the flower or the piece of bread and meat which was hastily thrust into their hands as tramp tramp tramp they marched away once again from home and friends knowing the needs of his men and having their comfort at heart longstreet called to mind that ******** the prince and prototype of the military bohemian assigned the highest place in the soldiers scale to rations when proof beyond peradventure was brought to him that stored away in the northeastern counties of north carolina were large quantities of corn and bacon he may have remembered the lean and hungry cassius he may have surmised that the record of history to the contrary notwithstanding the romans conquered the world because they were generous ******* that napoleon lost waterloo because of an empty aching stomach that the rice of the ******* and the potato of the irish could not fight against roast beef longstreet determined that if it was possible he would procure for his ******* confederates these tempting provisions after mature deliberation he planned to make a strong demonstration against suffolk virginia and at the same time to send troops into north carolina and wagontrains to procure and bring out these coveted supplies even though the price should be blood with that end in view picketts and hoods divisions of longstreets corps had been detached from the army of northern virginia leaving mclawss division also of his corps behind at fredericksburg with general lee hoods division and jenkinss brigade of picketts division went to suffolk direct armisteads and corses brigades of picketts division went via the james river and the line of the norfolk and petersburg railroad toward suffolk bearings artillery which was attached to picketts division and all the available artillery around and about petersburg were sent to suffolk direct garnetts and kempers brigades went on separate expeditions into eastern north carolina suffolk a small town established by law in #### was burned by order of sir henry clinton in #### it is on a line of railroad and is about eighteen miles from norfolk and eightyfive from richmond it has a considerable share of the commerce of north carolina all of that section of the country was in quiet possession of the federal forces at the time of longstreets expedition and had been since the capture of roanoke island by the federals and the abandonment of norfolk and suffolk by the confederates the confederate lines extended only to the blackwater river on the east where a small body of confederate troops was stationed to keep the federal force in check longstreets *********** maneuver was a great success and benefaction to the country and was accomplished thus in march 1863 he threatened suffolk in front and kept its garrison so successfully within their own strong works almost without any material opposition that he took out and carried off wagontrain after wagontrain of corn and bacon there was no distinct battle fought and no prolonged engagement during this foraging expedition though all through the entire period there was a great deal of heavy skirmishing and frequent ******* from time to time were made by the federal force from suffolk but they were always driven back with heavy loss the price of the bacon and corn for the gray was the blood of the blue and the gray yet who can say that it was under the circumstances unnecessarily high there are many functions of civilized life which can be postponed to more convenient occasions but dining is not one of them if it be true that the soul of man as some philosophers assert is located in the stomach how few will be lost through the voluntary neglect of this tabernacle of the holy ghost the confederate loss in officers and men was considerable but the saddest loss saddest because it seemed so unnecessary was the loss of the fauquier artillery striblings battery attached to picketts division the battery had been detached by the order of general french commander of artillery and placed in an old earthwork on the nansemond river far in advance of our lines situated on a point of land unprotected in the rear the battery was supported only by two small companies of infantry two gunboats of the federals attempted to run by this battery one of which was sunk and the other driven away the federals made no other attempt to pass but for two days and nights kept up a heavy and incessant fire from their gunboats and land batteries under cover of this fire they landed three of their regiments in the rear of the isolated and indefensible position after a fierce resistance the gallant little confederate band cut off and overwhelmed ******* hand to hand at the guns were all either killed or made prisoners except the drivers with the battery horses under lieutenant carroll who being some distance in the rear managed to make their escape the battery was one of the finest in the service having been captured by us from the federals it consisted of five magnificent guns three brass napoleons and two twentyfour pound howitzers all of which were recaptured captain stribling was in no way responsible for the sacrifice of his men or the loss of his battery he simply obeyed the orders of his commander general french on the 4th of may general longstreet the old warhorse of the confederacy or old peter as he was more commonly called having successfully accomplished the object of his maneuver and secured quantities of meat and grain even beyond his most sanguine expectations quietly withdrew his whole force from suffolk so stealthily was this done that our soldiers were across blackwater river before the federal troops were aware that we had gone hoods division was hurried on from blackwater river by rail to rejoin lees army who had just gained a victory at chancellorsville picketts division had orders to follow when information was brought that raiding cavalry was passing down the south side of james river en route to suffolk and a peremptory order came to pickett to proceed by the jerusalem plank road to petersburg with three brigades of his division and intercept the riders with that end in view the division with the exception of jenkinss brigade which much against general ************ was left on the blackwater river marched to peters burg the report was false there was no cavalry raid picketts division without jenkinss brigade marched through petersburg and on to richmond to rejoin the army of northern virginia at culpeper courthouse on the 1st of june 1863 after four months of hardship marching all the way going and coming three brigades of picketts division were on nearly the same ground they had left in the winter almost immediately afterward they started on that disastrous pennsylvania *********** military star of the federal commander burnside had gone down in the sea of

intolerably ********** the subordinate generals were severe in their criticisms of the new commander and assisted in ********* the growing discontent some of them represented the condition in its most discouraging view to the president in washington general burnside was absorbed in plans for regaining the confidence of the army and of his chiefs in washington he formed a design for crossing the river below fredericksburg sending the cavalry under ******* to the rapidan to cross at kellys ford and destroy communication between general lee and the confederate capital the objection to this plan was that it necessitated crossing in view of the southern army for lee could not be depended upon to keep his eyes shut while the movement was being effected on the 30th of december ******* with the cavalry was at kellys ford and the infantry was ready to move when burnside received an order from the president prohibiting him from taking any action without consulting him the commander offered his resignation which was not accepted he asked permission of the president either to resign or to move forward mr lincoln consented to the advance and burnside proceeded to put into operation a new plan which involved the passage of the river above fredericksburg and the surprise of lee who expected him to cross at a lower point in preparation for this movement sigels corps was appointed to guard falmouth and couch was to make a demonstration below fredericksburg to divert the attention of the confederates roads were constructed bankss ford above fredericksburg was selected as the point for crossing and on january 20 franklin and hooker bivouacked near that point bankss ford is a ford only in summer in january it must be crossed on bridges all of the 20th was spent in preparing for the passage had the movement begun three days earlier or had the good weather prevailed three days longer burnside might have had opportunity to fight down all the resentment which resulted from the battle of fredericksburg on the night of the 20th the rain began to flood the earth and by the 22d the army the artillery and wagons were ******* in the sticky paste which is produced by the combination of water and virginia soil burnside was still on the wrong side of the river while the storm afforded lee opportunity to range his army opposite in preparation to receive burnside if he should succeed in crossing and thus place himself between lees army and a river that was too swollen to be passed the confederate sharpshooters watching the movements of the army of the potomac as it endeavored to struggle through the mud called across the river to offer their services in assisting to build the bridges when the army of the potomac set out upon its disastrous expedition it destroyed many of the camps those which were left proved now a welcome shelter on the 22d the army retreated and on the 23d reached its former position and the famous mud march was ended on the 25th burnside at his own request was relieved of a command for which he had from the beginning felt himself unfitted and majorgeneral joseph hooker was assigned to the vacancy thus created sumner broken by age and infirmity was retired from active service and franklin was deprived of his command thus leaving hooker the senior general of this branch of the army fighting joe devoted himself with his usual energy to the reorganization and drill of his army president lincoln had written a private letter to the new commander which accompanied the order of appointment after commending him for his soldierly qualities and freedom from political intrigue and censuring him for his unfriendly criticisms of his predecessor he closes thus officers were required to have their absent men return a system of furloughs was established president lincoln granted amnesty to all deserters who returned by the first of april recruits began to come in the cavalry was placed under command of stoneman an able officer but not a great cavalry leader the dashing ardor of fighting joe infused new spirit into the army and won the confidence of all who love a dazzling warrior and who does not perhaps the most peaceable soul on earth is not dead to the thrill which a martial hero excites lincoln visited the army and reviewed the troops a northern writer has said that every visit he made to the army was equal to the addition of a new brigade as he left he gave hooker and couch this final warning i want to impress you two gentlemen in your next fight put in all your men we shall see how well the injunction was obeyed by the end of april hooker had what he called the finest army on the planet but it would not remain so long he must fight an early battle or lose the assistance of ******** regiments whose time would expire lee expected either that hooker would cross by the upper fords or that he would move against richmond longstreet laid out lines of defense for these fords and was then ordered with the divisions of hood and pickett and the artillery of bearing and henry to a point near petersburg to meet the possible movement on to richmond mclaws and r h anderson remained to finish the work in connection with the fords it was important to hooker that he attack lee in the absence of longstreet and his divisions lees cavalry was also much worn by its series of brilliant raids so dashing and successful that a northern writer has said in connection with them nothing that might be asserted of confederate audacity or federal imbecility is absolutely incredible lee was rapidly recruiting his army by conscription and by the return of sick and wounded who had sufficiently recovered to report for service d h hill was sent to north carolina and his division was placed under rodes early retained his command and trimble led jacksons old division in order to take advantage of every point in his favor hooker planned an attack upon chancellorsville a short distance from fredericksburg intending to cross the river by the two fords above the junction of the rapidan with the rappahannock these fords having been left unguarded the heavens seemed to be as strongly opposed to the progress of the new commander as they had been to that of his predecessor heavy rains delayed action until the 27th when the march began and on the 28th the passage across the river was effected by way of kellys ford on the rappahannock above the mouth of the rapidan twentyseven miles from fredericksburg by the eleventh and twelfth corps under howard and slocum and the fifth corps under meade the next day the rapidan was easily crossed and chancellorsville was reached on the 30th when couch crossed on a pontoon at the united states ford meanwhile the remainder of the army had crossed below fredericksburg on may i sickles arrived in chancellorsville so far the bold movement of hooker had succeeded when on the 30th of april 1863 the federal commander rode up to the one house which at that time constituted chancellorsville conscious of being followed by seventy thousand men he probably felt in every nerve his confident words i have lees army in one hand and richmond in the other he was to learn later that his birds were in the bush instead of in the hand with heartfelt satisfaction he announced to the army of the potomac that the enemy must either ingloriously fly or present himself where certain destruction awaits him general hooker was new to command and had the ************** of youth hooker seemed to have exhausted himself in the crossing he suddenly ceased to be fighting joe and became waiting joe his boasted ground upon which he had expressed his confident intention of devoting the confederates to destruction appeared to be well adapted to the purpose but he waited nearly twentyfour hours before proceeding to put his design into execution lee left early to hold the heights of fredericksburg against sedgwick and hastened the rest of his forces on to chancellorsville during the evening and midnight of the 30th on the morning of may i his cavalry met sykess division and a sharp skirmish followed lees cavalry skirmishers were repulsed but hooker instead of supporting his advanced columns ordered them to fall back to their old positions in spite of all remonstrance hooker insisted upon his order and the federals fell back thereby relinquishing the ground which hooker had in the beginning so proudly claimed as our ground and losing the battle of chancellorsville in advance the positions thus yielded were occupied by the confederates who placed their batteries on the ridges running in the direction of the federal lines and enfiladed the retreating troops night closed upon a field in which the confederates were well posted for offensive operations while hooker was very weakly fortified for defense in the morning lee kept up a fierce cannonading along his right and center to conceal the movements of stonewall jackson whom he sent with twentysix thousand men to attack the federal right to accomplish the movement required the careful effort of an entire day but it was successfully effected a little before six oclock in the afternoon when the federal troops on the right of the union line unconscious of danger had stacked their arms and were preparing their supper they were surprised by a sudden burst of jacksons men from the forest before which they fled in confusion suffering great loss in the rout jacksons movement had been observed early in the day and reported to hooker who imagined it to be a retreat wavering in this supposition at one time he sent a warning to slocum and howard on the right but it never reached them the surprise was complete hooker hurried up and ordered birneys division formerly his own to charge with the bayonet this movement resulted in checking the onset of jackson and forcing him into the woods commanding abandoned intrenchments where some federal guns were left unprotected in a moment the confederates would seize them and turn them upon their former ********** it was in front of these batteries though not through them that the darkest shadow which had yet fallen upon the southern cause lowered down into a starless night it was here that stonewall jackson fell shot down by the men who would have given their lives at any moment to save him on that moonlit evening in may when victory had perched upon the banner of the south when the heart of the confederacy thrilled with exultant hope he whom a northern writer has called that thunderbolt in war the leader whose presence meant victory the man from whose deep eyes flashed forth the *********** of triumph the soldier in whose voice rang the battlecry to which all southern hearts responded furled his flag and left the field forever as has been truly said by a northern historian it is doubtful whether all the advantages gained to the southern cause in the battle of chancellorsville were not dearly purchased by the loss of thomas jonathan jackson he died at ******* station virginia on the loth of may pleasanton having gained an aggressive position proceeded to fortify it arranging batteries and constructing roads across the marshy ground until he had so strengthened his position that he thought with the support of sickless infantry he could maintain himself against all lees army by unremitting efforts during the night of the 2d sickles succeeded in recovering a part of the ground and some of the guns which had been lost the day before but upon reporting to hooker was surprised by an order to fall back to chancellorsville thus the key of the military position was abandoned by the federals and the confederates seized it to unlock the door of success on the 3d thirty confederate guns were placed upon the point of vantage and covered as lees army was by thick woods which concealed it from the opposing force it was no difficult matter to hold at bay the disorganized federals who were unnerved by disaster and disabled by ignorance of the geography of the dense forest in which they could never know anything about the magnitude of the force they were to encounter sickles was attacked by the old corps of jackson now commanded by stuart the men crying out as they advanced remember jackson stuart was singing with gleeful appreciation old joe hooker come out of the wilderness sickless men fought as one of their officers said like devils but a flanking fire from the artillery on the ground which they had relinquished that morning by the order of the commanding general and a furious front attack by the confederate infantry caused them to retire to a line which they succeeded in holding to the end of the day the roads centering at chancellorsville passed under control of the confederates who pressed forward until stuart fighting the union right effected a junction with lees main army as the union forces fell back the confederate artillery was brought more into play and the chancellor house where hooker had his headquarters was soon under fire hooker was struck by a falling column and for a while was supposed to be dead much time was lost before he became conscious and his dazed condition for the rest of the day rendered him incapable of *********** direction sedgwick waited at fredericksburg until the night of the 2d when he received orders to destroy the confederate force and march at once to chancellorsville falling upon lees rear while hooker attacked him on the front to do this the heights of fredericksburg must be scaled early driven off and a march of eleven miles effected these arduous duties were so far accomplished as to bring him out upon the chancellorsville road in pursuit of barksdales mississippians with bankss ford in his rear affording him an opportunity of recrossing the river should it become necessary here he was met by mc laws sent by lee to stop sedgwicks progress sedgwick soon found that he must either avail himself of the opportunity of retreat furnished by the proximity of bankss ford or fight the whole army of northern virginia with no support from hooker whose despatches indicated a vacillation of mind which foreboded no good to any one whose safety depended upon prompt action by the commanderinchief lee no longer apprehensive of an attack from the main army was able to concentrate himself upon **** wick and reoccupying the heights of fredericksburg attacked him on the flank and during the night forced him across the river with a loss of five thousand men the next day the 5th passed quietly and in the evening hooker determined to recross a movement which he effected without molestation from the confederates the only obstacle to his withdrawal was a violent storm which flooded the river from the north side of the river on the 6th of may hooker issued a congratulatory order in which he claimed if not a victory technically speaking at least most of the advantages of one the south however and the army of the potomac the northern people and the administration at washington all united in regarding it as a defeat which further demoralized the army of the potomac and dispelled all illusions regarding fighting joe as a great military leader not quite a month had passed since lincoln had given his parting charge to the two commanders notwithstanding this injunction from one in whom common sense well took the place of strict military training over forty thousand men eager for the fray had been left inactive at no time since the lightnings of war had flashed their signal of terror across the continent had the cause of the south risen so high nor that of the north sunk so low as in the spring of 1863 the confederacy had reached its high tide from the beginning of the conflict the nations of europe had seized upon the opportunity of feeding fat the ancient ******* they bore the united states they saw in the new departure of the south the beginning of the fall of the republic and like vultures they hovered over the scene of the contest ready to swoop down when the carnage should be over and the field left quiet that the birds of prey

of the russian fleet near the coast of south america and the wellknown fact that russia would unite with any power on earth against her ancient foe england prevented the british government from accepting the overtures of napoleon iii to that end notwithstanding this obstacle the advocates of the confederacy in england lost no opportunity of indicating their desire for its success and their

efforts to plant himself so firmly upon american soil that he could never be uprooted he made his protestations of amity the cloak for every possible device against the administration party he strove to induce other powers to join him in plots against the north not from any friendship for the south but with the design as he expressed it to one of his ********** of restoring to the latin race on

disheartened and weakened the supporters of the north the measures of policy adopted by the administration had an almost equal effect in depressing northern sentiment the enthusiasm of volunteers in

but failed in his design of capturing supplies intended for the union forces and was cut off from his own army he left two brigades under robertson in the mountains with instructions it is said to

again overcome by a fatigue for which there could be no rest in the early dawn the federal commander inspected the position and placed his troops as they arrived slocum was posted on gulps hill the barb of the fishhook wadsworth at his left howard at the bend on cemetery hill protected by the stone walls at the foot of the hill and ********** guns at the crest when hancocks corps the second

placed behind round top as a reserve it held this position until the arrival of the sixth corps under sedgwick which had marched from manchester and was on the field at three oclock then the fifth

it reached across the baltimore road to the woodlands of rock creek and the ravines of wolfs hill at nine oclock meades army was posted and waiting for the attack as meade was inspecting his ground while aurora was yet ***** flirting with day over on the opposite ridge lee hill longstreet and hood were consulting in regard to preparations for the coming ordeal lee might retire into the passes of the mountains then meade would have to leave his strong position and go after him thus losing all he had gained and being unable to use to advantage the large reinforcements which had come to his aid this would look like a retreat and having fairly won the first day lee did not doubt his ability to win the second he might wait where he was for meades attack which would draw the army of the potomac from its stronghold and give lee the advantage of position but he could not stay long concentrated upon the hills for he had no store from which to gain supplies the advantage would be upon the side of the enemy moreover the soldiers full of the enthusiasm of success would not keep their martial fire through a period of waiting he must either draw meade from his strong position or attack him where he was he decided to take the latter course which was perhaps the more dangerous but it had the advantage of meeting the wishes of his soldiers upon whom retreat might have a demoralizing effect longstreet urged a movement around meades left lee rejected this plan and expressed his impatience to have longstreet begin his attack the enemy is here he said and if we do not whip him he will whip us general longstreet replied i never like to go into battle with one boot off and i would rather wait for pickett lee ordered longstreet to lead his corps into action along the emmitsburg road general lee then rode into gettysburg and to ewells headquarters when ewell should hear the sound of the attack upon the left he was to open on the right and the center was to fall into battle when

felt so strong in his position for defense that he supposed lee would also recognize his ************* and would decline to attack him in front confining his operations to a flank movement which would turn him out of his position he held a council of his **** commanders and with their approval directed butterfield to prepare a detailed order for the withdrawal of the troops if his apprehensions should be verified longstreets guns broke up the conference and called meade to the defense of his left sickles had left his troops in charge of birney and had gone to the council in meades headquarters when the roar of the cannon called the chiefs back to their posts meade followed sickles who was posted on ground that was low and commanded by an elevation in its front being therefore untenable he had applied for permission to occupy more elevated ground half or threequarters of a mile in front receiving no order and his outposts having been driven back he took the ground connecting with round top and hancock technically carrying out instructions this weakened his line and presented too great a front for so small a corps from the peachorchard it was refused to a wheatfield forming a deadly salient at the orchard which has since held a gruesome place in history as the bloody angle meade felt uncertain as to whether this ground could be held and sent for reinforcements sickles proposed to fall back but it was too late he was still further endangered by the removal of bufords cavalry from the left which had been ordered away by pleasanton the weak points of the line were covered as well as possible by the five batteries of the third corps and three others from the reserve artillery thirty pieces of cannon defended the orchard in the wheatfield were twelve howitzers a battery on devils den commanded the gorge of plum run and all the wooded slopes as far as the emmitsburg road lee was quick to detect his advantage and expected to reach the

oclock the artillery engagement began with appalling effect on both sides the tide of battle rolled on with frightful velocity and power toward the peachorchard and dashed upon the fatal angle open to attack upon two sides the artillery fire grew heavier and hood opened the fight to the east he perceived the importance of little round top hitherto left unguarded as a mere signal station and ordered

valor as they advanced toward cemetery hill there was seen in the open field to the right a long dark line of men half a mile distant and at right angles with their line they were coming at doublequick upon that unprotected right flank their muskets at right shoulder shift their banners fluttering in the breeze their burnished bayonets glistening in the sun the enemy were strengthening their position hurrying up reserves from right to left and from opposite directions doubling along the confederate front a heavy rain of shell and shrapnel poured down from the height in the fiery storm the thin ranks became yet thinner not an instants disorder prevailed but under the withering fire they marched steadily forward faster men faster we are almost there cried garnetts ******* voice above the roar of battle then he went down among the dead with the faith of a little child in his hero heart there was a muffled tread of armed men from behind then a rush of trampling feet and armisteads brigade from the rear closed up behind the front line their gallant leader with his hat on the point of his sword took garnetts place the division was now four ranks deep as often as the iron storm made gaps through it the cheer would come from private corporal sergeant lieutenant and captain alike close up close up and forward the lines shortened but never wavered never halted closer and closer they drew to the foe till there remained only a bleeding remnant now they broke forward into a doublequick while canister and grape whirred and whizzed through the air on on they rushed toward the stone wall where the federal batteries were pouring forth their deadly missiles a hundred yards away a flanking force came down on a run halted suddenly and fired into the line a deadly storm of musketry under this crossfire they reeled and staggered between falling comrades and the right came pressing down upon the center making the line at this point twenty to thirty deep a few unable to resist temptation without orders faced the enemy on their right though the latter were sixty to one the fighting was terrific muskets seemed to cross men fired to the right and to the front the fighting was handtohand the firing was into the enemys faces the federals in front fell behind their guns to let them ***** their grape and canister into the oncoming ranks piling up the dead and

marked the high tide of the confederacy a river formed of the noblest blood that ever flowed in american veins victory was within their grasp alas where were the promised supports worn and exhausted by the tension of the bloody fighting of the day before in which they had suffered terribly their leaders dead or wounded they had crumbled away under the deadly hail of the artillery fire back from the flaming crest fell only a remnant of the division which had performed such deeds of valor as made the whole world wonder the flags which floated a moment ago over cemetery hill lay on the ground among the prostrate forms of the men who had so bravely borne them to the very verge of victory of the five thousand who had followed where the flash of picketts sword lit the way to glorious victory or not less glorious defeat three thousand five hundred had gone down to the soldiers triumphant death to live forever in our hearts and on the *********** pages of their countrys history virginia is rich in the names of great warriors statesmen and leaders of men but the charge of this virginia division furnishes the most conspicuous proof in the history of the state that the rank and file of its citizen soldiery are the ***** of any troops on earth and the memory of this band of martyrs will be cherished in the hearts of her people forever and forever with such followers virginia will never be without great leaders it was fitting that in the descendants of the great sons of virginia who had led in all that had contributed to american grandeur this consummation of chivalrous manhood should be attained the battleflag of the confederacy had waved for a moment in triumph to droop forever around its staff to the south was left the bitter sense of loss the heartbreak of defeat she had left too a memory which is enshrined forever in the proudest and grandest niche of her temple of fame a glorified page of history to thrill the heart of the world while time lingers it is the page on which is inscribed the grandest charge known in all the long and proud record of martial history a charge which will live in song and story while the heart of man can throb responsive to immortal

roll through the halls of time and to ****** to actions of supernal glory heroes of coming ages picketts charge at gettysburg where were the guns when picketts men started on their grim march to death is a query which has been often made and to which colonel e p alexander is perhaps best fitted to give answer to this received following reply which is still in my possession i felt the responsibility very deeply for the day was rapidly advancing about twelve or a little later and whatever was to be done was to be done soon meanwhile i had been anxiously discussing the attack with general a b wright who said that the difficulty was not so much in reaching cemetery hill or taking it his brigade had carried it the afternoon before but that the trouble was to hold it for the whole federal army was mustered in a sort of horseshoe shape and could rapidly reinforce the point to any extent while our long enveloping line could not give prompt enough support this somewhat reassured me as i had heard it said that morning that general lee had ordered every brigade in the army to charge cemetery hill and it was at least certain that the question of supports had had his careful attention before answering i rode back to converse with general pickett whose line was now formed or forming in the wood and without telling him of the question i had to decide i found out that he was entirely sanguine of success in the charge and was only congratulating himself on ************** i was convinced that to make any halfway effort would ensure a failure of the campaign and that if our artillery fire was once opened after all the time consumed in preparation for the attack the only hope of success was to follow it up promptly with one extreme effort concentrating every energy we possessed into it and my mind was fully made up that if the artillery opened pickett must charge wrote to longstreet there have been many efforts to shift responsibility and to assign various causes to this repulse of the army of northern virginia but i can not find it in my heart nor do i think it reasonable to believe that any man or officer of that grand army led by the peerless lee did aught but what the most profound sense of duty and patriotism controlled by the emergencies which surrounded him suggested that he should do general imboden describing an interview with lee after the battle states that in a voice tremulous with emotion lee said after a moment he added in a tone almost of agony a report of the closing scene of the great battle was made by him who was best able to give the true story of picketts charge at gettysburg it was prepared from notes penciled on the backs of old letters on scraps of ************* on any fragment large enough to hold a sentence they were jotted down amid the dead faces bordering the line of retreat the groans of the wounded and dying all the fearful sights and sounds of that death march they are the memories of a man only a few days away from the most appalling crisis of his life this report was suppressed at the request of the commanderinchief weighed down by the responsibility of a great army lee shrank from adding to the difficulties of the position by any dissension which might be excited by a bare statement of facts in a kind and appreciative letter which has become a part of the published records of the war admitting the truth of the report he asked that it might be withdrawn adding after setting forth the reasons for his request the significant words we have the enemy to fight it was in a spirit of true patriotism that the leader of the army of northern virginia made this request those who knew him will remember that of all his many noble utterances none was more impressive than this duty is the grandest word in human language his duty was to the cause for which he fought and in the performance of that duty he asked that this thing might be done his wishes were respected then and through all the years that have passed since that time they have not been forgotten the most alluring temptations have not brought that report from the oblivion to which it was consigned in the faraway past the hand which penned those bloodstained notes reaching from the grave is as powerful as when it unsheathed the sword upon the field of battle and it draws across them still the mark of silence they are all our own they who went down in the ********** they who left the field with heavy hearts and reluctant steps longing to stay behind with their comrades who had passed beyond the conflict our tried and true our *********** may the soft veil of mercy and love enfold them forever the temperature of the summer of 1863 seemed to keep pace with the high tide of war the heat was so excessive that the schools were closed early the first week in june i was graduated from my alma mater i stopped in richmond for a few days en route to my home within the federal lines the day after i arrived i received a letter dated at culpeper courthouse june 13 full of faith in a successful campaign a short separation and a speedy termination of the difficulties june 15 and 18 there came other letters one written on the march to winchester the other after reaching that place breathing the same spirit of confidence and hope until the fatal third of july such letters came to me expressing hope and trust always hope and trust then drifted to us rumors faint and indefinite at first of a great battle fought at gettysburg gradually they grew stronger and brighter and the mind of the south became imbued with the impression that a grand victory had been won thus the news first came to us transmuted in the balmy air of the south from the appalling disaster it really was into the glorious triumph which our longing hearts hoped it might be a few days of this glowing dream and then the heartbreaking truth i could hear nothing of the general except the vague rumor that he had been killed in the final charge our mail facilities were very meager and our letters were smuggled through the lines by any trustworthy person who having been given the privilege of going back and forth happened to be at hand at the time many a mile i had ridden on ******** hoping to hear directly from the general before i was rewarded reck our old mule had been a benefaction not only to us but to the whole county every other mule and every horse had been confiscated and taken by the federals but for his wonderful memory reck would have changed owners too like all his ************ and sisters for he was a finelooking mule when a

first was the letter which the general as he went into battle had handed to general longstreet with its sad superscription if ********* nod means death the next was written on the second day after the great catastrophe later there came to me the following two weeks later i received this letter perhaps no girl just out of school ever had a more difficult problem sprung upon her than that which

connected with that interesting event in a young womans life however if love laughs at ********** he has more serious methods of treating other obstacles in his way and all the difficulties of millinery were finally overcome but still there were lions in the path longstreet lay under a tree at culpeper courthouse seeking repose from the burdens which would necessarily weigh upon the mind of a man in whose care was the destiny of the leading corps of the army of northern virginia as he leisurely reclined pickett came up and sat on the grass beside him general he said i am going to be married and want a furlough this little girl handing my picture to general longstreet says she is ready and willing to marry me at any minute in spite of the risks of war and will go with me to the furthest end of the earth if need be the younger man had consulted the older about many things since the day when he had rushed forward into the place made vacant by the wounding of his superior officer and carried the flag to victory but he had never before confided to him an aspiration of so soulful and sacred a character longstreet considered the matter gravely for a time i cant give it to you pickett they are not granting any furloughs now i might detail you for special duty and of course you could stop off by the way and be married said general longstreet with a twinkle in his eye it was not a time for insisting upon minor details even in regard to very momentous subjects and the general eagerly consented to be detailed for special duty then there arose the problem of how to get the two necessary parties to the transaction within the essential proximity to each other if the general attempted to cross the lines he might be arrested and then not only would the wedding be indefinitely postponed but one of the divisions of longstreets corps would lose its leader the general had purposed coming to meet me at the blackwater river which was the dividing line between the federal and confederate forces but fortunately through military exigencies his plans were changed as cautious as we had tried to be the federals by some unknown power caught a glimmering of what was expected and some poor fellow en route to the blackwater as innocent of being the general as of committing matrimony was ambushed and captured by a squad of cavalry sent out from suffolk for the purpose and though he pleaded innocent to the charges against him put into suffolk jail before he was recognized and released thus in the interests of the confederacy as well as of the marriage it became necessary that i should be the one to cross the lines my uncle was a physician and because of his profession was permitted to go where he wished and i had often accompanied him on his professional visits on the 14th of september my father and i set out to cross the lines under the protecting wing of this good uncle just before we were ferried over the blackwater river we came upon the federal cavalry who looked at us somewhat critically but recognizing dr phillips evidently assumed that he was bent upon a mission of mercy as indeed was he not and did not molest us we reached the railwaystation in safety waverley it was called and the romantic associations clustering around the name filled my youthful fancy with pleasure there we were met by my uncle colonel j j phillips and his wife and by the generals brother and his aunt and uncle miss olivia and mr andrew johnston colonel phillips was a warm personal friend of the general and commanded a regiment in his division he had been wounded at gettysburg and was just ************ they accompanied us to petersburg where to my great delight the general awaited me at the station when we reached the hotel he and my father went out for the purpose of procuring the license they soon returned with the sorrowful announcement that owing to some legal ************ the license could not be issued without a special decree of court i not being a resident of that jurisdiction court could not be convened until the next day and the general must report at headquarters that evening he went away sorrowful and i fell into a flood of tears thereby greatly shocking the prim rigid maiden lady a friend of my mother who had accompanied me as monitor and bridesmaid and who was intensely horrified by the expression of my impatience and the general impropriety of my conduct in fretting over the delay as i sat in my room drowned in grief i heard the newsboys crying the evening papers all about the marriage of general pickett the hero of gettysburg to the beautiful miss corbell of virginia you know a girl is always beautiful on her weddingday whatever she may have been the day before or will be the day after however it was not my weddingday but only was to have been and i had serious doubts as to whether my tear washed eyes and disappointed grief stained face would be likely to answer anybodys preconceived convictions of the highest type of beauty again was my mothers prunes and prisms friend unnecessarily shocked as i thought because i had simply opened the window to buy a paper containing the account of my own marriage the next day the general returned to petersburg and the court graciously convened the license was granted and we were married by the rev dr piatt in dear old st pauls church before congregated thousands for soldier and civilian rich and poor high and low were all made welcome by my hero we left for richmond on the afternoon train amidst the salute of guns hearty cheers and chimes and bands and bugles it may not be supposed that in those dark days of the confederacy we were likely to find a sumptuous banquet awaiting us in the capital but we did the river and the woods had given of their varied treasures to do honor to my general it was in the sora season and so *********** was that game supplied that the banquet was afterward known as the ***************** had it required the expenditure of ammunition to provide this delicacy it would probably have been lacking for the south at that time could not afford to shoot at birds when there were so many more important

and gallons of terrapin stew made and turkeys boned and made into ****** too by the faithful old plantation servants under the supervision of mrs simms the loyal old overseers wife not having sugar we

reception the army of northern virginia then stationed around richmond came in uniform of the thousands present only president davis and his cabinet a few ministers and a few very old men were in civilian clothes the general and i greeted and welcomed them all as they came then they passed on to the banquet and the dance dancing as only richmond in the confederacy could dance with a step that never faltered she ******* ****** over the crater of a volcano she threaded graceful mazes on the brink of the precipice the rumbling of the coming earthquake struck no minor tones into her merry music if people could not dance in the crises of life the tragedy of existence might be even darker than it is so they danced through the beautiful bright september night and when the last guests were going my general and i walked out upon the veranda with them and as they closed the outer gates watched the stars of night fade away before the coming dawn and the morning star rise and shine gloriously upon a new happy day after the battle of gettysburg longstreet placed before the secretary of war a proposition to take his corps to tennessee to reinforce bragg it was the intention that pickett should accompany this expedition a plan which drew from the corps commander the following words of commiseration and encouragement longstreets proposed plan was clouded by the changed orders which assigned pickett to the department of north carolina with headquarters at petersburg virginia his command ********* all that portion of virginia and north carolina lying between the james river on the north and cape fear river on the south extending on the east to the federal lines around suffolk and to the blackwater and ****** and included all the troops in that region pickett having been relieved of the faraway duty to which he had previously been assigned the leader of the expedition thus extended his congratulations and regrets commingled by order of the war department picketts division all that were left of them after that fatal charge at gettysburg two months before had just been divided up for the purpose of recruiting its strength although separated it still retained its organization and was again consolidated in may 1864 on the north anna river when it rejoined the army of northern virginia the department of north carolina was extended and important and as early as the 2d of november pickett reported in person to our secretary of war how ineffectually it was protected on the tidewater and approaches toward petersburg soon after this interview pickett learned of the intended federal expedition against peters burg by way of the james conveying this information to richmond he asked for sufficient troops to meet such an attack earnestly setting forth the immediate necessity of fortifying and obstructing the lower james later on pickett went to richmond and with elzey commander of the defenses at richmond had an interview with the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy representing the unprotected condition of his lines of which the federals would certainly take advantage at the close of this interview pickett was given the solemn promise that he should receive whatever reinforcements of troops could possibly be spared that a gunboat should be stationed on the james river at fort powhatan on the south bank of the river and that below that point the river should at once be further obstructed with torpedoes these promises for causes unknown were not fulfilled and subsequent events showed their importance when we returned to petersburg after our bridal visit with the generals sister and aunts we found that loving thoughtful hands had been unsparing in their tasteful arrangement of our temporary abode affection had found a way in spite of the check of war to anticipate every luxurious requirement choicest selections were made by the generals friends from among their own treasures to adorn our rooms it was here that the first tears of my married life were shed it happened some months after we had entered our petersburg home upon a gloomy rainy morning when the general was busy at his office and there was nothing to prevent my falling into the temptations which wait upon idle hands did you ever see or hear of a girl graduate who had never read a novel incredible as it may seem such was i at this period of my life

approve of novels consequently i had never been subjected to the charm of their ********* pages having grasped a situation so remote from the probable just imagine such an innocent crude mind suddenly brought into contact with the tense tragedy of east lynne a tragedy which probably has never been exceeded in literary history so it happened to me some one more hardened to ******* woes than i had been reading it and left it where it fell into my hands when i began i was not thinking much of the story i was too greatly appalled by the enormity of my crime in reading a novel of any kind to have a clear idea of what it was about i was ************ thinking what would my good grandmother think what would she say as i read on i began to lose sight and memory of my grandmother her influence ceased to move me the story exerted a miserable fascination for which there is no name all the woe and heartbreak of it fastened itself upon me and became my own the tragedy of a shattered life filled me with a grief unspeakable i read until my eyes were blinded with tears then i let the book fall upon the floor and gave way to a passion of sobs i heard the general coming and hid the book but i could not conceal the traces of my woe he was filled with anxiety when he saw my tearstained face what is the matter little one he asked with tender solicitude nothing i sobbed brokenly are you ill **** sir with renewed floods of tears have you hurt yourself he looked anxiously around in search of some weapon with which i might have accidentally inflicted upon myself an injury no i had not hurt myself has any one wounded your feelings or offended you in any way no everybody had been kind and good to me poor little thing she is tired and lonely will you come and ride with me no i would not ****** was the first time i had ever declined to ride with the general or in fact had refused to assent to anything which he had suggested and he was deeply hurt in vain he implored an explanation i was unable to divulge my grief and he was forced to leave me in tears and go forth with his great honest soul clouded with perplexity when he was gone i returned to east lynne and irrepressible misery when the general came back sometime later i was yet more deeply drowned in seas of woe and his anxiety was correspondingly increased are you homesick he asked tenderly you shall go home tomorrow and stay as long as you like i am not homesick do you want to see your father and mother they shall be sent for at once i did not want to see my father and mother do you want your little sisters they shall come and stay with you as long as you want them i did not want my little sisters again was he forced to leave me the dark mystery still ******** again did i resort to east lynne and uninterrupted woe when evening came the situation was yet worse i was hopelessly submerged in *********** measureless tides of despair i threw myself upon a couch and oceans of wretchedness rolled over me and i wept floods of burning tears the general was lost in mystification a sudden fear possessed him the rift within the lute had developed so great was the darkness which the imaginary life of the fictitious heroine cast over me that i did not at first realize the cloud on our domestic horizon it suddenly gloomed over me bringing contrition and remorse yet how could i explain and risk the contempt which i felt my deception warranted i watched the general as he paced up and down the floor vainly endeavoring to analyze the problem with which he had been so unexpectedly confronted sympathy doubt grief amazement seemed to ********* in his mind after a time he came and stood beside me looking at me with such an expression of sadness that under the influence of that gaze there was

misunderstanding from its hidingplace beneath the cushion and ********** handed it to him and all the clouds drifted away in smiles newbern north carolina was held by the federals and was reported to

barefooted famished soldiers newbern is the modern form of new berne so named in the latter part of the seventeenth century by its founder christopher baron de *********** in memory of his former home berne switzerland in its early infancy newbern had been baptized in blood and its sinister beginning seemed to have ushered it into a career of turbulence occasioned more by its location than by any consequence attaching to it from size or other characteristic adapted to attract attention its position as an important ******* of the confederacy early rendered it an object of desire to the enemy it is near the confluence of the neuse and the trent and the only two roads by which it may be reached by land lie through an almost impassable swamp there was once a railroad from newbern to kinston and ********* passing through the marshy ground but it had been destroyed on march 14 1862 burnside advanced upon newbern destroying a fortification of little value in the vicinity and capturing and partially burning the town being supported by gunboats which cleared the way by a heavy rain of shells burnside captured fortysix guns three light batteries and a large amount of stores in the beginning of 1864 newbern was held by the federal general foster with a small force pickett laid a plan for an attack upon newbern which was approved of and applauded by both lee and beauregard and was guarded with strictest secrecy on the 1st day of february 1864 hokes and cling mans north carolina brigades and a part of corses virginia brigade with a battalion of reids artillery the thirtyeighth virginia commanded by pickett set out from kinston on the neuse river in north carolina they were to threaten newbern on the south side of the neuse river on the north side of the neuse there was to be a demonstration by bearings cavalry and three regiments of infantry matt ransoms north carolina brigade bartons and terrys virginia brigades under command of barton marched along the trent river to destroy the railroad to ******** city and were directed to attack on the south side as soon as the federals should be diverted by the threatened assault of pickett and bearing simultaneously with these movements colonel r taylor wood with a naval force in small boats was to make a night excursion down the neuse river to newbern and attack the gunboats the troops left kinston just after nightfall in order that they might make their appearance at the specified points at daylight they were buoyant and hopeful the start was excellent everything seemed propitious victory apparently smiling on the efforts of all bearings feint upon the north was successful in attracting the attention of the federals from the real objective point colonel wood effected a complete surprise and captured the gunboat *********** under the guns of the forts at two oclock in the morning picketts infantry met the federal troops at bachelors creek seven miles distant from newbern the advance picket and vedette were silently captured and the reserve sought protection in a small fort just beyond the bridge this bridge being made of loose planks was taken away by the guard in the retreat and the stream too deep to ford proved an impassable barrier to the assailants thus the confederate advance was checked and the gallant little federal force held its position till it was reinforced during this engagement sixtyseven men were killed among them colonel shaw who was supporting the advance early in the morning hokes brigade crossed the stream flanking the federals and opening the way to newbern corse had already crossed captured a large force of federals which had been encamped on the railroad and forced back the garrison into newbern the confederates had succeeded in surprising newbern and had taken all the outworks and defenses in front almost victorious they waited with impatience for the attack on the other side which was to have been made by bartons column and which would have enabled them to enter newbern without opposition not a sound was heard the suspense was unbearable fear and anxiety began to crowd out hope the marsh prevented communication between the different divisions of the troops the failure was incomprehensible to all hour after hour of restless impatience went by and yet no gun was fired no attack was made by bartons column through a whole day of torture pickett waited in deathlike suspense with the prize of newbern almost within his grasp barton it seems regarded the federal defenses as too formidable to attack with any reasonable hopes of success pickett remained the whole of the next day in front of newbern hoping against hope and praying still that barton would even yet make an attack the special couriers he had sent out at intervals to try to reach barton not returning the next morning heartsick and disappointed he deemed it expedient to retire toward kinston though the newbern expedition failed in its ****** object it resulted in important advantages besides the capture of five hundred prisoners and over two hundred horses the confederates found comfort and temporary relief in the valuable capture of subsistence stores clothing shoes and camp equipage general pickett gives an account of newbern in the following ********** bartons explanation of his inaction at newbern is that although he had made every safe and proper exertion to gain information regarding the position of the enemy and had been assured by those whom he was forced to believe trustworthy that there were no fortifications at newbern other than those abandoned by the confederates at the capture of the place yet when he got there he found an invincible array of forts breastworks and fieldworks bristling with so deadly an array of guns that further progress was impossible the expedition to capture plymouth the capital of washington county north carolina which general pickett had planned to take effect some time before was just then about to set out this town situated a few miles south of roanoke river where it enters albemarle sound had been captured in 1862 by an expedition led by burnside and was now occupied by twentyfour hundred men under command of ******** pickett now maintained that too much time had been wasted and that the delay of this project which delay had had its origin with the authorities at richmond rendered the execution of the plan at this late hour both rash and inexpedient he held that inasmuch as danger threatened petersburg the troops then in north carolina for the purpose of moving on to plymouth instead of being kept there should be ordered back at once to the defense of the endangered city pickett again pointed out the weakness of petersburg how ineffectual were the defenses on the tidewater and approach to richmond and pleaded that immediate action should be taken in that direction he asked that the expedition be abandoned and that the three brigades of his division bartons corses and terrys which had been left in north carolina after the affair of newbern should be sent to him without delay huntons brigade of his division was still retained around the defenses of richmond the authorities at richmond giving no heed to picketts warning and taking no cognizance of his appeals in behalf of petersburg he in his desperation sent a special courier with a confidential letter to general lee who was then on the rapidan with the army of northern virginia telling him of his unheeded repeated warnings and requests and of his fruitless interview with the secretary of war general pickett pointed out to general lee the extreme danger to the confederacy at that point and the perils of further *************** general lee by return courier wrote as follows beauregard was then in command around charleston south carolina without loss of time he and pickett met by appointment at weldon north carolina pickett laid before beauregard the letter of general lee and explained the actual critical condition of affairs the absolute certainty of the immediate attack of the federals on this the most vulnerable approach to the capital of the confederacy and the inadequacy of any force which he had at his command to repel such an attack beauregard expressed himself at once as being in perfect unison of sentiment with pickett agreeing to the propriety of all he said he proffered his cooperation and assistance and promised to reinforce pickett as speedily as possible with whatever troops he could spare upon picketts return to petersburg he found that in the face of all argument in spite of all warning the expedition to plymouth had been ordered forward general pickett having planned the capture of plymouth he was of course to have commanded in person but just upon the eve of his starting out from his headquarters at petersburg he received a despatch from the war department at richmond directing him to turn over the command to brigadiergeneral hoke the command consisted of hokes terrys and ransoms brigades bartons corses and terrys brigades were kept in north carolina against the advice and warning of both beauregard and pickett who strongly urged that they be sent to petersburg to the support of pickett who had but a handful of men to guard the weakest point of the confederacy the open gate to richmond its capital beauregard sent a cipher despatch to pickett saying on the 2d day of may 1864 pickett was ordered to report to the army of northern virginia and beauregard was assigned to the division of north carolina the 3d of may my uncle dr john t phillips who was a practicing physician at ivor on the norfolk and petersburg railroad sent a special message by a trusty old neighbor to pickett to the effect that butler with fleet and transports all in readiness was only awaiting orders to advance this letter pickett sent over at once to the war department and telegraphed its contents to beauregard who being ill sent to pickett his inspector general major giles t cooke and his chief engineer colonel d b harris on the 5th of may the very day of butlers advance colonel walter harrison picketts inspectorgeneral and

pickett had so often warned the war department was made butler came up the james river with his whole force in transports protected by his gunboats and landed without opposition at city point and bermuda hundred lying between the james and appomattox rivers a whole division of his cavalry moved directly toward petersburg along the line of the blackwater notwithstanding the repeated warning of pickett the government was totally unprepared and the country at large completely surprised thus the world ***** its clear ******** seers now who tell of evil because they must no more than in the olden days when the sorrowful cassandra wandered sadly and alone in the sacred laurel grove of apollo and poured forth her mournful plaint for a nation that would not see as stated above on the night of the 2d of may when beauregard was assigned to the department of north carolina pickett received orders to report to the army of northern virginia he could not however turn a deaf ear to the pleadings of the council and the prayers and entreaties of the panicstricken people of petersburg as well as to the mandates of his own brave and tender heart and leave the city to the mercy of sword and flame he instantly made every available disposition for the defense of the place with the small means at his command which all told was one regiment of infantry of cling mans north carolina brigade and a few pieces of artillery on the blackwater river there was a portion of cling mans brigade one regiment of infantry the twentyninth virginia one battery of artillery and a small squad of cavalry the only infantry regiment he moved out in front of the works on the city point road and put on ********** all along the line the eleven pieces of artillery which was all he had he placed in the works at that point in his defense of petersburg pickett verified the statement of general grant the rebels are robbing the cradle and the grave for the militia and every available citizen of every sort and condition were ordered out and commanded to advance in the direction of the federals the small force on the blackwater river was ordered back immediately the heroic unselfish wives and daughters of the confederacy carried the despatches and cooked the food for their soldiers and defenders now with but six hundred men two hundred of whom were only partially effective pickett awaited the approach of butler with his thirty thousand strong a small force it was counted by men and guns but how ************* strong and great when measured by determination by ardor by enthusiasm and greatest of all by a firm and abiding love did not every man from the brave leader to the weakest private feel his heart thrill tumultuously as he reflected that behind him stood home friends loved ones the closest and dearest of family ties all that his heart held dear in life dependent on the valor and skill with which he held his ground a small and feeble band it might be said to face such odds but it was led by the same pickett who with one company of united states regulars held the whole british fleet at bay at san juan island and made the english lion crouch to the starspangled banner would not he who had fought so bravely for a little strip of earth on which a nation had risked its honor after the reckless fashion of nations battle with yet more ardent heroism for home and loved ones dearer to every true man than aught else a portion of haygoods south carolina brigade the first reinforcement of troops from the south arrived on the 6th of may the next day after the attack pickett stationed them at port walthall junction on the railroad between richmond and petersburg about six miles distant from the latter place the whole of beauregards army was south of petersburg and was on its way toward the defense of richmond on the south side hence it was ************ that this connection between petersburg and richmond should be kept open pickett knowing this detained this brigade on his own responsibility although he had been ordered in a telegram from bragg of the war department in richmond to send them directly onto richmond it was only by the intervention of this gallant little force of haygoods brave south carolinians who had a sharp skirmish with butlers advance column driving them back that the federals were kept off of the railroad and the connection between the two cities was preserved unbroken the weldon railroad was threatened by ****** cavalry division which had worked its way around in the rear and to the south of petersburg and attempted to intercept beauregards troops on that railroad though they failed they yet caused delay in transportation of these troops on the 7th of may wises virginia brigade arrived in petersburg and was sent out on the line toward city point then the three brigades of picketts division began coming in as fast as the brokendown wornout express could bring them all now breathed easier and felt less apprehension of immediate danger but the fear and anxiety of the women and children during those days of trial and danger is beyond description the roar of cannon shot and shell filled their ears

find myself safe in my soft warm bed with my little grandson the goldenhaired george e pickett ** nestling close in my arms our home in petersburg was situated on high street the old ********* house a

all i said be not afraid as long as general picketts arm is raised in your defense no harm can come to you i his wife share your danger and the general will obey no order that will take him away from your defense till you are safe you can depend upon my noble selfsacrificing hero trust and wait they not only trusted in their brave defender but gave him of their courage and strength in helping him

made into the country to keep up the appearance of *********** a large business in transportation and send up cheer after cheer of welcome fondly hoping the federals would not be cognizant of the fact that there were none to be welcomed except the feeble halfstarved men who ran the trains there were none to the eye but to the heart were not those whistling rumbling trains full to overflowing with gallant forms clad in the beautiful gray that we loved adorned with flashing swords carrying muskets that meant protection for us and above all with faces that had bent in truest love to our own such a week of anxiety as the general passed only he can know who holds in his hand the homes the lives the honor of men women and children for almost that length of time pickett had not slept and for three days had not been near our home his soup and bread and coffee i myself had carried to him out on the lines i had george and bob and charles my cook butler and gardener out on ************ each and all had done their part and they had not trusted in vain in the bravery and strategy of their fearless defender for as general grant had said in his telegram to president lincoln pickett had bottled up butler at petersburg general pickett a miracle has been performed you have saved petersburg and you have made a *********** nation of the confederacy this was the salutation of beauregard to pickett upon his relieving pickett at petersburg in may 1864 our equipments were all packed and we were on the eve of departing from petersburg in conformity with the orders received by the general before the federal attack upon the city now that our people were no longer in danger we were to go taking with us the thanks of the council and the love and gratitude of the whole city we left petersburg on monday the 16th of may 1864 as the morning of my birthday was dawning i was in a carriage with my maid and a few of my personal effects tom friend a courier was riding in front and bob

the poem of the look then the general rode on in many ways had my dear ones always shown loving memory of my birthday but today a new celebration was in store for me the federals were to grace the occasion i could not help contrasting in my mind various kinds of entertainment and wondering if many young people had celebrated their ***** days in so many different manners child almost as i was i wondered if i should ever again dance with light feet and a merry heart at a real birthday fete thus i rode through the dewy morn the first golden rays of the sun making a veil of glory from the mist

neck and from its tiny throat came a flood of melody that drowned discordant recollections the bottled general being still ****** up and peters burg being for the time safe beauregard deemed it expedient to move with the greater portion of his force toward richmond and drurys bluff on the james river leaving whiting in command at petersburg beauregards lines extended from the howlett house on the james river to fort clifton on the appomattox below petersburg on the south side of the appomattox there was a very small force for the defense of petersburg on the 15th of may 1864 whiting received orders from bragg of the war department at richmond to withdraw his whole force from petersburg and move by a roundabout road some distance in the rear of drurys bluff so as to get into the defenses of richmond from the rear whiting was both amazed and indignant at being obliged to abandon petersburg after its almost miraculous escape and to leave it thus entirely unprotected but fearing to disobey he in accordance with braggs directions issued marching orders for the following day this most remarkable order of bragg was signaled to beauregard by colonel walter harrison who at the solicitation of whiting was for the time serving on his staff beauregard at once sent an order through colonel ***** to whiting directing him to move with his command at daylight on the 16th of may and attack butler on his left thus *********** with beauregard in his attack whiting was delighted by this change of order and most enthusiastic at the prospect of meeting the federals at drurys bluff where some of the batteries were stationed to prevent the fleet from passing up the river beauregard had three divisions under ransom hoke and colquitt in ransoms division were two of picketts brigades bartons commanded by colonel fry and kempers old brigade under terry another of picketts brigades corses was in hokes division beauregards intention was to cut off the federals from their base of operations at bermuda hundred and on the 15th of may he issued orders for battle on the next day in a letter written some years after the close of the war beauregard thus sets forth his

h ******* of the seventeenth virginia was so severely wounded that he died shortly afterward whiting so far obeyed the instructions of beauregard as to cross the appomattox river at daylight and move with his command toward drurys bluff but his energy alas was paralyzed by a second order from bragg and he fell back upon petersburg without striking a single blow without giving any substantial aid to beauregards project beauregard was distressed and disappointed he affirmed that had whiting assisted him in the ******** attack which he had planned butlers entire army would have been destroyed beauregard on being informed that grant was crossing to the south side of james river below city point was obliged to abandon his position in order that he might defend petersburg on the south side of the appomattox lee was promptly notified by beauregard of his intentions but was unable to relieve him in time beauregard was in consequence forced to leave the intrenchments and butler on the morning of the 16th of may walked into them without opposition he thus reached the richmond and petersburg railroad which was unprotected and had begun destroying it when run off by the advance of picketts division at daylight also on the 16th of may huntons brigade set off in advance from malvern hill followed by the rest of longstreets corps between two and three oclock in the afternoon while this column was moving along the petersburg turnpike about ten miles from petersburg anderson who was then commanding the corps and pickett with his staff riding along together about a quarter of a mile in advance of the column were ambushed and fired upon by a portion of butlers troops huntons brigade was hurried up as quickly as possible followed by the other brigades the federal forces were driven back toward bermuda hundred they fought hard to hold the line recently given up by beauregard but the whole line was retaken and was held by picketts division from that time on until march 1865 when it was relieved by mahones division and sent off to meet sheridans cavalry raid upon the upper james and around richmond lee said it was not his intention that this attack on bermuda hundred should be carried to such an extent but he was so delighted and gratified with the result and so proud of the perseverance and daring of his brave virginians that he afterward wrote a complimentary acknowledgment of their service in the following letter to anderson on the 17th the morning after the battle of drurys farm longstreets corps pursued the federals to the howlett house on the james river and bivouacked for the night in an unfinished earthwork not more than six hundred yards from the federal gunboats and monitors which kept up an incessant shelling throughout the night on the

late autumn flower which had escaped the tramp of heavy feet the ringing cheers of the men as they saw us coming all helped to make me lose sight for a moment of the awful cause of our being there one morning as we rode along the howlett house line i saw a puff of smoke rise in the distance drifting scattering becoming a mere film as it floated higher and higher until it was lost against the blue sky how pretty that smoke is i said the general looked at it attentively then said anxiously yes dangerously beautiful it is from a shell the enemy have begun firing again come youd better ride on as

a number of picketts men had learned of our expected arrival and when the general thinking the secret of our coming was all his own emerged on horseback from a clump of trees near the railwaystation he found colonel floweree with his band squads from the different regiments the members of his staff and some of the brigade and regimental officers there before him waiting to welcome the new little

reached the station as soon as he handed us off his men surrounded us eager to take a peep into the great bundle of swaddlingclothes which hid from view their little general as they then christened

north of fort harrison on the north side of the james to hatchers creek south of petersburg several miles in length bounded on all sides by the federal army the confederates were in constant fear that grant would at any moment swing around our right and shut us up in richmond and petersburg to starve he had possession of the weldon road and was threatening the richmond and danville railroad our only remaining line connecting us with the southern states from which we received our supplies the line from howlett house on the james river opposite dutch gap canal across to swift creek and fort clifton on the appomattox a distance of about three miles was held by picketts division which numbered between four and five thousand men our line was so drawn out when thrown into the trenches that it made scarcely more than a strong skirmishline while the federal lines were full picketts men worked hard to make their position a strong one and were always on the qui vive for an assault at many points the confederate and federal lines were so close together that the soldiers of the two armies could talk to each other in an ordinary tone of voice could exchange newspapers tobacco for coffee and so on the venturesome confederates frequently made captives of the federal pickets once sweeping their line of riflepits for more than a hundred yards and taking a hundred and thirtysix prisoners

of life had risen to such an enormous height that the soldiers pay of eleven dollars a month was not sufficient to buy a ********** of wheat his rations were a fourth of a pound of bacon one **** of cornmeal ******** with now and then a bottle of sorghum a few beans or peas or a little rice no sugar coffee or soap it took sixty of our dollars to buy one dollar in gold one pound of soda cost fourteen dollars a loaf of bread two dollars ********** cotton and calico six dollars a yard shoes from one to three hundred dollars a pair but the privations of ******** and the dangers of the battlefield were nothing to the poor soldier in comparison with the almost certain knowledge that his wife and children and mother were cold and hungry what wonder is it then devoted though they were to their cause that there should yet be some desertions from their ranks the following incident will show what excuse mercy if not justice might plead in their defense one morning when my nurse returned from the deserters pen where i had sent her with a bucket of sorghum cakes for its poor doomed occupants she told me that the guard said that one of the men in the pen was from my home and knew me and that he had been begging to be allowed to send me a letter go back at once i said impulsively and tell the guard to get the letter and give it to you to bring to me she soon returned bringing a package tied up in ********* on the **** was written for the generals wife when i am dead the package contained three letters a little sealed box and two rings carved out of charcoal a slip of paper on one said for pas little lady on the other for pas little man and he mustnt forget his pa and he must be a good boy and look after his ma the box and letters were directed to his mother and wife the unsealed letter was written on both sides of the paper one side was written to me on the other side was a letter from his wife as follows the letter to me said thus on the cold and cheerless hearth of the lowly cabin burned the fires of patriotic ardor and the poor unlettered soldier having to the best of his small ability ministered to the wants of his suffering family had voluntarily returned to his duty under his flag regardless of the danger of meeting a deserters unhonored death i went into the next room where the general and colonel harrison were working over a map and handed the letter to the general as he read it his great glorious gray eyes filled with tears scolding me for what i had done he gave the letter to colonel harrison well said the colonel as he returned the letter there is nothing to be done about it dear lady these miserable wretches have got to be shot in the morning and all your pretty play is pretty play they have been tried by court martial their sentence approved and the general has nothing on earth to do with it and cant help it you and lady h not only look very much alike but you are very much alike discipline and the exigencies of the service demand a rigid enforcement of military laws said the general i knew my generals great generous heart and i knew that those men would not be shot the next morning before sunrise the execution

across the back legs in proportion and each foot encased in a side of sole leather later on when exchanging some prisoners captured in the riflepits the federals demanded four of their men for our mr adam to which demand we gladly acceded the last of january the peace commissioners appointed by the confederate government to meet the representatives of the federal government passed through the lines and went down the james river the whole army was full of hope that an amicable adjustment would be made alas our commissioners were vicepresident stephens assistant secretary of war campbell and r m t hunter confederate senator for virginia they were instructed to meet any representative whom president lincoln should select with the purpose of treating for peace between the two countries lincoln had consented to the meeting to discuss measures of restoring peace to our common country this discrepancy had not a tendency to pave the way to a satisfactory conference lincoln appointed seward to meet the representatives of the confederate government and in his letter of instructions said as the first meeting of seward with the confederate commissioners was not successful lincoln was induced by grant to go in person to meet the southern representatives mr stephens set forth the theory that secession was the best remedy for sectional differences as this view was not favorably received he suggested a union for the purpose of ********* the french from mexico lincoln and seward agreed with him as to the ************** of the new ****** neighbors but thought the united states government able to drive them away mr lincoln would treat only on the basis of reunion and the abolition of slavery mr hunters report contains the following the president said he could not treat with armed men hunter answered that this had often been done especially by charles l when at war with his parliament lincoln replied that he did not know much about history that he usually left that kind of thing to seward all that he distinctly recalled about charles l was that he lost his head of this conference which took place february 3 1865 on board the river queen lincoln thus made report to congress the news of the unsuccessful termination of the peace commission soon spread through the whole army and hope died in all hearts anxious faces indicated the deep sorrow with which the failure of the conference was regarded it was possible that the leaders might know of a prospect of foreign intervention of which the army was ignorant unless this was true nothing was left but to fight it out to the bitter end after the failure of the peace commission was known there was held in general picketts tent a consultation of the officers of his division as they talked their words drifted out to me said one we must hush all hope of peace in our hearts with the cry of war to the knife all ******** and absentees must be driven into the army i believe the yankees ***** tired of war as we are another suggested why not free the negroes they would be as loyal to us if we freed them as to our enemies who can give them certainly no more than we can unless it is better rations and pay but their love for us and the confidence they have in us will more than ************** that certainly responded another they are no dearer than our own sons we are willing to sacrifice our sons our fathers and ourselves why not our property is our property dearer than our own lives another said i believe the great bulk of the army is ready to make any sacrifice for our separate existence as a people and the cause of liberty as our forefathers resisted british tyranny we must resist northern oppression said another our object is not the negro but independence and a separate government for which i am willing to abolish slavery and give up any and every thing else with such patriotism such valiant soldiery said the general our independence shall be accomplished the north is turning the southern negro into northern bonds and i too believe that the majority of the army want to free the negro and make him help us to work i know that the majority of picketts men favor it we shall lose everything else if we attempt to preserve and perpetuate slavery and in the end of course lose that it should have been done in 1863 well at any rate it was agreed the last hope of peace save that which follows in the tread of the conqueror is over for the south the last winter of the confederacy had been one of privation hardship and painful anxiety the end was drawing near the march winds and ***** of the previous days had lulled themselves to sleep and march had borrowed from her sister month one of her softest most beautiful days for this the last review on this side of the dark waters of the grand old virginia division of picketts men i was on horseback beside the general proudly witnessing this last review of his beloved command the order to march was handed to the general just after the first brigade had passed on when the last man had passed in review and the last salute had been given and acknowledged the order to march was read and published there was not a man in the whole division who did not feel the hopelessness of prolonging this strife who did not know that it was then but a mere calculation of the few days and weeks which would elapse until the end yet without a complaint these brave men received marching orders sheridan the untiring and unconquerable with his ten thousand cavalry had routed early at waynesboro and dispersed his little band of three thousand men and was on his way to richmond it was reported via charlottesville from the north and the command was moving up to richmond and to the outer line of intrenchments north of the city pickett was to go and look after him we should take away with us many sacred memories of our eventful camp life the years of common suffering of sharing each others pleasures and bearing each others woes had bound us all together by the most sacred and loyal of ties till comrade seemed to me a closer truer tie than brother the camp was broken the last review of picketts division was over our baby the little general with hearty blessings had been sent on ahead with his faithful mammy two hours in advance of my departure i was waiting ready to start i had listened to the tramp of regiment after regiment as they in turn folded their tents and marched away the drums of the rearguard were growing fainter and fainter in the distance as we caught sight of lucy with her silken coat and limpid eyes full of tenderness and fire and her slim clean legs and small unerring feet as she skimmed over the field with blood as blue as that of her matchless rider tom friend one of the generals couriers was riding behind him they were coming back from the front for me bob promptly brought up my horse which was saddled and waiting i mounted and galloped forward to meet the general as we rode slowly away he looked thoughtfully and sadly around him and sighed a farewell to tent and camp of howlett house chester and the lines of breastworks this position important as the main line of defense between richmond and petersburg and opposing any advance by the federals he had occupied since the 16th of may 1864 through the soft lights and shades and the perfumed breath of the dawn of the year we rode away from our first and last camp and on together to the old pickett home in richmond where the general was to leave me and rejoin his division he said goodby and as we knelt beside our babys cradle we placed each other in gods holy keeping take care of mamma my little man if papa should not come back i leave her to you my dear dear little namesake son ask mamma to tell you what papa says and if there there he said cheerily i must go now smiles come smiles give me smiles no tears mind and he went out of the door and down the steps two at a time whistling the girl i left behind me a little while later i heard the drums beating and babys nurse rushed in to say i brushed away my tears caught up my baby who had just awakened snatched from the nurses hand the bunch of white violets which she said she had

to us who lived through the darkness of those days there is yet a black shadow falling around us like the memory of an awful dream poor confederacy she had nothing to oppose to the affluence of resources possessed by the enemy save the unconquerable gallantry of her children who fought against such odds as had never before stood in the way of freedom when pickett received and obeyed the telegram from lee ordering him to move to the right of petersburg he knew and his men knew that it was a forlorn hope no cheek blanched no muscle quivered as the order was read there was no weakening of their proud resolution to fight the battle for principle through sacrifice however vain to the end as i humbly reverently record these last days i lovingly lay the immortal laurel of gratitude prayer love and tears ******** on the sacred grave of these last men who vainly brave died for the land they could not save pickett received the order from lee on the 29th day of march 1865 at ****** creek where he with two of his brigades corses and terrys were bivouacked stuarts brigade was west of petersburg and was ordered to join pickett en route huntons brigade the brave old command at the head of which garnett met his glorious death on the field of gettysburg was with longstreet on the north of the james river the entire division had been ordered to march but it was found that there was transportation for only three brigades in order to secure a whole division longstreet suggested drawing mahone from bermuda hundred and allowing pickett to replace him but lee preferred a part of picketts division and ordered the three brigades forward pickett in carrying out the order of lee endeavored to make the movement as stealthily as possible though he knew it was impossible to conceal entirely from the knowledge of the federals the action of stuarts brigade near petersburg it being in the range of vision from the federal *************** pickett with the brigades of corse terry and stuart was to cross the appomattox river passing petersburg where they were to take the cars by the southside railroad to sutherlands station ten miles west of peters burg and to move thence to sutherlands tavern on the railroad fitz lees cavalry had already preceded the infantry to the tavern and he had from that point communicated with pickett who **** the three brigades reached the station a little after nine oclock in the evening at ten oclock the same night the 29th r h anderson sent an order to pickett to come on with his three brigades by a crossroad to the white oak road over hatchers run and take a position to the right of bush rod johnsons division at the extreme right of the confederate line the roads and streams were almost impassable but picketts indefatigable men without a murmur moved on through the drenching rain over the muddy roads fording streams and gullies pickett with his soldierly mien led them on ever and anon appearing among them his genial sunny smile helping many a jaded *********** to step out with a brighter face and a firmer tread as he would pass on whistling with his inimitable beautiful whistle dixie the bonnie blue flag maryland annie laurie the girl i left behind me or some other familiar air equally dear to the soldiers heart or with a word of good cheer he would wave his cap and go on leaving the air behind him radiant with sympathy and affection the presence of the born leader of soldiers is as strong and uplifting in arduous and wearisome marches as it is inspiring in battle about daybreak of the 30th with the rain still pouring pickett with his command arrived upon the white oak road between ********* courthouse and five forks the brigades extending for some distance up the road at about ten oclock of the morning of the same day general lee came up to the right of the confederate line and held a consultation with his chiefs during this council a prisoner was brought into camp he was a captain in sheridans cavalry and was captured near five forks upon the examination of this officer he let out the information that the whole federal cavalry more than fifteen thousand strong supported by a heavy infantry force was at or near dinwiddie courthouse lee did not give much credence to the statements of the federal captain nor did heth who was one of the chiefs mentioned as being in consultation with him but just about this time a message came from fitz lee stating that the enemys cavalry were in great force at five forks and had driven in all of his pickets upon this information lee at once sent orders to fitz lee to take command of the whole cavalry his own division the division of w h f lee and a part of rossers division and make an attack upon the cavalry force at five forks at noon on the same day lee ordered pickett to move on to five forks with his small force of artillery and infantry consisting of his own three brigades matt ransoms and wallaces brigades both together not equal to a full brigade and six rifled pieces of artillery under colonel pegram and take command of the whole force the main object of the attack was to break the federal left the proposed plan to further that end was that pickett should press down upon dinwiddie courthouse and as far down upon the front as possible and that r h anderson should at the same time make an attack in front the federal cavalry was in strong force between the right of the confederate line and five forks and picketts men being compelled to drive the federals out of their way the entire distance the skirmishing in their front and flank being continuous they could not of course make much of a record as to speed after eighteen hours of continuous marching through the discomforts of rain ***** and hunger and the dangers of shot shell and saber pickett reached five forks there had already been a sharp skirmish at this point between the two cavalry forces immediately on picketts arrival he threw out two regiments of infantry and the federal cavalry was soon driven in it was picketts intention to push on to dinwiddie courthouse but after consultation with fitz lee the other cavalry not as yet having joined him the night being dark and rainy and his own men tired and worn out it was decided that he should stop in order to keep the federals at a respectful distance during the night pickett threw out two of his brigades on the courthouse road corse and terry advanced almost a mile driving the federal cavalry before them though being dismounted and armed with the repeating rifle the troopers made a vigorous fight the strength of the enemy was beyond conjecture on the morning of the 31st lee led ******** gracies huntons and wises brigades against the federal fifth corps commanded by warren which was posted between picketts command and the confederate fortifications warren was driven back behind ******** run pickett placed w h f lees and rossers cavalry on the right followed by the infantry and artillery fitz lees division commanded by thomas t mumford was at the left w h f lees cavalry preceded the infantry column on the direct road to a crossing at ************* creek and mumford moved by an immediate road in the same direction at the fork of ************* creek w h f lee made one of the most brilliant and severe cavalry fights of the war forcing a crossing immediately in face of a superior force of the federal troops who had all the advantages of position with a stream of water in front the infantry were unable to cross at this point and sought a passage lower down terrys brigade leading it suffered serious loss in the passage though it made a brilliant dash across the creek and killed and captured about a hundred of the enemy driving their forces back to dinwiddie courthouse the loss of the confederates was chiefly confined to w h f lees cavalry and terrys and corses brigades many valuable officers were killed although the fifth corps had suffered great loss it rallied and charged against lees brigades but was again forced back to white oak road and then to the fortifications the darkness of night fell over the confederates within but half a mile of dinwiddie courthouse had some good southern joshua been there to stop the sun in its course for even one little halfhour the courthouse would have been ours the federals were being strongly reinforced with infantry grant in response to sheridans request having ordered up the fifth corps under warren numbering fifteen thousand the whole of sheridans and ****** cavalry were in front mackenzies division sixteen thousand strong having been sent forward when the battle was over pickett sent a courier to lee who was on the lines at petersburg telling him of the success of the day but stating that he had just ascertained through his scouts the certainty of the heavy infantry support to sheridans cavalry at dinwiddie courthouse and that he had no option but to withdraw with his small force this he proposed to do under cover of the night further assurance of the truth of this report proved to pickett that his decision was a judicious one he accordingly left the front of dinwiddie courthouse at two oclock on the morning of the 1st day of april and started back toward five forks thus ended another scene in the fifth act of the tragedy on which the dark curtain was so soon to fall for nearly two years after the fatal battle of gettysburg the war had drawn its slow length along with varying fortunes and now the end had almost come impenetrable gloom had closed around the confederacy and its shadow fell heavily over those who for four years had so heroically borne the heartbreak of ineffectual struggle in february 1865 president davis relinquished his military authority and general r e lee became generalinchief of the confederate armies all communication with foreign powers was closed and no more hope of assistance remained lees object was to reach the mountainous regions of virginia and north carolina and join johnstons forces while grants policy was to prevent the juncture on the last of march lees army of less than forty thousand was stretched until its extreme right rested on five forks fifteen miles southwest of petersburg a situation which justified lees reflection on the 2d of april when the line had been penetrated by the federal sixth corps and the gallant a p hill lay dead on the field near petersburg it has happened as i told them at richmond it would happen the line has been stretched until it has broken during the long struggle of the south for nationality no more desperate and heroic action occurred than took place at five forks on april i 1865 when federal reinforcements were sent to sheridan at dinwiddie courthouse the intention of grant was that the fifth corps fifteen thousand strong should attack picketts left and cut off retreat grant was generalinchief of the united states army and his power was exceedingly great but he could not control the elements the rain fell heavily on the night of the 31st and the fifth corps toiling over the difficult road found no enemy awaiting it at the end of its wearisome journey pickett having notice of the projected attack changed his orders for battle and withdrew to five forks which he reached early in the morning of april i followed by sheridans troops the movement was made in perfect order and as discreetly and quietly as possible they brought all their wounded off the field and buried all their dead after a fatiguing march over roads and streams almost impassable because of the heavy rains five forks was reached where having a few hours the start of sheridan pickett halted to rest but almost immediately upon his arrival he received a message from lee in response to one sent by pickett the preceding day saying five forks the point which lee ordered pickett to hold at all hazards is simply a crossing at right angles of two country roads and the ********** of a third road ********* one of these angles it is situated in a low flat country and has no natural points of defense its only fortification was a hastily constructed breastwork the place was absolutely not capable of being protected except by a very large body of troops and the small force directed to hold it could easily have been turned on the right or left and isolated from the main army at petersburg it was therefore a most unfortunate selection of a field on which to meet a superior force and yet six thousand men infantry cavalry and artillery all told were stationed here to hold the ground against an attack by thirtyfive thousand troops supported by heavy artillery the task was impossible of achievement but the effort was nevertheless most bravely made where nature supports a small force of men the combination may prove invincible even to an army much superior in numbers she throws up impregnable defenses ****** stone walls and creates caves of darkness for the protection of her chosen few on a straight wide plain nature stands aside and views the antagonists with impartial eye while mars radiantly smiles upon the largest army and the heaviest guns pickett had all his trains parked in rear of hatchers run and would have greatly preferred to hold his position at that point he inferred however from lees selection of five forks and his positive order to hold it at all hazards that he of course intended to send to him at once a strong reinforcement immediately therefore upon the receipt of lees peremptory order to hold five forks pickett formed his line of battle on the white oak road at right angles and across the ford road which ********** the southside railroad and set his men to throwing up breastworks they dug a ditch felled pinetrees and threw the earth up behind the felled logs and though they knew the holding of five forks would be hazardous cheerfully worked and waited it was nine oclock on saturday morning when the line was formed the number and disposition of the confederate force was as follows matt ransoms and wallaces brigades acting as one and combined not numbering over eight hundred men were on the left stuarts brigade amounting to about one thousand was next on the right and extended to the forks of the roads then came corses brigade one thousand strong and then terrys eight hundred strong supporting corses on the right of the line the six rifled pieces of artillery were placed along the line at wide intervals fitz lees cavalry was ordered into position on the left flank w h f lees on the right flank ************** bearings cavalry were all of rossers division that were present though they did fine service the cavalry numbered in all about twentyfive hundred men thus cavalry infantry and artillery amounted to not over six thousand men to meet sheridans cavalry numbering in itself more than five times that of picketts whole command in addition to sheridans own force he was supported by warrens infantry corps as soon as the confederates were in position they began cutting down trees piling up logs digging trenches and erecting obstructions their work was interrupted only when they were compelled to seize their guns to repel an attack three times the labor was thus suspended the federals having begun the attack upon the front as soon as the line was formed having repelled the foe they would immediately return to their work which they enlivened by singing my maryland dixie and bonnie blue flag the hurried work of three hours of these hungry ************* veterans a shallow ditch a few loose dirt covered pine logs were their only line of breastworks and yet these devoted men were ready to do or die about two oclock in the afternoon a general advance and attack began along the whole front and on the right flank which was quickly repulsed with considerable loss to the enemy pickett had a short time before ridden to the north side of hatchers run and hearing the sound of battle he galloped through a rain of fire and balls from crawfords troops on the ford road soon after he reached his command colonel pegram of the artillery was mortally wounded and fell near where the general was standing reforming his line pegram was shot from his horse by a ************ just after the charge had been repulsed and fell in rear of two of his guns a few minutes after this attack a terrific fire of musketry to the left and rear was heard the apprehension of picketts troops that the left wing had been turned and doubled back and that they would be taken in reverse proved unhappily true warrens corps had swept around to the left flank while sheridans cavalry mounted and dismounted was engaging the front and right warren forced ransom and wallace back and doubled them on stuarts brigade of picketts division huntons brigade was withdrawn from the front moved doublequick to the left and thrown forward to meet the attacking column pickett leading cheering on the men waving the confederate battleflag he dashed up to colonel floweree whose regiment was on the left informing him of the situation of affairs he said i depend upon your regiment to save the day you will have to grapple with twice your number but i know i can depend upon you colonel floweree was a fearless gallant determined soldier and a jovial jolly fellow i shall follow the moon marse george meaning he should go westward and well save the day if our last man has to bite his ****** dust you boys are all too gallant and deferential to bite the dust of their mammy you know marse george the general smiled and rode on he crossed the road to higher ground within forty paces of where the enemys columns were massed whence came showers of bullets falling around him but his life seemed a charmed one the men were dropping at every volley and the order to retreat was repeated three times but his boys refused to move till their general should come and then they retreated at doublequick and in good order follow the moon called out colonel floweree death or prison was their choice many chose the former pickett terry corse stuart and ransom were across the road calling on the men to get into line to meet the next onslaught a part of the famous glee club with gentry leading were singing rally round the flag boys rally once again near them was the ensign of the first

joined with theirs in the ************ there were very few to rally around that battleflag stained crimson with the noblest blood of the south sacred to a cause for which many a brave man had died and many another had offered his life willing to fall rather than see that banner suffer dishonor very few they were compared with the host arrayed against them but their voices rang out boldly and the notes of their battlesong echoed and reechoed from the forest at this time the confederates were just four hundred yards in rear of five forks and though the federals had captured many prisoners principally from ransoms wallaces and stuarts brigades they had gained but little ground pegrams men stood with their horses ready to return to their guns as soon as the opportunity should present the federals charged upon the front and right straight through the open field to the woods in which the confederate line was formed a heavy force was thrown around the right and left the federal cavalry poured down on the right and rear picketts men were entrapped held as in a vise by the cavalry with a line of infantry in the rear a deadly fire from all sides they formed in front north and south and met with desperate valor this double onset cut to pieces defeated captured all that were left of them still pressed on in sullen determination the closest fighting of the war was done here so near together were the opponents that they ******* each other with their muskets again and again the heroic little band rallied round the flag fighting on this ground unknown to them until darkness fell so

sadly reduced in numbers by losses in killed and captured depressed not only by past disasters but by the certainty of future defeat they gathered bravely around their leader and their flag with a courage which might lead them to death but would forever preserve them from dishonor early sunday morning the 2d of april following the battle of five forks pickett after reviewing his men thanked them for their confidence in him and for their valiant services in the last onslaught through which they had just passed with words of courage he gave the order to march proceeding with them toward exeter mills at which point it was his intention to cross the appomattox river and rejoin the main army while the command however was at a halt at exeter mills pickett received through a staffofficer an order from r h anderson to report to him at sutherlands tavern most of matt ransoms brigade had already gone across the river at exeter mills on the following morning just as the day was breaking pickett in accordance with the orders received from anderson started out with his command but he had not gone very far on his way when he found the road blocked and strewn with stragglers from heths and wilcoxs divisions these ********* informed pickett that the lines in front of petersburg had been forced that they had been cut off from petersburg and that anderson had gone on toward amelia courthouse assured of the truth of this information pickett immediately followed on up the river and on the evening of the same day the 2d of april joined anderson at deep creek nearly famished for no rations had been issued since the scanty supply of the 29th and yet not a murmur was heard a few hours afterward huntons brigade numbering about nine hundred reported this brigade had also been severely engaged meeting with serious loss on their march they learned that their beloved a p hill had been killed at petersburg and just as they were going into bivouac came too the first sad intelligence of the evacuation of richmond and its partial destruction by fire these mournful tidings struck a knell of despair to every heart but especially to those whose families and homes together with all their worldly possessions were within the captured burning city with the light which we now have it seems strange that this blow should have been made heavier by coming as a surprise but the fact was that the loss of their capital was a calamity for which the confederate soldiers were wholly unprepared it seemed however but to strengthen their resolve as they ************* marched on to describe the sufferings of the march on to amelia courthouse and thence to sailors creek would be to paint a picture of the darkest horror the army supplies were utterly exhausted there was no food to be had in the country all the homes along the line had been stripped by those who had come in advance there was nothing to eat but a little parched corn when they stopped long enough to ***** it this they shelled from the ear as they marched along many of the men overcome by fatigue and suffering loss of sleep and hunger succumbed by the way and others found themselves going to sleep as they walked along and would stumble and fall in the road now and then they made a halt for a skirmish with the enemy who were on all sides front rear and both flanks time and again during the fortyeight hours they were forced to halt and not only draw up in line of battle but form a hollow square to prevent capture the tortures of the march were intensified by the fact that it led through a country in which lived the families and friends of many of these soldiers who were marching on to death imprisonment or to the humiliation of defeat yet notwithstanding the fact that they were within a few hours of their homes and loved ones whom they had not seen many of them for months and many for years there was but little straggling although it was not safe to stray far from the command on account of the enemys cavalry yet now and then some one of these starving heroes impelled by the pangs of hunger would venture off in a vain search for food only to fall from weakness by the wayside all the sufferings privations and hardships of the four preceding years put together would not equal those endured on this march to amelia courthouse yet they went bravely on sustained by the hope that food awaited them there lee knowing that they had started off with only a days rations had ordered provisions to that point in the meantime the fatality foreseen by the prescient lee had taken place the last blow had fallen upon the doomed confederacy the dread message which had flashed across the wires on the morning of sunday the 2d of april had interrupted the devotions of the government officials in st pauls church in richmond to tell them that their capital had fallen they hastened from the church to the ********** to secure the confederate archives and convey them to a place f safety then giving orders for the firing of the city they left on the evening train lighted on their way by the flames which illumined the capital and followed by the thunderous reports of the exploding ironclads on the james next morning the victorious army came scurrying across country pellmell in a wild race to see which could be first in at the death for richmond had fallen at the very time that the ragged hungry weary suffering soldiers of a lost cause were marching on their painful journey cheering themselves with the hope of succor at the next ************ the flag of the victors was waving over the capital city of the confederacy upon arriving at amelia on the afternoon of the 4th the army ascertained that the supplies ordered by lee had been brought to the point designated but the authorities had immediately sent the train containing them to richmond to bring away the officials of the fallen capital and by some strange misunderstanding it had gone on without waiting to ****** thus was the great army of brave patient suffering men who had offered for their cause life home and all the hopes and aspirations they had ever known sacrificed for a few civic officers and the archives of a nation which had died in its birth the confederate forces were now widely scattered lee recognized the necessity of concentration on leaving richmond his intention was to retreat to danville on the southern boundary of virginia southwest of richmond from which point he hoped to effect a projected union with johnston his first objective point was *********** fiftytwo miles south of richmond at the junction of the richmond and danville and the norfolk and western railroads this place safely reached he could destroy the roads in the rear and for a time escape pursuit he had gained some hours and might have carried his plan to success but for the delay caused by the fatal mistake in ordering off the loaded train of supplies which he had taken such pains to provide the sufferings of the starving army and the consequent halts which were made in efforts to obtain subsistence enabled sheridan to ******** lee and reach jetersville on the danville railroad seven miles southwest of amelia from which place he telegraphed grant at petersburg grant arrived at jetersville at midnight presented himself at the headquarters of sheridan who roused from his slumbers hastened to meet him sheridan explained the position by means of a sketch hastily drawn upon a letter which he took from his pocket lee is caught said grant it will be hard for him to get away perhaps it was hard but when sheridan arrived at amelia on the morning of the 6th of april he found that the difficult feat had been accomplished and lee had once more eluded a welllaid plot on the morning of the 6th pickett reached sailors creek where for some hours he made a halt in line of battle this creek is a marshy stream difficult to cross running ******** into the appomattox in the meantime every effort was being made by the confederates to push on their wagontrains and artillery across the appomattox river at farmville a small town west of the danville railroad the mud and mire and famishing animals made the progress slow soldiers may live for a time on hope and patriotism but mules and horses must have fodder and corn both the wagonroad to lynchburg and the southside railroad cross the appomattox at farmville and the latter again five miles east of it at high bridge the river being too deep to ford farmville therefore became an important point to both armies ewells command was on picketts left and mahones division was on his right sheridan with his thousands of wellfed wellequipped cavalry was in front making every demonstration to delay the confederates from attacking until he should be reinforced by his infantry meantime mahone received orders to move on thus leaving a gap in the confederate line which grew wider as mahone advanced hunton from his position on the right of picketts division observed this movement and gave notice of it to pickett who at once made a report to anderson of mahones withdrawal and of the consequent danger to his own command and asked permission to follow mahone the order however which anderson had received from the commanderinchief to hold on in connection with ewells command unfortunately prevented him he said from complying with picketts request in the meanwhile the gap between pickett and mahone was increasing colonel hugers battalion of artillery attempted to cross this gap when mahone was a mile or more in advance of pickett this movement was defeated by sheridan who made a swift and vigorous attack upon huger pickett witnessing this ****** immediately pushed with his division across sailors creek and charged upon the federals with two of his brigades and the other two quickly followed sheridan taken by surprise was driven back more than half a mile abandoning two of hugers captured guns in his haste he carried off colonel huger with him but captain ******* colonel hugers adjutant made his escape on one of the *************** carrying a gun with him pickett then formed line of battle and held it against the repeated attacks of sheridans dismounted cavalry his division was by this time completely isolated both flanks being unprotected about three oclock shout after shout was echoed from the federal lines picketts men knew it meant that the infantry so anxiously looked for by sheridan had come to his aid and they realized the increased perils of their position the federal cavalry and infantry began at once to close around the confederate right anderson seeing that picketts men were being hemmed in on all sides and knowing that it was too late then for him to move on his line of march gave the order to pickett to draw off his brigades to the rear and to cut his way out in any manner possible anderson in order that he might assist pickett in this movement deployed wises brigade in the rear of picketts line of battle sheridan at once charged on every side picketts men overwhelmed by numbers fighting handtohand stubbornly resisted to the bitter end their inevitable fate many of the men broke their guns and many of the officers snapped their swords in two rather than surrender them to the enemy they fought as heroically and nobly on this their last battlefield when all hope was gone as they had ever done in any battle even when in their first flush of glory and in perfect faith of ultimate success corse and hunton were taken prisoners with almost the entire remnant of their commands stewart and terry succeeded in getting off the field pickett himself with colonel walter harrison and his medical director dr m m lewis escaped death or capture almost by a miracle pickett seeing several squadrons of cavalry riding directly down upon them rallied around him a mere squad of his beloved old division and with this last rally the men fired their parting shot into the faces of the advancing horsemen and in the momentary check they made their escape in the annals of warfare there is found no page which ***** more vividly with the light of heroism than does that which records the retreat of the confederate army after the battle of sailors creek starving jaded by forced marches and strenuous exertion in battle it yet found strength to turn and with its oldtime impetuosity and transcendent effort force back twice across the stream the strong wellfed victorious army of sheridan friend and foe alike have marveled over such wondrous gallantry displayed in the face of so great suffering and disaster truly the last flashes of the expiring flames of southern hopes and southern ambitions have shed imperishable glory over the record of the men who kept those flames alive through over four years of heroic struggle against overwhelming odds of men and resources after the battle of sailors creek occurred the first reunion of the blue and gray it was when sheridans soldiers shared their rations with picketts men until grant issued orders for their supply thus the voice of a common ancestry of blood and kinship was heard as an echo to the roar of cannon in after years came other ************ abraham lincoln stood at the foot of cemetery ridge and looked upward to where the frowning cannon had so short a time before sent its leaden death to the valley below some one said to him think of the men who held these heights yes he replied but think of the men who stormed these heights as picketts division weary footsore and ********* wended their toilsome way through pennsylvania on the march which ended on the field of gettysburg they passed a small dutch house nestling away in the greenery of a pleasant village as they came near a little maid rushed out upon the porch waving the stars and stripes in a wild burst of patriotic enthusiasm for a moment the leader of that ******* band felt apprehensive that not all its members could be depended upon to maintain their chivalry in the presence of that banner which to them represented so much of wrong done upon their native soil many of them had come from the war ravaged district of suffolk and southerners will know what that flag meant to them instantly the general wheeled from the line and taking off his cap bowed to the little maid with all that grace for which he was noted in camp as well as drawingroom and respectfully saluted the flag of his foes then turning he lifted his hand and when the long line had passed every man in it had ****** his cap to the youthful patriot and had saluted the banner which she had made her gage of battle the delighted little maiden who had never before received the homage of a whole division cried out in a glow of gratitude i wish i had a confederate flag i would wave that too the general was asked afterward how he could bring himself to salute the enemys flag i did not salute the enemys flag he replied i saluted the heroic womanhood in the heart of that brave little girl and the glorious old banner under which i won my first laurels on the twentyfourth anniversary of the greatest battle of the western continent the men who held those heights and the men who stormed those heights all that were left of them met on the old bloodstained field where the bravest deeds known to history had been performed peace had laid her soft mantle over the heights which nearly a quarter of a century before had been frowned upon by wars wrinkled visage in majestic silence the peaks looked skyward through the golden sun an amber glory lay over the summit of little round top and the stream at its base which had once flowed crimson now reflected in silvery gleams the light above it the clouds of battle had drifted away long ago and in their place were only soft gray mists ********* floating like a veil of peace around the crest where once the philadelphia brigade met the onset of picketts men the ********* had vanished but many of the brave defenders of the height yet remained as generous in peace as they had been brave in war they had come with outstretched hands to welcome all who were left of the ragged veterans who so valiantly scaled cemetery heights on that terrible july day which had burned its fiery mark upon the pages of our history every part of that ground had been consecrated by a deed of heroism the banner of the south furled itself in sadness around its broken flagstaff long ago but the field on which its heroes fought and fell is sacred to all southern hearts here upon this spot fell a young lieutenant wounded unto death carrying the battleflag of the south when the ********* from the hospital went over the field to perform their sad duty they found him lying under a tree with a worn blanket for a pillow his youthful face was white with pain and exhaustion such a very young face it was one could not help thinking that the arm of a loving mother would be a far more fitting pillow than the rough old army blanket for the boyish head the farewell kisses of home seemed yet to linger upon the gentle lips he was sadly wounded but refused to be taken to the hospital stating as a reason for the rejection of the proffered aid that he was comfortable and others worse hurt than he should be cared for first so they left him because he urged them to do so and when they came later the brave soul had passed beyond the darkness and the pain when he was lifted they saw why he had sent them away he had been lying upon his battleflag carefully folded and placed beneath him that it might not fall into the hands of the enemy the banner which he had protected in life he guarded still in death tenderly northern hands wrapped it around the dead hero whose lifeblood had saturated its folds and it was his martial cloak and shroud never was warrior more proudly draped for his last long sleep never did the mightiest of earth lie in grander state than did this boy soldier in the protecting folds of the flag he had so loved stranger hands laid in a northern grave that noble son of the south unknown the grave is marked unknown to the passerby but known forever to his god stranger eyes let fall the tears which sank into the earth to unite with natures subtle forces and spring upward in loves life and beauty to bloom in violets above that hero heart who shall say that the winds blowing southward did not lift upon their radiant wings a breath of those sweet flowers and carry it like a holy benediction to waiting sorrowing hearts in his beloved southland a young officer rushed up in front of ****** battery brandishing his sword and crying take that battery colonel cowan shouted fire the artillery flamed out its fiery death and all within its range fell after the battle was over colonel cowan picked up the officers sword which had been so defiantly ********** in front of his battery and carried it with him in honor of the brave soldier who had borne it to his death for years he made efforts to find some one who might claim it by right of kinship with its brave owner failing in this he brought it with him to the reunion on the historic ground from which he had taken it and in an eloquent speech presented it to picketts men amid tears for the noble dead and cheers for the noble living it is still treasured as a priceless relic of ********** and the luster with which it is adorned by the bravery of its wearer and the generosity of its captor will never fade over there is where pettigrew with his brave north carolinians fought with desperate courage to support the left flank of picketts column as the artillery plowed ************ through its ranks hopeless effort but not vain for the valor with which it was made is a coronet of glory on the brow of the good north state here the plain honest man of the people stood and gave utterance to his thought in words which appeal not to those alone to whom he spoke they sprang from a deep sympathetic soul and struck responsive chords in all hearts whose bravest and dearest had helped to make that ground so sacred that no living presence could deepen its consecration here manhood reached a height of courage and ardent love from which it could not recede and had gone beyond into the highest the last full measure of devotion had been given by the gray and the blue alike the brave men living and dead the living come with generous hand of greeting north and south and their voices speak only friendship the dead i look beyond and see their loved and loving faces on the crest of lifes sublimest height they fell to rise again in supernal triumph from the eternal silence they look down and are glad over the long pathway on which armistead garnett and thousands of other brave ones marched to death the daisies were blossoming in a great white sea as i looked they seemed to fall crushed under the rush of martial feet and through the mists of a quarter century i saw that long line moving forward in the wondrous charge of which the poet has written this twentyfourth anniversary of the greatest battle of the war was not the first reunion within my experience of the blue and the gray when the great civil war closed it left me as it did other southern women with a bitterness of heart which could conceive of nothing good in those whom i regarded as enemies the general had his old army friends with whom he had fought side by side on the fields of mexico whom he had loved through all the terrible four years and whose affection for him had never wavered the sword had severed the few ties which had linked me with the north the same bitterness went with me on our return from canada when we so unexpectedly became the guests in new york of some of the generals dearest and most intimate comrades in arms in the olden days as i became acquainted with these true and generous friends i learned that men may honestly differ politically and even draw their swords against each other and still keep warm and faithful hearts that only await the opportunity to give expression to their brotherly feeling i remembered that my hero had fought as bravely under the stars and stripes as he had ever fought under the stars and bars while my beloved south held the highest place in my ** factions next to her was the north that could produce brave and noble men whose friendship could stand a test so severe i took the generals watch which he had carried through two wars and had inscribed on the inner side of the case the names of the battles in which he had fought under each flag on the outside i had enameled the two flags joined together with two ribbons one of blue the other of gray i had not consulted the general about this reunion and the pleasure which mingled with his surprise showed how dear to him were the memories of his oldtime battlefields and the love of his old time friends a solemn reunion took place when we collected the bodies of the confederate and federal soldiers and gave them burial in the ground which had been made sacred by their blood ******** the dust of the blue and the gray mingled in the same coffin out from the infinite their hands united reach down to us and point the way to a higher and purer national life years later there was a sad reunion when the philadelphia brigade came to richmond to attend the unveiling of picketts monument on gettysburg hill in hollywood cemetery the first time that such a token of remembrance had ever been offered to a fallen foe brave men come to do honor to a hero who had fought against them their presence was a touching tribute which appealed to the depths of the southern heart and the friendships formed then can never be broken in the year in which i write the philadelphia brigade and picketts men met again in the beautiful quaker city whose generous heart had devised a succession of exquisite pleasures for the entertainment of her guests it was a happy reunion saddened only by the absence of loved ones who once met with us in genial comradeship we still seemed to hear their voices ********** memories of the olden days when not even the most prophetic soul could have foretold the time when the hand of the gray would clasp the hand of the blue in a friendship that was cemented in blood a few weeks afterward there was a pathetic reunion when the members of sedgwick post grand army of the republic of wakefield rhode island escorted the daughter of the confederacy when she started on her last solemn journey to the south which she so loved sweet winnie davis her noble and gracious life too early ended upon earth sleeps the long long sleep in the heart of that land which held her so dear and on her sacred grave north and south alike gently place the myrtle of love and now lately at atlanta our president in whose administration north and south have come nearer perhaps than at any other time since the beginning of our constitutional history and whose justice and sympathy have had great influence n promoting this friendly union has awakened by tender and loving words renewed impulses to thrill through the deep heart of our great union the tempest of war did not sweep away the traditions which formed so large a part of the basis of life in the south they dwell deep in the hearts of the people where they give light and glory to life as the sunlight of the ages locked up in the depths of earth ********** its glow into the sparkle of the glittering gem the flag of the south floats not in triumph from the masts of great ships that ride the sea in splendor but far above in the deepest arch of the highest firmament of life its stars glitter in eternal radiance the south has left its ********* with its mystic purple shades and soft odors that lull the soul to ********* dreams and entered the bracing atmosphere and healthy light of the world of today she has ****** into the depths of the earth and brought up the mighty forces of civilization which nature in the beginning stored away for this time of her awakening she sits not amid the ruins of her temples like a sorrowing priestess with veiled eyes and depressed soul mourning for that which hath been with face turned ******* and heart aflame with ardor she goes bravely forth with faith and trust to meet that which shall be ********* she looks to the past and the future to the the past

blood that flowed on its crimson way through our land a generation ago has ********** the soil for bearing yet more luxuriant blossoms of patriotism the star of the south burns in golden flame against the pulsing arch of sky which bends above the sunny land on the distant horizon the star of the north sparkles in iridescent gleams upon crests of snow and their mingled light ******* the pathway on which our nation moves to a glorious destiny while i was the guest of picketts men in the parade at the reunion of the gray in atlanta my son was in the army of the blue serving his country against a foreign foe for the only time in our many meetings to commemorate the past he was absent from my side but my arm was around his child the namesake grandson of the great confederate leader and the little blueeyed boy was waving the flag of virginia with as enthusiastic loyalty as could have been displayed by a much older son of that great state directly behind our coach marched veterans of the george e pickett the *************** and the r e lee camps clad in their old uniforms of confederate gray and carrying the tattered and ************* flags which they had so valiantly borne in deadly conflict in a generation past old and feeble they were many of them disabled by the wounds of that fearful time the presence of many of them there was due to a whole year perhaps of selfdenial on the part of themselves and their families who had made every sacrifice in order that the old soldier might meet once more with his comrades of the olden days for the last time one of them said to me with touching sadness gallantly they marched on no more heeding the pouring rain than they had heeded it in the brave days of old as they toiled along through the drenching rain my heart went back to the time when those warworn veterans first donned the old uniform of gray and lifted high above their ranks those banners now battlescarred then bright and beautiful and floating out upon the springtime breeze as if to promise a glorious future for the hearts that loved them and saw in their stars the light of victory these arc my boys proudly exclaimed general pickett to me pointing to his long line of southern heroes when i first went into camp where with my husband i spent the early years of my marriage it seems fitting that these heroic men who followed their leader so bravely on the ************* fields of the south should have a distinctive place in history they poured out their blood for the cause which was to them the dearest on earth their memory is a golden thread in the strong and beautiful web of southern life their graves make sacred the historic ground of the land for which they fought and fell the star of their countrys fame gleams more brightly in the great world sky because they have lived and died a few of these boys yet linger on the shores of time and their voices greet us with the thrill of the olden days far more have drifted away on the sea of silence if the flower of memory which i lovingly plant on the grave of the dead shall bloom to cheer the heart of the living i am content
