<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>
<p>“I can hear the sullen, savage roar of the breakers, if I do
not see them, and my pretty painted bark—expectation—is
bearing down helplessly upon them. Perhaps the unwelcome
will not come to-day. What then? I presume I should not
care; and yet, I am curious to see him,—anxious to know
what sort of person will henceforth rule the house, and go in
and out here as master. Of course the pleasant, peaceful days
are at an end, for men always make din and strife in a
household,—at least my father did, and he is the only one I
know much about. But, after all, why borrow trouble?—the
interloper may never come.”</p>
<p>The girl stood on tip-toe, shading her eyes with one hand,
and peering eagerly down the winding road which stretched at
right angles to the avenue, and over the hills, on towards the
neighboring town. No moving speck was visible; and, with
a sigh of relief, she sank back on the grassy mound and resumed
the perusal of her book. Above and around her spread
the wide branches of an aged apple-tree, feathered thickly
with pearly petals, which the wind tossed hither and thither
and drifted over the bermuda, as restless tides strew pink-chambered
shells on sloping strands; and down through the
flowery limbs streamed the waning March sun, throwing
grotesque shadows on the sward and golden ripples over the
face and figure of the young lounger. A few yards distant
a row of whitewashed bee-hives extended along the western
side of the garden-wall, where perched a peacock whose rainbow
hues were burnished by the slanting rays that smote like
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_7"></a>7</span>
flame the narrow pane of glass which constituted a window in
each hive and permitted investigation of the tireless workers
within. The afternoon was almost spent; the air, losing its
balmy noon breath, grew chill with the approach of dew,
and the figure under the apple-tree shivered slightly, and,
closing her book, drew her scarlet shawl around her shoulders
and leaned her dimpled chin on her knee.</p>
<p>Sixteen years had ripened and rounded the girlish form,
and given to her countenance that indefinable charm which
marks the timid hovering between careless, frolicsome youth,
and calmly conscious womanhood; while perfect health
rouged the polished cheeks and vermillioned the thin lips,
whose outlines sharply indexed more of decision than amiability
of character.</p>
<p>There were hints of brown in the heavy mass of waveless
dusky hair, that was elaborately braided and coiled around
the well turned head, and certain amber rays suggestive of
topaz and gold flashed out now and then in the dark-hazel iris
of the large eyes, lending them an eldritch and baleful glow.
Fresh as the overhanging apple-blooms, but immobile as if
carved from pearl,—perhaps it was just such a face as hers
that fronted Jason, amid the clustering boughs of Colchian
rhododendrons, when first he sought old Æëtes’ prescient
daughter,—the maiden face of magical Medea, innocent as yet
of murder, sacrilege, fratricide, and plunder,—eloquent of all
possibilities of purity and peace, but vaguely adumbrating all
conceivable disquietude and guilt.</p>
<p>The hushed expectancy of the fair young countenance had
given place to a dreamy languor, and the dark lashes drooped
heavily, when a long shadow fell upon the grass, and simultaneously
the peacock sounded its shrill <ins title="Was alarum">alarm</ins>. Rising quickly
the girl found herself face to face with one upon whose
features she had never looked before, and for a moment each
eyed the other searchingly. The stranger raised his hat, and
inclining his head slightly, said,—</p>
<p>“Permit me to ask your name?”</p>
<p>“Salome Owen. And yours, sir, is—”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_8"></a>8</span></div>
<p>“Ulpian Grey.”</p>
<p>For a few seconds neither spoke; but the man smiled, and
the girl bit her under-lip and frowned.</p>
<p>“Are you the miller’s daughter?”</p>
<p>“I am the miller’s daughter; and you are the master of
Grassmere.”</p>
<p>“It seems that I come home like Rip Van Winkle, or
Ulysses, unknown, unwelcomed,—unlike the latter,—even by
a dog.”</p>
<p>“Where is your sister?”</p>
<p>“Not having seen her for five years, I am unable to answer.”</p>
<p>“She went to town two hours ago, to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Then, after all, I am expected; but pray by what route—balloon
or telegraph?”</p>
<p>“Miss Jane went to the railroad dépot, but thought it
possible you might not arrive to-day, and said she would
attend a meeting at the church, if you failed to come. I presume
she missed you in the crowd. Sir, will you walk into
the house?”</p>
<p>Perhaps he did not hear the question, and certainly he did
not heed it, amid the clamorous recollections that rushed upon
him as he gazed earnestly over the lawn, down the avenue,
and up at the ivy-mantled front of the old brick homestead.
Thinking it might impress him as ludicrous or officious that
she should invite him to enter and take possession of his own
establishment, Salome reddened and compressed her lips. Apparently
forgetful of her presence, he stood with his hat in
his hand, noting the changes that time had wrought: the
growth of venerable trees and favorite shrubs, the crumbling
of fences, the gathering moss on the sun-dial, and the
lichen stains upon two marble vases that held scarlet verbena
on either side of the broad stone steps.</p>
<p>His close-fitting travelling suit of gray showed the muscular,
well-developed form of a man of medium size, whose very
erect carriage enhanced his height and invested him with a
commanding air; while the unusual breadth of his chest and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_9"></a>9</span>
shoulders seemed to indicate that life had called him to athletic
out-door pursuits, rather than the dun and dusty atmosphere
of a sedentary, cloistered career.</p>
<p>There are subtle countenances that baffle the dainty stipple
and line tracery of time, refusing to become mere tablets,
mere fleshy intaglios of the past, whereon every curious
stranger may spell out the bygone, and, counting their footprints,
cast up the number of engraving years. Thus it happened
that if Salome had not known from the family Bible
that this man was almost thirty-five, her eager scrutiny of his
features would have discovered little concerning his age, and
still less concerning his character. Exposure to the winds and
heat of tropic regions had darkened and sallowed the complexion,
which his clear deep blue eyes and light brown hair
declared was originally of Saxon fairness; in proof whereof,
when he drew off one glove and lifted his hand it seemed as if
the marble fingers of one statue were laid against the bronze
cheek of another.</p>
<p>Looking intently at this grave yet benignant countenance,
full of serenity, because calmly conscious of its power, the girl
set her teeth and ground her heel into the velvet turf, for
<i>frangas non flectes</i> was written on his smooth, broad brow,
and she felt fiercely rebellious as some fiery, free creature of
the Kamse, when first confronted with the bit and trappings
of him who will henceforth bridle and tame the desert-bred.</p>
<p>Waking from his brief reverie, the stranger turned and
extended his hand, saying, in tones as low and sweet as a
woman’s,—</p>
<p>“Will you not welcome a wanderer back to his home?”</p>
<p>She gave him the tips of her fingers, but the “Imp of the
Perverse” dictated her answer,—</p>
<p>“As you saw fit to compare yourself, a few moments since,
to certain celebrated absentees, I am constrained to tell you
that I happen to be neither Penelope nor Gretchen, nor yet
the illustrious dog referred to.”</p>
<p>He smiled good-humoredly, and replied,—</p>
<p>“I am not very sure that there is not a spice of Dame Van
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_10"></a>10</span>
Winkle somewhere in your nature. True, we are strangers,
but I believe you are my sister’s adopted child, and I hope
you are glad to see her brother at home once more. Jane is a
dear kind link, who should make us at least good friends; for,
if you are attached to her you will in time learn to like me.”</p>
<p>“I doubt it,—seeing that you resemble Miss Jane about as
nearly as I do the Grand Lama of Larissa, or the idol Bhadrinath.
But, sir, although it is not my office to welcome you,
I presume you have not forgotten the front door, and once
more I ask, Will you walk in and make yourself at home in
your own house?”</p>
<p>As she led the way to the steps, the arched gate at the end
of the avenue swung open, a carriage entered, and Salome
retreated to her own room, leaving unwitnessed the happy
meeting between an aged, infirm sister, and long-absent
brother.</p>
<p>Locking the door to secure herself from intrusion, she drew
a low rocking-chair to the hearth, where smouldered the
embers of a dying fire, and dropping her face in her palms,
stared abstractedly at the ashes. As she swayed slowly to and
fro, her lips parted and closed, her brows bent from their
customary curves of beauty, and half inaudibly she muttered,—</p>
<p>“The sceptre is departing from Judah. My rule is well
nigh ended; the interregnum has been brief, and the old
dynasty reigns once more. Just what I dreaded from the
hour I heard he was coming home. I shall be reduced to a
mere cipher, and made to realize my utter dependence,—and
the iron will soon enter my soul. We paupers are adepts in
the art of reading the countenance, and I have looked at this
Ulpian Grey long enough to know that I might as well bombard
Gibraltar with boiled peas as hope to conquer one of his
whims or alter one of his purposes. There will be bitterness
and strife between us. I shall wish him in his grave a
thousand times before it closes over him,—and he, unless he
is too good, will hate me cordially. I cannot and will not
give up all my hopes and expectations, without a long, fierce
struggle.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_11"></a>11</span></div>
<p>Salome Owen was the eldest of five children, who, by the
death of both parents, had been thrown penniless upon the
world, and found a temporary asylum in the county poor-house.
Her mother she remembered merely as a feeble, fractious
invalid; and her father, who had long been employed as
superintendent of large mills belonging to Miss Jane Grey,
had, after years of reckless intemperance, ended his wretched
career in a fit of mania a potu. His death occurred at a
season when Miss Grey was confined to her bed by an attack
of rheumatism, which rendered her a cripple for the remainder
of her days; but the first hours of her convalescence were
spent in devising plans for the education and maintenance of
his helpless orphans. In the dusty, cheerless yard of the poor-house
she had found the little group huddled under a mulberry
tree one hot July noon; and, sending the two younger
children to the orphan asylum in a neighboring town, she had
apprenticed one boy to a worthy carpenter, another to an
eminent horticulturist in a distant State; and Salome, the
handsomest and brightest of the flock, she carried to her own
home as an adopted child. Here, for four years, the girl had
lived in peace and luxurious ease, surrounded by all the elegances
and refining associations which though not inherent
in are at the command of wealth; and so rapidly and gracefully
had she fitted herself into the new social niche, that the
dark and stormy morning of her life had become only a dim
and hideous recollection, that rarely lifted its hated visage
above the smooth and shining surface of the happy present.</p>
<p>Fortuitous circumstances constitute the moulds that shape
the majority of human lives, and the hasty impress of an
accident is too often regarded as the relentless decree of all-ordaining
fate; while to the philosophic anthropologist it
might furnish matter for curious speculation whether, if Attila
and Alaric had chanced to find themselves the pampered
sons of some merchant prince,—some Rothschild or Peabody
of the fifth century,—their campaigns had not been purely
fiscal and bloodless, limited to the leaves of a ledger, while the
names of Goth and Hun had never crystallized into synonyms
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_12"></a>12</span>
of havoc and ruin; or had Timour been trained to cabbage-raising
and vine-dressing, whether he would not have lived in
history as the great horticulturist of Kesth, or the Diocletian
of Samarcand, rather than the Tartar tyrant and conqueror
of the East? How many possible Howards have swung at
Tyburn? How many canonized and haloed heads have barely
escaped the doom of Brinvilliers, and the tender mercies of
Carnifex?</p>
<p>Analogous to that wonderful Gulf Stream, once a myth and
still a mystery, the strange current of human existence, four
score and ten years long, bears each and all of us with a
strong, steady sweep away from the tropic lands of sunny
childhood, enamelled with verdure and gaudy with bloom,
through the temperate regions of manhood and womanhood,
fruitful and harvest-hued, on to the frigid, lonely shores of
dreary old age, snow-crowned and ice-veined; and individual
destinies seem to resemble the tangled drift on those broad
bounding gulf-billows, driven hither and thither, strewn on
barren beaches, scattered over bleaching coral crags, stranded
upon blue bergs,—precious germs from all climes and
classes; some to be scorched under equatorial heats; some to
perish by polar perils; a few to take root and flourish and
triumph, building imperishable land-marks; and many to
stagnate in the long, inglorious rest of a Sargasso Sea.</p>
<p>For all helpless human waifs in this surging ocean of time,
there is comfort in the knowledge that the fiercest storms toss
their drift highest; and one of these apparently savage waves
of adversity had swept Salome Owen safely to an isle of
palms and peace, where, under the fostering rays of prosperity,
the selfish and sordid elements of her character found
rapid development.</p>
<p>In affectionate natures, family ties serve as cords to strangle
selfishness; for, in large domestic circles, each member contributes
a moiety to swell the good of the whole—silently endures
some trial, makes some sacrifice, shares some sympathy
and sunshine, hoards some grief and gloom, and had Salome
remained with her brothers and sisters, their continual claims
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_13"></a>13</span>
on her time and attention would have healthfully diverted
thoughts that had long centred solely in self. Finding that
fortune had temporarily sheathed in velvet the goad of necessity,
the girl’s aspirations soared no higher than the maintenance
of her present easy and luxurious position, as a petted
dependent on the affection and bounty of a weak but generous
and lonely old lady. Having no other object near, upon which
to lavish the love and caresses that were stored in her heart,
Miss Jane had turned fondly to Salome, and so earnestly endeavored
to brighten her life, that the latter felt assured she
was selected as the heiress of that house and estate where she
had dwelt so happily; and thus sanguine concerning her
future prospects, the strong will of the girl completely dominated
the feebler and failing one of her benefactress, through
whose fingers the reins of government slipped so gradually,
that she was unconscious of her virtual abdication.</p>
<p>From this pleasant dream of a handsome heritage and life-long
plenty, Salome had been rudely aroused by the unwelcome
tidings that a young half-brother of Miss Jane was
coming to reside under her roof; and prophetic fear whispered
that the stranger would contest and divide her dominion. A
surgeon in the United States navy, he had been absent for five
years in distant seas, and only resigned his commission in consequence
of letters which informed him of the feeble condition
of his only surviving relative. Those who have eaten the
bread of charity learn to interpret countenances with an unerring
facility that eclipses the vaunted skill of Lavater, and
the girl’s brief inspection of the face which would henceforth
confront her daily, yielded little to dispel her gloomy forebodings.
The sound of the tea-bell terminated her reverie, and
rising, she walked slowly to the dining-room, throwing her
head as erect as possible, and compressing her mouth like some
gladiator summoned to the fatal arena of the Coliseum.</p>
<p>The dining-room was large and airy, with lofty wide windows,
and neatly papered walls, where in numerous old-fashioned
and quaintly carved frames hung the ancestral portraits
of the family. Although one window was open, and the mild
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_14"></a>14</span>
air laden with the perfumed breath of spring, a bright wood
fire flashed on the hearth, near which Miss Jane sat in her
large, cushioned rocking-chair, resting her swollen slippered
feet on a velvet stool, while her silver-mounted crutches
leaned against the arm of her chair. An ugly and very diminutive
brown terrier snarled and frisked on the rug, tormenting
a staid and aged black cat, who occasionally arched her
back and showed her teeth; and Dr. Grey stood leaning over
his sister’s chair, smoothing the soft grizzled locks that clustered
under the rich lace border of her cap. He was talking of
other days,—those of his boyhood, when, kneeling by that
hearth, she had pasted his kites, found strings for his tops,
made bags for his marbles, or bound up his bleeding hands,
bruised in boyish sports; and, while he read from the fresher
page of his memory the blessed juvenile annals long since
effaced from hers, a happy smile lighted her withered face,
and she put up one thin hand to pat the brown and bearded
cheek which nearly touched her head. To the pretty young
thing who had paused on the threshold, watching what passed,
it seemed a peaceful picture, cosy and complete, needing no
adjuncts, defying intruders; but Miss Jane caught a glimpse
of the shrinking figure, and beckoned her to the fire-place.</p>
<p>“Salome, come shake hands with my sailor-boy, and tell
him how glad we are to have his sunburnt face once more
among us. Ulpian, this is my dear child Salome, who makes
noise and sunshine enough in an otherwise dark and silent
dreary house. Why, children, don’t stand bowing at each
other, like foreign ministers at court! Ulpian, you are to be
a brother to that child; so go and kiss her like a Christian,
and let us have no more state and ceremony.”</p>
<p>“<i>Sans cérémonie</i> we introduced ourselves this afternoon,
under the apple-tree, and I presume Salome will accept the
assurance of my friendly intentions and fraternal regard, and
decline the seal which only long acquaintance and perfect confidence
could induce her to permit. Notwithstanding the very
evident fact that she is not entirely overwhelmed with delight
at my return, I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to one
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_15"></a>15</span>
who has so largely contributed to my sister’s happiness, and
shall avail myself of every opportunity to prove my appreciation
of her devotion.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey stepped forward, took Salome’s hand, and touched
it lightly with his lips, while the grave dignity of his manner
forbade the thought that affectation of gallantry or idle persiflage
suggested the words or action.</p>
<p>Disarmed by the quiet courtesy which she felt she had not
merited, the girl’s ready wit and nimbly obedient tongue for
once proved treacherous; and, conscious that the flush was
deepening on cheek and brow, she moved to the oval table in
the centre of the floor, and seated herself behind the massive
silver urn.</p>
<p>“Ulpian, take your place yonder, at the foot, and excuse my
absence from the table this first evening of your return. I
always have my meals here, close to the fire, and Salome presides
in my place. Child, put no cream in his tea, but a bountiful
share of sugar. You see, my boy, I have not grown too
old to recollect your whims.”</p>
<p>As he obeyed her, Salome was preparing to pour out the
tea; but, catching his eye, she paused, and Dr. Grey bowed his
head on his hand, and solemnly and impressively asked a
blessing, and offered up fervent thanks for the family reunion.
In the somewhat fragmentary discourse that ensued
between brother and sister the orphan took no part; and, a
half hour later, when the little party removed to the library
and established themselves comfortably for the evening,
Salome drew her chair close to the lamp, and, under pretence
of examining a book of engravings, covertly studied the features
and mien of the new-comer.</p>
<p>His quiet, low-toned conversation was of other lands and
distant nations, and, while there was an entire absence of that
ostentatious braggardism and dropsical egotism which unfortunately
attacks the majority of travellers, his descriptions of
foreign scenery were so graceful and brilliant, that despite
her ungracious determination and premeditated dislike, she
became a fascinated listener; and, more than once, found herself
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_16"></a>16</span>
leaning forward to catch his words. Her own vivid fancy
travelled with him over the lakes and isles, temples and
palaces, he had visited; and, when the clock struck eleven, and
a brief silence succeeded, she started as from some delightful
dream.</p>
<p>“Janet, shall we have prayers, or have I already kept you
up too late?”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey stooped and pressed his lips to his sister’s wrinkled
forehead, and her voice faltered slightly, as she answered,—</p>
<p>“It is never too late to thank God for all his goodness, especially
in bringing my dear boy safely back to me. Salome, get
the large Bible from the cushion in the parlor.”</p>
<p>As the orphan placed the book in Dr. Grey’s hand it opened
at the record of births, where on the wide page appeared only
the name of Ulpian Grey, and from the leaves fluttered a
small bow of blue ribbon.</p>
<p>He picked it up, and, considering it merely a book-mark,
would have replaced it, but Miss Jane exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“It is the blue knot that fastens that child’s collar. Give
it to her. She lost it yesterday, and has searched the house
for it. How came it in that old Bible, which I am sure has
not been used for fifteen years?”</p>
<p>Whatever solution of the mystery Salome might have
deigned to offer, remained unuttered, for Dr. Grey kindly
obviated the necessity of a reply by requesting her to bring
him an additional candle from an adjoining room; and the
superfluous celerity with which she started on the errand
called a twinkle to his eye and a half-smothered smile to his
lips. She felt assured that he was thoroughly cognizant of the
curiosity which had prompted her researches among the family
records, and inferred that he had either no vanity to be
flattered by such trifles, or was dowered with too much generosity
to evince any gratification at the discovery of an interest
she would have vehemently disclaimed.</p>
<p>It was the first time she had ever bowed before the family
altar, and, notwithstanding her avowed aversion to “Puritanic
ceremonials and Pharisaical practices,” she was unexpectedly
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_17"></a>17</span>
awed and deeply impressed by the solemnity with
which he conducted the brief services; while, despite her prejudice,
his grave courtesy toward her, and the subdued tenderness
that marked his treatment of his sister, commanded her
involuntary respect. When she stood before the mirror in her
own room, unbraiding her heavy hair, a dissatisfied expression
robbed her features of half their loveliness, and discontent
ploughed distorting lines about the scarlet lips which muttered,—</p>
<p>“I wonder if, in one of his evil fits, my father sold and
signed me away to Satan? I certainly am <i>bon gré mal gré</i> in
bondage to him; for, from my inmost heart I hate ‘good,
pious, sanctified souls,’ such as that marble man upstairs, who
has come back to usurp my kingdom, and lord it over this
heritage. After to-day a new regime. The potter’s hands are
fair and shapely, courteous and deft, but potter’s hands nevertheless.
Tough kneading he shall find it, and stiffer clay
than ever yet was moulded, or my name is not Salome Owen.
After all, how much better are we than the lower beasts of
prey? In the race for riches there is but one alternative,—to
devour, or be devoured; consequently that was an immemorial
and well tested rule in the warfare that commenced
when Adam and Eve found themselves shut out of Eden.
‘Each for himself,’ etc., etc., etc. Since I must <i>ex necessitate</i>
prey or be preyed upon, I shall waste no time in deliberation.”</p>

<a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>
<p>When fifty-two years old, Daniel Grey amassed a handsome
fortune by speculating in certain gold and coal mine
stocks, which not only relieved him from the necessity of daily
toil in his dusty counting-room, but elevated him to that more
than Braminical caste, dubbed in Mammon-parlance—capitalists;
whose decrees outweigh legislative statutes, and by feeling
the pulse of stock-boards and all financial corporations,
regulate the fiscal currents of the State. A few months subsequent
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_18"></a>18</span>
to this sudden accession of wealth, his meek and
devoted wife—who had patiently shared all the trials and
hardships of his early impecunious career, and brightened an
humble home which boasted no treasure comparable to her
loving, unselfish heart,—was summoned to the enjoyment of
a heritage beyond the stars; and Daniel Grey, capitalist,
found himself a florid handsome widower, with two children,
Enoch and Jane, to remind him continually of the pale wife
over whose quiet ashes rose a costly mausoleum, where rare
exotics nodded to each other across gilded slab and sculptured
angels. That he profoundly mourned his loss no charitable
mind could doubt, notwithstanding the obstinate fact that
ere the violets had bloomed a twelvemonth over the dead
mother of his children he had provided them with one who
certainly bore her name, <ins title="Was unsurped">usurped</ins> her precious privileges,
walked in her footsteps, but wofully failed to fill her place.</p>
<p>Mrs. Daniel Grey, scarcely the senior of the step-daughter
whose lips most reluctantly framed the sacred word “mother,”
was a fresh fair young thing, whose ideas of marriage extended
no further than diamonds, white satin, reception cards,
and bridal presents; and whose regard for her worthy husband
sought no surer basis than his bank-stock and insurance
dividends. Dainty and bright, in tasteful and costly apparel,
the pretty child-wife flitted up and down in his house and
over the serene surface of his life, touching no feeling of his
nature so deeply as that colossal <i>parvenu</i> vanity which exulted
in the possession of a graceful walking announcement of his
ability to clothe in fine fabrics and expensive jewels.</p>
<p>Perhaps the mildew that stained the ghastly gaunt angels
who kept guard over the dust of the dead wife, extended yet
further than the silent territory over which sexton and mattock
reigned, for one dreary December night, instead of nestling
for a post-prandial nap among the velvet cushions of his
luxurious parlor, Daniel Grey, capitalist, slept his last sleep
in a high-backed, comfortless chair before his desk, where the
confidential clerk found him next morning, with his rigid
icy fingers thrust between the leaves of his check-book.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_19"></a>19</span></div>
<p>According to the old Arab proverb,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“The black camel named Death kneeleth once at each door,<br>
And a mortal must mount to return nevermore.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And, past all peradventure, having borne away one member of
the household, the “Last Carrier” from force of habit hastens
to perform the same thankless service for the remainder;—thus
ere summer sunshine streamed on the husband’s
grave, another yawned at its side, and a wreathed and fluted
shaft shot up close to his mausoleum, to tell sympathizing
friends and careless strangers that the second wife of Daniel
Grey had been snatched away in the morning of life.</p>
<p>Her infant son Ulpian was committed to the tender guardianship
of his maternal grandmother, in whose hands he remained
until the close of his fourth year, when her death
necessitated his return to the home of his only relatives,
Enoch and Jane. At the request of his sister, the former had
sold the elegant new residence in a fashionable quarter of the
town, and removed to the old homestead and farm, hallowed
by reminiscences of their mother, and invested with the magic
attractions that early association weaves about the spots frequented
in youth.</p>
<p>Manifesting, even in boyhood, an unconquerable repugnance
not only to curriculum, but the monotonous routine of mercantile
pursuits, Enoch sullenly forswore stock-jobbing and
finance, and declared his intention of indulging his rural
tastes and becoming a farmer. Fine cattle and poultry of all
kinds, heavy wheat-crops, and well-stored corn-cribs engrossed
his thoughts, to the entire exclusion of abstract æsthetic speculation,
of operatic music, and Pre-Raphaelitism; while the
sight of one of his silky short-horned Ayrshires yielded him
infinitely more pleasure than the possession of all Rosa Bonheur’s
ideals could possibly have done, and the soft billowy
stretch of his favorite clover-meadow was worth all the canvas
that Claude or Poussin had ever colored. While Enoch had
cordially hated his fair blue-eyed young step-mother, not from
any personal or individual grounds of grievance, but simply
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_20"></a>20</span>
and solely because she dared to occupy the household niche,
sanctified once and forever by his own meek gentle-toned
mother, he nevertheless tenderly loved her baby-boy; and as
Ulpian grew to manhood he became the idol, at whose shrine
the brother and sister offered their pure and most intense
affection.</p>
<p>Neither had married, and when the youngest of the household
band completed his studies, and decided to accept a
naval appointment, the consternation and grief which the
announcement produced at the homestead, proved how essential
the presence of the half-brother had become to the happiness
of the sedate stolid Enoch, and equable unselfish
Jane. But the desire to travel subordinated all other sentiments
in Ulpian’s nature, and he eagerly embarked for a
cruise, from which he was recalled by tidings of the death of
his brother.</p>
<p>A brief sojourn at the homestead had sufficed to arrange
the affairs of the carefully-managed estate, and the young
surgeon returned to his post aboard ship, in distant oriental
seas. The increasing infirmity of his sister had finally induced
the resignation of his cherished commission, and
brought the man of thirty-five back to his home, where the
“old familiar faces” seemed to have vanished forever; and,
in lieu thereof, legions of cold-eyed strangers carelessly
confronted him.</p>
<p>Emancipated from all restraint, and early consigned to the
guidance of his boyish caprices and immature judgment, Ulpian
Grey’s character had unfolded itself under circumstances
peculiarly favorable for the fostering of selfishness and the
development of idiosyncrasies. As a plant, unmolested by
man and beast, germinates, expands, and freely
and completely manifests all its inherent tendencies, whether
detrimental or beneficial to humanity, so Dr. Grey’s matured
manhood was no distorted or discolored result of repeated
educational experiments, but a thoroughly normal efflorescence
of an unbiassed healthful nature.</p>
<p>Habits of unwavering application and searching study, contracted
in collegiate cloisters, tightened their grasp upon him,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_21"></a>21</span>
as he wandered away from the quiet precincts of <i>Alma Mater</i>
and into the crowded noisy campus of life; and even the
gregarious and convivial manners prevalent aboard ship failed
to divert his attention from the prosecution of scientific researches,
or to retard his rapid progress in classical scholarship.</p>
<p>For the treasures of knowledge thus patiently and indefatigably
garnered through a series of years, travel proved an
invaluable polyglot commentator, analyzing, comparing, annotating,
and italicizing, and had converted his mind into a vast,
systematically arranged pictorial encyclopædia of miscellaneous
lore, embellished with delicate etchings, noble engravings,
and gorgeous illuminations,—a thesaurus where <i>savants</i> might
seek successfully for <i>data</i>, and whence artists could derive
grand types, and pure tender coloring.</p>
<p>Reverent and loving appreciation of the intrinsically “true,
good, and beautiful” was part of the homage that his nature
rendered to its Creator, and instead of flowering into a morbid
and maudlin sentimentality which craves low-browed, long
straight-nosed, undraped statuettes in every nook and corner,—or
dwarfs the soul and pins it to the surplice of some
theologic <i>dogmata</i> claiming infallibility—or coffins the intellect
in cramped, shallow, psychological categories,—it bore
fruit in a wide-eyed, large-hearted, liberal-minded eclecticism,
which, waging no crusade against the various Saladins of
modern systems, quietly possessed itself of the really valuable
elements that constitute the basis of every ethical, æsthetic,
and scientific creed, which has for any length of time
levied black-mail on the credulity of mankind.</p>
<p>Breadth of intellectual vision promotes moral and emotional
expansion—for true catholicity of mind manufactures
charity in the heart; and toleration is the real mesmeric current
which brings the extremes of humanity <i>en rapport</i>,—is
the veritable ubiquitous Samaritan always provided with wine
and oil for the bruised and helpless, who are strewn along the
highway of life; and those who penetrated beyond the polished
surface of Dr. Grey’s character, realized that no tinge of cynicism,
no affectation of contempt for his country and countrymen
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_22"></a>22</span>
lurked in his heart, while erudition and foreign sojourning
seemed only to have warmed and intensified his sympathy
with all noble aims—his compassion for all grovelling ones.</p>
<p>That his compulsory return to the uneventful routine of
life at the homestead, involved a sacrifice which he would
gladly have avoided, he did not attempt to deny; but having
invested a large amount of earnest, vigorous faith in the final
conservatism of that much-abused monster which the seditious
army of the Disappointed anathematize as “Bad Luck,” he
went to work contentedly in this new sphere of action, and
waited patiently and trustfully for the slow grinding of the
great mill of Compensation, into whose huge hopper Fate had
unceremoniously poured all his plans.</p>
<p>His advent produced a very decided sensation not only in
the quiet neighborhood in which the farm was located, but
also in the adjacent town where the memory of Daniel Grey’s
meteoric ascent to pecuniosity still lingered in the minds of
the oldest citizens, and pleasantly paved the way for a cordial
reception of the fortunate son who inherited not only his
mother’s comeliness but his father’s hoarded wealth.</p>
<p>Living in the middle of the nineteenth century, and in a
hemisphere completely antipodal to that in which Utopia
was situated, or “Bensalem” dreamed of, the appearance of a
good-looking, well-educated, affluent bachelor could not fail to
stir all gossipdom to its dreg; and society, ever tenderly concerned
about the individual affairs of its prominent members,
was all agog—busily arranging for the <i>ci-devant</i> United
States Surgeon a programme, than which he would sooner
have undertaken the feats of Samson or the Avatars of
Vishnu.</p>
<p>His published card, announcing the fact that he had permanently
located in the city and was a patient candidate for
the privilege of setting fractured limbs and administering
medicine, somewhat dashed the expectations of many who conjected
that the Grey estate could not possibly be worth the
amount so long reputed, or the principal heir would certainly
not soil his fingers with pills and plasters, instead of sauntering
and dawdling with librettos, lorgnettes, meerschaums,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_23"></a>23</span>
and curiously-carved canes cut in the Hebrides or the jungles
of Java.</p>
<p>Over the door of that office, where the Angel of Death had
smitten his father thirty-five years before, a new sign swung
in the breeze, and showed the citizens the name of “Dr.
Ulpian Grey. Office hours from nine to ten, and from two
to three.”</p>
<p>The members of the profession called formally to welcome
him to a share of their annual profits, and collectively
gave him a dinner; the “best families” invited him to tea
or luncheon, croquet or “German,” and thus, having accomplished
his professional and social <i>début</i>, Ulpian Grey,
M.D., henceforth claimed and exercised the privilege of selecting
his associates, and employing his time as inclination
prompted.</p>
<p>In the comprehensive course of study to which he had so
long devoted his attention, he had not omitted that immemorial
stereotyped volume—Human Nature—which, despite
the attempted revisions of sages, politicians, and ecclesiastics,
remains as immutable as the everlasting hills; printing
upon the leaves of the youngest century phases of guilt
and guilelessness which find their prototypes in the gray dawn
of time, when the “morning stars sang together,”—yea, busy
to-day as of yore, slaughtering Abel, stoning Stephen, fretting
Moses, crucifying Christ. Finding much that was admirable,
and more that seemed ignoble, he gravely and
reverently sought to possess himself of the subtle arcana of
this marvellous book, rejecting as equally erroneous and unreliable
the magnifying zeal of optimism and the gloomy
jaundiced lenses of sneering pessimism,—thoroughly satisfied
that it was a solemn duty, obligatory upon all, to study
that complex paradoxical human nature, for the mastery of
which Lucifer and Jesus had ceaselessly battled since the day
when Adam and Eve were called “to dress and to keep” the
Garden by the Euphrates,—that heaven-born, heaven-cursed,
restless human nature, which now, as then,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_24"></a>24</span></div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Grasps at the fruitage forbidden,<br>
The golden pomegranates of Eden,<br>
To quiet its fever and pain.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>A few days’ residence under the same roof, and a guarded
observation of Salome’s conduct, sufficed to acquaint Dr. Grey
with the ungenerous motives that induced her chagrin at his
return; and, without permitting her to suspect that he had so
accurately read her character, he endeavored as unobtrusively
as possible to bridge by kindness and courtesy the chasm of
jealous distrust which divided them.</p>
<p>Indolent and self-indulgent, she neither brooked dictation,
nor gracefully accepted any suggestions at variance with the
reigning whim; for, since she became an inmate of Miss Jane’s
hospitable home, existence had been a mere dreamy, aimless
succession of golden dawns and scarlet-curtained sunsets—a
slow, quiet lapsing of weeks into months,—an almost stagnant
stream curled by no eddies, freighted with few aspirations,
bearing no drift.</p>
<p>The circumstances and associations of her early life had destroyed
her faith in abstract nobility of character; self-abnegation
she neither comprehended nor deemed possible; and
of a stern, innate moral heroism she was utterly sceptical;
consequently a delicately graduated scale of selfishness was the
sole balance by which she was wont to weigh men and women.</p>
<p>Her irregular method of study and desultory reading had
rather enervated than strengthened a mind naturally clear
and vigorous, and left its acquisitions in a confused and kaleidoscopic
mass, bordering upon intellectual salmagundi.</p>
<p>One warm afternoon, on his return from town, as Dr. Grey
ascended the steps he noticed Salome reclining on a bamboo
settee at the western end of the gallery, where the sunshine
was hot and glaring, unobstructed by the thin leafy screen of
vines that drooped from column to column on the southern
and eastern sides of the building. If conscious of his approach
she vouchsafed not the slightest intimation of it, and
when he stood beside her she remained so immovable that he
might have imagined her asleep but for the lambent light
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_25"></a>25</span>
which rayed out from eyes that seemed intently numbering
the soft fluttering young leaves on a distant clump of elm
trees, which made a lace-like tracery of golden glimmer and
quivering shadow on the purple-headed clover at their feet.</p>
<p>Her fair but long slender fingers carelessly held a book
that threatened to slip from their light relaxing grasp, and
compressing his lips in order to smother a smile under his
heavy moustache, Dr. Grey stooped and put his hand on her
plump white wrist, where the blue veins were running riot.</p>
<p>“So young,—yet cataleptic! Unfortunate, indeed,” he
murmured.</p>
<p>She shook off his touch, and instantly sat erect.</p>
<p>“I should be glad to know what you mean.”</p>
<p>“I have an admirable, nay, I venture to add, an almost infallible
prescription for catalepsy, which has cured two chronic
and apparently hopeless cases, and it will afford me great
pleasure to try the third experiment upon you, since you
seem pitiably in want of a remedy.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Were I as free from all other ills that ‘flesh
is heir to,’ as I certainly am of the taint of catalepsy, I might
indeed congratulate myself upon an immunity which would
obviate the dire necessity of ever meeting a physician.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure that you sufficiently understand the symptoms,
to recognize them unerringly?”</p>
<p>The rose tint in her cheeks deepened to scarlet, as she
haughtily drew herself up to her full height, and answered,—</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey himself is not more sagacious and adroit in detecting
them; especially when open eyes discover unwelcome
and disagreeable objects, which, wishing to avoid, they are
still compelled to see. I hope you are satisfied that I comprehend
you.”</p>
<p>“My meaning was not so occult as to justify a doubt upon
that subject; and moreover, Salome, lack of astuteness is far
from being your greatest defect. My motive should eloquently
plead pardon for my candor, if I venture to tell you that your
frequent affectation of unconsciousness of the presence of

years; for courtesy constitutes the keystone in the beautiful
arch of social amenities which vaults the temple of Christian
virtues. Lest you should take umbrage at my frankness,
which ought to assure you of my interest in your happiness
and improvement, permit me to remind you of the oriental
definition of a faithful friend, that has more pith than verbal
polish,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“The true friend is not he who holds up Flattery’s mirror,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>In which the face to thy conceit most pleasing hovers;<br>
But he who kindly shows thee all thy vices, sirrah!<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>And helps thee mend them ere an enemy discovers.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Rising, Salome swept him a profound courtesy, and, while
her fingers beat a tattoo on the book she held, she watched him
with a peculiar sparkle in her eyes, which he had already
learned to understand was a beacon flame kindled by intense
displeasure. Dr. Grey seated himself, and, taking off his
hat, said gently and winningly, as he pushed aside the hair
that clustered in brown rings over his forehead,—</p>
<p>“Here is ample room for both of us. Sit down, and be
reasonable; and let me catch a glimpse of the amiable elements
which I feel assured must exist somewhere in your
nature, notwithstanding your persistent endeavor to conceal
them. Your Janus character has hitherto breathed only war—war;
but, my young friend, I earnestly invoke its peaceful
phase.”</p>
<p>The kindness of tone and evident sincerity of manner
might have disarmed a prejudice better founded than hers;
but wrath consumed all scruples, and, recollecting his forbearance
with various former acts of rudeness, she presumed
to attempt further aggressions.</p>
<p>Waving her hand in tacit rejection of the proffered share of
the settee, she answered with more emphasis than perspicuity
demanded,—</p>
<p>“Does your reading of the book of Job encourage you to
believe that when those self-appointed counsellors—Eliphaz
the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—returned
to their respective homes, they had cause to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_27"></a>27</span>
congratulate themselves upon their cordial welcome to Job’s
bank of ashes, or felt bountifully repaid for their voluntary
mission of advice?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, no. My study of the record of the man
of Uz renders painfully patent that humiliating fact—old as
humanity—that sanctity of motive is no coat-of-mail to the
luckless few who bravely bear to the hearts of those with
whom they associate the unwelcome burden of unflattering
truths. Phraseology—definitions—vary with advancing centuries,
but not so the human impulses they express or explain;
and friendship in the days of Job was the identical ‘Mutual
Admiration Society,’ which at present converts its consistent
servile members into Damon and Pythias, but punishes any
violation of its canons with hatred dire and inextinguishable.
Were I blessed with the genius of Praxiteles or of Angelo, I
would chisel and bequeath to the world a noble statue,—typical
of that rare, fearless friendship, which, walking through
the lazaretto of diseased and morbid natures, bears not honied
draughts alone, but scalpel, caustic, and bitter tonics.”</p>
<p>The calm sweetness of voice and mien lent to his words an
influence which no amount of gall or satire could have imparted;
and, in the brief silence that ensued, Salome’s heart
was suddenly smitten with a humiliating consciousness of her
childish flippancy,—her utter inferiority to this man, who
seemed to walk serenely in a starry plane far beyond the mire
where she grovelled.</p>
<p>Ridicule braced and exaggerated her weaknesses, and the
strokes of sarcasm she could adroitly parry; but for persistent
magnanimity she was no match, and recoiled before it like the
traditional Fiend at sight of the <i>Santo Sudario</i>. Watching
her companion’s quiet countenance, she saw a shadow drift
over it, betokening neither anger nor scorn, but serious regret;
and involuntarily she drooped her head to avoid the eyes that
now turned full upon her.</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“Since</ins> I became a man, and to some extent capable of discriminating
with reference to the characters of persons with
whom I found myself in contact, I have made and invariably
observed one rule of conduct,—namely, never to associate with
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_28"></a>28</span>
those whom I cannot respect. Ignorance, want of refinement,
irritability of temper, and even lack of generous impulses,
I can forgive, when redeemed by candor and stern
honesty of purpose; but arrogance, dissimulation, and all-absorbing
selfishness I will not tolerate. In you I hoped and expected
better qualities than you permit me to find, and I
trust you will acquit me of intentional rudeness if I acknowledge
that you have painfully disappointed me. It was, and
still is, my earnest wish to befriend and to aid you,—to contribute
to your happiness, and cordially sympathize in any
annoyances that may surround you; but thus far you have
rendered it impossible for me to esteem you, and while I do
not presume that my good opinion is of any importance to
you, our present relations compel me to request that our
intercourse may in future be characterized by more urbanity
than has yet graced it. My sister has been much pained by
the feelings with which you evidently regard me, and since
you and I are merely guests under her roof, a due deference
to her wishes should certainly repress the exhibition of antipathies
towards those whom she loves. It is her earnest
desire (as expressed in a conversation which I had with her
yesterday) that I should treat you as a young sister; and, for
her sake, I offer you once more, and for the last time, my
hearty assistance in any department in which I am able to
render it.”</p>
<p>“The folds of your flag of truce do not conceal the drawn
sword beneath it; and let me tell you, sir, it is very evident
that ‘demand’ would far better have expressed your purpose
than the word ‘request.’”</p>
<p>“At least you should not be surprised if I doubt whether
you regard any truce as inviolable, and am inclined to suspect
you of latent treachery.”</p>
<p>“Your accusation of dissimulation is unjust, for I have
openly, fearlessly manifested my prejudice—my aversion.”</p>
<p>“That you dislike me is my misfortune, but that you
allow your detestation to generate discord in our small circle
is an error which I trust you will endeavor to correct. That I
have many faults I shall not attempt to deny; but mutual
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_29"></a>29</span>
forbearance will prove a mutual blessing. For Jane’s sake,
shall there not be peace between us?”</p>
<p>Standing before her, he looked gravely down into her face,
where flush and sparkle had died out, and saw—what she
was too proud to confess—that he had partially conquered her
waywardness, that she was reluctantly yielding to his influence;
but he understood her nature too thoroughly to pause
contented with this slight advantage in a contest which he
foresaw must determine the direction of her aims through life.</p>
<p>“Salome, I am waiting for your decision.”</p>
<p>Her lips stirred twice, but the words they framed were
either too haughty or too humble, for she refused them utterance;
and, while she deliberated, two tears settled the question
by rolling swiftly over her cheeks, and falling upon the cherry
ribbon at her throat.</p>
<p>Accepting it as a tacit signature to his terms of capitulation,
and satisfied with the result, Dr. Grey forbore to urge
verbal assurances. Taking the book from her hand, he said,
pleasantly,—</p>
<p>“Are you fond of French? I frequently find you poring
over your grammar.”</p>
<p>“I have never had a teacher, nor have I conquered the conjugations;
consequently, I know comparatively little about the
language.”</p>
<p>“Are you studying it with the intention of familiarizing
yourself with French literature, or merely to enable you to
translate the few phrases that modern writers sprinkle through
novels and essays?”</p>
<p>“For neither purpose, but simply because it is the court
language of the old world; and, if I should succeed in my hope
of visiting Europe, I might regret my ignorance of the universally
received medium of communication.”</p>
<p>“Have you, then, no desire to master those noble bursts of
eloquence by which Racine, Bossuet, Fénélon, and Cousin
have charmed the intellects of all nations?”</p>
<p>“None, whatever. I might as well tell you at once, what
you will inevitably discover ere long if you condescend to
inspect my meagre attainments, that for abstract study I have
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_30"></a>30</span>
no more inclination than to fondle some mummy in the
crypts of Cyrene, or play ‘blind man’s buff’ with the corpses
in the Morgue. My limited investments of time and
thought in intellectual stock have been made solely with
reference to speedy dividends of most practical and immediate
benefits; and knowledge <i>per se</i>—knowledge which will not
pay me handsome interest—has no more value in my eyes
than a handful of the dust of those Atures found in the
cavern of Ataruipe. Doubtless you think me pitiably benighted,
and possibly I might find more favor in your sight
if I affected a prodigious amount of literary enthusiasm, and
boundless admiration for scholarship and erudition; but that
would prove too troublesome an imposture,—for I am constitutionally,
habitually, and premeditatedly lazy.”</p>
<p>She saw a smile lurking under his heavy lashes, and half
ambushed in the corners of his mouth; and, vaguely conscious
that she was rendering herself ridiculous, she bit her lip with
ill-disguised vexation.</p>
<p>“Salome, I am afraid that under the garb of a jest you
are making me acquainted with a very mournful truth. You
have probably never heard of Lessing,—Gotthold Ephraim
Lessing.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I am not quite as ignorant as a Pitcairn’s Islander;
and I think I have somewhere seen that such a person as
Lessing lived at Wolfenbüttel. He once said, ‘The chase is
always worth more than the quarry.’ And again, ‘Did the
Almighty, holding in his right hand Truth, and in his left
Search after Truth, <ins title="Was deigned">deign</ins> to proffer me the one I might
prefer,—in all humility, but without hesitation, I should
request Search after Truth.’ When you have nothing more
important to occupy your attention, give ten minutes’ reflection
to his admonition, and perhaps it may declare a dividend
years hence. Last week I found your algebra on the
rug before the library grate, and noticed several sums worked
out in pencil on the margin. Are you fond of mathematics?”</p>
<p>“Not that I am aware of.”</p>
<p>“What progress have you made?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_31"></a>31</span></div>
<p>“My knowledge of arithmetic is barely sufficient to take
me through a brief shopping expedition.”</p>
<p>“Have you no ambition to increase it?”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I have no ambition. That ‘last infirmity of
noble minds’ has never attacked me; and, folding my hands,
I chant ceaselessly to my soul, ‘Take thine ease, eat, drink,
and be merry.’ The rapture of the mathematician, who bows
before the shrine of his favorite science, is to my dull intellect
as incomprehensible as the jargon of metaphysics or the mysteries
wrapped up in Pali cerements. Equations, conic sections,
differential calculus, constitute a skull and cross-bones
to which I allow as wide a berth as possible.”</p>
<p>The weary dissatisfied expression of her large, luminous
eyes, belied the sneer in her voice and the curl of her thin
lip, and it cost her an effort to answer his next question.</p>
<p>“Will you tell me what rule you have adopted for the distribution
of your time, and the government of your life?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; you are heartily welcome to it: ‘Yet a little
slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.’ <i>Laissez nous
faire</i>. Moreover, Dr. Grey, if you will courteously lend me
your ears, I will favor you with a still more felicitous exposition
of my invaluable organon.”</p>
<p>Stooping suddenly, she raised from the floor a small volume
which had been concealed by her dress, and, as it opened at a
page stained with the juice of a purple convolvulus, she smiled
defiantly, and read with almost scornful emphasis,—</p>

<p>With a degree of gravity that trenched on sternness, he
bowed, and answered,—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Salome, you look so weary that I must insist upon
relieving you. Give me the book and run out for a breath of
fresh air—a glimpse of blue sky.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey laid his hand on the volume, but the girl shook
her head and pushed aside his fingers.</p>
<p>“I am not at all tired, and even if I were it would make
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_33"></a>33</span>
no difference. Miss Jane desires me to read this sermon
aloud, and I shall finish it.”</p>
<p>The invalid, who had been confined to her bed for many
days by a severe attack of rheumatism, partially raised herself
on one elbow, and said,—</p>
<p>“My dear, give him the book, while you take a little exercise.
You have been pent up here long enough, and, moreover,
I want to talk to Ulpian about some business matters.
Don’t look so sullen, my child; it makes no difference who
reads the sermon to me. Kiss me, and run out on the lawn.”</p>
<p>The orphan relinquished chair and book, but there was no
relaxation of her bent brows, and neither warmth nor lingering
pressure in the firm, hardly drawn lips, which lightly
touched the old lady’s sallow, wrinkled cheek. When she had
left the room, closing the door after her with more force than
was requisite to bolt it securely, Miss Jane sighed heavily, and
turned to her brother.</p>
<p>“Poor thing! She is so jealous of you; and it distresses me
to see that no friendship grows up between you, as I hoped
and believed would be the case. If you would only notice her
a little more I think you might win her over.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to time, Janet. I ‘have piped unto her and she
would not dance; I have mourned unto her, and she has not
lamented,’—and concessions only feed her waywardness. If
there be a residuum of good sense and proper feeling in her
nature, they will assert themselves after a while; if not, all
extraneous influences are futile. I will resume the reading,
if agreeable to you.”</p>
<p>Moody and rebellious, Salome stood for some moments on
the threshold of the front door, staring vacantly out over the
lawn; then, snatching her hat from a hook in the hall, she
swiftly crossed the grounds, climbed over a low lattice fence
at the foot of the declivity, and followed a worn but neglected
path leading into the adjoining forest.</p>
<p>The sanctity of the Sabbath afternoon rested like a benison
over the silent glades, where sunshine made golden roads along
the smooth brown pine straw, and glinted on the purple flags
that fluttered in the mild west wind. Even the melancholy
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_34"></a>34</span>
plaint of sad-eyed dun doves was hushed, as they slowly swung
in the swaying pine-tops; and two young lambs, neglected by
the wandering flock, lay sleeping quietly, with their snowy
heads pillowed on clustering violets,—far from the fold, forgotten
by their mothers, at the mercy of strolling dogs,
watched only by the Great Shepherd.</p>
<p>Salome’s rapid pace soon placed a mile between her and the
fence that bounded the lawn; and, pushing through the dense
undergrowth which betokened the proximity of a stream, she
stood ere long on the margin of a wide pond which supplied
the broad, shining sheet of beryl water that poured over the
rocky dam, close to the large irregular building called “Grey’s
Mill.”</p>
<p>Piles of lumber were bleaching in the sunshine, but the
machinery was at rest, the workmen were all absent, and not
a sound broke the stillness, save the steady, monotonous chant
of the water leaping down into the race, where a thousand
foam-flakes danced along towards the huge wheels, and died
on the soft green mosses and lush-creepers that stole down to
bathe in the sparkling wavelets. The knotted roots of an old
beech tree furnished a resting-place, and Salome sat down
and leaned her head against the scarred trunk, where lightning
had once girdled and partially destroyed it,—leaving
one-half the branches leafy, the remainder scorched and barren.</p>
<p>Overhanging willows darkened the edges of the pond; and,
in the centre, one tall, venerable cypress, lonely as some palm
in the desert, rose like a gray shaft tufted with a fine fringe
of fresh green; and occasional clusters of broad, shining
leaves, spread themselves on the surface of the water, cradling
large, snowy lilies, whose gold-powdered stamens trembled
ceaselessly. Now and then a trout leaped up, as if for a
breath of May air, and fell back into the circle that widened
until it touched either bank; and not far from a cow who
stood knee-deep in water, browsing on a wild rose that clambered
over the willows to peep at its pink image in the pond, a
proud pair of gray geese convoyed a brood of yellow younglings
that dived and breasted the ripples with evident glee.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_35"></a>35</span></div>
<p>With her arms clasped around her knees, Salome sat watching
the blue tendrils of smoke that rose from a clump of elms
beyond the mill and curled lazily upward until they lost themselves
in air; and, though the arching elm boughs hid mossy
roof and chimney, she nevertheless felt that she was looking
on the old house where she was born, and where ten dreary
years of sorrow and humiliation had embittered and perverted
her nature.</p>
<p>Those elms had seen her mother die, had heard her father’s
drunken revelry, and bent their aged heads to listen on that
wild wintry night, when in blood-curdling curses his soul rent
itself from the degraded tenement of clay. Apparently peace
brooded over earth, sky, and water; but to that lonely figure
under the riven beech, every object within the range of vision
babbled horrible tales of the early years, and memory pointed
to a corner of the lumber-shed adjoining the mill where she
had often secreted herself to avoid her father’s brutality,—always
keeping her head in the moonshine, because she dreaded
the darkness inside, which childish fancy filled with ghostly
groups. She hated the place as she hated the past, and this
was the second time she had visited it since the day that consigned
her to the poor-house; for it was impossible for her
to look at the pond without recollecting one dark passage in
her life, known only to God and herself. To-day she recalled,
with startling vividness a dusky, starlit June evening, when,
maddened by an unmerited and unusually severe punishment
inflicted by her father, she had resolved to drown herself, and
find peace in the mud at the bottom of the mill-pond. Placing
her infant sister on the grass, she had kissed her good-by,
and selecting the deepest portion of the water, had climbed
out on a willow branch and prepared for the final plunge.
Putting her fingers in her ears that she might not hear the
bubbling of the murderous water, she shut her eyes and
sprang into the pond; but her long hair caught the willow
twigs, and, half strangled and quite willing to live, she scrambled
up into the low limbs that seemed so anxious to rescue
her from a watery grave; and, dripping and trembling, crept
back to the house, comforting herself with the grim assurance
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_36"></a>36</span>
that whatever else might befall, she certainly was not foreordained
to be either beaten to death or drowned. The impulse
which had brought her on this occasion to a scene so fraught
with harrowing memories, was explicable only by the supposition
that its painful surroundings were in consonance with
the bitter and despondent mood in which she found herself;
and, in the gloom that this retrospection shed over her countenance,
her features seemed to grow wan and angular. For
several days she had been sorely disquieted by the realization
of Miss Jane’s rapidly failing strength; and the probability
of her death, which a year ago would have been entirely endurable
as an avenue to wealth, now appeared the direst
catastrophe that had yet threatened her ill-starred life.</p>
<p>It was distressing to think of the kind old face growing stiff
in a shroud, but infinitely more appalling to contemplate the
possibility of being turned out of a comfortable home and
driven to labor for a maintenance. Salome had a vague impression
that either Providence or the world owed her a luxurious
future, as partial compensation for her juvenile
miseries; but since both seemed disposed to repudiate the debt,
she was reluctantly compelled to ponder her prospective bankruptcy
in worldly goods, and, like the unjust steward, while
unwilling to work she was still ashamed to beg.</p>
<p>Although she strenuously resisted the strong, steady influence
so quietly exerted by Dr. Grey, the best elements of her
nature, long dormant, began to stir feebly, and she was conscious
of nobler aspirations than those which had hitherto
swayed her; and of a dimly-defined self-dissatisfaction that was
novel and annoying. Unwilling to admit that she valued his
good opinion, she nevertheless felt chagrined at her failure
to possess it, and gradually she realized her utter inferiority
to this man, whose consistent Christian character commanded
an entire respect which she had never before entertained for
any human being. Immersed in vexing thoughts concerning
her future, she mechanically stretched out her hand to pluck
a bunch of phlox and of lemon-hued primroses that were nodding
in the sunshine close to her feet; but, as she touched the
stems, a large copper-colored snake slowly uncoiled from the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_37"></a>37</span>
tuft of grass where they nestled and, gliding into the water,
disappeared in the midst of the lilies.</p>
<p>“I wonder if throughout life all the flowers I endeavor to
grasp will prove only Moccasin-beds! Why should they,—unless
God abdicates and Satan reigns? I have found, to my
cost, that existence is not made entirely of rainless June days;
but I doubt whether darkness and storms shut out the warm
glow and perpetually curtain the stars. Obviously I am no
saint; still, I am disposed to believe I am not altogether
wicked. I have committed no capital sins, nor grievously
transgressed the decalogue,—and why should I despair of my
share of the good things of life? I am neither Cain nor Jezebel,
and therefore Fates and Furies have no warrant to dog
my footsteps. Moreover, how do I know that Destiny is indeed
the hideous, vindictive crone that luckless wretches have
painted her, instead of an amiable, good soul, who is quite
as willing to scatter blessings as curses? Because some dyspeptic
Greek dreamed of three pitiless old weavers, blind to
human tears, deaf to human petitions, why should we wise
and enlightened people of the nineteenth century scare ourselves
with the skeleton of Paganism? I have as inalienable a
right to brocades, crown-jewels, and a string of titles, as any
reigning queen, provided I can only get my hands upon them;
and, since life seems to be a sort of snatch-and-hold game,
quick keen eyes and nimble fingers decide the question. I
have never trodden on the world’s tender toes, nor smitten its
pet follies, nor set myself aloft to gaze pityingly on its degradation,
therefore, the world honors me with no special grudge.
But one thing is mournfully certain,—my path is not strewn
with loaves and fishes ready baked and broiled, and I must
even go gleaning and fishing for myself. Almost everybody
has some gift or some mission; but I really do not see in what
direction I can set to work. Work! How I hate the bare
thought! I have not sufficient education to teach, nor genius
to write, nor a talent for drawing, and barely music enough in
my soul to enable me to carry the church tunes respectably.
Come, Salome Owen! Shake off your sloth, and face the
abominable fact that you must earn your own bread. It is a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_38"></a>38</span>
great shame, and I ought not to be obliged to work, for I am
not responsible for my existence, and those who brought me
into the world owed it to me to provide for my wants. I cannot
and will not forgive my father and mother; but that will
not mend matters, since, nevertheless, here I am, with a body
to feed and clothe, and God only knows how I am to accomplish
it. I find myself with youth, health, some beauty, an
average share of intellect, and all the wants pertaining thereunto.
If the worst comes to the worst I suppose I can contrive,
like other poverty-stricken girls, to marry somebody who
will support me comfortably; but that is rather an uncertain
speculation, and meantime Miss Jane might die. Now, if the
Bible is true, it must indeed be a blessed lot to be born a
brown sparrow, and have the Lord for a commissary. I am
a genuine child of old Adam, and labor is the heaviest curse
that could possibly be sent upon me.”</p>
<p>Once or twice during this profitless reverie she had paused
to listen to a singular sound that came from a dense group
of willows not far from the spot where she sat, and now it
grew louder, swelling into a measured cry, as of a child in
great distress.</p>
<p>“Somebody in trouble, but it does not concern me; I have
enough and to spare, of my own.”</p>
<p>She settled herself once more quite comfortably, but the
low, monotonous wail, smote her heart, and womanly sympathy
with suffering strangled her constitutional selfishness.
Rising, she crept cautiously along the edge of the pond until
she reached the thicket whence the sound proceeded, and, as
she pushed aside the low branches and peeped into the cool,
green nook, her eyes fell upon the figure of a little boy who
lay on the ground, rolling from side to side and sobbing violently.</p>
<p>“What is the matter? Are you sick or hungry?”</p>
<p>Startled by the sound of her voice, the child uttered a
scream of terror, and whirled over, hiding his face in the
leaves and grass.</p>
<p>“For Heaven’s sake, stop howling! What are you about,—wallowing
here in the mud, ruining your clothes, and yelling
like a hyena? Hush, and get up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please, ma’am, don’t tell on me! Don’t carry me
back, and I will hush!”</p>
<p>“Where do you live?”</p>
<p>“Nowhere. Oh!—oh!” And he renewed his cries.</p>
<p>“A probable story. What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t got any name.”</p>
<p>“You have no name, and you live nowhere? Come, little
fellow, this will never do. I am afraid you are a very bad boy
and have run away from home to escape being punished.
Hush this instant!”</p>
<p>He had kept his face carefully concealed, and, resolved to
ascertain the truth, Salome stooped and tried to lift him; but
he struggled desperately, and screamed frantically,—</p>
<p>“Let me alone! I won’t go back! I will jump into the
pond and drown myself if you don’t let me alone.”</p>
<p>He was so hoarse from constant crying that she could recognize
no familiar tones in his voice, but a great dread seized
her, and, suddenly putting her hands under his head, she
forced the face up, and looked at the flushed, swollen features.</p>
<p>“Stanley! Is it possible? My poor little brother!”</p>
<p>The equally astonished boy started up, and stared half wistfully,
half fearfully, at the figure standing before him.</p>
<p>“Is it you, Salome? I did not know you.”</p>
<p>“How came you here? When did you leave the Asylum?”</p>
<p>“I ran away, three days ago.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I was tired of living there, and I wanted to come
back home.”</p>
<p>“Home, indeed! You miserable begger, don’t you know
you have no home but the Orphan Asylum?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have. I want to come back yonder. Don’t you see
home yonder, among the trees, with the pretty white and
speckled pigeons flying over it?”</p>
<p>He pointed across the pond to the old house beyond the
mill, whose outlines were visible through the openings in the
elms; and, as he gazed upon it with that intense longing so
touching in a child’s face, his sobs increased.</p>
<p>“Stanley, that is not your home now. Other people live
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_40"></a>40</span>
there, and you have no right to come back. Why did you run
away from the Asylum? Did they treat you unkindly?”</p>
<p>“No,—yes. They whipped me because I cried and said I
hated to stay there, and wanted to come home.”</p>
<p>Salome looked at the soiled, torn clothes, and sorrowful
face; and, bursting into tears, she bent forward and drew her
brother to her bosom. He put his arms around her neck, and
kissed her cheek several times, saying, softly and coaxingly,—</p>
<p>“Sister Salome, you won’t send me back, will you? Please
let me stay with you, and I will be a good boy.”</p>
<p>For some minutes she was unable to reply, and wept
silently as she smoothed the tangled hair back from the
child’s white forehead and pressed her lips to it.</p>
<p>“Stanley, how is Jessie? Where did you leave her?”</p>
<p>“She is well, and I left her at the Asylum. She had a long
cry the night I ran away, and said she wanted to see you, and
she thought you had forgotten us both. You know, Salome,
it is over a year since you came to see us, and Jessie and I are
so lonesome there, we hate the place.”</p>
<p>“What were you crying so bitterly about when I found you,
just now?”</p>
<p>“I am so hungry, and the man who lives yonder at home
drove me away. He said I was prowling around to steal something,
and if he saw me there any more he would shoot me. I
ate my last piece of biscuit yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Why did you not come to me instead of the miller?”</p>
<p>“I was afraid you would send me back to the Asylum; but
you won’t,—I know you won’t, Salome.”</p>
<p>“Suppose I had not happened to hear you crying,—what
would have become of you? Did you intend to starve here in
the swamp?”</p>
<p>“I thought I would wait till the miller left home, and then
beg his wife to give me some bread, and, if I could get nothing,
I was going to pull up some carrots that I saw growing
in a field back of the house. Oh, Salome, I am so hungry and
so tired!”</p>
<p>She sat down on a heap of last year’s leaves, which autumn
winds and winter rains had driven against the trunk of a decayed
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_41"></a>41</span>
and fallen sweet-gum, and, drawing the weary head
with its shock of matted yellow curls to her lap, she covered
her own face with her hands to hide the hot tears that
streamed over her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Salome, are you very mad with me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Stanley; you have behaved very badly, and I don’t
know what I ought to do with you.”</p>
<p>He tried to put aside one of her shielding hands, and failing,
wound his arms around her waist, and nestled as close as
possible.</p>
<p>“Sister, please let me stay and live with you, and I promise—I
declare—I will be a good boy.”</p>
<p>“Poor little fellow! You don’t in the least know what you
are talking about. How can you live with me when I have no
home, and not a dollar?”</p>
<p>“I thought you stayed with a rich lady, and had everything
nice that you wanted.”</p>
<p>“I do not expect to have even a shelter much longer. The
lady who takes care of me is sick, and cannot live very long;
and, when she dies, I don’t know where I shall go or what I
may be obliged to do.”</p>
<p>“If you will only keep me I will help you work. At the
Asylum I saw wood, and pick peas, and pull out grass and
weeds from the strawberry vines, and sometimes I sweep the
yards. Just try me a little while, Salome, and see how smart
I can be.”</p>
<p>“Would you be willing to leave poor little Jessie at the
Asylum? If she felt so lonesome when you were there, how
will she get along without you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, we could steal her out some night, and keep her with
us. Salome, I tell you I don’t mean to go back there. I will
die first. I will drown myself, or run away to sea. I would
rather starve to death here in the swamp. Everybody else
can get a home, and why can’t we?”</p>
<p>“Because your father was a drunkard, and left his children
to the charity of the poor-house; and, God knows, I heartily
wish we were all screwed down in the same coffin with him.
You and I, Jessie, and Mark, and Joel are all beggars—miserable
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_42"></a>42</span>
beggars! Hush, Stanley, you will sob yourself into a
fever! Stop crying, I say, if you do not want to drive me
crazy! I thought I had trouble enough, without being tormented
by the sight of your poor, wretched face; and now,
what to do with you I am sure I don’t know. There—do be
quiet. Take your arms away; I don’t want you to kiss me any
more.”</p>
<p>In the long silence that succeeded, the child, spent with
grief and fatigue, fell into a sound sleep, and Salome sat with
his head in her lap and her clasped hands resting on her knee.</p>
<p>The afternoon slowly wore away, and the dimpled pond
caught lengthening shadows on its surface as the sun dipped
into the forest. The measured tinkle of a distant bell told
that the cows were wending quietly homeward; and, while the
miller’s wife drove her geese into the yard, the pigeons nestled
in their leafy coverts high among the elm arches, and the
solemn serenity of coming summer night stole with velvet
tread over the scene, silencing all things save the silvery barcarolle
of the falling water, and the sweet, lonely vesper hymn
of a whippoorwill, half hidden in the solitary cypress.</p>
<p>Although tears came very rarely to her eyes, the orphan had
wept bitterly, and, surprised at finding herself so completely
unnerved on this occasion, she made a powerful effort to regain
her composure and usual stolidity of expression. Shaking
the little sleeper, she said,—</p>
<p>“Wake up, Stanley. Get your hat and come with me, at
least for to-night.”</p>
<p>The child was too weary to renew the conversation, and,
hand in hand, the two walked silently on until they approached
the confines of the farm, when Salome suddenly
paused at sight of Dr. Grey, who was crossing the pine forest
just in front of them. Pressing his sister’s hand, Stanley
looked up and asked, timidly,—</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with me?”</p>
<p>“Hush! I have not fully decided.”</p>
<p>She endeavored to elude observation by standing close to
the body of a large pine, but Dr. Grey caught a glimpse of her
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_43"></a>43</span>
fluttering dress, and came forward rapidly, carrying in his
arms one young lamb and driving another before him.</p>
<p>“Salome, will you be so good as to assist me in shepherding
this obstinate little waif? It has been running hither and
thither for nearly half an hour, taking every direction but the
right one. If you will either walk on and lower the bars for
me or drive this lamb while I go forward, you will greatly
oblige me. Pardon me,—you look distressed. Something
painful has occurred, I fear.”</p>
<p>The girl’s usually firm mouth trembled as she laid her hand
on the torn straw hat that shaded Stanley’s features, and answered,
hurriedly,—</p>
<p>“Yes. We have both stumbled upon stray lambs; but mine,
unfortunately, happens to prove my youngest brother, and,
since I am neither Reuben nor Judah, I could not leave him in
the woods to perish. Stanley, run on and pull down the bars
yonder, where you see the sheep looking through the fence.”</p>
<p>“How old is he?”</p>
<p>“About eight years, I believe, but he is small for his age.”</p>
<p>“He does not in the least resemble you.”</p>
<p>“No; pitiable little wretch, he looks like nothing but destitution!
When a poor man dies, leaving a houseful of beggarly
orphans, the State ought to require the undertaker who buries
him to shoot or hang the whole brood, and lay them all in
the Potter’s Field out of the world’s way.”</p>
<p>“Such words and sentiments are strangely at variance with
the affectionate gentleness and resignation which best become
womanly lips, and I pity the keen suffering that wrings them
from yours. He who ‘setteth the solitary in families’ never
yet failed in loving guardianship of trusting orphanage, and
certainly you have no cause to upbraid fate, or impiously murmur
against the decrees of your God.”</p>
<p>He stood before her, with one hand stroking the head of the
lamb that nestled on his bosom; but his face was sterner, his
voice far more severe, than she had ever known either before,
and her eyes fell beneath the grave and sorrowful rebuke
which looked out from his.</p>
<p>“Your brother ran away from the Asylum, three days ago.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_44"></a>44</span></div>
<p>“How did you ascertain that fact?”</p>
<p>“About an hour after you left the house, the matron of the
Asylum sent to <ins title="Was inqure">inquire</ins> whether you were aware of his absence,
and to notify you that your little sister Jessie is quite ill. I
was searching for you, when I accidentally found these lambs,
deserted by their mother. Thank you, Stanley; I will put up
the bars, and you can go to the house with your sister. Salome,
the carriage is ready, and if you desire to see Jessie immediately
I will take you over as soon as possible. There is
a full moon, and you can return with me or remain at the
Asylum until morning. Confer with my sister concerning
the disposal of this little refugee.”</p>
<p>He patted the boy’s head, and entered the sheepfold, while
Salome stood leaning against the fence, looking vacantly
down at the bleating flock.</p>
<p>Catching her brother’s hand, she hurried to the house,
bathed his face, brushed his disordered hair, and gave him a
bountiful supper of bread and milk; after which, Jane Grey
ordered the little culprit brought to her bedside, where she
delivered a kind lecture on his sinful disobedience. When Dr.
Grey entered the room, Salome was standing at the window,
while Stanley clung to her dress, hiding his face in its folds,
vowing vehemently that he would not return to the Asylum,
and protesting with many sobs that he would be the best boy
in the world if he were only allowed to remain at the farm.</p>
<p>“Salome, do quiet him; he will fret himself into a fever,”
said Miss Jane, whose nerves began to quiver painfully.</p>
<p>“He has it already,” answered the girl, without turning
her head. She did not observe Dr. Grey’s entrance, and when
he <ins title="Was aproached">approached</ins> the window, where the mellow moonshine
streamed full on her face, he saw tears stealing over her
cheeks, and noticed that her fingers were clenched tightly.</p>
<p>“Salome, do you wish to see Jessie to-night? She has had
convulsions during the day, and may not live until morning.”</p>
<p>She looked up at his grave, noble countenance, and her lips
fluttered as she answered, huskily,—</p>
<p>“I can do nothing for her, and why should I see her die?”</p>
<p>“To whose care was she committed by her dying mother?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_45"></a>45</span></div>
<p>“To mine.”</p>
<p>“Have you faithfully kept the sacred trust?”</p>
<p>“I did all that I could until Miss Jane placed her in the
asylum.”</p>
<p>“Does your conscience acquit you?”</p>
<p>She silently dropped her face in her hands, and for some
seconds he watched her anxiously.</p>
<p>“Have you and Janet decided what shall be done with
Stanley?”</p>
<p>“No; the longer I ponder the matter, the more confused my
mind becomes.”</p>
<p>“Will you leave it in my hands, and abide by my decision?”</p>
<p>“Yes, gladly.”</p>
<p>“You promise to be satisfied with any course upon which I
may resolve?”</p>
<p>Looking up quickly, she exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Oh, yes; I trust you, fully. Do what you think best.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey put his hand under Stanley’s chin, and, lifting his
face, examined his countenance and felt his pulse.</p>
<p>“He is only frightened and fatigued. Put him to bed at
once in your room, and then let me take you to see little Jessie.
If you fail to go, you might reproach yourself in coming
years.”</p>
<p>It was nine o’clock when the carriage stopped at the door
of the Asylum, and Salome and Dr. Grey went up to the “Infirmary,”
where the faithful matron sat beside one of the little
beds, watching the deep slumber of the flushed and exhausted
sleeper.</p>
<p>The disease had almost spent its force, the crisis was passed,
and the attending physician had pronounced the patient much
better; still, when Salome stooped to kiss her sister, the
matron held her back, assuring her that perfect quiet was essential
for her recovery. Kneeling there beside the motherless
girl, Salome noted the changes that time and suffering had
wrought on the delicate features; and, as she listened to the
quick, irregular breathing, the fountain of tenderness was suddenly
unsealed in her own nature, and she put out her arms,
yearning to clasp Jessie to her heart. So strong were her
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_46"></a>46</span>
emotions, so keen was her regret for past indifference and neglect,
that she lost all self-control, and, unable to check her
passionate weeping, Dr. Grey led her from the room, promising
to bring her again when the sick child was sufficiently
strong to bear the interview.</p>
<p>During the ride homeward he made no effort to divert her
thoughts or relieve her anxiety, knowing that although severe
it was a healthful regimen for her long indurated heart, and
was the <i>rénaissance</i> of her better nature.</p>
<p>When they arrived at home, the moon was shining bright
and full, and, as they waited on the gallery for a servant to
open the door, Dr. Grey drew most favorable auguries from
the chastened, blanched face, with its humbled and grieved
expression.</p>
<p>“Salome, I shall for the present keep Stanley here; and,
until I can make some satisfactory arrangement with reference
to his education, I would be glad to have you hear his recitations
every day. Have you the requisite leisure to superintend
his lessons?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I have not deserved this kindness from you, Dr.
Grey; but I thank you, from my inmost heart. You are good
enough to forgive my many offences, and I shall not soon forget
it.”</p>
<p>“Salome, you owe me no gratitude, but there is much for
which you should go down on your knees and fervently thank
your merciful God. My young friend, will you do this?”</p>
<p>He extended his hand, and, unable to utter a word, Salome
gave him hers, for a second only, and hastened to her own
room, where Stanley’s fair face lay in the golden moonlight,
radiant with happy dreams of white pigeons and pet lambs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Don’t strangle me, Jessie! Put down your arms, and
listen to me. Sobbing will not mend matters, and you might
as well make up your mind to be patient. Of course I should
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_47"></a>47</span>
like to take you with me, if I had a home; but, as I told you
just now, we are so poor that we must live where we can, not
where we prefer. Because I wear nice pretty clothes do you
suppose I have a pocketful of money? I have not a cent to
buy even a loaf of bread, and I can’t ask Miss Jane to take
care of you as well as of Stanley and myself. Poor little
thing, don’t cry so! I know you are lonely here without Stanley,
but it can’t be helped. Jessie, don’t you see that it can
not be helped?”</p>
<p>“I don’t eat so very much, and I could sleep with Buddie
and wouldn’t be in the way,—and I can wear my old clothes.
Oh, please, Salome! I will die if you leave me here.”</p>
<p>“You will do no such thing; you are getting well as fast as
possible. Crying never kills people,—it only makes their
heads ache, and their eyes red and ugly. See here, if you
don’t stop all this, I shall quit coming to see you! Do you
hear what I say?”</p>
<p>The only reply was a fresh sob, which the child strove to
smother by hiding her face in Salome’s lap.</p>
<p>The matron, who sat by the open window, looked up from
the button-hole she was working, and, clearing her throat,
said,—</p>
<p>“Better let her have her cry out,—that is the surest cure
for such troubles as hers. She was always manageable and
good enough until Stanley ran away, and since then she does
nothing but mope and bite her finger-nails. Cry away, Jessie,
and have done with it. Ah, miss, the saddest feature about
Asylums is the separation of families; and if the matron had
a heart of stone it would melt sometimes at sight of these
little motherless things clinging to each other. I’m sure I
have shed a gallon of tears since I came here. It is a fearful
responsibility to take charge of an institution like this, for if
I try to make the children respect my authority, and behave
themselves properly, outsiders ’specially the neighbors, says I
am too severe; and if I let them frolic and romp and make as
much din and uproar as they like, why, then the same folks
scandalize me and the managers, and say there is no sort of
discipline maintained. I verily believe, miss, that if an angel
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_48"></a>48</span>
came down from heaven to matronize these children, before
six months elapsed all the godliness would be worried out of
her soul by the slanders of the public and the squabbles of the
children. Now I don’t confess to be an angel, but I do claim
a conscience, and God knows I make it a rule to treat these
orphans exactly as I treated my own and only child, whom I
buried three years ago. Do you suppose that any woman who
has laid her first-born in its coffin could be brutal enough to
maltreat poor little motherless lambs? I don’t deny that
sometimes I am compelled to punish them, for it is as much
my duty to whip them for bad conduct as to see that their
meals are properly cooked and their clothes kept in order. Am
I to let them grow up thieves and liars? Must I stand by and
see them pull out each other’s hair and bite off one another’s
ears?”</p>
<p>“Of course not, Mrs. Collins. You must preserve some
discipline.”</p>
<p>“Must I? Well, miss, I will show you how beautifully that
sounds and how poorly it works. There is your brother Stanley
(I mean no offence, miss, but special cases explain better
than generalities),—there’s your brother Stanley, who ran
away—for what?”</p>
<p>“Because he was homesick and wanted to see me.”</p>
<p>“No such thing, begging your pardon. Perhaps he told
you that, but remember there are always two sides to every
tale. The truth of the matter is just this: Stanley has an ugly
habit of cursing, which I will not tolerate; and, twice when I
heard him swearing at the other children, I shamed him well
and slapped him soundly. Last week I told him and Joe
Clark to shell a basket of peas, while the cook was making
some ginger-bread for them, and before I was out of the
room they commenced quarrelling. They raised such an uproar
that I came back and saw the whole fray. Stanley cursed
Joe, who expostulated and tried to pacify him, and when he
finally threatened to tell me that Stanley was cursing again,
your brother snatched a hatchet that was lying on the dresser
and swore he would kill him if he did. He aimed a blow at
Joe’s head, but slipped on the pea-hulls, and the hatchet
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_49"></a>49</span>
struck the boy’s right foot, cutting off one of his toes. Now
what would you have done, under the circumstances,—allowed
the children to be tomahawked in that style? You say I must
have discipline. Well, miss, I tried to ‘discipline’ Stanley’s
wickedness out of him by giving him a whipping, and the end
of the matter was that he ran away that afternoon. That is
not the worst of it,—for the children all know the facts, and
since they find that Stanley Owen can run away and be sustained
in his disobedience, of course it tends to demoralize
them. So I say that if I do my duty I am lashed by the
tongues of people who know nothing of the circumstances;
and if I fail to perform my duty I am lashed by my own conscience,—and
between the two I have a sorrowful time; for
I declare to you, miss, that Stephen’s martyrdom was a small
affair in comparison with what I pass through every week. I
love the children and try to be kind to them, but I can’t have
them cursing and swearing like sailors, and scalping each
other. I must either raise them like Christians, or resign my
situation to some one who is ‘wise as serpents and harmless as
doves.’ It is all very fine to talk of ‘proper discipline’ in
charitable institutions; but, miss, in the name of common
sense, how can I get along unless the friends of the children
sustain me? Did you punish Stanley, and send him back?
On the contrary, you countenanced his bad conduct and kept
him with you, and it is perfectly natural that little Jessie here
should be dissatisfied and anxious to join him. I can’t scold
her, for I know she misses her brother, who was always very
tender and considerate in his treatment of her.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate the difficulties which surround you, and believe
that you are conscientiously striving to do your duty towards
these children; but I knew that if I compelled Stanley
to return it would augment instead of correcting the mischief.”</p>
<p>At this juncture the matron was summoned from the room,
and, during the silence that ensued, Jessie climbed into her
sister’s lap, wound her thin arms around her neck, and softly
rubbed her pale cheek against the polished rosy face, where
perplexity and annoyance were legibly written.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_50"></a>50</span></div>
<p>“Salome, don’t you love me a little?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do; Jessie, don’t be so foolish.”</p>
<p>“Please let me go with you and Stanley.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to starve,—you poor silly thing?”</p>
<p>“Yes; I would rather starve with Buddie than stay here by
myself.”</p>
<p>“I want to hear no more of such nonsense. You have not
tried starving, and you are too young to know what is really
for your good. Now, listen to me. At present I am obliged
to leave you here,—come, don’t begin crying again; but, if you
will be a good girl and try not to fret over what cannot be
helped, I promise you that just as soon as I can possibly support
you I will take you to live with me.”</p>
<p>“How long must I wait?”</p>
<p>“Until I make money enough to feed and clothe you.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you guess when you can come for me?”</p>
<p>“No, for as yet I know not how I can earn a dollar; but, if
you will be patient, I promise to work hard for you and Stanley.”</p>
<p>“I will be good. Salome, I have saved a quarter of a dollar
that the doctor gave me when I was sick,—because I let
the blister stay on my side a half hour longer; and I thought
I would send it to Buddie, to buy him some marbles or a kite;
but I reckon I had better give it to you to help us get a house.”</p>
<p>She drew from her pocket a green calico bag, and, emptying
the contents into her hand, picked out from among brass buttons
and bits of broken glass a silver coin, which she held up
triumphantly.</p>
<p>“No, Jessie,—keep it. Stanley has plenty of playthings,
and you may need it. Besides, your quarter would not go far,
and I don’t want it. Good-bye, little darling. Try to give
Mrs. Collins no trouble, and recollect that when I promise you
anything I shall be sure to keep my word.”</p>
<p>Salome drew the child’s head to her shoulder, and, as she
bent over and kissed the sweet, pure lips, Jessie whispered,
“When we say our prayers to-night, we will ask God to send
us some money to buy a home, won’t we? You know he made
the birds feed Elijah.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_51"></a>51</span></div>
<p>“But we are not prophets, and ravens are not flying about
with bags of money under their wings.”</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“We</ins> do not know what God can do, and if we are only good,
He is as much bound to take care of us as of Elijah. He made
the sky rain manna and partridges for the starving people in
the desert, and He is as much our God as if we came out from
Egypt under Moses. I know God will help us, if we ask Him.
I am sure of it; for last week I lost Mrs. Collins’ bunch of
keys, and, when I could not find them anywhere, I prayed to
God to help me, and, sure enough, I remembered I left them
in the dairy where I was churning.”</p>
<p>Jessie’s countenance was radiant with hope and faith, which
her sister could not share, yet felt unwilling to destroy; and,
checking the heavy sigh that rose from her oppressed heart,
she hastily quitted the house.</p>
<p>In the midst of confused and perturbed reflections, rose like
some lonely rock-based beacon in boiling waves her sacred
promise to the trusting child, and ingenuity was racked to
devise some means for its prompt fulfilment. Consanguinity
began to urge its claim vehemently, and long dormant tenderness
pleaded piteously for exiled idols.</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“If</ins> I were only a Christian, like Dr. Grey! His faith, like
strong wings, bears him high above all sloughs of despond, all
morasses of moodiness. People cannot successfully or profitably
serve two masters. That is eminently true; not because
it is scriptural, but <i>vice versa</i>; because it is so obviously true
it could not escape a place in the Bible. Half work pays poor
wages, and it is not surprising that neither God nor Mammon
will patiently submit to it. I suppose the time has come when
I must bargain myself to one or the other; for, hitherto, I
have declared in favor of neither. I am not altogether sanctified,
nor yet desperately wicked, but I hate Satan, who
ruined my father, infinitely more than I dislike the restrictions
of religion. I owe him a grudge for all the shame and
suffering of my childhood,—which, if God did not interfere to
prevent, at least there is strong presumptive evidence that he
took no pleasure in witnessing. I don’t suppose I have any
faith; I scarcely know what it means; but perhaps if I try to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_52"></a>52</span>
serve God instead of myself, it will come to me as it came to
Paul and Thomas. I wonder whether mere abstract love of
righteousness and of the Lord drives half as many persons
into Christian churches as the fear of eternal perdition. I
don’t deny that I am afraid of Satan, for if he contrives to
smuggle so much sin and sorrow into this world what must his
own kingdom be? If there be any truth in the tradition that
every human being is afflicted by some besetting sin that
crouches at the door of the soul, lying in ambush to destroy
it, then my own ‘Dweller of the Threshold,’ is love of mine
ease. Time was when I would have bartered my eternal heritage
for a good-sized mess of earthly pottage, provided only it
was well spiced and garnished; but to-day I have no inclination
to be swindled like Esau. Idleness has well-nigh ruined
me, so I shall take industry by the horns, and laying thereon
all my sins of indolence, drive it before me as the Jews drove
Apopompœus.”</p>
<p>She walked on in the direction of the town, turning her
head neither to right nor left, and keeping her eyes fixed on
the blue air before her, where imagination built a home,
through whose spacious halls Stanley and Jessie sported at
will. On the principal street stood a fashionable dress-making
and millinery establishment, and thither Salome bent her
steps, resolved that the sun should not set without having witnessed
some effort to redeem the pledge given to Jessie.</p>
<p>Panoplied in Miss Jane’s patronage, she demanded and obtained
admission to the inner apartment of this Temple of
Fashion, where presided the Pythoness whose oracular utterances
swayed <i>le beau monde</i>.</p>
<p>What passed between the two never transpired, even among
the apprentices that thronged the adjoining room; but when
Salome left the house she carried under her arm a large
bundle which furnished work for the ensuing fortnight.</p>
<p>Evening shadows overtook her, while yet a mile distant
from home, and as she passed a small cottage, where candle-light
flared through the open window, she saw Dr. Grey
standing beside the bed, on which, doubtless, lay some sufferer.</p>
<p>Ere many moments had elapsed, she heard his well-known
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_53"></a>53</span>
footstep on the rocky road, and involuntarily paused to greet
him.</p>
<p>“What called you to old Mrs. Peterson’s?”</p>
<p>“Her youngest grandchild is very ill with brain fever; so
ill that I shall return and sit up with him to-night.”</p>
<p>“I was not aware that physicians condescended to act as
mere nurses,—to execute their own orders.”</p>
<p>“Then I fear you have formed a very low estimate of the
sacred responsibilities of my profession, or of the characters
of those who represent it. The true physician combines the
offices of surgeon, doctor, nurse, and friend.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Peterson is almost destitute, and to a great extent
dependent on charity; consequently you need not expect to
collect any fee.”</p>
<p>“Knowing her poverty, I attend the family gratuitously.”</p>
<p>“Is not your charity-list a very long one?”</p>
<p>“Could I divest myself of sympathy with the sufferings of
those who compose it I would not curtail it one iota; for I feel
like Boerhaave, who once said, ‘My poor are my best patients;
God pays for them.’”</p>
<p>“Then, after all, you are actuated merely by selfishness,
and remit payments in earthly dross,—in ‘filthy lucre,’—in
order to collect your fees in a better currency, where thieves do
not break through nor steal?”</p>
<p>“‘He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; but
he that honoreth Him, hath mercy on the poor.’ If a tinge
of selfishness mingle with the hope of future reward, it will be
forgiven, I trust, by the great Physician, who, in sublimating
human nature, seized upon its selfish elements as powerful
agencies in the regeneration of mankind. An abstract worship
of virtue is scarcely possible while humanity is clothed
with clay, and I am not unwilling to confess that hope of
eternal compensation influences my conduct in many respects.
If this be indeed only subtle selfishness, at least we shall be
pardoned by Him who promised to prepare a place in the
Father’s mansion for those who follow His footsteps among
the poor.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_54"></a>54</span></div>
<p>She looked up at him, with a puzzled, searching expression,
that arrested his attention, and exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“How singularly honest you are! I believe I could have
faith if there were more like you.”</p>
<p>“Faith in what?”</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“In</ins> the nobility of my race,—in the possibility of my own
improvement,—in the watchful providence of God.”</p>
<p>“Salome, there is much sound philosophy in the eighty-seventh
and eighty-ninth maxims of cynical Rochefoucauld,
‘It is more disgraceful to distrust one’s friends than to be deceived
by them. Our mistrust justifies the deceit of others.’
My opportunities have been favorable for studying various
classes of men, and my own experience corroborates the truth
of Montaigne’s sagacious remark, ‘Confidence in another
man’s virtue is no slight evidence of a man’s own.’ Try to
cultivate trust in your fellow creatures, and the bare show
of faith will sometimes create worth.”</p>
<p>“Did Christ’s show of confidence in Judas save him from
betrayal?”</p>
<p>“Let us hope that he was the prototype of a very limited
class. You must not expect to find mankind divided into two
great castes—one all angels, the other comprising hopeless
demons. On the contrary, noble and most ignoble impulses
alternately sway the actions and thoughts of the majority of
our race; and the saint of to-day is not unfrequently tempted
to become the fiend of to-morrow. Remember that the conflict
with sinful promptings begins in the cradle—ends only
in the coffin,—and try to be more charitable in your judgments.”</p>
<p>They walked a few yards in silence, and at length Salome
asked,—</p>
<p>“Were you not kept up all of last night?”</p>
<p>“Yes; I was obliged to ride fifteen miles to set a dislocated
shoulder.”</p>
<p>“Then you must be exhausted from fatigue, and unfit for
watching to-night. Will you not allow me to relieve you, and
take charge of Mrs. Peterson’s grandchild? I admit I am
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_55"></a>55</span>
very ignorant; but I will faithfully follow your directions,
and I think you may venture to trust me.”</p>
<p>Confusion flushed her face as she made this proposition, but
in the pale, pearly lustre of the summer starlight, it was not
visible.</p>
<p>“Thank you heartily, Salome. I could implicitly trust
your intentions, but the case is almost hopeless, and I fear
you are too inexperienced to render it safe for me to commit
the child to your care. I appreciate your kindness, but am
too much interested in the boy to leave him when the disease
is at its crisis, and a cup of coffee will strengthen me for the
vigil. You have been to the Asylum this afternoon; tell me
something about little Jessie.”</p>
<p>“She is still rather pale, but otherwise seems quite well
again. Of course she is dissatisfied since Stanley has left,
and thinks she ought to be allowed to follow his example; but
I finally persuaded her to remain there patiently, at least
for the present. It is well that the poor have their sensibilities
blunted early in life, for they are spared many sorrows
that afflict those who are pampered by fortune and rendered
morbidly sensitive by years of indulgence and prosperity.”</p>
<p>A metallic ring had crept into her voice, hardening it, and
although he could not distinctly see her countenance, he knew
that the words came through set teeth.</p>
<p>“Salome, I hope that I misunderstand you.”</p>
<p>“No; unfortunately, you thoroughly comprehend me. Dr.
Grey, were you situated precisely as I find myself, do you suppose
you would feel your degradation as little as I seem to do?
Do you think you would relish the bread of charity as keenly
as one, who, for courtesy’s sake, shall be nameless? Could
you calmly stand by, and with utter <i>sang froid</i> see your
brothers and sisters—your own flesh and blood—drift on
every chance wave, like some sodden crust or withered weed
on a stormy, treacherous sea? Would not your family pride
bleed and die, and your self-respect wail and shrivel and
expire?”</p>
<p>“You have so grossly exaggerated and overcolored your
picture that I recognize little likeness to reality.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_56"></a>56</span></div>
<p>“I neither gloze nor mask; I simply front the facts, which
are, briefly, that you were nurtured in independence and
trained to abhor the crumbs that fall from other people’s
tables, while all heroic aspirations and proud chivalric dreams
were fed by the milk that nourished you; whereas, I grew up
in the wan, sickly atmosphere of penury; glad to grasp the
crust that chance offered; taught to consider the bread of dependence
precious as ambrosia; willing to forget family ties
that were fraught only with humiliation and wretchedness;
coveting bounty that I had not sufficient ambition to merit;
and eager to live on charity, as long as it could be coaxed,
hoodwinked, or scourged into supporting me comfortably.
Yesterday I read a sentence that might have been written for
me, so felicitously does it photograph me, ‘Temperament is a
fate oftentimes, from whose jurisdiction its victims hardly
escape, but do its bidding herein, be it murder or martyrdom.
Virtues and crimes are mixed in one’s cup of nativity,
with the lesser or larger margin of choice. <i>Blood is a
destiny.</i>’ You, Ulpian Grey, are what you are because your
father was a gentleman, and all your surroundings were
luxurious and refined; and I, the miller’s child, am what
you see me because my father was coarse and brutal; because
my body and soul struggled with staring starvation,—physical,
mental, and moral. Be just, and remember these things
when you are tempted to despise me as a pitiable, spiritless
parasite.”</p>
<p>“My little friend, you have most unnecessarily tortured
yourself, and grieved and mortified me. Have I ever treated
you with contempt or disrespect?”</p>
<p>“You evidently pity me, and compassion is about as welcome
to my feelings as a vitriol bath to fresh wounds.”</p>
<p>“Are you not conscious of having more than once acted in
such a manner as to necessitate my compassion?”</p>
<p>She was silent for some moments; but as they entered the
avenue, she said, impetuously,—</p>
<p>“I want you to respect me.”</p>
<p>“If you respect yourself and merit my good opinion, I shall
not withhold it. But of one thing let me assure you; my
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_57"></a>57</span>
standard of womanly delicacy, nobility, gentleness, and Christian
faith is very exalted; and I cannot and will not lower it,
even to meet the requirements of those who claim my friendship.
Thoroughly cognizant of my opinions concerning several
subjects, you have more than once, premeditatedly and obtrusively
outraged them, and while I can and do most cordially
overlook the offence, you should not deem it possible
for me to entertain a very lofty estimate of the offender.
When I came home you took such extraordinary pains to convince
me that not a single noble aspiration actuated you that
I confess you almost succeeded in your aim; but, Salome, I
hope you are far more generous than you deign to prove yourself,
and I promise you my earnest respect shall not lag
behind,—shall promptly keep pace with your deserts. You
can, if you so determine, make yourself an attractive, brilliant,
noble woman; an ornament—and better still—a useful, honored
member of society; but the faults of your character are
grave, and only prayer and conscientious, persistent efforts
can entirely correct them. I am neither so unreasonable nor
so unjust as to hold you accountable for circumstances beyond
your control; and, while I warmly sympathize with all your
sorrows, I know that you are still sufficiently young to rectify
the unfortunate warping that your nature received in its
mournful early years. To ask me to respect you is as idle
and useless and impotent as the soft murmur of this June
breeze in the elm boughs above us; but you can command my
perfect confidence and friendship solely on condition that you
merit it. Salome, something very unusual has influenced
you to-day, forcing you to throw aside the rubbish that you
patiently piled over your better self until it was effectually
concealed; and, if you are willing to be frank with me, I
should be glad to know what has so healthfully affected you.
I believe I can guess: has not little Jessie wooed and won
her sister’s heart, melting all its icy selfishness and warming
its holiest recesses?”</p>
<p>At this moment Stanley bounded down the steps to meet
them, and, bending over to receive his kiss and embrace,
Salome gladly evaded a reply. That night, after she had
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_58"></a>58</span>
taught her brother his lessons for the next day and made
him repeat the prayer learned in the dormitory of the Asylum,—when
she had read Miss Jane to sleep and seen the doctor
set out on his mission of mercy, she brightened the lamp-light
in her own room, and, opening the parcel, drew out and commenced
the dainty embroidery which she had promised should
be completed at an early day.</p>
<p>The night was warm, but the sea-breeze sang a lullaby in
the trees that peeped in at her window, and now and then a
strong gust blew the flame almost to the top of the lamp-chimney.
Stanley slept soundly in his trundle-bed, occasionally
startling her by half-uttered exclamations, as in his
dreams he chased rabbits or found partridge-eggs. Oblivious
of passing hours, and profoundly immersed in speculations
concerning her future, the girl sewed on, working scallop
after scallop, and flower after flower, in the gossamer cambric
between her slender fingers. Stars that looked upon her early
in the night had gone down into blue abysms below the
horizon, and the midnight song of a mocking-bird, swinging
in a lemon-tree beneath her window, had long since hushed
itself with the chirp of crickets and gossip of the katydids.</p>
<p>A tap on the facing of her open door finally aroused her,
and she hastily attempted to hide her work, as Dr. Grey
asked,—</p>
<p>“What keeps you up so late? Are you dressing a doll
for Jessie?”</p>
<p>“What brings you home so early? Is your patient better?”</p>
<p>“Yes; in one sense he is certainly better; for, free from all
pain, he rests with his God.”</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Half-past three. Little Charles died about an hour ago,
and, as I shall be very busy to-morrow, I came upstairs to
ask if you will oblige me by going over to Mrs. Peterson’s
and remaining with her until the neighbors assemble in the
morning. It is an unpleasant duty, and unless you are perfectly
willing I will not request you to perform it.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_59"></a>59</span></div>
<p>“Certainly, sir; I will go at once. Why should I hesitate?”</p>
<p>“Come down as soon as you are ready, and I will make
Harrison drive you over in my buggy. As it is only a mile
I walked home.”</p>
<p>When she stood before him, waiting for the servant to adjust
some portion of the harness, Dr. Grey wrapped her shawl
more closely around her, and said,—</p>
<p>“What new freak keeps you awake till four o’clock?”</p>
<p>“It is no freak, but the beginning of a settled purpose
that reaches in numberless ramifications through all my
coming years. It does not concern you, so ask me no more.
Good-night. I suppose I ought to tender you my thanks
for deeming me worthy of this melancholy mission; and if
so, pray be pleased to accept them.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Jane, have you heard that we shall soon have some new
neighbors at ‘Solitude’?”</p>
<p>“No; who is brave enough to settle there?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, a widow, has purchased and refitted the
house, preparatory to making it her home.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose she knows the history of its former
owners?”</p>
<p>“Probably not, as she has never seen the place. The purchase
was made some months since by her agent, who stated
that she was in Europe.”</p>
<p>“Ulpian, I am sorry that the house will again be occupied,
for some mournful fatality seems to have attended all who
ever resided there; and I have been told that the last proprietor
changed the name from ‘Solitude’ to ‘Bochim.’”</p>
<p>“You must not indulge such superstitious vagaries, my
dear, wise Janet. The age of hobgoblins, haunted houses,
and supernatural influences has passed away with the marvels
of alchemy and the weird myths of Rosicrucianism. Because
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_60"></a>60</span>
many deaths have occurred at that place, and the residents
were consequently plunged in gloom, you must not rashly
impute eldritch influences to the atmosphere surrounding it.
Knowing its ghostly celebrity, I have investigated the grounds
of existing prejudice, and find that of the ten persons who
have died there during the last fifteen years, three deaths were
from <ins title="Was heriditary">hereditary</ins> consumption, one from dropsy, two from
paralysis, one from epilepsy, one from brain-fever, one from
drowning, and the last from a fall that broke the victim’s
neck. Were these attributable to any local cause, the results
would certainly not have proved so diverse.”</p>
<p>“Call it superstition, or what you will, no amount of coaxing,
argument, or ridicule, no imaginable inducement could
prevail on me to live there,—even if the house were floored
with gold and roofed with silver. It is the gloomiest-looking
place this side of Golgotha, and I would as soon crawl into a
coffin for an afternoon nap as spend a night there.”</p>
<p>“Your imagination invests it with a degree of gloom which
is adventitious, and referable solely to painful associations;
for intrinsically the situation is picturesque and beautiful, and
the grounds have been arranged with consummate taste.
This morning I noticed a quantity of rare and very superb
lilies clustered in a corner of the <i>parterre</i>.”</p>
<p>“Pray, what called you there?”</p>
<p>“A workman engaged in repairing some portion of the
roof, slipped on the slate and broke his arm; consequently,
they sent for me.”</p>
<p>“Just what he might have expected. I tell you something
happens to everybody who ever sleeps there.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose there is a squad of malicious spirits
hovering in ambush to swoop upon all new-comers, and not
only fracture limbs, but scatter to right and left paralysis,
epilepsy, and other diseases? From your rueful countenance
a stranger might infer that Pandora’s box had just been
opened at ‘Bochim,’ and that the very air was thick with
miasma and maledictions.”</p>
<p>“Oh, laugh on if you choose at my old-fashioned whims and
superstition; but, mark my words, that place will prove a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_61"></a>61</span>
curse to whoever buys it and settles there! Has Mrs. Gerome
a family?”</p>
<p>“I believe I heard that she had no children, but I really
know little about her except that she must be a woman of
unusually refined and cultivated tastes, as the pictures, books,
and various articles of vertu that have preceded her seem to
indicate much critical and artistic acumen. The entire building
has been refitted in exceedingly handsome style, and the
upholsterer who was arranging the furniture told me it had
been purchased in Europe.”</p>
<p>“When is Mrs. Gerome expected?”</p>
<p>“During the present week.”</p>
<p>“What aged person is she?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, my dear, curious Janet, I have asked no questions
and formed no conjectures; but I trust your baleful prognostications
will find no fulfilment in her case.”</p>
<p>“Ulpian, I had some very fashionable visitors to-day, who
manifested an extraordinary interest in your past, present,
and future. Mrs. Channing and her two lovely daughters
spent the morning here, and left an invitation for you to
attend a party at their house next Thursday evening. Miss
Adelaide went into ecstasies over that portrait in which you
wore your uniform, and asked numberless questions about
you; among others, whether you were still heart-whole, or
whether you had suffered some great disappointment early in
life which kept you a bachelor. What do you suppose she
said when I told her that you had never had a love-scrape in
your life?”</p>
<p>“Of course she impugned the statement, which, to a young
lady framed for flirtations, must indeed have appeared incredible.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, she declared that the woman who succeeded
in captivating you would achieve a triumph more difficult
and more desirable than the victory of the Nile or of
Trafalgar. I was tempted to ask her if she might be considered
the ambitious Nelson, but of course politeness forbade.
Ulpian, she is the prettiest creature I ever looked at.”</p>
<p>“Yes, as pretty as mere healthy flesh can be without the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_62"></a>62</span>
sublimation and radiance of an indwelling soul. There is
nothing which impresses me so mournfully as the sight of a
beautiful, frivolous, unscrupulous woman, who immolates all
that is truly feminine in her character upon the shrine of
swollen vanity; and whose career from cradle to grave is as
utterly aimless and useless as that of some gaudy, flaunting
ephemeron of the tropics. Such women act as extinguishers
upon the feeble, flickering flame of chivalry, which modern
degeneracy in manners and morals has almost smothered.”</p>
<p>His tone and countenance evinced more contempt than Salome
had known him to express on any former occasion, and,
glancing at his clear, steady, grave blue eyes, she said to
herself,—</p>
<p>“At least he will never strike his colors to Admiral Adelaide
Channing, and I should dislike to occupy her place in his
estimation.”</p>
<p>“My dear boy, you must not speak in such ungrateful terms
of my beautiful visitor, who certainly has some serious design
on your heart, if I may judge from the very extravagant praise
she lavished upon you. I daresay she is a very nice, sweet
girl, and you know you told me once that if you should ever
marry your wife must be a beauty, else you could not love
her.”</p>
<p>“Very true, Janet, and I have no intention of retracting
or diminishing my rigid requirements, but my definition of
beauty includes more than mere physical perfection,—than
satin skin, pearl-tinted, fine eyes, faultless teeth, abundant
silky tresses, and rounded figure. It demands that the heart
whose blood paints lips and cheek, shall be pure, generous,
and holy; that the soul which looks out at me from lustrous
eyes shall be consecrated to another deity than Fashion,—shall
be as full of magnanimity, and strength, and peace, as a
harp is of melody; my beauty means meekness, faith, sanctity,
and exacts mental, moral, and material excellence. Rest
assured, my dear, sage counsellor, that if ever I bring a wife
to my hearthstone I will have selected her in obedience to the
advice of Joubert, who admonished us, ‘We should choose
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_63"></a>63</span>
for a wife only the woman we would choose for a friend,
were she a man.’”</p>
<p>“You expect too much; you will never find your perfect
ideal walking in flesh.”</p>
<p>“I will content myself with nothing less—I promise you
that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no doubt you will believe that the woman you marry
is all that you dream or wish; but some fine morning you
will present me with a sister as full of foibles and vanities
and frailties as any other spoiled and cunning daughter of
Eve. Of course every bridegroom classes as ‘perfect’ the
blushing, trembling young thing who peeps shyly at him
from under a tulle veil and an orange wreath; but, take my
word for it, there is a spice of Delilah in every pretty girl,
and the credulity of Samson slumbers in all lovers. Nevertheless,
Ulpian, I would sooner see you in bondage to a pair
of white hands and hazel eyes,—would rather know that like
all your race you were utterly humbugged—hoodwinked—by
some fair-browed belle, whose low voice rippled over pouting
pink lips, than have you live always alone, a confirmed old
bachelor. After all, I doubt whether you have really never
had a sweetheart, for every schoolboy swears allegiance to
some yellow-haired divinity in ruffled muslin aprons.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey laid his hand gently on the shrivelled fingers that
were busily engaged in shelling some seed-beans, and answered,
jocosely,—</p>
<p>“Have I not often told you, that my dear, old, patient
sister Janet, is my only lady-love?”</p>
<p>“And your silly old Janet is not such an arrant fool as to
believe any such nonsense,—especially when she remembers
that from time immemorial sailors have had sweethearts in
every port, and that her spoiled pet of a brother is no exception
to his race or his profession.”</p>
<p>He laughed, and smoothed her grizzled hair.</p>
<p>“Since my sapient sister is so curious, I will confess that
once—and only once in my life—I was in dire danger of falling
most desperately in love. The frigate was coaling at
Palermo, and I went ashore. One afternoon, in sauntering
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_64"></a>64</span>
through the orange and lemon groves which render its environs
so inviting, I caught a glimpse of a countenance so serene,
so indescribably lovely, that for an instant I was disposed
to believe I had encountered the beatific spirit of St. Rosalie
herself. The face was that of a woman apparently about
eighteen years old, who evidently ranked among Sicilian aristocrats,
and whose elegant attire enhanced her beauty. I followed,
at a respectful distance, until she entered the garden
of an adjacent convent and fell on her knees before a marble
altar, where burned a lamp at the feet of a statue of the
Virgin; and no painting in Europe stamped itself so indelibly
on my memory as the picture of that beautiful votary. Her
delicate hands were crossed over her heart,—her large, liquid,
black eyes, raised in adoration,—her full, crimson lips parted
as she repeated the ‘<i>Ave Maria</i>’ in the most musical voice
I ever heard. Just above the purplish folds of her abundant
hair drooped pomegranate boughs all aflame with scarlet
blooms that fell upon her head like tongues of fire, as the
wind sprang from the blue hollows of the Mediterranean and
shook the grove. The sun was going swiftly down behind the
stone turrets of a monastery that crowned a distant hill, and
the last rays wove an aureola around my kneeling saint, who,
doubtless, aware of the effect of her graceful attitudinizing,
seemed in no haste to conclude her devotions. As I recalled
the charming tableau, those lines wherein Buchanan sought
to photograph the picturesqueness of the Digentia, float up
from some sympathetic cell of memory,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘Could you look at the leaves of yonder tree,—<br>
The wind is stirring them, as the sun is stirring me!<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>The woolly clouds move quiet and slow<br>
In the pale blue calm of the tranquil skies,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>And their shades that run on the grass below<br>
Leave purple dreams in the violet’s eyes!<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>The vine droops over my head with bright<br>
Clusters of purple and green,—the rose<br>
Breaks her heart on the air; and the orange glows<br>
Like golden lamps in an emerald night.’</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>My Sicilian Siren finally disappeared in a gloomy arched-way
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_65"></a>65</span>
leading into the convent, and I returned to the hotel to dream
of her until the morning sunshine once more bathed Conca
D’Oro in splendor,—when I instituted a search for the name
and residence of my inamorata. Six hours of enthusiastic
investigation yielded me the coveted information, but imagine
the profound despair in which I was plunged when I ascertained
from her own smiling lips that she was a happy wife
and the proud mother of two beautiful children. As she rose
to present her swarthy husband, I bowed myself out and took
refuge aboard ship. Here ends the recital of the first and
last bit of romance that ever threw its rosy tinge over the
quiet life of your staid and humble brother—Ulpian Grey,
M.D.”</p>
<p>“Ah, my dear sailor boy, I am afraid thirty-five years of
experience have rendered you too wary to be caught by such
chaff as pretty girls sprinkle along your path! I should be
glad to see your bride enter this door before I am carried out
feet foremost to my final rest by Enoch’s side.”</p>
<p>“Do not despair of me, dear Jane, for I am not exactly
Methuselah’s rival; and comfort yourself by recollecting that
Lessing was forty years old when he first loved the only woman
for whom he ever entertained an affection—his devoted
Eva König.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey bent over his sister’s easy-chair, and, taking her
thin, sallow face tenderly in his soft palms, kissed the sunken
cheeks—the wrinkled forehead; and then, laying her head
gently back upon its cushions, entered his buggy and drove
to his office.</p>
<p>“Salome, what makes you look so moody? There are as
many furrows on your brow as lines in a spider’s web, and
your lips are drawn in as if you had dined on green persimmons.
Child, what is the matter?”</p>
<p>Miss Jane lifted her spectacles from her nose, and eyed the
orphan, anxiously.</p>
<p>“I am very sorry to hear that ‘Solitude’ will be filled once
more with people, and bustle, and din. It is the nearest
point where we can reach the beach, and I have enjoyed many
quiet strolls under its grand, old, solemn trees. If haunted
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_66"></a>66</span>
at all, it is by Dryads and Hamadryads, and I like the babble
of their leaves infinitely better than the strife of human
tongues. Miss Jane, if I were only a pagan!”</p>
<p>“I am not very sure that you are not,” sighed the invalid.</p>
<p>“Nor I. I have lost my place,—I am behind my time in
this world by at least twenty centuries, and ought to have
lived in the jovial age of fauns and satyrs, when groves were
sacred for other reasons than the high price of wood,—when
gods and goddesses were abundant as blackberries, and at the
beck and call of every miserable wretch who chose to propitiate
them by offering a flask of wine, a bunch of turnips, a
litter of puppies, or a basket of olives. Hesiod and Homer
understood human nature infinitely better than Paul and
Luther.”</p>
<p>“Salome, you are growing shockingly irreverent and
wicked.”</p>
<p>“No, madam,—begging your pardon. I am only desperately
honest in wishing that my salvation and future
felicity could be secured beyond all peradventure, by a sacrifice
of oatcakes, or white doves, or black cats, instead of a
drab-colored life of prayer, penance, purity, and patience. I
don’t deny that I would rather spend my days in watching
the gorgeous pageant of the<i> Panathenaea</i>, or chanting dithyrambics
to insure a fine vintage, or even offering a <i>Taigheirm</i>,
than in running neck and neck with Lucifer for the kingdom
of heaven. I love kids, and fawns, and lambs, as well as
Landseer; but I should not long hesitate, had I the choice,
between flaying their tender flesh in sacrifice and mortifying
my own as a devout life requires.”</p>
<p>“But what would have become of your poor soul if you had
lived in Pagan times?”</p>
<p>“What will become of it under present circumstances, I
should be exceedingly glad to know. ‘The heathen are a
law unto themselves,’ and I sometimes wish I had been born a
Fejee belle, who lived, was tastefully tattooed, and died without
having even dreamed of missionaries,—those officious
martyrs who hope to wear a whole constellation on their foreheads
as a reward for having been eaten by cannibals, to whom
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_67"></a>67</span>
they expounded the unpalatable doctrine that, ‘this is the
condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men
loved darkness rather than light.’ Moreover, I confess—”</p>
<p>“That is quite sufficient. I have already heard more than
I relish of such silly and sacrilegious chat. At least, you
might have more prudence and discretion than to hold forth
so disgracefully in the hearing of your little brother.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane’s cheek flushed, and her feeble voice faltered.</p>
<p>“He has fallen fast asleep over the bean-pods; and, even if
he had not, how much of the conversation do you imagine he
would comprehend? His sole knowledge of Grecian theogony
consists of a brief acquaintance with a bottle of pseudo Greek
fire which burnt the pocket out of his best pantaloons.”</p>
<p>“Salome, you distress me; and, if Ulpian had not left us,
you would have kept all such heathenish stuff shut up in your
sinful and wayward heart.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey is no Gorgon, having power to petrify my
tongue. I am not afraid of him; and my respect for your
feelings is much stronger than my dread of his.”</p>
<p>“Hush, child! You are afraid of him, and well you may
be. I fear that all your Sabbath-school advantages—all your
Christian privileges—have been wofully wasted; and I shall
ask Ulpian to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you, Miss Jane. You may save yourself the
trouble, for he has given me over to hardness of heart and
‘a reprobate mind,’ and his patience is not only ‘clean gone
forever,’ but he has carefully washed his hands of all future
interest in my rudderless and drifting soul. Let me speak
this once, and henceforth I promise to hold my peace. I do
not require to be ‘talked to’ by anybody,—I only need to be
let alone. Sabbath-schools are indisputably excellent things,—and
I can testify that they are ponderous ecclesiastical hammers,
pounding creeds and catechisms into the mould of
memory; but these nurseries of the church nourish and harbor
some Satan’s imps among their half-fledged saints; and while
they certainly accomplish a vast amount of good, they are by
no means infallible machines for the manufacture of Christians,—of
which fact I stand in melancholy attestation. I
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_68"></a>68</span>
have a vague impression that piety does not grow up in a
night, like Jonah’s gourd <ins title="Was of">or</ins> Jack the Giant-killer’s beanstalk;
but is a pure, glittering, spiritual stalactite, built by
the slow accretion of dripping tears. Do you suppose that
you can successfully train my soul as you have managed
my body?—that you can hold my nose and pour a dose of
faith down my throat, like ipecac or cod-liver oil? In matters
of theology I am no ostrich, and, if you afflict me <i>ad
nauseam</i> with religious dogmas, you must not wonder that my
moral digestion rebels outright. I shall not dispute the fact
that in justice to your precepts and example I ought to be a
Christian; but, since I am not, I may as well tell you at once
and save future trouble, that I can neither be baited into the
church like a hawk into a steel-trap, nor scared and driven
into it like bees into a hive by the rattling of tin pans and the
screaking of horns. Don’t look at me so dolefully, dear Miss
Jane, as if you had already seen my passport to perdition
signed and sealed. You, at least, have done your whole duty,—have
set all the articles of orthodoxy, well-flavored and
garnished, before me; and, if I am finally lost, my spiritual
starvation can never be charged against you in the last balance-sheet.
I am not ignorant of the Bible, nor altogether
unacquainted with the divers creeds that spring from its
pages as thick, as formidable, as ferocious, as the harvest
from the dragon’s teeth; and, thanking you for all you have
taught me, I here undertake to pilot my own soul in this
boiling, bellowing sea of life. I doubt whether some of the
charts you value will be of any service in my voyage, or
whether the beacons by which you steer will save me from the
reefs; but, nevertheless, I take the wheel, and, if I wreck my
soul,—why, then, I wreck it.”</p>
<p>In the magic evening light, which touches all things with a
rosy, transitory glamour, the fresh young face with its daintily
sculptured lineaments seemed marvellously and surpassingly
fair; but, like <i>morbidezza</i> marble, hopelessly fixed and
chill, and might have served for some image of Eve, when,
standing on the boundary of eternal beatitude, she daringly
put up her slender womanly fingers to pluck the fatal fruit.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_69"></a>69</span>
Her large, brilliant eyes followed the sinking sun as steadily—as
unblinkingly—as an eagle’s; but the gleam that rayed
out was baleful, presaging storms, as infallibly as that sullen,
lurid light, which glares defiantly over helpless earth when
to-day’s sun falls into the cloudy lap of to-morrow’s tempest.</p>
<p>A heavy sigh struggled across Miss Jane’s unsteady lips,
as, removing her glasses, she wiped her eyes, and said,
slowly,—</p>
<p>“Yes; I am a stupid, unsuspecting old dolt; but I see it
all now.”</p>
<p>“My ultimate and irremediable ruin?”</p>
<p>“God forbid!”</p>
<p>Salome approached the arm-chair, and, stooping, looked intently
at the aged, wan face.</p>
<p>“What is it that you see? Miss Jane, when people stand,
as you do, upon the borders of two worlds, the Bygone fades,—the
Beyond grows distinct and luminous. Lend me your
second sight, to decipher the characters scrawled like fiery
serpents over the pall that envelops the future.”</p>
<p>“I see nothing but the grim, unmistakeable fact that my
little, clinging, dependent child, has, without my knowledge,
put away childish things, and suddenly steps before me a wilful,
irreverent, graceless woman, as eager to challenge the
decrees of the Lord as was complaining Job before the breath
of the whirlwind smote and awed him. Some day, Salome,
that same voice that startled the old man of Uz will make you
bend and tremble and shiver like that acacia yonder, which the
wind is toying with before it snaps asunder. When that
time comes the clover will feed bees above my gray head, but
I trust my soul will be near enough to the great white throne
to pray God to have mercy on your wretched spirit, and
bring you safely to that blessed haven whither you can never
pilot yourself.”</p>
<p>Nervous excitement gave unwonted strength to the feeble
limbs; and, grasping her crutches, Miss Jane limped into
her own room and closed the door after her.</p>
<p>For some moments the girl stood looking out over the lawn,
where fading sunshine and deepening shadow made fitful
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_70"></a>70</span>
<i>chiaroscuro</i> along the primrose-paved aisles that stretched
under the elm arches,—then, raising her fingers as if tracing
lines on the soft, gold-dusted atmosphere that surrounded
her, she muttered doggedly,—</p>
<p>“Yes; I am at sea! But, if God is just, Miss Jane and I
will yet shake hands on that calm, surgeless, crystal sea, shining
before the throne. So, now I take the helm and put the
head of my precious charge before the wind, and only the Almighty
can foresee the result. In His mercy I put my trust.
So be it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Mother, I am afraid Mrs. Gerome does not like this
place, or the furniture, or something, for she has not spoken
a kind word about the house since she came. She looks
closely at everything, but says nothing. What do you suppose
she thinks?”</p>
<p>Robert Maclean, the gardener at “Solitude,” paused abruptly,
as his mother pinched his arm sharply and whispered,—</p>
<p>“Whist! There she comes down the azalea walk; and no
one likes to stumble upon their own name when they are not
expecting the sound or sight of it. No; she has turned off
towards the cedars, and does not see us. As to her likes and
dislikes, there is nothing this side of heaven that will content
her; and you might have known better than to suppose she
would be much pleased with anything. No matter what she
thinks, she seldom complains, and it is hard to find out her
views; but she told me to tell you that she approved all you
had done, and thanked you for the pains you have taken to
arrange things comfortably.”</p>
<p>Old Elsie tied the strings of her white muslin cap, and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_71"></a>71</span>
turned her back to the wind that was playing havoc with its
freshly fluted frills.</p>
<p>“Mother, I heard her laugh yesterday, for the first time.
It was a short, quick, queer little laugh, but it pleased me
greatly. The cook had set some duck-eggs under that fine
black Spanish hen; and, when they hatched, she marched
off with the brood into the fowl-yard, where they made straight
for the duck-pool and sailed in. The hen set up such a din
and clatter that Mrs. Gerome, who happened to get a
glimpse of them, felt sorry for the poor frightened fowl, and
tried to drive the little ones out of the water; but, whenever
she put her hand towards them to catch the nearest, the
whole brood would quack and dive,—and, when she had
laughed that one short laugh, she called to me to look after
them and went back to the house. You don’t know how
strangely that laugh sounded.”</p>
<p>“Don’t I? Speak for yourself, Robert. I have heard her
laugh twice, but it was when she was asleep, and it was an
uncanny, bitter sound,—about as welcome to my ears as her
death-rattle. Last night she did not close her eyes,—did not
even undress; and the hall clock was striking three this
morning when I heard her open the piano and play one of
those dismal, frantic, wailing things she calls ‘fugues,’ that
make the hair rise on my head and every inch of my flesh
creep as if a stranger were treading on my grave. When
she was a baby, cutting her eye-teeth, she had a spasm; and
seeing her straighten herself out and roll back her eyes till
only the white balls showed, I took it for granted she was
about to die, and, holding her in my arms, I fell on my knees
and prayed that she might be spared. Well, now, Robert,
I am sorry I put up that petition, for the Lord knew best;
and it would have been a crowning mercy if he had paid no
attention to my half-crazy pleadings and taken her home
then. What meddling fools we all are! I thought, at that
time, it would break my heart to shroud her sweet little
body; but ah! I would rather have laid my precious baby
in her coffin, with violets under her fingers, than live to see
that desperate, unearthly look, come and house itself in her
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_72"></a>72</span>
great, solemn, hungry, tormenting eyes, that were once as
full of sparkles and merriment as the sky is of stars on a
clear, frosty night. My son, we never know what is good
for us; for, many times, when we clamor for bread we break
our teeth on it; and then, again, when we rage and howl
because we think the Lord has dealt out scorpions to us,
they prove better than the fish we craved. So, after all, I
conclude Christ understood the whole matter when he enjoined
upon us to say, ‘Thy will be done.’”</p>
<p>The old nurse wiped her eyes with the corner of her black
silk apron, and, leaning against the trunk of a tree, crossed
her arms comfortably over her broad and ample chest, while
Robert busied himself in repotting some choice carnations.</p>
<p>“But, mother, do you really think she will be satisfied to
stay here, after travelling so long up and down in the world?”</p>
<p>“How can I tell what she will or will not do? You know
very well that she goes to sleep with one set of whims and
wakes up with new ones. She catches odd freaks as some
people catch diseases. She said yesterday that she had had
enough of travel and change, and intended to settle and live
and die right here; but that does not prove that I may not
receive an order next week to pack her trunks and start to
Jericho or Halifax, and I should not think the world was
upside down and coming to an end if such an order came before
breakfast to-morrow. Poor lamb! My poor lamb!
Yonder she comes again. Do you notice how fast she walks,
as if the foul fiend were clutching at her skirts or she were
trying to get away from herself,—trying to run her restless
soul entirely out of her wretched body? Come away, Robert,
and let her have all the grounds to herself. She likes best
to be alone.”</p>
<p>Mother and son walked off in the direction of the stables,
and the advancing figure emerged from the dense shade where
interlacing limbs roofed one of the winding walks, and paused
before the circular stand on which lemon, rose, white, crimson,
and variegated carnations, nodded their fringed heads
and poured spicy aromas from their velvety chalices.</p>
<p>The face and form of Mrs. Gerome presented a puzzling
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_73"></a>73</span>
paradox, in which old age and youth seemed struggling for
mastery; and “death in life” found melancholy verification.
Tall, slender, and faultlessly made, the perfection of her
figure was marred by the unfortunate carriage of her head,
which drooped forward so heavily that the chin almost touched
her throat and nearly destroyed the harmony of the profile
outline. The head itself was nobly rounded, and sternly
classic as any well authenticated antique, but it was no marvel
that it habitually bowed under the heavy glittering mass
of silver hair, which wound in coil after coil and was secured
at the back by a comb of carved jet, thickly studded with
small silver stars. The extraordinary lustrousness of these
waves of gray hair that rippled on her forehead and temples
like molten metal, lent a weird and wondrous effect to the
straight, regular, rigid features,—daintily cut as those of Pallas,
and quite as pallid. The delicate and high arch of the
eyebrows was black as ebony, and in conjunction with the
long jetty lashes formed a very singular contrast to the shining
white tresses, which lay piled like freshly fallen snow-drift
above them. The brow was full, round, smooth, and
fair as a child’s; and more than one azure thread showed the
subtle tracery of veins, whose crimson currents left no rosy
reflex on the firm, gleaming white flesh, through which they
branched.</p>
<p>Beneath that faultless forehead burned unusually large
eyes, deep as mountain tarns, and of that pure bluish gray
that tolerates no hint of green or yellow rays. The dilated
pupils intensified the steel color, and faint violet lines ran
out from the iris to meet the central shadows, while above
and below the heavy black fringes enhanced their sombre
depths, where mournful mysteries seemed to float like corpses
just beneath the crystal shroud of ocean waves. The pale, passionless
lips,—perfect in their pure curves, but defrauded of
the blood which resolutely refused to come to the surface and
tint the fine satin skin,—were lined in ciphers that the curious
questioned and wondered over, but which few could read and
none fully comprehend. The beautiful, frigid mouth, where
all sweetness was frozen out to make room for hopelessness
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_74"></a>74</span>
and defiance, would have admirably suited some statue of
discrowned and smitten Hecuba; and no amount of sighs and
sobs, no stormy bursts of grief or fierce invective, could rival
the melancholy eloquence of its mute, calm pallor.</p>
<p>The wan face, with its gray globe-like eyes, and the metallic
glitter of the prematurely silvered hair, matched in hue the
pearl-colored muslin dress which fluttered in the wind; and,
standing there, this gray woman of twenty-three looked indeed
like Pygmalion’s stone darling,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Fair-statured, noble, like an awful thing<br>
Frozen upon the very verge of life,<br>
And looking back along eternity<br>
With rayless eyes that keep the shadow Time.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Her frail, white hands, with their oval nails polished and
opalescent, were exceedingly beautiful; and, where the creamy
foam of the fine lace fell back from the dimpled wrists,
quaintly carved jet serpents with blazing diamond eyes coiled
around the throbbing thread-like pulses of sullen <i>sang azure</i>.</p>
<p>Bending over the carnations, she examined the gorgeous
hues,—toyed with their fragile stems,—and then, glancing
shyly over her shoulder like a startled fawn half expectant
of hounds and hunter, she glided rapidly to an artificial
mound crowned with a mouldering mossy plaster image of
Ariadne and her pard, and stood surveying her new domain.</p>
<p>“Solitude” filled a semicircular hollow between low wooded
hills, which ran down to lave their grassy flanks in the blue
brine of the Atlantic, and constituted the horns of a crescent
bay, on whose sloping sandy beach the billows broke without
barrier.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned brick house—with sharp, peaked roof,
turreted chimneys, and gable window looking down in front
upon the clumsily clustered columns that supported the
arched portico—was built upon a rocky knoll, of which nature
laid the foundation and art increased the height; and,
around and above it, towered a dense grove of ancient trees
that shut out the glare of the sea and effectually screened
the mansion from observation. The damp walls were heavily
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_75"></a>75</span>
draped with the sombre verdure of ivy, whose ambitious tendrils
clambered to the cleft chimney-tops, and peered impertinently
over the broad stone window-sills, whence the
indignant housemaid remorselessly sheared them away as
often as their encroachments grew perceptible.</p>
<p>In the rear of the house, and toward the west, stretched
orchard, vegetable garden, vineyard, and wheat-field, whose
rolling green waves seemed almost to break against the ruddy
trunks of cedars that clothed the hillside. To the left and
north lay low, marshy, meadow land, covered with rank grass
and frosted with saline incrustations; while south of the
building extended spacious grounds, studded here and there
with noble groups of deodars, Norway spruce, and various
ornamental shrubs, and bounded by a tall impenetrable hedge
of osage orange. Before the house, which faced the ocean
and fronted east, the lawn sloped gently down to a terrace
surmounted by a granite balustrade; and just beyond, supported
by stone piers on the golden sands, stood an octagonal
boat-house, built in the Swiss style, with red-tiled roof, and
floored with squares of white and black marble, whence a
flight of steps led to the little boat chained to one of the
rocky piers. Along the entire length of the terrace a line
of giant poplars lifted their aged, weather-beaten heads, high
above all surrounding objects,—ever on the <i>qui vive</i>, looking
seaward,—trim and erect as soldiers on dress parade, and
defiant of gales that had shorn them of many boughs, and
left ghastly scars on their glossy limbs.</p>
<p>Tradition whispered, with bated breath, that in the dim
dawn of colonial settlement a rude log hut had been erected
here by pirates, who came ashore to bury their ill-gotten
booty, and rumors were rife of bloody deeds and midnight
orgies,—all of which sprang into more vigorous circulation,
when, in laying the foundations of the boat-house piers, an
iron pot containing a number of old French and Spanish
coins was dug out of the shells and sand.</p>
<p>Melancholy tales of stranded vessels and drowned crews,
of a slaver burned to the water’s edge to escape capture, and of
charred corpses strewn on the beach, thickened the atmosphere
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_76"></a>76</span>
of legendary gloom that enveloped the spot,—where
the successive demise of several proprietors certainly sanctioned
the feeling of dread and superstitious distrust with
which it was regarded. That the unenviable celebrity it had
attained was referable to local causes generating disease, appeared
almost incredible; for, if miasmatic exhalations rose
dank and poisonous from the densely shaded humid house,
they were promptly dispelled by the strong, invincible ocean-breeze,
which tore aside leafy branches and muslin curtains,
and wafted all noxious vapors inland.</p>
<p>A committee of medical sages having cautiously examined
the place, unanimously averred that its reputed fatality could
not justly be ascribed to any topographical causes. Whereupon
the popular nerve, which closely connected the community
with supernaturaldom, thrilled afresh; and all the
calamities, real and imaginary, that had afflicted “Solitude”
from a period so remote that “the memory of man runneth
not to the contrary,” were laid upon the galled shoulders of
some red-liveried, sulphur-scented Imp of Abaddon, whose
peculiar mission was to haunt the “piratical nest;” and, in
lieu of human victims, to addle the eggs, blast the grape crop,
and make night hideous with spectral sights and sounds.</p>
<p>To an unprejudiced observer the hills seemed to have gleefully
clasped hands and formed a half-circle, shutting the
place in for a quiet breezy communion with garrulous ocean,
whose waves ran eagerly up the strand to gossip of wrecks and
cyclones, with the staid martinet poplars that nodded and
murmured assent to all their wild romances.</p>
<p>Such was the pleasant impression produced upon the mind
of the lonely woman who now owned it, and who hoped to
spend here in seclusion and peace the residue of a life whose
radiant dawn had been suddenly swallowed by drab clouds
and starless gloom.</p>
<p>The Scotch are proverbially credulous concerning all preternatural
influences; and, had Robert Maclean been cognizant
of half the ghostly associations attached to the residence
which he had selected in compliance with general instructions
from his mistress, it is scarcely problematical whether the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_77"></a>77</span>
house would not have remained in the hands of the real-estate
broker; but, fortunately for their peace of mind, Elsie and
her son were as yet in blissful ignorance of the dismal celebrity
of their new home.</p>
<p>Resting her folded hands on the bare shoulders of the
Ariadne, which modest lichens and officious wreaths of purple
verbena were striving to mantle, Mrs. Gerome scanned the
scene before her; and a quick, nervous sigh, that was almost
a pant, struggled across her lips.</p>
<p>“Unto this last nook of refuge have I come; and, expecting
little, find much. Shut out from the world, locked in
with the sea,—no neighbors, no visitors, no news, no gossip,—solitary,
shady, cool, and quiet,—surely I can rest here.
Forked tongues of scandal can not penetrate through those
rock-ribbed hills yonder, nor dart across that defying sea; and
neither wail nor wassail of men or women can disturb me
more. But how do I know that it will not prove a mocking
cheat like Baiæ and Maggiore, or Copais and Cromarty? I
have fled in disgust and <i>ennui</i> from far lovelier spots than
this, and what right have I to suppose that contentment has
housed itself as my guest in that old, mossy, brick pile, where
mice and wrens run riot? Like Cain and Cartophilus, my
curse travels with me, and I no sooner pitch my tent, than lo!
the rattle and grin of my skeleton, for which earth is not wide
enough to furnish a grave! Well! well! at least I shall
not be stared to death here,—shall not be tormented by
eye-glasses and sketch-books; can live in that dim, dark,
greenish den yonder, unobserved and possibly forgotten
and finally sleep undisturbed in the dank shade of those
deodars, with twittering birds overhead and a
sobbing sea at my feet. How long—how long before that
dreamless slumber will fall upon my heavy lids,—weary with
waiting? Only twenty-three yesterday! My God, if I should
live to be an old woman! The very thought threatens insanity!
Ten—twenty—possibly thirty years ahead of me.
No; I could not endure it,—I should go mad, or destroy myself!
If I were a delicate woman, if I only had weak lungs
or a dropsical heart, or a taint of any hereditary infirmity
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_78"></a>78</span>
that would surely curtail my days, I could be tolerably patient,
hoping daily for the symptoms to develop themselves. But,
unfortunately, though my family all died early, no two members,
selected the same mode of escape from this bastile of
clay; and my flesh is sound, and I am as strong and compact
as that granite balustrade, and—ha! ha!—quite as hard.
<i>Au pis aller</i>, if the burden of life becomes utterly intolerable
I can shuffle it off as quickly as did that proud Roman, who,
‘when the birds began to sing’ in the dawn of a day heralded
by tempestuous winds laden with perfume from the vales of
Sicily, shut his eyes forever from the warm sparkling Mediterranean
billows that broke in the roads of Utica, and pricked
the memory of inattentive Azrael with the point of a sword.
Neither Phædo, family, nor fame, could coax Cato to respect
the prerogative of Atropos; and if he, ‘the only free and unconquered
man,’ quailed and fled before the apparition of
numerous advancing years, what marvel that I, who am
neither sage nor Roman, should be tempted some fine morning
when the birds are sounding <i>reveille</i> around my chamber
windows, to imitate ‘what Cato did, and Addison approved’?
After all, what despicable cowards are human hearts, and how
much easier to die like Socrates, Seneca, and Zeno, than stagger
and groan under the load of hated, torturing years, that
are about as welcome to my shoulders as the ‘old man of the
sea’ to Sinbad’s! How long?—oh, how long?”</p>
<p>The gloomy gray eyes had kindled into a dull flicker that
resembled the fitful, ghostly gleam of sheet lightning, falling
through painted windows upon crumbling and defiled altars
in some lonely ruined cathedral; and her low, shuddering
tones, were full of a hopeless, sneering bitterness, as painfully
startling and out of place in a woman’s voice as would be the
scream of a condor from the irised throats of brooding doves,
or the hungry howl of a wolf from the tender lips of unweaned
lambs. In the gloaming light of a soft gray sky powdered by
a few early stars, stood this desolate gray woman, about
whose face and dress there was no stain of color save the blue
glitter of a large sapphire ring, curiously cut in the form of a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_79"></a>79</span>
coiled asp, with hooded head erect and brilliant diamond eyes
that twinkled with every quiver of the marble-white fingers.</p>
<p>Impatiently she turned her imperial head, when the sound
of approaching steps broke the stillness; and her tone was
sharp as that of one suddenly roused from deep sleep,—</p>
<p>“Well, Elsie! What is it?”</p>
<p>“Tea, my child, has been waiting half-an-hour.”</p>
<p>“Then go and get your share of it. I want none.”</p>
<p>“But you ate no dinner to-day. Does your head ache?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no; my heart jealously monopolizes that privilege!”</p>
<p>The old woman sighed audibly, and Mrs. Gerome added,—</p>
<p>“Pray, do not worry yourself about me! When I feel disposed
to come in I can find the way to the door. Go and
get your supper.”</p>
<p>The nurse passed her wrinkled hand over the drab muslin
sleeves and skirt, and touched the folds of hair.</p>
<p>“But, my bairn, the dew is thick on your head and has
taken all the starch out of your dress. Please come out of this
fog that is creeping up like a serpent from the sea. You are
not used to such damp air, and it might give you rheumatic
cramps.”</p>
<p>“Well, suppose it should? Does not my white head entitle
me to all such luxuries of old age and decrepitude? Don’t
bother me, Elsie.”</p>
<p>She put out her hand with a repellent gesture, but Elsie
seized it, and clasping both her palms over the cold fingers,
said, with irresistible tenderness,—</p>
<p>“Come, dearie!—come, my dearie!”</p>
<p>Without a word Mrs. Gerome turned and followed her
across the lawn and into the house, whose internal arrangement
was somewhat at variance with its unpretending exterior.</p>
<p>The rooms were large, with low ceilings; and fire-places,
originally wide and deep, had been recently filled and fitted
up with handsome grates, while the heavy mantelpieces of
carved cedar, that once matched the broad facings of the windows
and the massive panels of the doors, were exchanged for
costly <i>verd antique</i> and lumachella. The narrow passage running
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_80"></a>80</span>
through the centre of the building was also wainscoted
with cedar and adorned with fine engravings of Landseer’s
best pictures, whose richly carved walnut frames looked almost
cedarn in the pale chill light that streamed upon them through
the violet-colored glass which surrounded the front door and
effectually subdued the hot golden glare of the sunny sun.
The old-fashioned folding doors that formerly connected the
parlor and library had been removed to make room for a low,
wide arch, over which drooped lace curtains, partially looped
with blue silk cord and tassels, and both apartments were
furnished with sofas and chairs of rosewood and blue satin
damask, while the velvet carpet, with its azure ground strewn
with wreaths of white roses and hyacinths, corresponded in
color. Handsome book-cases, burdened with precious lore,
lined the walls of the rear room; and on either side of a massive
ormolu <i>escritoire</i>, bronze candelabra shed light on the
blue velvet desk where lay delicate sheets of gossamer paper
with varied and <i>outré</i> monograms, guarded by an exquisite
marble statuette of Harpocrates, which stood in the
mirror-panelled recess reserved for pen, ink, and sealing-wax.
The air was fragrant with the breath of flowers that nodded to
each other from costly vases scattered through both apartments;
and, before one of the windows, rose a bronze stand
containing china jars filled with pelargoniums, in brilliant
bloom. An Erard piano occupied one corner of the parlor,
and the large harp-shaped stand at its side was heaped with
books and unbound sheets of music. Here two long wax
candles were now burning brightly, and, on the oval marble
table in the centre of the floor, was a superb silver lamp representing
Psyche bending over Cupid, and supporting the finely-cut
globe, whose soft radiance streamed down on her burnished
wings and eagerly-parted sweet Greek lips. The design
of this exceedingly beautiful lamp would not have disgraced
Benvenuto Cellini, nor its execution have reflected discredit
upon the genius of Felicie Fauveau, though to neither of these
distinguished artificers could its origin have been justly ascribed.
In its mellow, magical glow, the fine paintings suspended
on the walls seemed to catch a gleam of “that light
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_81"></a>81</span>
that never was on sea or land,” for their dim, purplish Alpine
gorges were filled with snowy phantasmagoria of rushing avalanches;
their foaming cataracts braided glittering spray into
spectral similitude of Undine tresses and Undine faces; their
desolate red deserts grew vaguely populous with mirage mockeries;
their green dells and grassy hill-sides, couching careless
herds, and fleecy flocks, borrowed all Arcadia’s repose; and the
marble busts of Beethoven and of Handel, placed on brackets
above the piano, shone as if rapt, transfigured in the mighty
inspiration that gave to mankind “<i>Fidelio</i>” and the “<i>Messiah</i>.”</p>
<p>On the sofa which partially filled the oriel window, where
the lace drapery was looped back to admit the breeze, lay an
ivory box containing materials and models for wax-flowers;
and, in one corner, half thrust under the edge of the silken
cushion, was an unfinished wreath of waxen convolvulus and
a cluster of gentians. There, too, open at the page that narrated
the death-struggle, lay Liszt’s “Life of Chopin,” pressed
face downwards, with two purple pansies crushed and staining
the leaves; and a small gold thimble peeping out of a crevice
in the damask tattled of the careless feminine fingers that had
left these traces of disorder.</p>
<p>The collection of pictures was unlike those usually brought
from Europe by cultivated tourists, for it contained no Madonnas,
no Magdalenes, no Holy Families, no Descents or Entombments,
no Saints, or Sibyls, or martyrs; and consisted of
wild mid-mountain scenery, of solemn surf-swept strands, of
lonely moonlit moors, of crimson sunsets in <ins title="Left as original">Cobi</ins> or Sahara,
and of a few gloomy, ferocious faces, among which the portrait
of Salvator Rosa smiled sardonically, and a head of
frenzied Jocasta was preëminently hideous.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Gerome entered the parlor and brightened the
flame of the Psyche lamp, her eyes accidentally fell upon
the bust of Beethoven, where, in gilt letters, she had inscribed
his own triumphant declaration, “<i>Music is like wine, inflaming
men to new achievements; and I am the Bacchus who
serves it out to them</i>.” While she watched the rayless marble
orbs, more eloquent than dilating darkening human pupils,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_82"></a>82</span>
a shadow dense and mysterious drifted over her frigid face,
and, without removing her eyes from the bust above her, she
sat down before the piano, and commenced one of those marvellous
symphonies which he had commended to the study
of Goethe.</p>
<p>Ere it was ended Elsie came in, bearing a waiter on which
stood a silver <i>epergne</i> filled with fruit, a basket of cake, and a
goblet of iced tea.</p>
<p>“My child, I bring your supper here because the dining-room
looks lonesome at night.”</p>
<p>“No,—no! take it away. I tell you I want nothing.”</p>
<p>“But, for my sake, dear—”</p>
<p>“Let me alone, Elsie! There,—there! Don’t teaze me.”</p>
<p>The nurse stood for some moments watching the deepening
gloom of the up-turned countenance, listening to the weird
strains that seemed to drip from the white fingers as they
wandered slowly across the keys; then, kneeling at her side,
grasped the hands firmly, and covered them with kisses.</p>
<p>“Precious bairn! don’t play any more to-night. For God’s
sake, let me shut up this piano that is making a ghost of you!
You will get so stirred up you can’t close your eyes,—you
know you will; and then I shall cry till day-break. If you
don’t care for yourself, dearie, do try to care a little for the
old woman who loves you better than her life, and who never
can sleep till she knows your precious head is on its pillow.
My pretty darling, you are killing me by inches, and I shall
stay here on my knees until you leave the piano, if that is not
till noon to-morrow. You may order me away; but not a step
will I stir. God help you, my bairn!”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome made an effort to extricate her hands, but the
iron grasp was relentless; and, in a tone of great annoyance,
she exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Oh, Elsie! You are an intolerable—”</p>
<p>“Well, dear, say it out,—an intolerable old fool! Isn’t that
what you mean?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly; but you presume upon my forbearance.
Elsie, you must not interrupt and annoy me, for I tell you
now I will not submit to it. You forget that I am not a
child.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_83"></a>83</span></div>
<p>“Darling, you will never be anything but a child to me,—the
same pretty child I took from its dead mother’s arms and
carried for years close to my heart. So scold me as you may,
my pet, I shall love you and try to take care of you just as
long as there is breath left in my body.”</p>
<p>She ended by kissing the struggling hands; and, striving
to conceal her vexation, Mrs. Gerome finally turned and
said,—</p>
<p>“If you will eat your supper, and stay with Robert, and
leave me in peace, I promise you I will close the piano, which
your flinty Scotch soul can no more appreciate than the brick
and mortar that compose these walls. You mean well, my
dear, faithful Elsie, but sometimes you bore me fearfully. I
know I am often wayward; but you must bear with me, for,
after all, how could I endure to lose you,—you the only
human being who cares whether I live or die? There,—go!
Good night!”</p>
<p>She threw her arms around Elsie’s neck, leaned her wan
cheek for an instant only on her shoulder, then pushed her
away and hastily closed the piano.</p>
<p>Two hours later, when the devoted servant stole up on tip-toe,
and peeped through the half-open door that led into the
hall, she found the queenly figure walking swiftly and lightly
across the room from oriel to arch, with her hands clasped
over the back of her head, and the silvery lamp-light shining
softly on the waves of burnished hair that rippled around her
pure, polished forehead.</p>
<p>As she watched her mistress, Elsie’s stout frame trembled,
and hot tears streamed down her furrowed face while she
lifted her heart in prayer, for the dreary, lonely, lovely woman,
who had long ago ceased to pray for herself. But when
the quivering lips of one breathed a petition before the throne
of God, the beautiful cold mouth of the other was muttering
bitterly,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Yea, love is dead, and by her funeral bier<br>
Ambition gnaws the lips, and sheds no tears;<br>
And, in the outer chamber Hope sits wild,—<br>
Hope, with her blue eyes dim with looking long.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Ulpian, why do you look so grave and grieved? Does your
letter contain bad news?”</p>
<p>Miss Jane pushed back her spectacles and glanced anxiously
at her brother, who stood with his brows slightly knitted,
twirling a crumpled envelope between his fingers.</p>
<p>“It is not a letter, but a telegraphic dispatch, summoning
me to the death-bed of my best friend, Horace Manton.”</p>
<p>“The man whose life you saved at Madeira?”</p>
<p>“Yes; and the person to whom, above all other men, I am
most strongly and tenderly attached. His constitution is so
feeble that I have long been uneasy about him; but the end
has come even earlier than I feared.”</p>
<p>“Where does he live?”</p>
<p>“On the Hudson, a few miles above New York City. I
have no time to spare, for I shall take the train that leaves at
one o’clock, and must make some arrangement with Dr.
Sheldon to attend my patients. Will it trouble or tire you
too much to pack my valise while I write a couple of business
letters? If so, I will call Salome to assist you.”</p>
<p>“Trouble me, indeed! Nonsense, my dear boy; of course
I will pack your valise. Moreover, Salome is not at home.
How long will you be absent?”</p>
<p>“Probably a week or ten days,—possibly longer. If poor
Horace lingers, I shall remain with him.”</p>
<p>“Wait one moment, Ulpian. Before you go I want to
speak to you about Salome.”</p>
<p>“Well, Janet, I lend you my ears. Has the girl absolutely
turned pagan and set up an altar to Ceres, as she threatened
some weeks since? Take my word for the fact that she does
not believe or mean one half that she says, and is only amusing
herself by trying to discover how wide her audacious heresies
can expand your dear orthodox eyes. Expostulation and
entreaty only feed her affected eccentricities and skepticism,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_85"></a>85</span>
and if you will persistently and quietly ignore them, they will
shrivel as rapidly as a rank gourd-vine, uprooted on an August
day.”</p>
<p>“Pooh! pooh! my dear boy. How you men do prate sometimes
of matters concerning which you are as ignorant as the
yearling calves and gabbling geese that I suppose your learned
astronomers see driven every day to pasture on that range of
mountains in the moon—Eratosthenes—that modern science
pretends to have discovered, and about which you read so marvellous
a paper last week.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane reverently clung to the dishonored remnants of
the Ptolemaic theory, and scouted the philosophy of Copernicus
which she vehemently averred was not worth “a pinch of
snuff,” else the water in the well would surely run out once in
every twenty-four hours. Now, as she dived into the depths of
her stocking-basket, collecting the socks neatly darned and
rolled over each other, her brother smiled, and answered, good
humoredly,—</p>
<p>“Dear Janet, I really have not time to follow you to the
moon, nor to prove to you that your astronomical doctrines
have been dead and decently buried for nearly three hundred
years; but I should like to hear what you desire to tell me
with reference to Salome. What is the matter now?”</p>
<p>“Nothing ails her, except a violent attack of industry,
which has lasted much longer than I thought possible; for, to
tell you the truth without stint or varnish, she certainly was
the most sluggish piece of flesh I ever undertook to manage.
Study she would not, keep house she could not, sewing gave
her the headache, and knitting made her cross-eyed; but,
behold! she has suddenly found out that her pretty little pink
palms were made for something better than propping her
peach-bloom cheeks. A few days ago I accidentally discovered
that she was sitting up until long after midnight, and when I
questioned her closely, she finally confessed that she had
entered into a contract to furnish a certain amount of embroidery
every month. Bless the child! can you guess what
she intends to do with the money? Hoard it up in order to
rent a couple of rooms, where she can take Jessie and Stanley
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_86"></a>86</span>
to live with her. Ulpian, it is a praiseworthy aim, you must
admit.”</p>
<p>“Eminently commendable, and I respect and admire the
motive that incites her to such a laborious course. At present
she is too young and inexperienced to take entire charge of
the children, and I know nothing of your plans or intentions
concerning her future; but, let me assure you, dear Jane, that
I will cordially coöperate in all your schemes for aiding her
and providing a home for them, and my purse shall not prove
a laggard in the race with yours. Recently I have been revolving
a plan for their benefit, but am too much hurried just
now to give you the details. When I return we will discuss it
<i>in extenso</i>.”</p>
<p>“You know that I ascribe great importance to blood, but
strange as it may appear, that girl Salome has always tugged
hard at my heart-strings, as if our proud old blood beat in her
veins; and sometimes I fancy there must be kinship hidden behind
the years, or buried in some unknown grave.”</p>
<p>“Amuse yourself while I am away by digging about the
genealogical tree of the house of Grey, and, if you can trace a
fibre that ramifies in the miller’s family, I will gladly bow
to my own blood wherever I find it, and claim cousinship.
Meantime, my dear sister, do keep a corner of your loving
heart well swept and dusted for your errant sailor-boy.”</p>
<p>He hastily kissed her cheek and turned away to write letters,
while she went into the adjoining room to pack his
clothes.</p>
<p>When Salome returned from town, whither she had gone to
carry a package of finished work and obtain a fresh supply,
she found Miss Jane alone in the dining-room, and wearing a
dejected expression on her usually cheerful countenance.</p>
<p>“Did Ulpian tell you good-by?”</p>
<p>“No, I have not seen him. Where has he gone?”</p>
<p>“To New York.”</p>
<p>The long walk and sultry atmosphere had unwontedly
flushed the girl’s face, and the damp hair clung in glossy rings
to her brow; but, as Miss Jane spoke, the blood ebbed from
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_87"></a>87</span>
cheeks and lips, and sweeping back the dark tresses that
seemed to oppress her, she asked, shiveringly,—</p>
<p>“Is Dr. Grey going back to sea?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, child! An old friend is very ill, and telegraphed
for him. Sit down, dear,—you look faint.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, I don’t wish to sit down, and there is nothing
the matter with me. When will he come home?”</p>
<p>“I can not tell precisely, as his stay is contingent upon the
condition of his friend.”</p>
<p>“Is it a man or woman whom he has gone to see?”</p>
<p>The astonishment painted on Miss Jane’s face would have
been ludicrous to a careless observer, less interested than the
orphan in her slow and deliberate reply.</p>
<p>“A man, of course.”</p>
<p>“Did he tell you so?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. He went to see Mr. Horace Manton, with
whom he was associated while abroad. But suppose it had
been some winsome, brown-eyed witch of a woman, instead of
a dying man, what then?”</p>
<p>“Then you would have lost your brother, and I my French
pronouncing dictionary,—that is all. Did he leave any message
about my grammar and exercises?”</p>
<p>“No, dear; but he started so hurriedly—so unexpectedly—he
had not time for such trifles. Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“To put away my bonnet and bundle, and look after Stanley,
who is romping with the kittens on the lawn.”</p>
<p>The old lady laid down her knitting, leaned her elbows on
the arms of her rocking-chair, and, clasping her hands, bowed
her chin upon them, while a half-stifled sigh escaped her.</p>
<p>“Mischief,—mischief, where I meant only kindness! I
sowed good seed, and reap thistles and brambles! My charity-cake
turns out miserable dough! But how could I possibly
foresee that the child would be such a simpleton? What right
has she to be so unnecessarily interested in my brother, who is
old enough to have been her father? It is unnatural, absurd,
and altogether unpardonable in Salome to be guilty of such
presumptuous nonsense; and, of course, it is not in the least
my fault, for the possibility of this piece of mischief never
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_88"></a>88</span>
once occurred to me! True, she is as old as Ulpian’s mother
was when father married her; but then Mrs. Grey was not at
all in love with her white-haired husband, and had set her
affections solely on that Mercer-Street house, with marble
steps and plate-glass windows. How do I know that, after all,
Salome is not in love with Ulpian’s fortune instead of the
dear boy’s blue eyes, and handsome hair, and splendid teeth?
However, I ought not to think so harshly of the child, for I
have no cause to consider her calculating and selfish. Poor
thing! if she really cares for him there are breakers ahead of
her, for I am sure that he is as far from falling in love with
her as I would be with the ghost of my great-grandfather’s
uncle. Thank Providence, all this troublesome, mischievous,
Lucifer machinery of love and marriage is shut out of heaven,
where we shall be as the angels are. Ah, Salome! I fear
you are a giddy young idiot, and that I am a blind old imbecile,
and I wish from the bottom of my heart you had never
darkened my doors.”</p>
<p>The quiet current of Miss Jane’s secluded life had never
been ruffled by a serious <i>affaire du cœur</i>; consequently she indulged
little charity towards those episodes, which displayed
what she considered the most humiliating weakness of her sex.</p>
<p>While puzzling over the best method of extricating her <i><ins title="Was protégé">protégée</ins></i>
from the snare into which she was disposed to apprehend
that her own well-meant but mistaken kindness had betrayed
her, she saw an unsealed note lying beneath the table, and, by
the aid of her crutch, drew it within reach of her fingers. A
small sheet of paper, carelessly folded and addressed to Salome,
merely contained these words,—</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“I congratulate you, my young friend, on the correctness of
your French themes, which I leave in the drawer of the library-table.
When I return I will examine those prepared
during my absence; and, in the interim, remain,</p>
<p>“Very respectfully,</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Ulpian Grey</span>.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Miss Jane wiped her glasses, and read the note twice; then
held it between her thumb and third finger, and debated the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_89"></a>89</span>
expediency of changing its destination. Her delicate sense of
honor revolted at the first suggestion of interference, but
an intense aversion to “love-scrapes” finally strengthened her
prudential inclination to crush this one in its incipiency; and
she deliberately tore the paper into shreds, which she tossed
out of the window.</p>
<p>“If Ulpian only had his eyes open he would never have
scribbled one line to her; and, since I know what I know, and
see what I see, it is my duty to take the responsibility of destroying
all fuel within reach of a flame that may prove as
dangerous as a torch in a hay-rick.”</p>
<p>Limping into the library, she took from the drawer the two
books containing French exercises and laid them in a conspicuous
place on the table, where they could not fail to arrest
the attention of their owner; after which she resumed her
knitting, consoling herself with the reflection that she had
taken the first step towards smothering the spark that threatened
the destruction of all her benevolent schemes.</p>
<p>Up and down, under the spreading trees in the orchard,
wandered Salome, anxious to escape scrutiny, and vaguely conscious
that she had reached the cross-roads in her life, where
haste or inadvertence might involve her in inextricable difficulties.</p>
<p>She was neither startled, nor shocked, nor mortified, that
the unceremonious departure of the master of the house
stabbed her heart with pangs that made her firm lips writhe,
for she had long been cognizant of the growth of feelings
whose discovery had so completely astounded Miss Jane.</p>
<p>The orphan had not eagerly watched and listened for the
sight of his face—the sound of his voice—without fully comprehending
herself; for, however ingeniously and indefatigably
women may mask their hearts from public gaze and comment,
they do not mock their own reason by such flimsy
shams, and Salome could find no prospect of gain in playing
a game of brag with her inquisitive soul.</p>
<p>In the quiet orchard, where all things seemed drowsy—where
the only spectators were the mellowing apples that reddened
the boughs above her, and her sole auditors the brown
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_90"></a>90</span>
partridges that nestled in the tall grass, and the shy cicadæ
ambushed under the clover leaves—her pent-up pain and disappointment
bubbled over in a gush of passionate words.</p>
<p>“Gone without giving me a syllable, a word, a touch!
Gone, for an indefinite period, without even a cold ‘good-by,
Salome!’ You call yourself a Christian, Dr. Grey, and yet you
are cruel, now and then, and make me writhe like a worm on
a fish-hook! He told Stanley he would return in two or three
weeks, perhaps sooner,—but I know better. I have a dull
monitor here that says it will be a long, dreary time, before
I see him again. A wall of ice is rising to divide us—but it
shall not! it shall not! I will have my own! I will look into
his calm eyes! I will touch his soft, warm, white palms! I
will hear his steady, low, clear voice, that makes music in my
ears and heaven in my heart! It is three months since he
shook hands with me, but all time cannot remove the feeling
from my fingers; and some day I can cling to his hand and
lean my cheek against it,—and who dare dispute my right?
He says he never loved any woman! I heard him tell his
sister he had yet to meet the woman whom he could marry,—and,
if truth lingers anywhere in this world of sin, it finds a
sanctuary in his soul! He never loved any woman! Thank
God! I can’t afford to doubt it. No one but his sister has
touched his lips, or his noble, beautiful forehead. How I
envied little Jessie when he put his arm around her and
stooped and laid his cheek on hers. Oh, Dr. Grey, nobody else
will ever love you as I do! I know I am unworthy, but I will
make myself good and great to match you! I know I am
beneath you, but I will climb to your proud height,—and, so
help me God, I will be all that your lofty standard demands!
He does not care for me now,—does not even think of me; but
I must be patient and merit his notice, for my own folly sank
me in his good opinion. When these apples were pale, pink
blossoms, I dreaded his coming, and hoped the vessel would
be wrecked; now, ere they are ripe, I am disposed to curse the
cause of his temporary absence and think myself ill-used that
no farewell privileges were granted me. Now I can understand
why people find comfort in praying for those they love;
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_91"></a>91</span>
for what else can I do but pray while he is away? Oh, I
shall not, cannot, will not, miss my way to heaven if he gets
there before me!”</p>
<p>In utter abandonment she threw herself down in the long
yellow sedge-grass,—frightening a whole covey of gossiping
young partridges and a couple of meek doves, all of which
whirred away to an adjacent pea-field, leaving her with her
face buried in her hands, and watched by trembling mute
crickets and cicadæ.</p>
<p>On the topmost twig of the tallest tree a mocking-bird
poised himself, and sympathetically poured out his vesper
canticle,—a song of condolence to the prostrate figure who,
just then, would have preferred the echo of a man’s deep voice
to all Pergolese’s strains.</p>
<p>After a little while pitying Venus swung her golden globe
in among the apple-boughs, peeping compassionately at her
luckless votary; and, finally, in the violet west,—</p>

<p class="cg">“Two silver beacons sphered in the skies,<br>
Eve in her cradle opening her eyes.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Two weeks dragged themselves away without bringing any
tidings of the absent master; but, towards the close of the
third, a brief letter informed his sister that the invalid friend
was still alive, though no hope of his recovery was entertained,
and that it was impossible to fix any period for the writer’s return.
Salome asked no questions, but the eager, hungry expression,
with which she eyed the letter as it lay on the top
of the stocking-basket, touched Miss Jane’s tender heart; and,
knowing that it contained no allusion to the orphan, she put
it into her hand, and noticed the cloud of disappointment
that gathered over her features as she perused and refolded
it. Another week—monotonous, tedious, almost interminable—crept
by, and one morning as Salome passed the post-office
she inquired for letters, and received one post-marked New
York and addressed to Miss Jane.</p>
<p>Hurrying homeward with the precious missive, her pace
would well-nigh have distanced Hermes, and the dusty winding
road seemed to mock her with lengthening curves while
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_92"></a>92</span>
she pressed on; but at last she reached the gate, sped up the
avenue, and, pausing a moment at the threshold to catch her
breath and appear <i>nonchalant</i>, she demurely entered Miss
Jane’s apartment. The only occupant was a servant sewing
near the window, and who, in reply to an eager question, informed
Salome that the mistress had gone to spend the day
with a friend whose residence was six miles distant.</p>
<p>The girl bit her lip until the blood started, and, to conceal
her chagrin, took refuge in the parlor, where the quiet dimness
offered a covert. Locking the door, she sat down in one
of the cushioned rocking-chairs and looked at the letter lying
between her fingers. The gilt clock on the mantel uttered a
dull, clicking sound, and a little green and gold-colored bird
hopped out and “cuckooed” ten times. Miss Jane would
not probably return before seven, possibly eight o’clock, and
what could be done to strangle those intervening nine hours?</p>
<p>The blood, heated by exercise and impatience, throbbed
fiercely in her temples and thumped heavily at her heart, producing
a half-suffocating sensation; and, in her feverish
anxiety, the doom of Damiens appeared tolerable in comparison
with the torturing suspense of nine hours on the
rack.</p>
<p>The envelope was an ordinary white one, merely sealed
with a solution of gum arabic, and dexterous fingers could
easily open and reclose it without fear of detection, especially
by eyes so dim and uncertain as those for which it had been
addressed. A damp cloth laid upon the letter would in five
minutes prove an <i>open sesame</i> to its coveted contents, and a
legion of fiends patted the girl’s tingling fingers and urged
her to this prompt and feasible relief from her goading impatience.
Secure from intrusion and beyond the possibility
of discovery, she turned the envelope up and down and over,
examining the seal; and the amber gleams lying <i>perdu</i> under
the shadows of her pupils rayed out, glowing with a baleful
Lucifer light, as infallibly indicative of evil purposes as the
sudden kindling in a crouching cat’s or cougar’s gaze, just as
they spring upon their prey.</p>
<p>It was a mighty temptation, cunningly devised and opportunely
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_93"></a>93</span>
presented, and six months ago her parley with the
imps of Apollyon who contrived it would not have lasted five
minutes; but, in some natures, love for a human being will
work marvels which neither the fear of God, nor the hope of
heaven, nor yet the promptings of self-respect have power to
accomplish.</p>
<p>Now while Salome dallied with the temper and gave audience
to the clamors of her rebellious heart, she looked up and
met the earnest gaze of a pair of sunny blue eyes in a picture
that hung directly opposite.</p>
<p>It was an admirable portrait of Dr. Grey, clad in full uniform
as surgeon in the U.S. Navy, and painted when he was
twenty-eight years old. Up at that calm, cloudless countenance,
the girl looked breathlessly, spell-bound as if in the
presence of a reproving angel; and, after some seconds had
elapsed, she hurled the unopened letter across the room, and
lifted her hands appealingly,—</p>
<p>“No,—no! I did not—I cannot—I will not act so basely!
I must not soil fingers that should be pure enough to touch
yours. I was sorely tempted, my beloved; but, thank God,
your blessed blue eyes saved me. It is hard to endure nine
hours of suspense, but harder still to bear the thought that I
have stooped to a deed that would sink me one iota in your
good opinion. I will root out the ignoble tendencies of my
nature, and keep my heart and lips and hands stainless,—hold
them high above the dishonorable things that you abhor, and
live during your absence as if your clear eyes took cognizance
of every detail. Yea,—search me as you will, dear deep-blue
eyes,—I shall not shrink; for the rule of my future years
shall be to scorn every word, thought, and deed that I would
not freely bare to the scrutiny of the man whose respect I
would sooner die than forfeit. Oh, my darling, it were easier
for me to front the fiercest flames of Tophet than face your
scorn! I can wait till Miss Jane sees fit to show me the letter,
and, if it bring good news of your speedy coming, I shall
have my reward; if not, why should I hasten to meet a bitter
disappointment which may be lagging out of mercy to me?”</p>
<p>Picking up the letter as suspiciously as if it had been
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_94"></a>94</span>
dropped by the Prince of Darkness on the crest of Quarantina,
she stepped upon a table and inserted the corner of the envelope
in the crevice between the canvas and the portrait-frame,
repeating the while a favorite passage that she had
first heard from Dr. Grey’s lips,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“‘God meant me good too, when he hindered me<br>
From saying “yes” this morning. I say no,—no!<br>
I tie up “no” upon His altar-horns,<br>
Quite out of reach of perjury!’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Young though she was, experience had taught her that the
most effectual method of locking the wheels of time consisted
in sitting idly down to watch and count their revolutions;
consequently, she hastened upstairs and betook herself vigorously
to the work of embroidering a <i>parterre</i> of flowers on the
front breadth of an infant’s christening dress which her employer
had promised should be completed before the following
Sabbath.</p>
<p>Stab the laggard seconds as she might with her busy needle,
the day was drearily long; and few genuine cuckoo-carols have
been listened to with such grateful rejoicing as greeted those
metallic gutturals that once in every sixty minutes issued
from the throat of the gaudy automaton caged in the gilt
clock.</p>
<p>True, nine hours are intrinsically nine hours under all circumstances,
whether decapitation or coronation awaits their
expiration; but to the doomed victim or the heir-apparent
they appear relatively shorter or longer. At last Salome saw
that the shadows on the grass were lengthening. Her head
ached, her eyes burned from steady application to her trying
work, and laying aside the cambric, she leaned against the
window-facing and looked out over the lawn, where Time
seemed to have fallen asleep in the mild autumn sunshine.</p>
<p>How sweet and welcome was the distance-muffled sound of
tinkling cow-bells, and the low bleating of homeward-strolling
flocks, wending their way across the hills through which
the road crawled like a dusty gray serpent.</p>
<p>A noisy club of black-birds that had been holding an indignation
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_95"></a>95</span>
meeting in the top of a walnut tree near the gate, adjourned
to the sycamore grove that overshadowed the barn
in the rear of the house; and Stanley’s pigeons, which had
been cooing and strutting in the avenue, went to roost in the
pretty painted pagoda Dr. Grey had erected for their comfort.
Finally, the low-swung, heavy carriage, with its stout dappled
horses, gladdened Salome’s strained eyes; and, soon after, she
heard the thump of Miss Jane’s crutches and her cheerful
voice, asking,—</p>
<p>“Where are the children? Tell them I have come home.
Bless me, the house is as dark as a dungeon! Rachel, have
we neither lamps nor candles?”</p>
<p>The orphan stole down the steps, climbed upon the table in
the parlor, and, seizing the letter, hurried into the dining-room,
where, quite exhausted by the fatigue of the day, the
old lady lay on the sofa.</p>
<p>She held out her hand and drew the girl’s face within
reach of her lips, saying,—</p>
<p>“My child, I am afraid you have had rather a lonely day.”</p>
<p>“Decidedly the loneliest and longest I ever spent, and I believe
I never was half so glad to see you come home as just
now when the carriage stopped at the door.”</p>
<p>Ah, what hypocrisy is sometimes innocently masked by the
earnest utterance of the truth! And what marvels of industry
are accomplished by self-love, which seeks more assiduously
than bees for the honied drops of flattery that feed its
existence!</p>
<p>Miss Jane was pardonably proud that her presence was so
essential to the happiness of the orphan whom she fondly
loved, and gratification spread a pleasant smile over her worn
features.</p>
<p>“Where is Stanley? The child ought not to be out so
late.”</p>
<p>“He went down to the sheep-pen to count the lambs and
look after one that broke its leg yesterday. Miss Jane, are
you too much fatigued to read a letter which I found this
morning in your box at the post-office?”</p>
<p>“Is it from Ulpian? I was wondering to-day why I did
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_96"></a>96</span>
not hear from him. Dear me, what have I done with my
spectacles? They are the torment of my life, for the instant
I take them off my nose they seem to find wings. Give me
the letter, and see whether I left my glasses on the bed where
I put my bonnet.”</p>
<p>Salome went into the next room and unsuccessfully searched
the bed, bureau, table, and wardrobe; and in an agony of impatience,
returned to the invalid.</p>
<p>“You must have lost them before you came home; I can’t
find them anywhere. Let me read the letter to you.”</p>
<p>“No; I must have my glasses. Perhaps I dropped them in
the carriage. Send word to the driver to look for them. It
was very careless in me to lose them, but I am growing so
forgetful. Rachel, do hunt for my spectacles.”</p>
<p>Salome ground her teeth to suppress a cry of vexation; and,
to conceal her impatience, joined heartily in the search.</p>
<p>Finally she found the glasses on the front steps, where they
had fallen when their owner left the carriage; and, feeling
that adverse fate could no longer keep her in suspense, she
hurried into the house and adjusted them on Miss Jane’s
eagle nose.</p>
<p>Conscious that she was fast losing control over the nerves
that were quivering from long-continued tension, Salome
stepped to the open window and stood waiting. Would the
old lady never finish the perusal? The minutes seemed hours,
and the pulsing of the blood in the girl’s ears sounded like
muttering thunder.</p>
<p>Miss Jane sighed heavily,—cleared her throat, and sighed
again.</p>
<p>“It is very sad, indeed! It is too bad,—too bad!”</p>
<p>Salome turned around, and exclaimed, savagely,—</p>
<p>“Why can’t you speak out? What is the matter? What
has happened?”</p>
<p>“Ulpian’s friend is dead.”</p>
<p>“Thank God!”</p>
<p>“For shame! How can you be so heartless?”</p>
<p>“If the man could not recover I should think you would
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_97"></a>97</span>
be glad that he is at rest, and that your brother can come
home.”</p>
<p>“But the worst of the matter is that Ulpian is not coming
home. Mr. Manton wished him to act as guardian for his
daughter, who is in Europe, and Ulpian will sail in the next
steamer for England, to attend to some business connected
with the estate. It is too provoking, isn’t it? He says it is
impossible to tell when we shall see him again.”</p>
<p>There was no answer, and, when Miss Jane wiped her eyes
and looked around, she saw the girl tottering towards the door,
groping her way like one blind.</p>
<p>“Salome,—come here, child!”</p>
<p>But the figure disappeared in the hall, and when the moonlight
looked into the orphan’s chamber the soft rays showed
a girlish form kneeling at the window, with a white face
drenched by tears, and quivering lips that moaned in feeble,
broken accents,—</p>
<p>“God help me! I might have known it, for I had a presentiment
of terrible trouble when he went away. How can I
trust God and be patient, while the Atlantic raves and surges
between me and my idol? After all, it was an angel of mercy
whose tender white hands held back this bitter blow for nine
hours. Gone to Europe, and not one word—not one line—to
me! Oh, my darling! you are trampling under your feet the
heart that loves you better than everything else in the universe,—better
than life, and its hopes of heaven!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Salome, where did you learn to sing? I was astonished
this morning when I heard you.”</p>
<p>“I have not yet learned,—I have only begun to practise.”</p>
<p>“But, my child, I had no idea you owned such a voice.
Where have you kept it concealed so long?”</p>
<p>“I was not aware that I had it until a month ago, when it
accidentally discovered itself.”</p>
<p>“It is very powerful.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_98"></a>98</span></div>
<p>“Yes, and very rough; but care and study will smooth and
polish it. Miss Jane, please keep your eye on Stanley until I
come home; for, although I left him with his slate and arithmetic,
it is by no means certain that they will not part company
the moment I am out of sight.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“To carry back some work which would have been returned
yesterday had not the weather been so inclement.”</p>
<p>In addition to the package of embroidered handkerchiefs,
Salome carried under her arm a roll of music and an instruction-book;
and, when she reached the outskirts of the town,
turned away from the main street and stopped at the door of
a small comfortless-looking house that stood without enclosure
on the common.</p>
<p>Two swart, black-eyed children were playing mumble-peg
with a broken knife, in one corner of the room; a third, with
tears still on its lashes, had just sobbed itself to sleep on a
strip of faded carpet stretched before the smouldering embers
on the hearth; while the fourth, a feeble infant only six
months old, was wailing in the arms of its mother,—a thin,
sickly woman, with consumption’s red autograph written on
her hollow cheeks, where the skin clung to the bones as if
resisting the chill grasp of death. As she slowly rocked herself,
striving to hush the cry of the child, her dry, husky cough
formed a melancholy chorus, which seemed to annoy a man
who sat before the small table covered with materials for
copying music. His cadaverous, sallow complexion, and keen,
restless eyes, bespoke Italian origin; and, although engaged in
filling some blank sheets with musical notes, he occasionally
took up a violin that lay across his knees, and, after playing
a few bars, laid aside the bow and resumed the pen. Now
and then he glanced at his wife and child with a scowling
brow; but, as his eyes fell on their emaciated faces, something
like a sigh seemed to heave his chest.</p>
<p>When Salome’s knock arrested his attention he rose and advanced
to the half-open door, saying, impatiently,—</p>
<p>“Well, miss, have you brought me any money?”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mr. Barilli. Here are the ten dollars that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_99"></a>99</span>
I promised, but I wish you to understand that in future I shall
not advance one cent of my tuition-money. When the month
ends you will receive your wages, but not one day earlier.”</p>
<p>“I beg pardon, miss; but, indeed, you see—”</p>
<p>He did not conclude the sentence, but waved his hand towards
the two in the rocking-chair and proceeded to count
the money placed in his palm.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see that you are very destitute, but charity begins
at home, and I have to work hard for the wages that you have
demanded before they are due. Good morning, madam; I
hope you feel better to-day. Come, Mr. Barilli, I have no
time to waste in loitering. Are you ready for my lesson?”</p>
<p>“Quite ready, miss. Commence.”</p>
<p>For three-quarters of an hour he listened to her exercises,
which he accompanied with his violin, and afterwards directed
her to sing an air from a collection of songs on the table. As
her deep, rich contralto notes swelled round and full, he shut
his eyes and nodded his head as if in an ecstacy; and, when
she concluded, he rapped his violin heavily with the bow, and
exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Some day when you sing that at <i>Della Scala</i>, remember
the poor devil who taught it to you in a hovel. Soaked as
those old walls are with music from the most famous lips the
world ever applauded, they hold no echoes sweeter than that
last trill. After all, there is no passion—no pathos—comparable
to a perfect contralto crescendo. It is wonderful how you
Americans squander voices that would rouse all Europe into
a <i>furore</i>.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid your eager desire for pupils biases your judgment,
and invests my voice with fictitious worth,” answered
Salome, eyeing him suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Ha! you mean that I flatter, in order to keep you. Not
so, miss. If St. Cecilia herself asked tuition without good
pay, I should shut the door in her face; but, much as I need
money, I would not risk my reputation by praising what was
poor. If one of my children—that miserable little <ins title="Was period">Beatrice,</ins>
yonder—only had your voice, do you think I would copy
music, or teach beginners, or live in this cursed hole? You
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_100"></a>100</span>
have a fortune shut up in your throat, and some day, when
you are celebrated, at least do me the justice to tell the world
who first found the treasure; and, out of your wealth, spare
me a decent tombstone in the Campo Santo of—of—”</p>
<p>He laughed bitterly, and, seizing his violin, filled the room
with mournful <i>miserere</i> strains.</p>
<p>“How long a course of training do you think will be necessary
before the inequalities in my voice can be corrected and
my vocalization perfected?”</p>
<p>“You are very young, miss, and it would not do to strain
your voice, which is well-nigh perfect in itself; but, of course,
your execution is defective,—just as a young nightingale cannot
warble all its strains before it is full-feathered. If you
study faithfully, in one year, or certainly one and a half, you
will be ready for your engagement at Della Scala. Hist! see
if you can follow me?”</p>
<p>He played a subtle, chromatic passage, ending in a trill, and
the orphan echoed it with such accuracy and sweetness that
the teacher threw down his bow, and, while tears stood in his
glittering eyes, he put his brown hand on the girl’s head, and
said, earnestly,—</p>
<p>“There ought to be feathers here instead of hair, for no
nightingale, nestled in the olive groves of Italy, ever warbled
more easily and naturally. Don’t go out to the world as Miss
Owen,—make it call you <i>Rosignuolo</i>. Take the next page in
the instruction-book for a new lesson, and practise the old
scales over before you touch the new,—they are like steps
in a ladder, and save jumps and jars. God made your voice
wonderful, and, if you are only careful not to undo his work,
it will develop itself every year in fresh power and depth.
Ha! if my poor squeaking Beatrice only had it! But there
is no more music stored in her throat and chest than in a
regiment of rats. Good day, miss. Your lesson is ended, and
I go to buy some wood for my miserable shiverers.”</p>
<p>He seized his hat and walking-stick and quitted the house,
leaving his pupil to gather up her music and conjecture,
meanwhile, whether the wood-yard or a neighboring bar-room
was his real destination.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_101"></a>101</span></div>
<p>His dissipated habits had greatly impaired her faith in the
accuracy of his critical acumen touching professional matters,
and, as she rolled up the sheet of paper in her hands, Salome
approached the feeble occupant of the rocking-chair, and said,
rather abruptly,—</p>
<p>“Madam Barilli, you ought to know when your husband
speaks earnestly and when he is merely indulging in idle flattery,
and I wish to learn his real opinion of my voice. Will
you tell me the truth?”</p>
<p>“Yes, miss, I will. I am no musician, and never was in
Europe, where he studied; but he talks constantly of your
voice, and tells me there is a fortune in it. Only last night
he swore that if he could control it, he would not take a hundred
thousand dollars for the right; and then, poor fellow, he
fell into one of his fierce ways and boxed my little Beatrice’s
ears, because, he said, all the teachers in the <i>Conservatoire</i>
could not put into her throat the trill that you were born with.
Ah, no, he flatters no one now! He has forgotten how, since
the day that I was coaxed to run away from my father’s elegant
home and marry the tenor singer of an opera troupe and
the professor who taught me the gamut at boarding-school.
Miss, you may believe him, for Sebastian Barilli means what
he says.”</p>
<p>“One hundred thousand dollars! I promise him and you
that if one-half of that amount can be ‘trilled’ into my pocket
you shall both be comfortable during the remainder of your
days.”</p>
<p>“Mine are numbered, and will end before your career begins;
and, when you sing in Della Scala, I trust I shall be
singing up yonder behind the stars, where cold and hunger
and heart-ache and cruel words cannot follow me. But, miss,
when I am gone, and Sebastian is over at the corner trying
to drown his troubles, and my four helpless little ones are
left here unprotected, for God’s sake look in upon them now
and then, and don’t let them cry for bread. My own family
long ago cast me off, and here I am a stranger; but you, who
have felt the pangs of orphanage, will not stand by and see
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_102"></a>102</span>
my darlings starve! Oh, miss, the poor who cannot pity the
poor must be hard-hearted indeed!”</p>
<p>The suffering woman pressed her moaning babe closer to
her bosom, and, taking Salome’s hand between her thin, hot
fingers, bowed her tear-stained face upon it.</p>
<p>Grim recollections of similar scenes enacted in the old house
behind the mill crowded upon the mind of the miller’s daughter,
hardening instead of melting her heart; but, withdrawing
her fingers, she said in as kind a tone as she could command,—</p>
<p>“The poor are sometimes too poor to aid each other, and
pity is most unpalatable fare; but, if your husband has not
grossly deceived himself and me with reference to my voice,
I will promise that your children shall not suffer while I live.
For their sake do not despond, but try to keep up your
spirits, else your husband will be utterly ruined. Gloomy
hearthstones make club-rooms and bar-rooms populous.
Good-by. When I come again, I will bring something to
stimulate your appetite, which seems to require coaxing.”</p>
<p>She stooped and looked for a minute at the gaunt, white
face of the half-famished infant pressed against the mother’s
feverish breast, and an irresistible impulse impelled her to
stroke back the rings of black hair that clustered on its sunken
temples; then, snatching her music and bundle, she hurried
out of the close, untidy room, and, once more upon the grassy
common, drew a long, deep breath of pure fresh air.</p>
<p>Autumn, with orange dawns, and mellow, misty moons,
when</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Sweet, calm days, in golden haze<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Melt down the amber sky,”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>had died on bare brown stubble-fields and vine-veined hill-sides,
purple with clustering grapes on leafless branches; and
wintry days had come, with sleety morns and chill, crisp
noons, and scarlet sunset banners flouting the silver stars in
western skies, where the shivering, gasping old year had
woven,—</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_103"></a>103</span></div>
<p>None of the earlier years of Salome’s life seemed to her half
so drearily long as the four monotonous months that followed
Dr. Grey’s departure; and, during the intervals between his
brief letters to his sister, the orphan learned a deceptive
quietude of manner, at variance with the <ins title="Was tumultous">tumultuous</ins> feelings
that agitated her heart; for painful suspense which is borne
with clenched hands and firmly-set teeth is not the more
patient because sternly mute.</p>
<p>Which suffered least, Philoctetes howling on the shores of
Lemnos, or the silent Trojan priest, writhing in a death-struggle
with the serpent folds that crushed him before the
altar of Neptune?</p>
<p>If any messages intended for Salome found their way across
the ocean, they finally missed their destination, and reached
the dead-letter office of Miss Jane’s vast and inviolate pocket;
and, while this apparent neglect piqued the girl’s vanity, the
blessed assurance that the absent master was alive and well
proved a sovereign balm for all the bleeding wounds of <i>amour
propre</i>.</p>
<p>In order to defray the expense of her musical tuition,
which was carried on in profound secrecy, it was necessary
to redouble her exertions; and all the latent energy of her
character developed itself in unflagging work, which she persistently
prosecuted early and late, and in quiet defiance of
Miss Jane’s expostulations and predictions that she would
permanently impair her sight.</p>
<p>Paramount to the desire of amassing wealth that would
enable her to provide for Jessie and Stanley rose the hope
that the cultivation of her voice would invest her with talismanic
influence over the man who was singularly susceptible
of the magic of music; and, jealously guarding the new-found
gift, she spared no toil to render it perfect.</p>
<p>Fearful that her suddenly acquired fondness for singing
might arouse suspicion and inquiry, she rarely practised at
home unless Miss Jane were absent; and, having procured a
tuning-fork, she retreated to the most secluded portion of the
adjoining forest and rehearsed her lessons to a mute audience
of grazing cattle, sombre pines, nodding plumes of golden-rod,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_104"></a>104</span>
and shivering white asters, belated and overtaken by
wintry blasts. Alone with nature, she warbled as unrestrainedly
as the birds who listened to her quavering crescendos;
and more than once she had become so absorbed in this forest
practising, that twinkling stars peeped down at her through
the fringy canopy of murmuring firs.</p>
<p>In fulfilment of a promise given to Stanley, with the hope
of stimulating him to more earnest study, Salome one day
took a piece of sewing and her music-book, and set off with
her brother for the sea-shore, where he was sometimes allowed
to amuse himself by catching crabs and shrimps. The route
they were compelled to take was very circuitous, since strangers
were now forbidden to stroll through the grounds attached
to “Solitude,” which was the nearest point where land
and ocean met. Following a cattle-path that threaded the
bare brown hills and wound through low marsh meadows,
Salome at length climbed a cliff that overhung the narrow
strip of beach running along the base of the promontory, and,
while Stanley prepared his net, she applied herself vigorously
to the completion of a cluster of lilies of the valley which
she had begun to embroider the preceding night.</p>
<p>It was a mild, sunny afternoon, late in December, with only
a few flakes of white curd-like cirri drifting slowly before
the stiffening south wind that came singing a song of the
tropics over the gently heaving waste of waters—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Where the green buds of waves burst into white froth flowers.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Two glimmering sails stood like phantoms on the horizon;
and a silent colony of snowy gulls, perched in conclave on a
bit of weed-wreathed drift floating landward, were the only
living things in sight, save the childish figure on the yellow
beach under the bleaching rocks, and the girlish one seated on
the tallest cliff, where a storm-scarred juniper, bending inland,
waved its scanty fringe in the fresh salt breeze.</p>
<p>No note of human strife entered here, nor hum of noisy
business marts; and the solemn silence, so profound and holy,
was broken only by the soft, mysterious murmur of the immemorial
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_105"></a>105</span>
ocean, as its crystal fingers smote the harp of rosy
shells and golden sands.</p>
<p>Clasped in the crescent that curved a mile northward lay the
house, and grove, and grounds of “Solitude,” looking sombre
in the distance, as the shadow of surrounding hills fell upon
the dense foliage that overhung its quiet precincts, and toned
down the garish red of the boat-house roof, which lent a brief
dash of color to the peaceful picture. Beyond the last guarding
promontory that seemed to have plunged through the
shelving strand to bathe in blue brine and cut off all passage
along its base, a strong well-trained eye might follow the trend
of the coast even to the dim outlines and thread-like masts,
that told where the distant town hugged its narrow harbor;
and, in the opposite direction, low, irregular sand hills and
brown marshes crept southward, as if hunting the warmth
that alone could mantle them with living verdure.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore away, the sinking sun dipped suddenly
behind a wooded eminence, which, losing the warm
purples it had worn since noon, grew chill and blue as his rays
departed; and, weary of her work, Salome put it aside and
began to practise her music lesson, beating time with her
slender fingers on the bare juniper-roots, from which wind
and rain had driven the soil. Running her chromatic scales,
and pausing at will to trill upon any minor note that wooed
her vagrant fancy, she played with her flexible voice as dexterous
violinists toy with the obedient strings they hold in
harmonious bondage to their bows.</p>
<p>Finally she pushed the exercises away, and began a <i>fantasus</i>
from “Traviata,” which she had heard Mr. Barilli play
several times; and so absorbed was she in testing her capacity
for vocal gymnastics that she failed to observe the moving
figure dwarfed by distance and pacing the sands in front of
“Solitude.”</p>
<p>The rich, fresh tones which seemed occasionally to tremble
with the excess of melody that burdened them played hide-and-seek
among the hills, startling whole choruses of deep-throated
echoes, and attending and retentive ocean, catching
the strains on her beryl strings, bore them whither—and how
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_106"></a>106</span>
far? To palm-plumed equatorial isles, where dying auricular
nerves mistook them for seraphic utterances? To toiling mariners,
tossed helplessly by fierce typhoons, who, pausing in
their scramble for spars, listened to the weird melody that
presaged woe and wreck? To the broken casements of fishermen’s
huts, on distant shores, where anxious wives peered out
in the blackening tempest, and shrank back appalled by
sounds which sea-tradition averred were born in coral caves,
mosaiced with blanching human skulls? What hoary hierophant
in the mysteries of cataphonics and diacoustics will
undertake to track those trills across the blue bosom of the
Atlantic or the purplish billows of the Indian Ocean?</p>
<p>The wind went down with the sun; silver-edged cirri lost
their glitter, and swift was</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> “The spread</p>
<p class="cg">Of orange lustre through these azure spheres<br>
Where little clouds lie still like flocks of sheep,<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In that wondrous and magical after-glow which tenderly
hovers over the darkening face of the dying day, like the
strange, spectral smile that only sheds its cold, supernatural
light on lips twelve hours dead, Salome’s fair face and graceful
<i>pose</i> was as softly defined against the western sky as some
nimbussed saint or madonna on the golden background of old
Byzantine pictures. Her small straw hat, wreathed with
scarlet poppies, lay at her feet; and around her shoulders she
had closely folded a bright plaid flannel cloak, which tinted
her complexion with its ruddy hues, as firelight flushes the
olive portraits that stare at it from surrounding walls, and the
braided black hair and large hazel eyes showed every brown
tint and topaz gleam.</p>
<p>Leaning her arms on the top of her music-book, she rested
her chin upon them, and sat looking seaward, singing a difficult
passage, in the midst of which her nimble voice tripped
on an E flat, and, missing the staccato step, rolled helplessly
down in a legato flood of melody; whereupon, with an impatient
grimace she shut her eyes, weary of watching the wave-shimmer
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_107"></a>107</span>
that almost dazzled her. After a few seconds, when
she opened them, there stood just on the edge of the cliff, as
if poised in air, a woman whose face and form were as sharply
cut in profile on the azure sea and sky as white cameo features
on black agate grounds.</p>
<p>Around the tall figure shining folds of silver poplin hung
heavy and statuesque, and over the shoulders a blue crape
shawl was held by a beautiful blue-veined hand, where a sapphire
asp kept guard; while a cluster of double violets fastened
behind one shell-like ear breathed their perfume among
glossy bands of gray hair.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“There was no color in the quiet mouth,<br>
Nor fulness; yet it had a ghostly grace,<br>
Pathetically pale,”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>and wan, and woful—the still face turned seaward, fronting a
round white moon that was lifting its full disk out of the line
where air and water met—she stood motionless.</p>
<p>Lifting her head, Salome shivered involuntarily, and grew
a shade paler as she breathlessly watched the apparition, expecting
that it would fade into blue air or float down and
mingle with the waters that gave it birth. But there was no
wavering mistiness about the shining drapery; and, presently,
when she turned and came forward, the orphan, despite her
sneers at superstition, felt the hair creep and rise on her
temples, and, springing to her feet, they faced each other.
As the stranger advanced, Salome unconsciously retreated a
few steps, and exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Gray-eyed, gray-haired, gray-clad, gray-faced, and rising
out of that gray sea, I suppose I have at last met the gray
ghost that people tell me haunts old ‘Solitude.’ But how
came such a young face under that drift of white hair? If
all ghosts have such finely carved, delicate noses and chins,
such oval cheeks and pretty brows, most of us here in the
flesh might thank fortune for a chance to ‘shuffle off this
mortal coil.’ Say, are you the troubled evil spirit that haunts
‘Solitude’?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_108"></a>108</span></div>
<p>The voice was so mournfully sweet that it thrilled every
nerve in Salome’s quivering frame.</p>
<p>“Phantom or flesh—which are you?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, the owner of ‘Solitude.’”</p>
<p>“Oh, indeed! I beg your pardon, madam, but I took you
for a wraith! You know the place has always been considered
unlucky—haunted—and you are such an extraordinary-looking
person I was inclined to think I had stumbled
on the traditional ghost. I am neither ignorant nor stupidly
superstitious; but, madam, you must admit you have an unearthly
appearance; and, moreover, I should be glad to know
how you rose from the beach below to the top of this cliff?
I see no feathers on your shoulders—no balloon under your
feet!”</p>
<p>“I was walking on the sands in front of my door, and,
hearing some very sweet strains that came floating down from
this direction, I followed the sound, and climbed by means
of steps cut in the side of this cliff. Since you regarded me
as a spectre, I may as well tell you that I was beginning to
fancy I was listening to one of the old sea-sirens, until I saw
your rosy face and red lips, far too human for a dripping mermaid
or a murderous, mocking Aglaiopheme.”</p>
<p>“No more a siren, madam, than you are a ghost! I am
only Salome Owen, the miller’s child, waiting for that boy
yonder, whose sublimest idea of heaven consists in the hope
that its blessed sea of glass is brimming with golden shrimp.
Stanley, run around the cliff, and meet me. It is too late
for us to be here. We should have started home an hour ago.”</p>
<p>“Who taught you ‘Traviata’?”</p>
<p>“I am teaching myself, with what small help I can obtain
from a vagabond musician, who calls himself Signor Barilli,
and claims to have been a tenor singer in an opera troupe at
Milan.”</p>
<p>“You ought to cultivate your voice as thoroughly as possible.”</p>
<p>“Why? Is it really good? Tell me, is it worth anything?
No one has heard it except that Italian violinist; and, if he
praises it, I sometimes fear it is because he is so horribly dissipated
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_109"></a>109</span>
that he confounds my <i>bravura</i> runs with the clicking
of his wine-glasses and the gurgling of his flask. Do you
know much about music?”</p>
<p>“I have heard the best living performers, vocal and instrumental,
and to a finer voice than yours I never listened; but
you need study and practice, for your execution is faulty.
You have a splendid instrument; but you do not yet understand
its management. Where do you live?”</p>
<p>“At ‘Grassmere,’ a farm two miles behind those hills, and
in a house hidden under elm and apple trees. Madam, it is
very late, and I must bid you good-evening. Before I go, I
should like to know, if you will not deem me unwarrantably
impertinent, whether you are a very young person with white
hair, or whether you are a very old woman with a wonderfully
young face?”</p>
<p>For a moment there was no answer; and, supposing that she
had offended her, the orphan bowed and was turning away,
when Mrs. Gerome’s calm, mournful tones arrested her:</p>
<p>“I am only twenty-three years old.”</p>
<p>She walked away, turning her countenance towards the
water, where moonlight was burnishing the waves; and, when
Salome and Stanley had reached the bend in their path that
would shut out the view of the beach, the former looked back
and saw the silver-gray figure standing alone on the silent
shore, communing with the silver sea, as desolate and as hopeless
as Buchanan’s “Penelope,”—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Doctor Sheldon, do you think she is dangerously ill?”</p>
<p>“I am afraid, Salome, that she will soon become so; for
she is threatened with a violent attack of pneumonia, which
would certainly be very dangerous to a woman of her age. It
is a great misfortune that her brother is absent.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_110"></a>110</span></div>
<p>“Dr. Grey reached New York three days ago.”</p>
<p>“Indeed! I will telegraph immediately, and hasten his
return.”</p>
<p>Dr. Sheldon was preparing a blister in the room adjoining
the one occupied by Miss Jane, and the orphan stood by his
side, twisting her fingers nervously over each other, and looking
perplexed and anxious. He returned to his patient, and
when he came out some moments later, and took up his hat,
his countenance was by no means reassuring.</p>
<p>“Although I know that you are very much attached to
Miss Jane, and would faithfully endeavor to nurse her, you
are so young and inexperienced that I do not feel quite willing
to leave her entirely to your guardianship; and, therefore,
shall send a woman here to-night who will fully understand
the case. She is a professional nurse, and Dr. Grey will be
relieved to hear that his sister is in her hands, for he has
great confidence in her good sense and discretion. I shall
stop at the telegraph office, as I go home, and urge him to
return at once. Give me his address. Do not look so dejected.
Miss Grey has a better constitution than most persons
are disposed to believe, and she may struggle through this
attack.”</p>
<p>The new year was ushered in by heavy and incessant rains,
and, having imprudently insisted upon superintending the
drainage of a new sheepfold and the erection of an additional
cattle-shed, Miss Jane had taken a severe cold, which resulted
in pneumonia.</p>
<p>Assiduously and tenderly Salome watched over her, and
even after the arrival of Hester Dennison, the nurse, the orphan’s
solicitude would not permit her to quit the apartment
where her benefactress lay struggling with disease; while
Miss Jane shrank from the stranger, and preferred to receive
the medicine from the hand of her adopted child.</p>
<p>When Dr. Sheldon stood by the bed early next morning, and
noted the effect of his treatment, Salome’s keen eye observed
the dissatisfied expression of his face, and she drew sad auguries
from his clouded brow. He took a paper from his pocket,
and said, cheerfully,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_111"></a>111</span></div>
<p>“Come, Miss Jane, get up a smile to pay me for the good
news I bring. Can you guess what this means?” holding an
envelope close to her eyes.</p>
<p>“More blisters and fever mixtures, I suppose. Doctor, my
poor side is in a dreadful condition.”</p>
<p>As she laid her hand over her left lung, she winced and
groaned.</p>
<p>“How much would you give to have your brother’s hand,
instead of mine, on your pulse?”</p>
<p>“All that I am worth! But my boy is in Europe, and can’t
come back to me now, when I need him most.”</p>
<p>“No, he is in New York. You have been dreaming, and
forget that he has reached America.”</p>
<p>“No, I never knew it. Salome, is there a letter?”</p>
<p>“No letter, but a dispatch announcing his arrival. I told
you; but you must have fallen asleep while I was talking to
you.”</p>
<p>“No such thing! I have not slept a wink for a week.”</p>
<p>“That is right, Miss Jane; scold as much as you like; it
will do you no harm. But, meantime, let me tell you I have
just heard from Dr. Grey, and he is now on his way home.”</p>
<p>Salome was sitting near the pillow, and suddenly her head
bowed itself, while her lips whispered, inaudibly,—</p>
<p>“Thank God!”</p>
<p>The invalid’s face brightened, and, stretching her thin, hot
hand towards the orphan, she touched her shoulder, and
said:—</p>
<p>“Do you hear that, my child? Ulpian is coming home.
When will he be here?”</p>
<p>“Day after to-morrow evening, I hope, if there is no
detention and he makes all the railroad connections. I trust
you will prove sufficiently generous to bear testimony to my
professional skill, by improving so rapidly that when he
arrives there will be nothing left to do but compliment my
sagacity, and thank me for relieving you so speedily. Is not
your cough rather better?”</p>
<p>She did not reply; and, bending down, he saw that she was
asleep.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_112"></a>112</span></div>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“Doctor</ins>, I am afraid she is not much better.”</p>
<p>He sighed, shook his head, and beckoned Hester into the
hall in order to question her more minutely concerning the
patient.</p>
<p>That night and the next she was delirious, and failed to
recognize any one; but about noon on the following day she
opened her eyes, and, looking intently at Salome, who stood
near the foot of the bed, she said, as if much perplexed,—</p>
<p>“I saw Ulpian just now. Where is he?”</p>
<p>“He will be here this afternoon, I hope. The train is due
at two o’clock, and it is now a quarter past twelve.”</p>
<p>“I tell you I saw him not ten minutes since.”</p>
<p>“You are feverish, dear Miss Jane, and have been dreaming.”</p>
<p>“Don’t contradict me! Am I in my dotage, think you? I
saw my boy, and he was pale, and had blood on his hands,
and it ran down his beard and dripped on his vest. You can’t
deceive me! What is the matter with my poor boy? I will
see him! Give me my crutches this instant!”</p>
<p>She struggled into a partially upright position, but fell back
upon her pillow exhausted and panting for breath.</p>
<p>“You were delirious. I give you my word that he has not
yet come home. It was only a horrible dream. Hester will
assure you of the truth of what I say. You must lie still, for
this excitement will injure you.”</p>
<p>The nurse gave her a powerful sedative, and strove to divert
her thoughts; but ever and anon she shuddered and whispered,—</p>
<p>“It was not a dream. I saw my dear sailor-boy, and he
was hurt and bleeding. I know what I saw; and if you and
Hester swore till every star dropped out of heaven, I would
not believe you. If I am old and dying, my eyes are better
than yours. My poor Ulpian!”</p>
<p>Despite her knowledge of the feverish condition of the sick
woman, and her incredulity with reference to the vision that
so painfully disturbed her, Salome’s lips blanched, and a
vague, nameless, horrible dread seized her heart.</p>
<p>Very soon Miss Jane fell into a heavy sleep, and, while the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_113"></a>113</span>
nurse busied herself in preparing a bottle of beef-tea, the
orphan sat with her head pressed against the bedpost, and
her eyes riveted on the face of the watch in her palm, where
the minute-hand seemed now and then to stop, as if for
breathing-time, and the hour-hand to have forgotten the way
to two o’clock.</p>
<p>For nearly six months Salome had counted the weeks and
days,—had waited and hoped for the hour of Dr. Grey’s return
as the happiest of her life,—had imagined his greeting,
the bright, steady glow in his fine eyes, the warm, cordial
pressure of his white hand, the friendly tones of his pleasant
voice; for, though he had failed to bid her good-by, fate could
not cheat her out of the interview that must follow his arrival.
Fancy had painted so vividly all the incidents that would
characterize this longed-for greeting, that she had lived it over
a thousand times; and, now that the meeting seemed actually
at hand, she asked herself whether it were possible that disappointment
could pour one poisonous drop into the brimming
draught of joy that rose foaming in amber bubbles to her
parched lips.</p>
<p>In the profound silence that pervaded the darkened room,
the ticking of the watch was annoyingly audible, and seemed
to Salome’s strained and excited nerves so unusually loud that
she feared it might disturb the sleeper. At a quarter to two
o’clock she went to the hearth and noiselessly renewed the fire,
laying two fresh pieces of oak across the shining brass andirons,
whose feet represented lions’ heads.</p>
<p>She swept the hearth, arranged some vials that were scattered
on the dressing-table, and gave a few improving touches
to a vase filled with white and orange crocuses, then crept back
to the bedside and again picked up the watch. It still lacked
fifteen minutes of two, and, looking more closely, she found
that it had stopped. Tossing it into a hollow formed by the
folds of the coverlid, and repressing an impatient ejaculation,
she listened for the sound of the railroad whistle, which,
though muffled by distance, had not failed to reach her every
day during the past week.</p>
<p>Presently the silence, which made her ears ache, throbbed
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_114"></a>114</span>
so suddenly that she started, but it was only the “cuckoo!
cuckoo!” of the painted bird on the gilded clock. That
clock was fifteen minutes slower than Miss Jane’s watch; and
Salome put her face in her hands, and tried to still the loud
thumping sound of the blood at her heart.</p>
<p>The train was behind time. Only a few moments as yet,
but something must have happened to occasion even this
slight delay; and, if something,—what?</p>
<p>Hester came in and whispered,—</p>
<p>“Dinner is ready, and Stanley is hungry. Has Miss Jane
stirred since I went out?”</p>
<p>“No; what time is it?”</p>
<p>“Half after two.”</p>
<p>“Oh, nonsense! You are too fast.”</p>
<p>“Not a minute,—begging your pardon. My brother stays
at the dépot, and keeps my watch with the railroad time.”</p>
<p>Salome went to the dining-room, gave Stanley his dinner,
and, anxious to escape observation, shut herself in the dim,
cold parlor, where she paced the floor until the cuckoo jumped
out, chirped three times, and, as if frightened by the girl’s
fixed eyes, fluttered back inside the clock. More than an hour
behind time! Now, beyond all hope or doubt, there had been
an accident! Loss of sleep for several consecutive nights,
and protracted anxiety concerning Miss Jane, had so unnerved
the orphan that she was less able to cope successfully with
this harrowing suspense than on former occasions; still the
sanguine hopefulness of youth battled valiantly with the
ghouls that apprehension conjured up, and she remembered
that comparatively trivial occurrences had sometimes detained
the train, which finally brought all its human freight safely
to the dépot.</p>
<p>The day had been very cold and gloomy; and thick, low
masses of smoke-colored cloud scudded across the chill sky,
whipped along their skirts by a stinging north-east blast into
dun, ragged, trailing banners. Despite the keenness of the
air, Salome opened one of the parlor windows and leaned her
face on the broad sill, where a drizzling rain began to show itself.
She had read and heard just enough with reference
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_115"></a>115</span>
to the phenomena of <i>clairvoyance</i> to sneer at them in happy
hours, and to recur helplessly to the same subject with a species
of silent dread when misfortune seemed imminent. To-day,
as Miss Jane’s delirious utterances haunted every nook and
cranny of her excited brain, permeating all topics of thought,
<ins title="Was se">she</ins> recalled many instances, on legendary record, where the
dying were endowed with talismanic power over the secrets
of futurity. Could it be possible that Miss Jane had really
seen what was taking place many miles distant? Reason
shook her hoary head, and jeered at such childish fatuity;
but superstitious credulity, goaded by an intense anxiety,
would not be silenced nor put to the blush, but boldly babbled
of Swedenborg and burning Stockholm.</p>
<p>Once she had heard Dr. Grey tell his sister, in answer to
some inquiry concerning the <i>arcana</i> of mesmerism, that he
had bestowed much time and thought upon the investigation
of the subject, and was thoroughly convinced that there existed
subtle psychological laws whose operations were not yet comprehended,
but which, when analyzed and studied, would explain
the remarkable influence of mind over mind, and prove
that the dread and baffling mysteries of psychology were
merely normal developments of intellectual power instead of
supernatural or spiritual manifestations.</p>
<p>This abstract view of the matter was, however, most unsatisfactory
at the present juncture; and the current of Salome’s
reflections was abruptly changed by the sound of the locomotive
whistle,—not the prolonged, steady roar, announcing
arrival, but the sharp, short, shrill note of departure. Soon
after, the clock struck four, and, ere the echoes fell asleep
once more in the sombre corners of the quiet parlor, Dr. Sheldon
drove up to the front door and entered the house.
Springing into the hall, Salome met him, and laid her hand
on his arm.</p>
<p>“Salome, your face frightens me. How is Miss Jane?
Has she grown worse so rapidly since I was here this morning?”</p>
<p>“I see little change in her. But you have locked bad
news behind your set teeth. Oh, for God’s sake, don’t torture
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_116"></a>116</span>
me one second longer! Tell me the worst. What has happened?”</p>
<p>“The down-train was thrown from an embankment twenty
feet high, and the cars took fire. Many lives have been sacrificed,
and it is the most awful affair I ever heard of.”</p>
<p>He had partially averted his head to avoid the sight of her
whitening and convulsed features; but, laying her hands heavily
upon his shoulders, she forced him to face her, and her
voice sank to a husky whisper,—</p>
<p>“Is he dead?”</p>
<p>“I hope not.”</p>
<p>“Speak out,—or I shall go mad! Is he dead?”</p>
<p>“Calm yourself, Salome, and let us hope for the best. We
know nothing of the particulars of this dreadful disaster, and
have learned the names of none of the sufferers. I have little
doubt that Dr. Grey was on the train, but there is no certainty
that he was injured. The regular up-train could not leave
as usual, because the track was badly torn up; but a locomotive
and three cars ran out a while ago with several surgeons and
articles required for the victims. Pray sit down, my poor
child, for you are unable to stand.”</p>
<p>“Where did it happen?”</p>
<p>“Near Silver Run water-tank,—about forty miles from
here. The accident occurred at twelve o’clock.”</p>
<p>Salome’s grasp suddenly relaxed, and, tossing her hands
above her head, she laughed hysterically,—</p>
<p>“Ha, ha! Thank God, he is not dead! He is only hurt,—only
bleeding. Miss Jane saw it all, and he is not dead, or
she would have known it. Thank God!”</p>
<p>Dr. Sheldon was a stern man and renowned for his iron
nerves, but he shuddered as he looked at the pinched, wan face,
and heard the unnatural, hollow sound of her unsteady voice.
Had care, watching, and suspense unpoised her reason?</p>
<p>Something of that which passed through his mind looked
out of his eyes, and interpreting their amazed expression, the
girl waved her hand towards the door, and added,—</p>
<p>“I am not insane. Go in, and Hester will explain.”</p>
<p>He turned away, and she went back to the dusky room and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_117"></a>117</span>
threw herself down on the sofa, opposite to the portrait of
the U.S. surgeon.</p>
<p>Of what passed during the following two hours, she retained,
in after years, only a dim, confused, painful memory of
prayers and promises made to God in behalf of the absent.</p>
<p>Once before, when Miss Jane’s death seemed imminent, she
had been grieved and perplexed by the possibility that Dr.
Grey would inherit the estate and usurp her domains; but
to-day, when the Great Reaper hovered over the panting,
emaciated sufferer, and simultaneously threatened the distant
brother and sole heir of the extended possessions which this
girl had so long coveted, the only thought that filled her
heart with dread and wrung half-smothered cries from her
lips was,—</p>
<p>“Spare his life, oh, my God! Leave me penniless—take
friends, relatives, comforts, hopes of wealth—take all—take
everything, but spare that precious life and bring him safely
back to me! Have mercy on me, O Lord, and do not snatch
him away! for, if I lose him now, I lose faith in Christ—in
Thee—I lose all hope in time and eternity, and my sinful,
wrecked soul will go down forever in a night that knows no
dawning!”</p>
<p>For six months she had been indeed,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“A faded watcher through the weary night—<br>
A meek, sweet statue at the silver shrines,<br>
In deep, perpetual prayer for him she loved;”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>but patience, dragging anchor, finally snapped its cable, and
now, instead of an humble suppliant for the boon that alone
made existence endurable, she fiercely demanded that her idol
should not be broken, and, battling with Jehovah, impiously
thrust her life down before Him as an accursed and intolerable
burden, unless her prayers were granted. Ah, what
scorpions and stones we gather to our boards, and then dare
charge the stinging mockeries against a long-suffering, loving
God! Ten days before, Salome had meekly prayed, “Thy will
be done,” and had comforted herself with the belief that at last
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_118"></a>118</span>
she was beginning to grow pious and trusting, like Miss Jane;
but, at the first hint of harm to Dr. Grey, she sprang up,
utterly oblivious of the protestations of resignation that were
scarcely cold on her lips, and furious as a tigress who sees the
hunter approach the jungle where all her fierce affections
centre. God help as all who pray orthodoxly for His will, and
yet, when the emergency arrives, fight desperately for our own,
feeling wofully aggrieved that He takes us at our word, and
moulds the clay which we make a Pharisaical pretense of
offering!</p>
<p>A slow drizzling rain whitened the distant hills, that seemed
to blanch in their helplessness as the wind smote them like a
flail; and it wove a grayish veil over the leafless boughs of
bending, shivering elms, on the long, dim avenue. The
wintry afternoon closed swiftly, and, in its dusky dreariness,
Salome listened to the tattoo of the rain on the roof, and to the
<i>miserere</i> that wailed through the lonely chambers of her soul.
The chill at her heart froze her to numbness and oblivion of
the coldness of the atmosphere, and, when a servant came in
to close the window against the slanting sleet, she lay so still
that the woman thought her asleep, and stole away on tip-toe.
The room grew dark; but, through the half-opened door, the
light from the hall lamp crept in and fell on the gilded frame
and painted face of the portrait, tracing a silvery path along
the gloomy wall. As the night deepened, that wave of light
rippled and glittered until the handsome features in the picture
seemed to belong to some hierarch who peeped from a
window of heaven, into a world drenched with unlifting
darkness.</p>
<p>That oval piece of canvas had become the one fetich to
which Salome’s heart clung in silent adoration, defiant of the
iconoclastic touch of reason and the adverse decree of womanly
pride; for natures such as hers will always grovel in the dust,
hugging the mutilated fragments of their idol, rather than
bow at some new, fretted shrine, where other images hold
sway, commanding worship. Looking up almost wolfishly at
that tranquil, shining countenance, she said to her sullen,
mourning heart,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_119"></a>119</span></div>
<p>“There are no more like him, and, if we lose him, there is
nothing left in life, and all hope is at an end, and <i>finis</i> shall
be printed on the first page of the book of our existence; and
ruin, like a pitiless pall, shall cover what might have been a
happy, possibly a grand and good, human career. We did
not intend to love him,—no, no; we tried hard to hate him
who stood between us and affluence and indolent ease, but he
conquered us by his matchless magnanimity, and shamed our
ignoble aims and base selfishness, and put us under his royal
feet; and now we would rather be trampled by Ulpian, our
king, than crowned by any other man. Let us plead with
Christ to spare the only pilot who can save us from eternal
shipwreck.”</p>
<p>Lying there so helpless yet defiant in her desolation, some
subtle thread of association, guided, perhaps, by the invisible
fingers of her guardian angel, led her mind to a favorite couplet
often quoted by Dr. Grey,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“I heard faith’s low, sweet singing, in the night,<br>
And, groping through the darkness, touched God’s hand.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>If the painted lips in the aureola on the wall had parted
and audibly uttered these words, they would scarcely have
impressed her more powerfully as a message from the absent;
and, rising instantly, the orphan prayed in chastened, humbled
tones for strength to be patient, for ability to trust God’s wisdom
and mercy.</p>
<p>How often, when binding our idolized Isaacs upon the altar,
and, meekly submissive to what appears God’s inexorable mandates,
we unmurmuringly offer our heart’s dearest treasure,
the sacrificial knife is stayed, and our loathed and horrible
Moriahs, that erst smelt of blood and echoed woe, become hallowed
Jehovah-jirehs, all aglow, not with devouring flames,
but the blessed radiance of God’s benignant smile, and musical
with thanksgiving strains. But Abraham’s burden preceded
Abraham’s boon, and the souls who cannot patiently endure
the first are utterly unworthy of the rapture of the last.</p>
<p>As the girl’s mind grew calmer under the breath of prayer—which
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_120"></a>120</span>
stills the billows of human passion and strife as the
command of Jesus smoothed the thundering surf of Genesareth,—she
recollected that she had absented herself from the
sick-room for an unusually long time. How long, she could
not conjecture, for the face of the clock was invisible, and she
had ceased to count the cuckoo-notes; but her limbs ached,
and a fillet of fire seemed to circle her brow.</p>
<p>With a lingering gaze upon the radiant portrait, she quitted
the parlor, and went wearily back to renew her vigil.</p>
<p>Hester Dennison was cowering over the hearth, spreading
her bony hands towards the crackling flames, and, walking up
to the mantelpiece, Salome touched the nurse, and whispered,—</p>
<p>“Hester, what did the doctor say? Is there any change?”</p>
<p>“Hush!” The woman laid a finger on her lip, and
glanced over her shoulder.</p>
<p>There was only a subdued light of a shaded lamp mingling
with the flicker of the fire, and, as Salome’s eyes followed
those of the nurse, they rested upon the figure of a man
kneeling at the bedside, and leaning his head against the pillow
where Miss Jane’s white hair was strewn in disorder.</p>
<p>A cry of delight, which she had neither the prudence nor
power to repress, rang through the silent chamber, startling
its inmates, and partially arousing the invalid. Salome forgot
that life and death were grappling over the prostrate form
of the aged woman,—forgot everything but the supreme joy
of knowing that her idol had not been rudely shattered.</p>
<p>Springing to the bedside, she put out her hands, and exclaimed,
rapturously:</p>
<p>“Oh, Dr. Grey! Were you much hurt? Thank God, you
are alive and here! Indeed, He is merciful—”</p>
<p>“Hush! Have you no prudence? Quit the room, or be
quiet.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey lifted his haggard face from the pillow, and the
light showed it pallid and worn by acute suffering, while a
strip of plaster pressed together the edges of a deep cut on
his cheek. His clothes glistened with sleet, and bore stains
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_121"></a>121</span>
that in daylight were crimson, though now they were only
ominously dark.</p>
<p>The stern tones of his voice, suppressed though it was,
stung the girl’s heart; and she answered, in a pleading whisper,—</p>
<p>“Only tell me that you are not severely injured. Speak
one kind word to me!”</p>
<p>“I am not dangerously hurt. Hush! Remember life
hangs in the balance.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Dr. Grey! will you not even shake hands with me,
after all these dreary months of absence? This is hard, indeed.”</p>
<p>She had stood at his side, with her hands extended imploringly;
and now he moved cautiously, and, silently holding
up one hand swathed in linen bands, pointed to his left arm,
which was tightly splintered and bandaged.</p>
<p>The mute gesture explained all, and, sinking to the carpet,
she pressed her lips to the linen folds, and to the coat-sleeve,
where sleet and blood-spots mingled.</p>
<p>He could not have prevented her, even had he desired to do
so; but at that instant his sister moaned faintly, and, bending
forward to examine her countenance, he seemed for some minutes
unconscious of the presence of the form crouching close
by his side.</p>
<p>After a little while he looked down, sighed, and whispered,—</p>
<p>“My child, do go to bed. You can do no good here, and too
much watching has already unstrung your nerves. Go to your
room, and pray that God will spare our dear Janet to us.”</p>
<p>Was this the welcome for which she had waited and longed—of
which she had dreamed by day and by night? Not a
touch, barely a brief, impatient glance, and a few reproving,
indifferent words. She had rashly dared fate to cheat her out
of this long-anticipated greeting, and the grim, grinning crone
had accepted the challenge, and now triumphantly snapped
her withered fingers in the face of the vanquished.</p>
<p>When coveted fruit that has been hungrily watched through
the slow, tedious process of ripening finally falls rosy and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_122"></a>122</span>
mellow into eagerly uplifted fingers, and breaks in a shower
of bitter dust on the sharpened and fastidious palate, it rarely
happens that the half-famished dupe relishes the taste; and
Salome rose, feeling stunned and mocked.</p>
<p>In one corner of the room stood a chintz-covered lounge,
and, creeping to it, she laid herself down; and, shading her
features with her hand, looked through her fingers at the pale,
grieved face of the anxious brother. Sometimes he stood up,
studying the placid countenance of the sufferer, and now and
then he walked softly to the fire-place, and held whispered
conferences with Hester relative to the course of treatment
that had been pursued.</p>
<p>But everywhere Salome’s eyes followed him; and finally,
when he chanced to glance at the couch, and noticed its occupant,
whom he imagined fast asleep, he pointed to a blanket
lying on a chair, and directed Hester to spread it over the
girlish figure. The thoughtful act warmed the orphan’s
heart more effectually than the thick woollen cover; and when
he sat down in an easy-chair close to the bed, and within
range of Salome’s vision, she yielded to the comforting consciousness
of his presence. And, while her lips were moving
in thanks for his preservation and return, exhausted nature
seized her dues, and the girl fell asleep and dreamed that Dr.
Grey stood by the lounge, and whispered,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“No star goes down, but climbs in other skies;<br>
The rose of sunset folds its glory up<br>
To burst again from out the heart of dawn,<br>

And sorrow makes the chastened heart a seer;<br>
The deepest dark reveals the starriest hope,<br>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Yes, Hester, the danger is past; and, if the weather continues
favorable, my sister will soon be able to sit up. My
gratitude prompts me to erect an altar here, where the mercy
of God stayed the Destroying Angel, as in ancient days David
consecrated the threshing-floor of Araunah.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, if you can possibly spare me, I should like to
go back to town to-day as Dr. Sheldon has sent for me to
take charge of a patient at his Infirmary.”</p>
<p>“You ought not to desert me while I am so comparatively
helpless; and I should be glad to have you remain, at least
until I recover the use of my hands.”</p>
<p>“Miss Salome can take my place, and do all that is really
necessary.”</p>
<p>“The child is so inexperienced I am almost afraid to trust
her; still—”</p>
<p>“Don’t speak so loud. She is standing behind the window-curtain.”</p>
<p>“Indeed! I thought she left the room when I entered it.
Of course, Hester, I will not detain you if it is necessary that
you should be at the Infirmary; but I give you up very reluctantly.
Salome, if you are at leisure, please come and
see how Hester dresses my hand and arm, for I must rely
upon your kind services when she leaves us. Notice the manner
in which she winds the bandages. There, Hester,—not
quite so tight.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I never had an education, and am at best an
ignorant, poor soul: therefore, not knowing what to think
about many curious things that happen in sick-rooms, I should
be glad to hear what you have to say concerning that vision
of your sister. Remember, she saw it at the very minute
that the accident happened. I don’t believe in spirit-rapping,
and such stuff as dancing tables, and spinning chairs,
and pianos that play tunes when no human being is near
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_124"></a>124</span>
them; but I have heard and seen things that made the hair
rise and stand on my head.”</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“</ins>The circumstance that occurred three days since is certainly
rather singular and remarkable, but by no means inexplicable.
My sister knew that I was then travelling by railroad,—that
I would, without some unusual delay, reach the
dépot at a certain hour, and, being in a delirious condition,
her mind reverted to the probability of some occurrence that
might detain me. Having always evinced a peculiar aversion
to railroads, which she deems the most unsafe method of travelling,
she had a feverish dream that took its coloring from her
excited apprehension of danger to me; and this vision, born
of delirium, was so vivid that she could not distinguish phantom
from reality. In ninety-nine cases out of every hundred
similar ones, the dream passes without fulfilment, and is rarely
recollected or mentioned; but the hundredth—which may
chance by some surprising coincidence to seem verified—is
noised abroad as supernatural, and carefully preserved among
‘well-authenticated spiritual manifestations.’ If I had escaped
injury, the freaks of my sister’s delirium would have
made no more impression on your mind than the ravings of a
lunatic; and, since I was so unfortunate as to be bruised and
burned, you must not allow yourself to grow superstitious,
and attach undue importance to a circumstance which was
entirely accidental, and only startling because so exceedingly
rare. Presentiments, especially when occurring in cases of
fever, are merely Will-o-the-wisps floating about in excited,
diseased brains. While at sea, and constantly associated with
sailors, whose minds constitute the most favorable and fruitful
soil for the production of phantasmagoria and <i>diablerie</i>,
I had frequent opportunities of testing the fallacy and absurdity
of so-called ‘presentiments and forebodings.’ I am
afraid it is the absence of spirituality in the hearts of the
people, that drives this generation to seek supernaturalism in
the realm of merely normal physics. The only true spiritualism
is that which emanates from the Holy Ghost,—conquers
sinful impulses, and makes a Christian heart the temple of
God.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_125"></a>125</span></div>
<p>Here Miss Jane called Hester into the adjoining room;
and turning to Salome, Dr. Grey added,—</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding the vaunted destruction of the ancient
Hydra of superstition by the darts and javelins of modern
rationalism, and the ponderous hot irons of empirics, it is
undeniably true that the habit of ‘seeking after a sign’ survived
the generation of Scribes and Pharisees whom Christ
rebuked; and manifests itself in the middle of the nineteenth
century by the voracity with which merely material phenomena
are seized as unmistakable indications of preternatural
agencies. The innate leaven of superstition triumphs
over common sense and scientific realism, and men and women
are awed by coincidences that reason scouts, but credulity
receives with open arms. Salome, I regret exceedingly that
I am forced to trouble you, but there are some important letters
which I wish to mail to-day, and you will greatly oblige
me by acting as amanuensis while I dictate. My present disabled
condition must apologize for the heavy tax which I am
imposing upon your patience and industry. Will you come to
the <ins title="Added quote and question mark">library?”</ins></p>
<p>She made no protestations of willingness to serve him, and
confessed no delight at the prospect of being useful, but merely
bowed and smiled, with an expression in her eyes that puzzled
him.</p>
<p>Seated at the library-table, and writing down the sentences
that he dictated while pacing the floor, Salome passed one of
the happiest hours of her life; for it brought the blessed assurance
that, for the present at least, he acknowledged his need
of her.</p>
<p>One of the letters was addressed to Mr. Gerard Granville,
an <i>attaché</i> of the American legation at Paris, and referred
principally to financial affairs; and the other, directed to
Muriel Manton, contained an urgent request that she and her
governess would leave New York as speedily as possible and
become inmates of his sister’s house.</p>
<p>When she had folded the letters and sealed them with his
favorite emerald signet,—bearing the words, “<i>Frangas non
Flectes</i>,”—Salome looked up, and asked,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_126"></a>126</span></div>
<p>“How old is your ward, Miss Manton?”</p>
<p>“About your age,—though she looks much more childish.”</p>
<p>“Pretty, of course?”</p>
<p>“Why ‘of course’?”</p>
<p>“Simply because in novels they are always painted as pretty
as Persephone; and the only wards I ever knew happen to be
fictitious characters.”</p>
<p>“Novels are by no means infallible mirrors of nature, and
few wards are as attractive as my black-eyed pet. Muriel
will be very handsome, I hope, when she is grown; but now
she impresses me as merely sweet, piquant, and pretty.”</p>
<p>“Did you know her prior to your recent visit?”</p>
<p>“Yes; her father’s house was my home whenever I chanced
to be in New York, and I have seen her, occasionally, since
she was a little girl. For your sake, as well as mine, I am
glad she will reside here, because I hope she will prove in
every respect a pleasant companion for you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you; but, unfortunately, that is one luxury of
which I never felt the need, and with which, permit me to
tell you, I can readily dispense. I have little respect for
women, and no desire to be wearied with their inane garrulity.”</p>
<p>She leaned back in her chair, and tapped restlessly with
the end of the pen-staff on the morocco-covered table.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey looked down steadily and gravely into her provokingly
defiant face, and replied very coldly,—</p>
<p>“Were I in your place, I think I should jealously guard
my lips from the hasty utterance of sentiments that, if unfeigned,
ought to bring a blush to every true woman’s cheek;
for I fear that she who has no respect for her own sex bids
fair to disgrace it.”</p>
<p>A scarlet wave rolled up from throat to temples, and the
lurking yellow gleamed in her eyes, but the bend of her nostril
and curve of her lips did not relax.</p>
<p>“Which is preferable, hypocrisy or irreverence?”</p>
<p>“Both are unpardonable, in a woman.”</p>
<p>“Where is your vast charity, Dr. Grey?”</p>
<p>“Busy in sheltering that lofty ideal of genuine female perfection
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_127"></a>127</span>
which you seem so pertinaciously ambitious to sully
and degrade.”</p>
<p>“You are harsh, and scarcely courteous.”</p>
<p>“You will never find me less so when you vauntingly exhibit
such mournful blemishes of character.”</p>
<p>“At least, sir, I am honest, and show myself just what
God saw fit to allow misfortune to make me.”</p>
<p>“Hush, Salome! Do not add impiousness to the long catalogue
of your sinful follies. I hoped that there was a favorable
change in you before I left home, but I very much fear
that, instead of exorcising the one evil spirit that possessed
you, you have swept, and garnished, and settled yourself comfortably
with seven new ones.”</p>
<p>“And, like R. Chaim Vital, you come to pronounce <i>Nidui!</i>
and banish my diabolical guests. If cauterization cures moral
ulcers as effectually as those that afflict the flesh, then, verily,
you intend I shall be clean and whole. You are losing
patience with your graceless neophyte.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Salome; because forced to lose faith in her inclination
and capacity to sublimate her erring nature. Once for
all, let me say that habitual depreciation of your own sex will
not elevate you in the estimation of mine; for, however fallen
you may find mankind, they nevertheless realize amid their
degradation that,—</p>

<p class="cg">‘’Tis somewhat to have known, albeit in vain,<br>

<span class="indent2"> </span>New faith in worth.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>There was no taunt, no bitterness, in his voice; but grievous
disappointment, too deep for utterance; and the girl winced
under it, though only the flush burning on cheek and brow
attested her vulnerability.</p>
<p>“Remember, sir, that humanity was not moulded entirely
from one stratum of pipe-clay. Only a few wear paint, enamelling,
and gold as delicate costly <ins title="Was Sevres">Sèvres</ins>; and, while the majority
are only coarse pottery, it is scarcely kind—certainly
not generous—in dainty, transparent china, belonging to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_128"></a>128</span>
king’s palaces, to pity or denounce the humble Delft or Wedgewoodware
doing duty in laborer’s cottages.”</p>
<p>“Very true, my poor little warped, blotched bit of perverse
pottery; but of one vital truth permit me to assure you: the
purity and elevation of our race depend upon preserving inviolate
in the hearts of men a belief that women’s natures are
crystalline as that celebrated glass once made at Murano,
which was so exceedingly fine and delicate that it burst into
fragments if poison was poured into it.”</p>
<p>“Then, obviously, I am no Venetian goblet; else long ago
I should have shattered under the bitter, black juices poured
by fate. It seems I am not worthy to touch the lips of doges
and grand dukes; but let them look to it that some day, when
spent and thirsty, they stretch not their regal hands for the
common clay that holds what all their costly, dainty fragments
can never yield. <i>Nous verrons!</i> ‘The stone which the
builders rejected has become the head of the corner.’”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey had resumed his walk, but the half-suppressed,
passionate protest, whose underswell began to agitate her
voice, arrested his attention, and he came to the table and
stood close to the orphan.</p>
<p>“What is the matter with my headstrong young friend?”</p>
<p>She made no answer; but her elfish eyes sought his, and
braved their quiet rebuke.</p>
<p>“This is the last opportunity I shall offer you to tell me
frankly what troubles you. Can I help you in any way? If
so, command me.”</p>
<p>“Once you could have helped me, but that time has passed.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps not. Try me.”</p>
<p>“It is too late. You have lost faith in me.”</p>
<p>“No; you have lost all faith in yourself, if you ever indulged
any,—which I very much doubt. It is you who are
faithless concerning your own defective character.”</p>
<p>“Not I, indeed! I know it rather too well, either to set it
aloft for adoration or to trample it in the mire. When your
faith in me expired, mine was born. Do you recollect that
beautiful painted window in Lincoln Cathedral which the
untutored fingers of an apprentice fashioned out of the despised
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_129"></a>129</span>
bits of glass rejected by the fastidious master-builder?
It is so vastly superior to every other in the church that the
vanquished artist could not survive the chagrin and mortification,
and killed himself. My faith is very strong, that,
please God, I shall some day show you similar handiwork.”</p>
<p>“You grow enigmatical, and I do not fully understand
you.”</p>
<p>“No; you do not in the least comprehend me. The girl
whom you left six months ago has changed in many respects.”</p>
<p>“For better, or for worse?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps neither one nor yet the other; but, at least, sir,
‘my future will not copy fair my past.’”</p>
<p>“Since my return, I have noticed an alteration in your deportment,
which, I regret to say, I cannot consider an improvement;
and I should feel inclined to attribute your restless
impatience to nervous disease were I not assured by your
appearance that you are in perfect health. Remember, that
quietude of manner constitutes a woman’s greatest charm;
and, unfortunately, you seem almost a mimic mælstrom. But,
pardon me, I did not intend to lecture you; and, hoping all
things, I will patiently wait for the future that you seem to
have dedicated to some special object. I will try to have
faith in my perverse little friend, though she sometimes
renders it a difficult task. May I trouble you to stamp those
letters?”</p>
<p>He could not analyze the change that passed swiftly across
her face, nor the emotion that made her suddenly clinch her
hands till the rosy nails grew purple.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, don’t you believe that if Judas Iscariot had
only resisted the temptation of the thirty pieces of silver,
and stood by his master instead of betraying him, that his
position in heaven would have been far more exalted than
that of Peter, or even of John?”</p>
<p>“That is a question which I have never pondered, and am
not prepared to discuss. Why do you propound it?”</p>
<p>She did not answer immediately; and, when she spoke, her
glittering eyes softened in their expression, and resembled
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_130"></a>130</span>
stars rising through the golden mist of lingering sunset splendor.</p>
<p>“God gave you a nobler heart than mine, and left it an
easy, pleasant matter for you to be good; while, struggle as
I may, I am constantly in danger of tumbling into some
slough of iniquity, or setting up false gods for my soul to
bow down to. Because it is so much more difficult for me to
do right than for you, it is only just that my reward should
be correspondingly greater.”</p>
<p>“I am neither John nor Peter, nor are you Judas; and
only He who knows our mutual faults and follies, our
triumphs and defeats in the life-long campaign with sin, can
judge us equitably. I am too painfully conscious of my own
imperfections not to sympathize earnestly with the temptations
that may assail you; and, moreover, we should never
lose sight of the fact,—</p>

<p>“Have I ever denied you anything that you asked?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,—your good opinion.”</p>
<p>“I knew that had you really desired that, you would long
since have rendered it impossible for me to withhold it. But
to the point,—what is your petition?”</p>
<p>“I want you to pray for me.”</p>
<p>“Salome, are you serious? Are you really in earnest?”</p>
<p>“Mournfully in earnest.”</p>
<p>“Then rest satisfied that henceforth you will always have
a place in my prayer; but do not forget the greater necessity
of praying for yourself. Now, tell me how you have been employed
during my long absence. Where are the accumulated
exercises which I promised to examine and correct when I
returned?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_131"></a>131</span></div>
<p>“Promised whom?”</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>“You forget that I did not see you the day you left, and
that you did not even bid me good-by.”</p>
<p>“I referred to your French exercises in a brief and hurried
note that I left for you.”</p>
<p>“Left where? I never received—never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“I laid it upon your plate, where I supposed you would
certainty notice it when you came home to dinner.”</p>
<p>“Why did not you give it to Miss Jane?”</p>
<p>“Simply because she was not in the room when I wrote it.
It is rather surprising that it escaped your observation, as I
laid it in a conspicuous place.”</p>
<p>She did not deem it necessary to inform him that on that
unlucky day she had suddenly lost her appetite, and failed to
go to the table; and now she put her fingers over her eyes to
conceal the blaze of joyful light that irradiated them, as he
mentioned the circumstance, comparatively trivial, but precious
in her estimation, since it was freighted with the assurance
that at least he had thought of her on the eve of his
unexpected departure. What inexpressible comfort that note
might have contributed during all those tedious months of
silence and separation! While she sat there thinking of the
dreary afternoon when, down in the orchard-grass she lay upon
her face, Dr. Grey came nearer to her, and said,—</p>
<p>“I hope you have not abandoned your French?”</p>
<p>“No, sir; but I devote less time than formerly to it.”</p>
<p>“If agreeable to you, we will resume the exercises as soon
as I can wield my pen.”</p>
<p>“If you can teach me Italian, I should prefer it; especially
since I have learned to pronounce French tolerably well?”</p>
<p>“What use do you expect to have for Italian,—at least, at
present? French is much more essential.”</p>
<p>“I have a good reason for desiring to make the change,
though just now I do not choose to be driven into any explanations.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me. I had no intention of forcing your confidence.
When in Italy, I always contrive to understand and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_132"></a>132</span>
make myself understood; but my knowledge and use of the
language is rather too slip-shod to justify my attempting to
teach you idioms, hallowed as the medium through which
Dante and Ariosto charmed the world. Miss Dexter, Muriel’s
governess, is a very thorough and accomplished linguist, and
speaks Italian not only gracefully but correctly. I have already
engaged her to teach you whatever she may deem advisable
when she comes here to live.”</p>
<p>“You are very kind. Is she a young person?”</p>
<p>“She is a very highly cultivated and elegant woman,
probably twenty-five or six years old, and has been in Florence
with Muriel.”</p>
<p>Involuntarily and unconsciously the orphan sighed, and the
muscles in her broad forehead tangled terribly.</p>
<p>“Salome, please put your hand in the right pocket of my
vest, and take out a key that ought to be there. No,—not
that; a larger steel one. Now you have it. Will you be so
good as to open that trunk which came by express yesterday
(it is in the upper hall), and bring me a box wrapped in pink
tissue-paper? I would not trouble you with so many commissions
if I could use my hands.”</p>
<p>Unable longer to repress her feelings, the girl exclaimed
eagerly,—</p>
<p>“If you could imagine what pleasure it affords me to render
you the slightest service, I am very sure you would not annoy
me with apologies for making me happy.”</p>
<p>In a few moments she returned to the library, bearing in
her hand a small but heavy package, which she placed on the
table before him.</p>
<p>“Please open it, and examine the contents.”</p>
<p>She obeyed him; and, after removing the wrapping, found
a blue velvet case that opened with a spring and revealed a
parcel enclosed in silver paper. Dr. Grey turned and walked
to the window; and, as Salome took off the last covering, a
watch and chain met her curious gaze. One side of the former
was richly and elaborately chased, and represented Kronos
leaning on his scythe; the other was studded with diamonds
that flashed out the name “Salome.” Astonishment and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_133"></a>133</span>
delight sealed the orphan’s lips, and, in silence, far more
eloquent than words, she bowed her head upon the table.
After a few moments had elapsed, Dr. Grey attempted to steal
out of the room; but, being obliged to pass close by her chair,
she put out her hand and arrested his movement.</p>
<p>“It is the most beautiful watch I have ever seen; but, oh,
sir! how shall I sufficiently thank you? How can I express
all that is throbbing here in my proud, grateful heart? Although
the costly gift is elegant and tasteful, I hold still
more precious the fact which it attests,—that during your
absence you thought of me. How shall I begin to prove my
gratitude for your kindness and generosity?”</p>
<p>“Do not thank me, my little friend; for, indeed I require
no verbal assurances that my <i>souvenir</i> is kindly received and
appreciated. Wear the watch; and let it continually remind
you not only of the sincerity of my friendship, but of the far
more important fact that every idle or injudiciously employed
hour will cry out in accusation against us in the final assize,
when we are called upon to render an account of the distribution
of that invaluable time which God allows us solely for
the accomplishment of His work on earth. It is so exceedingly
difficult for young persons to realize how marvellously
rapid is the flight of time, that you will, I trust, forgive me
if I endeavor to impress upon you the vital importance of
making each day fragrant with the burden of some good deed,
the resistance of some sore temptation, some service rendered
to God or to suffering humanity which shall make your years
mellow with the fruitage that will entitle you to a glorious
record in the golden book of Abou Ben Adhem’s angel. Let
this little jewelled monitress of the fleeting, mocking nature
of time, this ingenious toy, whose ticking is but the mournful,
endless knell of dead seconds, remind you that,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“This life of ours, what is it? A very few<br>
Soon ended years, and then—the ceaseless psalm,<br>
And the eternal Sabbath of the soul.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As Salome looked up into his tranquil, happy face, two
tears glided across her cheeks, and fell upon the pretty
bauble.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_134"></a>134</span></div>
<p>“You will find a key in the case, and can wind it up, and
set it by the clock in the parlor.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, are you willing that my watch shall bear daily
testimony of something which I hold far above its diamonds,—that
you have faith in Salome Owen?”</p>
<p>“Perfectly willing that you should make it eloquent with
all friendly utterances and sympathy. Hester has bound my
arm so tightly that it impedes the circulation, and is very
painful. Please loosen the bandage.”</p>
<p>She complied as carefully as possible, though her hands
trembled; and, when the ligature had been comfortably adjusted
and the arm restored to its sling, she stooped and
pressed her lips softly and reverently to the cold, white
fingers, that protruded from the linen bands. He endeavored
ineffectually to prevent the caress, which evidently embarrassed
him; but she left two kisses on the bruised hand, and, snatching
her watch and chain from the table, hastily quitted the
room.</p>
<p>In after years, when loneliness and disappointment pressed
heavily upon her heart, she looked back to the three weeks
that succeeded Dr. Grey’s return as the halcyon days, as the
cloudless June morning of her life; and, in blissful retrospection,
temporarily found Elysium.</p>
<p>She wrote his letters, read aloud from his favorite books,
dressed and bandaged his blistered hand and fractured arm,
and surrendered her heart to an intense and perfect happiness
such as she had scarcely dared to hope would ever be her
portion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Bring her into my office. Steady, men! There may
be broken bones, and jarring would be torture. Don’t
stumble over that book on the floor. Lay her here on the
sofa, and throw open the blinds.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, is she dead?”</p>
<p>“No, only badly stunned; and the contusion on the head
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_135"></a>135</span>
seems to be very severe. Stand back, all of you, and give her
air. When did it happen?”</p>
<p>“About twenty minutes ago. She is a stout, heavy woman,
and we could not walk very fast with such a burden.
Ah! you intend to bleed her?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I fear nothing else will relieve her. Mitchell, hold
the arm for me.”</p>
<p>“How did she receive this injury?” asked Dr. Mitchell,
who had been holding a consultation with Dr. Grey relative
to some perplexing case.</p>
<p>“Those gray ponies which we were admiring a half-hour
since, as they trotted by the door, took fright at a menagerie
procession coming up from the dépot to the Hippodrome,—and
ran away. In steering clear of the elephant, who was
covered from head to foot, and certainly looked frightful, the
horses ran into a mass of lumber and brick at the corner of
Fountain and Franklin streets, where a new store is being
erected, and the carriage was upset. Unfortunately the harness
was very strong, and did not give away until the carriage
had been dragged some yards among the rubbish, and one
of the horses finally floundered into a bed of mortar, and broke
the traces. The driver kept his hold upon the reins to the
last, but was badly bruised, and this woman was thrown out
on a pile of bricks and granite-caps. The municipal authorities
should prohibit these menagerie parades, for the
meekest plough-horse in the State could scarcely have faced
that band of musicians, flanked by the covered elephant and
giraffe, and the cages of the beasts,—much less those fiery
grays, who seem snuffing danger even when there is no provocation.”</p>
<p>“Who is this woman?”</p>
<p>“She is a total stranger to me,” answered Dr. Grey, bending
down to put his ear to the heart of the victim.</p>
<p>A bystander seemed better informed, and replied,—</p>
<p>“She is a servant or housekeeper of the lady who lives at
‘Solitude.’ But here comes the driver, limping and making
wry faces.”</p>
<p>Robert Maclean approached the sofa, and his scratched and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_136"></a>136</span>
bleeding face paled as he leaned over the prostrate form of his
mother.</p>
<p>“Oh, doctors, surely two of you can save her! For God’s
sake, don’t let her die! Does she breathe?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the bleeding has already benefitted her. She
breathes regularly, and the action of her heart is better. Sit
down, my man,—you look ghastly. Mitchell, give him some
brandy, and sew up that gash in his cheek, while I write a
prescription.”</p>
<p>“Never mind me, doctor; only save my poor mother. She
looks like death itself. Mother, mother, it is all over now!
Come, wake up, and speak to me!”</p>
<p>He seized one of her cold hands, and chafed it vigorously
between both of his, while tears and blood mingled, as they
dripped from his face to hers.</p>
<p>“Doctor, tell me the truth; is there any hope?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, my friend; there is every reason to believe she
will ultimately recover, though you need not be surprised if
she remains for some hours in a heavy stupor. Remember, a
pile of brick is not exactly a feather pillow, and it may be
some time before the brain recovers from the severity of the
contusion. What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Robert Maclean.”</p>
<p>“And hers?”</p>
<p>“Elsie Maclean. Poor, dear creature! How she labors
in her breathing. Suppose I lift her head?”</p>
<p>“No; let her rest quietly, just as she is, and I trust all
will be well. Come to the table, and allow me to put some
plaster over that cut which bleeds so freely. Trust me,
Maclean, and do not look so woe-begone. I am not deceiving
you. There may be serious internal injuries that I have not
discovered, but this stupor is not alarming. I can find no
fractured bones, and hope the blow on the head is the most
troublesome thing we shall have to contend with.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey proceeded to sponge the bruised and stained face
and, hoping to divert the man’s anxious thoughts, said, nonchalantly,—</p>
<p>“I believe you are in Mrs. Gerome’s employment?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_137"></a>137</span></div>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been at ‘Solitude’?”</p>
<p>“I came here, sir, and bought the place, while she was in
Europe. Ah, doctor, if my mother should die, I believe it
would kill my mistress.”</p>
<p>“You are old family servants?”</p>
<p>“My mother took her when she was twelve hours old, and
has never left her since. She loves Mrs. Gerome even better
than she loves me—her own flesh and blood. I can’t go home
and tell my mistress I have nearly killed my mother. She
would never endure the sight of me again. Her own mother
died the day after she was born, and she has always looked
on that poor dear soul yonder as her <ins title="Added quote">foster-mother.”</ins></p>
<p>Robert limped back to the sofa, and, seating himself on a
chair, looked wistfully into his mother’s countenance; then
hid his face in his hands.</p>
<p>“Come, be a man, Maclean; and don’t give way to nervousness!
Your mother’s condition is constantly improving,
though of course it is not so apparent to you as to me. What
has been done with the carriage and horses?”</p>
<p>“Oh, the carriage is a sweet pudding; and the grays—curses
on ’em!—are badly bruised. One of them had his
flank laid open by a saw lying on a lumber-pile; and I only
wish it had sawed across the jugular. They are vicious brutes
as ever were bitted, and it makes my blood run cold sometimes
to see their devilish antics when Mrs. Gerome insists on driving
them. They will break her neck, if I don’t contrive to
break theirs first.”</p>
<p>“I should judge from their appearance that it was exceedingly
unsafe for any lady to attempt to control them.
They seem very fiery and unmanageable. What has been
done with them?”</p>
<p>“The deuce knows!—knocked in the head, I trust. I
asked two men, who were in the crowd, to take them to the
livery-stable. Mrs. Gerome is not afraid of anything, and
one of her few pleasures is driving those gray imps, who know
her voice as well as I do. I have seen them put up their
narrow ears and neigh when she was a hundred yards off;
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_138"></a>138</span>
and sometimes she wraps the reins around her wrists and
quiets them, when their eyes look like balls of fire. But
Rarey himself could not have stopped them a while ago, when
they determined to run over that menagerie show. My mistress
will say it was my fault, and she will stand by the gray
satans through thick and thin. Hist, doctor, my mother
groans!”</p>
<p>“Would it not be best for you to go home and acquaint
Mrs. Gerome with what has occurred?”</p>
<p>“I would not face her without my mother for—twenty
kingdoms! You have no idea how she loves her ‘old Elsie,’
and I couldn’t break the news to her,—I would sooner break
my head.”</p>
<p>“This is not a proper place for your mother, and I advise
you to remove her to the hospital, which is not very far from
my office. She can be carried on a litter.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my mistress would never permit that! She will let
no one else nurse my mother; and, of course, she could not
go to a public place like a hospital, for you know she is so
dreadful shy of strangers.”</p>
<p>After many suggestions, and much desultory conversation,
it was finally decided that Elsie should be placed on a mattress,
in the bottom of an open wagon, and carried slowly
home. A careful driver was provided, and when Dr. Grey
had seen his patient comfortably arranged, and established
Robert on the seat with the driver, he yielded to the solicitations
of the son, that he would precede them to “Solitude,”
and acquaint Mrs. Gerome with the details of the accident.</p>
<p>Although ten months had elapsed since the latter took
possession of her new home, so complete had been her seclusion
that she remained an utter stranger; and, when visitors
flocked from town and neighborhood to satisfy themselves
concerning the rumors of the elegant furniture and appointments
of the house, they were invariably denied admittance,
and informed that since her widowhood Mrs. Gerome had not
re-entered society.</p>
<p>Curiosity was piqued, and gossip wagged her hundred busy
tongues over the tormenting fact that Mrs. Gerome had never
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_139"></a>139</span>
darkened the church-door since her arrival; and, occasionally,
when she rode into town, wore a thick veil that thoroughly
screened her features; and, instead of shopping like other
people, made Elsie Maclean bring the articles to the carriage
for her inspection.</p>
<p>The servants seemed to hold themselves as much aloof as
their mistress, and though Robert and his mother attended
service regularly every Sabbath, they appeared as gravely silent
and ungregarious as Sphinxes. The ministers of various
denominations called to pay their respects to the stranger, but
only the clerical cards succeeded in crossing the threshold;
and, while rumors of her boundless wealth crept teasingly
through Newsmongerdom, no one except Salome Owen had
yet seen the new-comer.</p>
<p>Cases of books and pictures occasionally arrived from
Europe, and never failed to stir the pool of gossip to its dregs;
for the wife of the express-agent was an intimate friend of
Mrs. Spiewell, whose husband was pastor of the church which
Elsie and Robert attended, and who felt personally aggrieved
that the Rev. Charles Spiewell was not welcomed as the spiritual
guide of the mistress of “Solitude.”</p>
<p>Finally, a morbid, meddling inquisitiveness goaded the
chatty little woman beyond the bounds of ministerial decorum,
and, having rashly wagered a pair of gloves that she would
gain an entrance to the parlors (whereof the upholsterer’s
wife told marvellous tales), she armed herself with a pathetic
petition for aid to build a “Widow’s Row,” and, with a subscription-list
for a “Dorcas Society,” and confident of ingress,
boldly rang the bell. Unfortunately, Elsie chanced that day
to be on post as sentinel, and, though she immediately recognized
the visitor as the mother of the small colony of Spiewells
who crowded every Sunday morning into the pew of the
pastor, she courtesied, and gave the stereotyped rebuff,—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome begs to be excused.”</p>
<p>“Ah, indeed! But she does not know who has called, or
she would make an exception in my favor. I am your minister’s
wife, and must really see her, if only for two minutes.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_140"></a>140</span>
Take my card to her, and say I call on important business,
which cannot fail to interest her.”</p>
<p>Not a muscle of Elsie’s grave face moved, as she received
the card, and answered,—</p>
<p>“I am very sorry, madam, but Mrs. Gerome sees no visitors,
and my orders are positive.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Spiewell bit her lip, and reddened.</p>
<p>“Then take these papers to her, and ask if she will please
be so good as to examine their claims to her charity. In the
meantime I will wait in the parlor, and must trouble you for
a glass of water.”</p>
<p>She thrust the petitions into Elsie’s hand, and attempted
to slip into the hall, through the partial opening of the door
which the servant held during the parley; but, planting her
massive frame directly in the way, the resolute woman effectually
barred entrance, and, pointing to an iron <i>tête-à-tête</i>
on the portico, said, decisively,—</p>
<p>“I beg pardon, madam, but you will find a seat there; and
I will bring the water while Mrs. Gerome reads your letters.
If you are fatigued, I will hand you luncheon and some wine.”</p>
<p>Mortified and enraged, Mrs. Spiewell grew scarlet, but
threw herself into the seat designated, resolved to snatch a
glimpse of the interior the instant the servant had disappeared.</p>
<p>Very softly Elsie closed and securely latched the door on
the inside, knowing that at that moment her mistress was
sitting in the oriel window of the front parlor.</p>
<p>In vain the visitor tried and twisted the bolt, and, completely
baffled, tears of chagrin moistened her eyes. She had
scarcely time to regain her seat, when Elsie reappeared, bearing
on a handsome salver a wine-glass, silver goblet, and an
elegant basket filled with cake.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome presents her compliments, and sends you
this fifty dollar bill for whatever society you represent.”</p>
<p>Too thoroughly discomfited to conceal her pique and indignation,
Mrs. Spiewell snatched letters and donation, and,
without lingering an instant, swept haughtily down the steps,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_141"></a>141</span>
“shaking off the dust of her feet” against “Solitude” and
its incorrigible owner.</p>
<p>An innocent impertinence once coldly frustrated soon takes
unto itself a sting and branding-irons, and thus, what was
originally merely idle curiosity, becomes bitter malice; and
henceforth the worthy minister’s gossiping wife lost no opportunity
of inveighing against the superciliousness of the
stranger, and of insinuating that some very extraordinary circumstances
led her “to fear that something was radically
wrong about that poor Mrs. Gerome, for troubles that could
not be poured into the sympathetic ears of pastors and of
pastors’ wives must be very dark, indeed.”</p>
<p>Whenever the name of the new-comer was mentioned, Mrs.
Spiewell compressed her lips, shook her head, and shrugged
her round shoulders; and, of course, persons present surmised
that the “minister’s lady” was acquainted with melancholy
facts which charity prevented her from divulging.</p>
<p>Many of the grievances and ills that afflict society spring
not from sinful, envenomed hearts, but from weak souls and
empty heads; and Mrs. Spiewell, who sat up with all the
measle-stricken, teething, sick children in her husband’s
charge, and would have felt disgraced had she missed a meeting
of the “Dorcas Society,” or of the “Barefeet Relief
Club,” would have been duly shocked if any one had boldly
charged her with slandering a woman whom she had never
seen, and of whose antecedents she knew absolutely nothing.
Verily, it is difficult, indeed, even for “the elect” to keep
themselves “unspotted from the world;” and Zimmerman
was a seer when he declared, “Who lives with wolves must
join in their howls.”</p>
<p>Absorbed by professional engagements, or fiscal cares, the
gentlemen of a community are rarely interested in or informed
of the last wreck of character which the whirlpool of
scandal strews on the strand of society; but vague rumors
relative to Mrs. Gerome’s isolation had penetrated even into
the quiet precincts of Dr. Grey’s sanctum, and consequently
invested his present mission with extraneous interest.</p>
<p>For the first time since her arrival he approached the confines
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_142"></a>142</span>
of her residence, and, as he threw the reins over the
dashboard of his buggy and stood under the lofty old trees that
surrounded the house, he paused to admire the beauty of the
grounds, the grouping of some statues and pot plants on a
neighboring mound, and the far-stretching sheen of the rippling
sea.</p>
<p>No living thing was visible except a golden pheasant and
scarlet flamingo strutting along the stone terrace at the foot
of the lawn, and silence and repose seemed brooding over
house and yard; when suddenly a rapid, passionate, piano-prelude
smote the stillness till the air appeared to throb and
quiver, and a thrillingly sweet yet intensely mournful voice
sang the wailing strains of <i>Addio del Passato</i>.</p>
<p>The indescribable yet almost overwhelming pathos of the
tones affected Dr. Grey much as the tremolo-stop in some
organ-overture in a dimly-lighted cathedral; and, as the
singer seemed to pour her whole aching heart and wearied
soul into the concluding “<i>Ah! tutto-tutto fini!</i>” he turned,
and involuntarily followed the sound, like one in a dream.</p>
<p>The front door was closed; but the sash of the oriel window
had been raised, and through the delicate lace curtains
that were swaying in the salt breath of ocean he could see
what passed in the parlor. A woman sat before the piano,
running her snowy fingers idly across the keys, now striking
<i>fortissimo</i> a wild stormy <i>fugue</i> theme, and then softly evoking
a subtle minor chord that seemed the utterance of some despairing
spirit breathing its last prayer for peace.</p>
<p>Her Marie-Louise blue dress was girded at the waist by a
belt and buckle of silver, and the loose sleeve of the right
arm was looped and pinned up, showing the dimpled elbow
and daintily rounded wrist encircled by the jet serpent.
Around her throat she had carelessly thrown a lace handkerchief,
and from the mass of hair that seemed tiny, snow-capped
waves, a cluster of blue nemophila leaned down to
touch the white forehead beneath, and peep at the answering
blue gleams in the large, shining, steely eyes. Her fingers
strayed listlessly into a <i>Nocturne</i>; but from the dreamy
expression of the face, upraised to gaze at the busts on the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_143"></a>143</span>
brackets above, it was evident that her thoughts had wandered
far away from <i>Addio del Passato</i>, and were treading the drift-strewn
strands of melancholy memory.</p>
<p>Presently she rose, walked twice across the room, and came
back to an <i>étagére</i> where stood an azure Bohemian glass vase,
supported by silver Tritons, and filled with late blue hyacinths
and early pancratiums.</p>
<p>Bending her regal head, she inhaled the mingled perfumes,
worthy of Sicilian or Cyprian meadows; and, while her slight
fingers toyed with the fragile petals, a proud smile lent its
sad light to the chill face, and she said aloud, as if striving to
comfort herself,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“‘Not the ineffable stars that interlace<br>
The azure canopy of Zeus himself<br>
Have surer sweetness than my hyacinths<br>
When they grow blue, in gazing on blue heaven,<br>
Than the white lilies of my rivers, when<br>
In leafy spring Selene’s silver horn<br>
Spills paleness, peace, and fragrance.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>With a heavy sigh she turned away, and sat down in the
rear room, near the arch, where an easel now stood, containing
a large, unfinished picture; and, taking her ivory palette
and brushes, she began to retouch the violet robe of one of
the figures.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey had seen more beautiful women among the gilded
pillars and frescoes of palaces, and amid the olives and vineyards
of Parthenope; but in Mrs. Gerome he found a fascinating
mystery that baffled analysis and riveted his attention.
Neither young nor old, she had crowned herself with the
glories of both seasons, and seemed some sweet, dewy spring,
wrapped in the snows and frozen in the icy garb of winter.</p>
<p>He had expected to meet a middle-aged person, habited in
widow’s weeds, and meek from the severe scourging of a
recent and terrible bereavement; but that anomalous white
face and proud, queenly form were unlike all other flesh that
his keen eyes had hitherto scanned; and he regarded her as
curiously as he would have examined some abnormal-looking
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_144"></a>144</span>
specimen of nerves and muscles laid upon the marble slab of a
dissecting-table.</p>
<p>Recollecting suddenly that, if he did not present himself,
the wagon would arrive before he had accomplished the object
of his visit, he drew a card from his pocket, and, stepping
over the low sill of the oriel window, advanced to the arch.</p>
<p>The mistress of the house sat with her back turned towards
him, and was apparently absorbed in putting purple shadows
into the folds of a mantle that hung from the shoulders of a
kneeling figure on the canvas.</p>
<p>Face-downward on an ottoman near, lay a beautiful copy of
Owen Meredith’s poems; and, after a few seconds, she paused,
brush in hand, and, taking up the book, slowly read aloud—glancing,
as she did so, from page to picture,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> “‘Then I could perceive</p>
<p class="cg">A glory pouring through an open door,<br>
And in the light five women. I believe<br>
They wore white vestments, all of them. They were<br>
Quite calm; and each still face unearthly fair,<br>
Unearthly quiet. So like statues all,<br>
Waiting they stood without that lighted hall;<br>
And in their hands, like a blue star, they held<br>
Each one a silver lamp.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Standing immediately behind her, Dr. Grey saw that she
had seized the weird “<i>Vision of Virgins</i>,” and was putting
into pigment that solemn phantasm of the poet’s imagination
where five radiant women were passing to their reward,—and
five wailing over flickering, dying lamps, were huddled helplessly
and hopelessly under a black and starless midnight sky.
Although unfinished, there was marvellous power in the picture,
and the sickly gleam from the expiring wicks made the
surrounding gloom more supernatural, like the deep shadows
skulking behind the lurid glare in some old Flemish painting.</p>
<p>He saw also that she had followed the general outline of
the poem; but one of the faces was so supreme in its mute
anguish that he thought of Reni’s “Cenci,” and of a wan
“Alcestis,” and a desperate “Cassandra,” he had seen at
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_145"></a>145</span>
Rome; and, in comparison, the description of the poet
seemed almost vapid,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> “One as still as death</p>
<p class="cg">Hollowed her hands about her lamp, for fear<br>
Some motion of the midnight, or her breath,<br>
Should fan out the last flicker. Rosy clear<br>
The light oozed through her fingers o’er her <ins title="Added period">face.</ins><br>
There was a ruined beauty hovering there<br>
Over deep pain, and dashed with lurid grace<br>
A waning bloom.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The room with its costly, quaint, and tasteful furniture,—the
solitary and singularly beautiful woman; the wonderful
picture, growing beneath her hand; the solemn silence, broken
only by the deep, hollow murmur of the dimpling sea that sent
its shimmer in at the window to meet the painted shimmer in
a marine view framed on the wall,—all these wove a spell
about the intruder that temporarily held him a mute captive.</p>
<p>The artist laid a delicate green on the stripped and scattered
leaves from a wreath of Syrian lilies lying on the marble
steps of the bridegroom’s mansion, and once more she read a
passage from the open book,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> “‘Then I beheld</p>
<p class="cg">A shadow in the doorway. And One came<br>
Crown’d for a feast. I could not see the Face.<br>
The Form was not all human. As the Flame<br>
Streamed over it, a presence took the place<br>
With awe. He, turning, took them by the hand<br>
And led them each up the wide stairway, and<br>
The door closed.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The sound of her voice, low but clear, and burdened with
a sadness that no language could exhaust or interpret, thrilled
Dr. Grey’s steady nerves as no music had ever done, and,
stepping forward, he held out his card, and said,—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, a painful necessity has compelled me to
intrude upon your seclusion, and I trust you will acquit me
of impertinence.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_146"></a>146</span></div>
<p>Rising, she fronted him with a frown severe as that which
clouded Artemis’ brow when profane eyes peered through
myrtle boughs into her sacred retreat, and the changed voice
seemed thick with bristling icicles.</p>
<p>“Your business must be imperative, indeed, if it warrants
this intrusion. What servant admitted you?”</p>
<p>“None. I came in haste, and, seeing the window open,
entered without ringing. Madam, my card will explain my
errand.”</p>
<p>“Has Dr. Grey an unpaid bill? I was not aware the servants
had needed your services; but if so, present your claim
to Robert Maclean, my agent.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome owes me nothing, and I came here reluctantly
and in compliance with Robert Maclean’s request, to
inform her of an accident which happened this afternoon
while—”</p>
<p>He paused, awed by the change that swept over her countenance,
filling it with horrible dread.</p>
<p>“Those gray horses?”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>“Not Elsie? Oh! don’t tell me that my dear old Elsie was
mangled! Hush! I will not hear it!”</p>
<p>Palette and brushes fell upon the carpet, and she wrung
her fingers until the diamond-eyed asp set its blue fangs in
her cold flesh.</p>
<p>“Robert was merely bruised, but his mother was very badly
injured, and is still insensible. Every precaution has been
taken to counteract the effect of the severe blow on her head,
and I hope that after an hour or two she will recover her
consciousness. Robert is bringing her home as carefully as
possible, and you may expect them momentarily. Only his
urgent entreaties that I would precede him and prepare you
for the reception of his mother could have induced me to
waive ceremony and thrust myself into the presence of a lady
who seems little disposed to pardon the apparent presumption
of my visit.”</p>
<p>She evidently did not heed his words, and, suddenly clasping
her hands across her forehead, she said, bitterly,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_147"></a>147</span></div>
<p>“Coward! why can’t you speak out, and tell me that the
corpse will soon be here, and a coffin must be ordered? This
is the last blow! Surely, God will let me alone, now; for
there is nothing more that He can send to afflict me. Oh,
Elsie,—my sole comfort! The only one who ever loved me!”</p>
<p>A bluish pallor settled about her mouth, and Dr. Grey
shuddered as he looked into the dry, defiant eyes, so beautiful
in form and color but so mournfully desperate in their expression.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, your servant is neither dead nor dying, and
I have told you the worst. Down the road I can see the
wagon coming slowly, and I would advise you to call the
household together, in order to assist in lifting Elsie, who is
very stout and heavy. Calm yourself, madam, and trust your
favorite servant to my care.”</p>
<p>“Servant! Sir, she is mother, father, husband, friends,—all,—everything
to me! She is the only human being who
cares for, or understands, or sympathizes with me,—and I
could not live without her. Oh, sir, do not ask me to trust
you! The time has gone by when I could trust anybody
but Elsie. You are a physician,—you ought to know what
should be done for her; and, Dr. Grey, if you have any pity
in your soul, and any skill in your profession, save my old
Elsie’s life! Dr. Grey—”</p>
<p>She paused a few seconds, and added, in a whisper,—</p>
<p>“If she dies, I am afraid I might grow desperate, and commit
what you happy people call a crime.”</p>
<p>He felt an unwonted moisture dim his eyes, as he watched
the delicate face, white as the hair that crowned it, and wondered
if the wide, populous world could match her regal form
and perfect features.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, I think I can promise that Elsie will recover
from her injuries; but a prayer for her safety would
bring you more comfort than my feeble words of assurance
and encouragement. The mercy of God is surer than the combined
medical skill of the universe.”</p>
<p>“The mercy of God!” she repeated, with a gesture of
scorn and impatience. “No, no! God set his face like a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_148"></a>148</span>
flint against me, long, long ago, and I do not mock myself by
offering prayers that only call down smitings upon me.
Seven years since I prayed my last prayer, which was for
speedy death; and, from that hour, I seem to have taken a
new lease on life. Now I stand still and keep silent, and I
hoped that God had forgotten me.”</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands and Dr. Grey drew a
chair close to her and endeavored to make her sit down, but
she resisted and shrank from his touch on her arm.</p>
<p>“Madam, the wagon has stopped at the door. Will you
direct your servants, or shall I?”</p>
<p>“If she is not dead, tell Robert to carry her into my room.
Oh, Dr. Grey, you will not let her die!”</p>
<p>As she looked up imploringly into his calm, noble face, she
met his earnest gaze, brimming with compassion and sympathy,
and her lips and chin quivered.</p>
<p>“Trust your God, and have faith in me.”</p>
<p>He went out to assist in removing his patient, and when
they had carried the mattress and its occupant into the room
opposite the parlor and laid it on the carpet near the window,
he had the satisfaction of observing a favorable change in
Elsie’s condition. While he stood by a table preparing some
medicine, Robert stole up, and asked:</p>
<p>“Do you notice any improvement? She groaned twice on
the road, and once I am sure she opened her eyes.”</p>
<p>“Yes; I think that very soon she will be able to speak, for
her pulse is gaining strength every hour.”</p>
<p>“How did my mistress take it?”</p>
<p>“She was much shocked and grieved. Maclean, where are
her friends and relatives?”</p>
<p>There was no reply, and, glancing over his shoulder to repeat
the inquiry, Dr. Grey saw Mrs. Gerome leaning against
the door.</p>
<p>“Robert, have you killed her?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, ma’am! She is doing very well, the doctor says.”</p>
<p>She crossed the room, and sat down on the edge of the
mattress, taking one of the large brown hands in both of hers
and bending her face over the pillow.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_149"></a>149</span></div>
<p>“Elsie! mother! Elsie, speak to your poor child!”</p>
<p>That wailing voice pierced the stupor, and Dr. Grey was
surprised to see the woman’s eyes unclose and rest wonderingly
upon the countenance hovering over her.</p>
<p>“My dear Elsie, don’t you know me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my bairn. What ails you?”</p>
<p>She spoke indistinctly, and shut her eyes once more, as if
exhausted.</p>
<p>“If she was in her coffin, I verily believe she would rise,
if she heard your voice calling her,” said Robert, wiping away
the tears of joy that trickled across his sunburnt cheeks.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey stooped to put his finger on Elsie’s pulse, and
Mrs. Gerome threw herself down on the carpet, and buried her
face in the pillow, where her silver hair mingled with the
grizzled locks that straggled from beneath the old woman’s
torn lace cap.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Well, Ulpian, are you convinced that ‘Solitude’ is an
unlucky place, and that misfortune dogs the steps of all who
make it a home? Once you laughed at my ‘superstition.’
What think you now, my wiseacre?”</p>
<p>“My opinion has not changed, except that each time I see
the place I admire it more and more; and, were it for sale,
I should certainly purchase it.”</p>
<p>“Not with the expectation of living there?”</p>
<p>“Most assuredly.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane had suspended for a moment the swift clicking
of her knitting-needles in order to hear her brother’s reply,
and now she rejoined, almost sharply,—</p>
<p>“You will do no such silly thing while there is breath left
in my body to protest, or to persuade. Pooh! you only talk
to tease me; for five grains of observation and common sense
will teach you that there is a curse hanging over that old
piratical nest.”</p>
<p>“Dear Janet, when headstrong drivers persist in carrying a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_150"></a>150</span>
pair of fiery, vicious horses into the midst of a procession of
wild beasts that would have scared even your sober dull
Dapples out of their lazy jog-trot, it is not at all surprising
that snapped harness, broken carriage, torn flesh, and strained
joints should attest the folly of the experiment. The accident
occurred not far from my office, which is haunted by
nothing worse than your harmless sailor-boy.”</p>
<p>“All very fine, my blue-eyed oracle, but I notice that the
horses belonging to ‘Solitude’ were the only ones that made
mischief and came to grief; and I promise you that all the
hawsers in Gosport Navy-Yard will never drag me inside the
doomed place. How is your patient? If you expect her to
get well, you had better take a ‘superstitious’ old woman’s
counsel, and send her away from that valley of Jehoshaphat.”</p>
<p>“I am very sorry to tell you that she was more seriously
hurt than I was at first inclined to believe. Her spine was so
badly injured that although there is no danger of immediate
death, she will never be able to sit up or walk again. She
may linger many months, possibly years; but must, as long
as life lasts, remain a bed-ridden cripple. It is one of the
saddest cases I have had to deal with during my professional
career; and Elsie Maclean bears her sufferings with such noble
fortitude, such genuine Christian patience, coupled with stern
Scotch heroism, that I cannot withhold my admiration and
earnest sympathy. Yesterday I held a consultation with four
physicians, and, when we told her the hopelessness of her
condition, she received the announcement without even a sigh,
and seemed only to dread that instead of an assistant she
might prove a burden to her mistress.”</p>
<p>“She appears to be a very important personage in the
household.”</p>
<p>“Yes; she is Mrs. Gerome’s nurse, housekeeper, and counsellor,—and
I have rarely seen such warm affection as exists
between them. I wish, Janet, that you were strong enough
to call at ‘Solitude,’ for its mistress leads a lonely, secluded
life, and must require some society.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_151"></a>151</span></div>
<p>“But, Ulpian, I hear strange things about her, and it is
hinted that she is deranged.”</p>
<p>“Your knowledge of human nature should teach you how
little truth is generally found in the floating <i>on dits</i> of social
circles.”</p>
<p>“How long has she been widowed?”</p>
<p>“I do not know, but presume that her affliction has not
been very recent, as she wears no mourning.”</p>
<p>“If she has discarded widow’s weeds, and dresses in colors,
why should she taboo society, and make herself the town-talk
by refusing to receive even the clergy and their wives? She
has lived here ten months, and I understand from Dolly
Spiewell that not a soul has ever seen her. Of course such
eccentricities provoke gossip and tickle the tongue of scandal,
and if the world can’t find out the real cause of such conduct,
it very industriously sets to work and manufactures one.”</p>
<p>“Which, in my humble opinion, constitutes a piece of unwarrantable
impertinence on the part of meddling Mrs.
Grundy. The world might be more profitably engaged in
mending its own tortuous and mendacious ways, and allowing
poor solitary wretches to fondle their whims and caprices.
If Mrs. Gerome does not choose to receive visitors, what right
has the public to grumble, or even discuss the matter?”</p>
<p>As Salome spoke, she plunged her stiletto vigorously into a
piece of cambric, and her thin lip curled contemptuously.</p>
<p>“Abstractly true, my dear child; but, from the beginning
of time, people have meddled; and, since gossip she must,
even Eve chatted too freely with serpents. Besides, since we
are in the world, we should not turn eremites, and bristle
at the sight of one of our own race; for society has a few
laws that are inexorable,—that cannot be violated without
subjecting the offender to being stung to death by venomous
tongues; and one of these statutes is, that all shall see and
be seen, shall talk and be talked about, and shall visit and
be visited. When a woman unaccountably turns recluse, she
is at the mercy of public imagination, stimulated by disappointed
curiosity; and very soon the verdict goes forth that
she is either deformed or deranged.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_152"></a>152</span></div>
<p>“I dispute the prerogative of the public to dictate in such
matters, and I shall rebel whenever it presumes to lay even a
little finger across my path. What, pray tell me, is the world,
but an aggregation of persons like you and me, and what
possible concern can you or I have with the fact that Mrs.
Gerome burrows like a mole, beyond our sight? If she sees
fit to found a modern sect of Troglodytes, I can’t understand
that the wheels of society are thereby scotched, or that the
public has a shadow of right to raise a hue-and-cry and strive
to unearth her, as if she were a fox, a catamount, or a gopher.
It is useless for society to constitute itself a turning-lathe for
rounding off all individual angularities, and grinding people
down to dull uniformity until they are as indistinguishable
as a bag of unpainted marbles or of black-eyed peas; and,
if God had intended that we should all invariably think, feel,
and act after one pattern, He would have populated the world
with Siamese twins; whereas, the first couple that were born
on earth were so dissimilar that all the universe was not wide
enough to hold them both, and manslaughter began when the
race only numbered a quartette. If mankind had not arrogated
the privilege of being its ‘brother’s keeper,’ it would
never have been forced to deny the fact. I admire the honesty
and truth with which Alexander Smith bravely confessed, ‘I
love a little eccentricity; I respect honest prejudices. It is
high time, it seems to me, that a moral game-law were passed
for the preservation of the wild and vagrant feelings of human
nature.’”</p>
<p>“That is a dangerous doctrine, my dear child, especially
for a woman to entertain; because custom rules us with an
iron rod, and flays us alive if we contravene her decrees.”</p>
<p>“I should be exceedingly glad to learn by what authority
or process Truth is provided with sex? Are some orthodox
doctrines female and others male? Why have not we women
as clear a right to any given set of principles as men? Truth
is as much my property as that of the Czar of Russia, and,
if I choose to lay hold of any special province of it, why must
I perforce be dragged to the whipping-post of custom, simply
because by an accident I am called Susan or Hepzibah instead
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_153"></a>153</span>
of Peter or Lazarus? So long as my convictions of
truth (which custom brands as vagaries) are innocuous, I
have a perfect and inalienable right to indulge them; but the
instant I become pestiferous to society, let me be consigned
to the tender mercies of strait-jacket and insane-asylum
regimen. If I creep quietly along my own intellectual and
ethical trail, taking heed not to touch the sensitive toes of
custom, why should it ungenerously insist upon bruising
mine? My seer was right when he boldly declared, ‘The
world has stood long enough under the drill of Adjutant
<ins title="Guessed at end quote position">Fashion.’</ins> It is hard work, the posture is wearisome, and
Fashion is an awful martinet, and has a quick eye, and comes
down mercilessly on the unfortunate wight who can not
square his toes to the approved pattern. It is killing work.
Suppose we try ‘standing at ease’ for a little while? Wherefore,
custom to the contrary notwithstanding, I contend that
Mrs. Gerome has as indisputable a right to refuse admittance
to Rev. Mrs. Spiewell as any anchorite of the Nitrian Sands
to decline receiving a bevy of inquisitive European belles.
If society rules like Russia or Turkey, then am I a candidate
for knout and bastinado. I do not wish to be unwomanly,
and honesty and candor are not necessarily unfeminine,
because some coarse, rough-handed, bold-eyed woman
has possibly rendered them unpopular.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane laid down her knitting, folded her hands, and,
as she watched the girl, her emotions were probably similar
to those that agitate some meek and staid hen, who, leading
a young brood of ducks from her nest, suddenly beholds them
displaying their aquatic proclivities by plunging into the
horse-pond, and performing all the evolutions of a regatta.</p>
<p>“Ah, child, I fear you think too little of what you wish or
intend to make yourself!”</p>
<p>“Only have patience, Miss Jane, and some day I will show
you all the graces of Griselda and Gudrun the second. Dr.
Grey, have you seen Mrs. Gerome?”</p>
<p>“Yes,—on two occasions.”</p>
<p>“Is she not the most extraordinary and puzzling person
you ever looked at?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_154"></a>154</span></div>
<p>“When and where could you have met her?”</p>
<p>“For a few minutes only, last winter, I saw her on the
beach, near ‘Solitude.’ We exchanged a half-dozen words,
and she left an impression on my mind which all time will
not efface. Since that evening I have frequently endeavored
to surprise her on the same spot, but only once I succeeded
in catching a glimpse of a blue shawl that fluttered in the
distance. She seemed to me a beautiful, pale priestess, consecrated
to the ministry of the shrine of sorrow; and, when
I hear snubbed-dom sneering at her, and remember the hopeless
expression with which her wonderful, homeless eyes
looked out across that grey, silent sea,—I cannot avoid thinking
that she is very wise in barring her doors, and heeding
the advice of Montenebi, ‘<i>Complain not of thy woes to the
public: they will no more pity thee than birds of prey pity
the wounded deer</i>.’”</p>
<p>“My acquaintance with Mrs. Gerome is too slight to warrant
the utterance of an opinion relative to her idiosyncrasies,
but I am afraid cynicism rather than grief immures
her from society. Her prematurely white hair and the remarkable
pallor of her smooth complexion combine to render
her appearance piquant and unnatural; and, certainly, there
is something in her face strangely suggestive of old Norse
myths, mystery, and magic. Her features, when analyzed,
prove faultlessly regular, but her life is out of tune, and the
expression of her countenance mars what would otherwise be
perfect beauty. I can, in some degree, describe the impression
she produced upon me by quoting the lines that were
suggested when I saw her this morning, standing by Elsie
Maclean’s bed,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘I saw a vision of a woman, where<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Night and new morning strive for domination;<br>
Incomparably pale, and almost fair,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>And sad beyond expression.<br>
Her eyes were like some fire-enshrining gem,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Were stately, like the stars, and yet were tender;<br>
Her figure charmed me, like a windy stem,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Quivering, and drooped, and slender.<br>
She measured measureless sorrow toward its length<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>And breadth, and depth, and height.’”</p>

<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_155"></a>155</span></div>
<p>Salome looked up from the eyelet she was working, but Dr.
Grey had turned his head towards his sister who had fallen
asleep in her chair, and the orphan could not see his face.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome must have been very young when she married,
and—”</p>
<p>“Hush! Janet looks so weary that I want her to have a
long nap, and our voices might disturb her.”</p>
<p>He took his hat and gloves and left the room, and Salome
forgot her embroidery and fell into a reverie that proved
neither pleasant nor profitable, and lasted until Miss Jane
awoke.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the following day, when the orphan
returned from her clandestine visit to the Italian musician,
she saw an unusual number of persons on the front gallery,
and found that the long-expected party from New York had
arrived during her absence. Miss Jane was talking to the
governess—a meek-looking, but exceedingly handsome woman,
of twenty-seven or eight years, with fair hair and quiet brown
eyes; and every detail of her dress, speech, and bearing averred
that Edith Dexter was no humble scion of proletariat. Her
polished yet reserved manners bespoke high birth and aristocratic
associations; but something in the composed, sad
countenance, in the listless drooping of the pretty head, hinted
that she had long since spilt the rosy sparkling foam of her
cup of life, and was patiently drinking its muddy lees.</p>
<p>On the upper step sat Dr. Grey, with his arm encircling the
form of his ward, whose head rested very confidingly against
his shoulder. Muriel Manton was dressed in deep mourning,
and had evidently been weeping, for her guardian was tenderly
wiping the tears from her cheek when Salome came up
the avenue; and, with a keen, jealous pang that she had never
felt before, the latter scanned the stranger’s claims to beauty.</p>
<p>Very black eyes, brilliant complexion, and fine teeth, she
certainly possessed; but her features were rather coarse; her
mouth was much too large for classic requirements; and
Salome was rejoiced to find her nose indisputably <i>retroussé</i>.</p>
<p>Years hence she would doubtless be a large, well-formed,
commanding woman, who could exhibit Lyons silk or Genoese
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_156"></a>156</span>
velvet to the best advantage, and would be considered a fine-looking,
rosy, robust personage; but at present the face, which
from under a small straw hat anxiously watched hers, was
infinitely handsomer, more attractive, more delicate, and intellectual;
and the miller’s child felt that she had little to
apprehend from the merely personal charms of the wealthy
ward.</p>
<p>Salome felt injured as she eyed the doctor’s arm, which
had never touched even her shoulder; and it was painful and
humiliating to notice the affectionate manner in which his
hand stroked one of Muriel’s that lay on his knee,—and to
remember that his fingers had not met hers in a friendly
grasp since long before his visit to Europe,—had only clasped
hers twice during their acquaintance.</p>
<p>“Come in, Salome, and let me introduce you to my ward
Muriel, and to Miss Dexter, who is prepared to receive you as
a pupil.”</p>
<p>Muriel silently held out her hand; but Salome only bowed
and <ins title="Was run">ran</ins> lightly up the steps, as if she did not perceive the
outstretched fingers. Miss Dexter rose and advanced to meet
her, saying, in a tone that indexed great kindness of heart,—</p>
<p>“I am exceedingly glad to meet you, Miss Salome; for
Dr. Grey has promised that I shall find in you a most exemplary
and agreeable pupil.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I am indeed glad to hear that he has
changed his opinion of me; and I must endeavor not to lose
my newly acquired amiable character,—but he was rather
rash to stand security for my good behavior.”</p>
<p>She saw that Dr. Grey was surprised at her cold reception
of his pet and <i>protegé</i>, and perversity took possession of her.
Going to the back of Miss Jane’s old-fashioned rocking-chair
she put her arms around her, and, leaning over, kissed her
cheek several times. It was not her habit to caress any one
or any thing,—not even her little brother,—and this unusual
demonstrativeness puzzled and surprised the old lady
who said, fondly,—</p>
<p>“I presume Ulpian is brave enough to encounter all the
risks of standing security for your obedience and docility.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_157"></a>157</span></div>
<p>“Certainly I appreciate his chivalry, since none knows
better than he the danger—nay, probability, of a forfeiture
of the contract on my part.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey rose, and, looking steadily at her, said, in a tone
which she well understood,—</p>
<p>“Promises are, in my estimation, peculiarly sacred things;
and that which I made to Miss Dexter in your behalf was
based upon one that I gave you some time since, namely, that
I would have faith in you. Come with me, Muriel; I want to
show you and Miss Dexter the finest cow this side of Ayrshire,
and some sheep that are handsome enough to compare favorably
with the best that ever browsed in the ‘Court of Lions.’”</p>
<p>He took his ward’s hand and led her away to the cattle-yard,
whither Miss Dexter accompanied them.</p>
<p>As Salome looked after the trio her eyes flashed and scarlet
spots burned on her cheeks, while a feeling of suffocation oppressed
her heart.</p>
<p>“Why will you vex him, when you know that he tries so
hard to like you?” asked Miss Jane in a distressed tone,
stroking the girl’s hot face, as she spoke.</p>
<p>The head was instantly lifted beyond her reach, and the
answer came swiftly, sharp and defiant,—</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say that it is so extremely difficult for
him to tolerate me?”</p>
<p>“You are obliged to know that you are not one of his
favorites, like that sweet-tempered Muriel, to whom he seems
so warmly attached; and it is all your own fault, for he was
disposed to like you when he first came home. Ulpian loves
quiet and amiable people, who are never rude and snappish;
and it appears to me that you are trying to see how hateful
and spiteful you can be. Why upon earth did you not shake
hands with those strangers, and treat them politely?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t choose to be hypocritical,—and I don’t
like Miss Muriel Manton.”</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“Nonsense!</ins> Stuff! I only wish you were half as well-bred
and courteous, and lady-like.”</p>
<p>“Do you, really? Then, to be obedient and, oblige you,
when they come back, I will imitate her example, and throw
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_158"></a>158</span>
myself into Dr. Grey’s arms, and rub my cheek against his
shoulder, and fondle his hands. If this be ‘lady-like,’ then,
indeed, I penitently cry ‘<i>peccavi!</i>’ and promise that in future
you shall not have cause to complain of me.”</p>
<p>“Pooh, pooh, child! What ails you? Muriel has known
Ulpian all her life, and looks upon him now as her father.
He has petted her since she was a little girl, and loves her
almost as well as if she were his child, instead of his ward.
You know she is an orphan; and it is very natural for her to
cling to her guardian, who was for a great many years her
father’s most intimate friend.”</p>
<p>“We are both orphans, and she is certainly not my junior,
yet your propriety would be shocked if I behaved as she does.
Where is Stanley?”</p>
<p>“Studying his geography lesson, with the assistance of the
globe, in the library. What do you want with him?”</p>
<p>“I am going to the beach, and wish him to walk with me.”</p>
<p>“It is too late for you to start for the seaside, and, moreover,
it would appear very discourteous in you to absent yourself
the first evening that these strangers spend here. Ulpian
would be displeased.”</p>
<p>“According to your statement a few minutes since, that is
his chronic condition, as far as I am concerned; and, as I
do not belong to the mimosa species, I think I may brave his
frowns.”</p>
<p>“That is not the worst you have to apprehend. Child, I
think it would be bitter indeed, to bear Ulpian Grey’s contempt.”</p>
<p>“I shall take care not to deserve it; and Dr. Grey never
forgets to be just.”</p>
<p>“My dear little girl, what right have you to be jealous of
his love for his young ward?”</p>
<p>The flame that was slowly dying out of her face leaped up
fiercer than before, and she crimsoned to the edges of her
hair.</p>
<p>“Jealous! Good heavens, Miss Jane, you must be dreaming!
I merely question the taste that allows his ‘lady-like’
favorite to caress him so openly, and should not have expressed
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_159"></a>159</span>
my disapprobation so strongly if you had not rated
me soundly, and held her up as a model for my humble imitation.
If she and her governess are to stir up strife between
you and me, I shall heartily wish them a speedy passage to
Halifax or heaven. Beyond all peradventure I shall get
murderously jealous if you dare to give this sloe-eyed, peony-faced
girl, my place in your dear old heart. She, of course,
will fondle her guardian as much as she pleases, or as often
as he sees fit to allow; but woe unto her if I catch her hands
and lips about you, my dearest and best friend! Don’t scold
me and praise her, or some fine day I shall jump at and
strangle her, which you know would not be ‘well-bred’ or
‘lady-like,’ much less moral and Christian.”</p>
<p>She almost smothered the old lady in her arms, and kissed
her several times.</p>
<p>“What has stirred up the evil spirit in you? You look
as wicked as your mother Herodias, thirsting for the blood
of John the Baptist; or as Jezebel plotting against the
prophet—”</p>
<p>“And telling me that like her I am ‘going to the dogs’
is not the surest way to reform me. Stanley! Stanley! get
your hat and come here.”</p>
<p>“Your awful temper will be your ruin if you don’t put a
curb-bit on it. See here, Salome, don’t be so utterly silly
and childish! I do not wish you to go to the sea-shore this
evening.”</p>
<p>“Please, Miss Jane, don’t order me to stay at home, because,
then of course, I should feel bound to obey you, and I
should not behave prettily, and you would wish me at the
bottom of the sea, instead of on its brink. Let me go, and I
will come back cool as a cucumber, and well-behaved as Miss
Muriel Manton. Please don’t prohibit me; and I promise I
will lose my evil spirit in the sea, like that Gergesene wretch
that haunted the tombs. Here comes Stanley. Don’t shake
your head. I am off.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane would not receive the proffered farewell kiss,
but tears gathered and dimmed her eyes as she looked after
the graceful, girlish figure, swiftly crossing the lawn; and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_160"></a>160</span>
sad forebodings filled her affectionate heart when she thought
of the unknown future that stretched before that impetuous,
jealous, imperious nature.</p>
<p>Anxious that the strangers should feel thoroughly welcome
and at home, she joined them as soon as possible after their
return from the sheepfold, and exerted herself to keep the
shuttlecock of conversation in constant motion; but her
brother’s watchful eyes discerned the perturbed feeling she
sought to hide; and, when she insisted, for the first time in
two years, upon taking her seat and presiding at the tea-table,
he busied himself in arranging her cushions comfortably,
and whispered,—</p>
<p>“How good and considerate you are, my precious sister.
A thousand thanks for this generous effort, which I trust will
not fatigue you.”</p>
<p>He placed himself opposite, and was about to ask a blessing
on the meal, but paused to inquire,—</p>
<p>“Where are the children, Salome and Stanley?”</p>
<p>“They have gone down to the beach, and we will not wait
for them.”</p>
<p>Soon after, Muriel said,—</p>
<p>“I think Salome is almost beautiful. She has splendid
eyes and hair. Miss Edith, does she not remind you of a
piece of sculpture at Naples?”</p>
<p>“Yes; I noticed a resemblance to the <i>Julia-Agrippina</i>, and
the likeness must be remarkable, since it impressed us simultaneously.
Salome’s brow is fuller, and her chin more
prominent than that of the Roman woman we admired so
ardently; and, besides, I should judge that she had quite as
much or more will than the daughter of Germanicus, for her
lips are thinner.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey changed the topic of conversation, and Miss Dexter
courteously followed the cue.</p>
<p>The moon was high in heaven when Salome and her brother
came up the avenue; and, observing that the lights were extinguished
in the front rooms, she surmised that the new-comers
had retired very early, in consequence of fatigue from their
long journey. Sending Stanley to bed, she sat down on the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_161"></a>161</span>
steps to rest a few moments before going upstairs, and began
to fan herself with her straw hat.</p>
<p>She had grown very calm, and almost ashamed of her passionate
ebullition in the presence of strangers; and numerous
good resolutions were sending out fibrous roots in her heart.
How long she rested there she knew not, and started when
<ins title="Removed extra word, he">Dr. Grey</ins> said, in a subdued voice,—</p>
<p>“Salome, I am waiting to lock the door, and should be glad
if you will come in now, or be careful to secure the inner bolt
whenever you do. As I always shut up the house, I was
afraid you might not think of it; and burglaries are becoming
alarmingly frequent.”</p>
<p>She rose instantly, and entered the hall.</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Eleven o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible? You know, sir, that the evenings are very
short now.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He was removing a chair from the gallery and closing the
Venetian blinds, and she could not see his face. Hoping to
receive some friendly look, which she was painfully aware she
did not deserve, she loitered till he turned around.</p>
<p>“Salome, have you a light in your room?”</p>
<p>“I do not know, but suppose so.”</p>
<p>“There are two candles in the library, and you had better
take one, rather than stumble along in the dark and wake
everybody.”</p>
<p>He brought out one, and handed it to her.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Good-night, Dr. Grey.”</p>
<p>“Good-night, Salome.”</p>
<p>The candle-light showed no displeasure in his countenance,
which was calm as usual, and there was not a hint of
harshness in his unwontedly low voice; but she read disappointment
in his grave, kind eyes. She knew that she
could not sleep until she had made her peace with him; and,
though it cost her a great effort to conquer her pride, she said,
humbly,—</p>
<p>“‘And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_162"></a>162</span>
seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent,—thou
shalt forgive him.’”</p>
<p>“Yes; but the frequency of the offence renders it difficult
to believe the repentance genuine.”</p>
<p>“Christ, your master, did not doubt it.”</p>
<p>“I am less than the disciples whom he addressed; and they
answered, ‘Increase our faith.’”</p>
<p>“You did not pray for me this morning.”</p>
<p>“I never neglect my promises. Why do you doubt that I
fulfilled them this morning?”</p>
<p>“This has been one of my sinful days, when Satan runs
rough-shod over all my good intentions, and drags me through
the mire that I was trying to hold my soul far above. I tell
you, sir, that the ‘unclean spirit’ that vexed the daughter of
the Syrophœnician woman was mild, and harmless, and well-mannered,
in comparison with the demon that takes bodily
possession of me, and whose name is not ‘<i>Suset</i>’! but a fearful
<i>Ruach</i> demanding the ban <i>Cherem</i>. I once thought all
that part of Scripture which referred to the casting out of
devils was metaphorical; but I know better now; for the one
that Luther assaulted with his inkstand was not more palpable
than that which enters into my heart every now and
then, and overturns the altars of the ‘true, good, and beautiful,’
and sets up instead a small hall of Eblis, as full of
horrible, mis-shapen things as that hideous ‘Last Judgment’
of Orcagna, in the Campo Santo at Pisa, which you once
showed me in a portfolio of engravings. Oh, Dr. Grey! you
ought to be merciful to me; for indeed God gave me a fearfully
wicked and cunning spirit for a perpetual companion
and tempter. Even Christ had Lucifer and Quarantina.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and conquered both, and promised assistance to all
who earnestly desire and resolve to follow his example.”</p>
<p>“You cannot forgive my rudeness?”</p>
<p>“The act of incivility was very slight; but, my young
friend, the unaccountable perversity of your character certainly
fills my mind with serious apprehension concerning
your future. Of course, I can very readily forgive the occasion
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_163"></a>163</span>
that displayed it, but I cannot entirely forget the spirit
that distresses me when I least expect it.”</p>
<p>“If you will dismiss this afternoon from your mind, I
will never—”</p>
<p>“Stop! Make me no more promises till you are strong
enough to keep them inviolate. Promise less and pray more;
I am not angry, but I am disappointed.”</p>
<p>She drooped her head to avoid his grave, sad gaze, and for
a moment there was silence.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, will you shake hands with me, in token of
pardon?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, if you wish it.”</p>
<p>He took her hand in both of his, pressed it kindly, and said,
in a low, solemn tone,—</p>
<p>“Good-night, Salome. May God guide, and strengthen,
and help you to be the noble woman, the consistent Christian,
which only His grace and blessing can ever enable you to become.
Remember the cheering words of Jean Paul Richter,
‘Evil is like the nightmare, the instant you bestir yourself
it has already ended.’”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Ulpian, have you had any conversation with Salome?”</p>
<p>“Upon what subject?”</p>
<p>“Have you talked with her concerning her studies?”</p>
<p>“Not recently. Soon after Muriel and Miss Dexter came,
I mentioned to her the fact that I should be glad to see her
enter a class with Muriel and pursue the same studies, and
that such an arrangement would be entirely agreeable to Miss
Dexter; but she declined the proposition, saying she would
only trouble the latter to teach her Italian. Do you know
why she is so anxious to acquire that language?”</p>
<p>“No; to tell you the truth, I know less and less every day
about her actions, for the child has suddenly grown very
reserved. This morning she was walking up and down the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_164"></a>164</span>
library with her hands behind her and her eyes looking as if
they were travelling to Jericho or Jeddo, and when I asked
her why she was so unusually silent, she snapped like a toy-torpedo,
‘I am silent because this is one of my wicked days,
and I am fighting the devil; and if I open my lips I shall
say something that will give him the victory.’ I held out
my hand to her and begged her to come and sit by me and
tell me what troubled or tempted her,—and what do you
suppose she said?”</p>
<p>“Something, I am afraid, that I shall be sorry to hear you
repeat.”</p>
<p>“She laid her hand on her heart and answered, ‘You are
very good, Miss Jane, but you can no more help me than the
disciples could relieve that wretch whom only Christ healed.’
‘<i>This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</i>’ Whereupon,
she snatched a book from the table and left the room.
I did not see her for several hours, and when I met her in
the hall, a few moments since, I said, ‘Well, dear, which won
the victory, sin or my little girl?’ She put her hands on my
shoulders, laughed bitterly, and answered, ‘It was a drawn
battle. Neither has much to boast of, and we lie on our
arms watching—nay, glaring at each other. Let me be quiet
a little while, and don’t ask me about <ins title="Added quote">it.’”</ins></p>
<p>“Can you conjecture the cause of the present trouble?”</p>
<p>“I have a suspicion.”</p>
<p><ins title="Removed quote">Miss</ins> Jane paused, sighed, and frowned.</p>
<p>“I should think you might persuade her to confide in you.”</p>
<p>“Pooh! Persuade her? I would quite as soon undertake
to persuade the Andes to dance a jig as attempt to discover
what she has determined not to divulge. If you knew her as
well as I do, you would appreciate the uselessness of trying to
persuade her to do anything. But you men never see what lies
right under your noses, and I believe if you lived in the same
house with that child for five years longer you would understand
her as little as you do to-day. Ulpian, shut the door,
and sit down here close to me.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey complied; and, laying her shrunken hand on her
brother’s knee, Miss Jane said, hesitatingly,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_165"></a>165</span></div>
<p>“My dear boy, I don’t know whether I ought to tell you,
and, indeed, I do not see my way clearly; but you seem so unsuspecting
that I think it is my duty to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“Pray come to the point, dear Janet. Your exordium is
very tantalizing. Tell me frankly what disturbs you.”</p>
<p>“It pains me to call your attention to a fact that I know
cannot fail to produce annoyance.”</p>
<p>He put his arm around her, and, drawing her head to his
shoulder, answered, tenderly,—</p>
<p>“My precious sister, I have seen for some days that you
were perplexed and anxious, but I abstained from questioning
you because I felt assured whenever you deemed it best to confide
in me, you would voluntarily unburden your heart. Now
lay all your troubles upon me, and keep back nothing. Has
Salome grieved you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, the child does not intend to grieve me! Ulpian,
can’t you imagine what makes her unhappy, and restless, and
contrary?”</p>
<p>“She is very wayward, passionate, and obstinate, and any
restraint upon her whims is peculiarly irksome and intolerable
to her; but I believe she is really striving to correct the unfortunate
defects in her character. She evidently dislikes our
guests, and this proves a continual source of disquiet to her;
for, while she endeavors to treat them courteously, I can see
that she would be excessively rude if she dared to indulge her
antipathies.”</p>
<p>“Do you know why she dislikes Muriel so intensely?”</p>
<p>“No; I cannot even conjecture. Muriel is very amiable
and affectionate, and seems disposed to become very fond of
Salome, if she would only encourage her advances. Can you
explain the mystery?”</p>
<p>“If you were not as blind as a mole, or the fish in Mammoth
Cave, you would see that Salome is insanely jealous of
your affection for your ward, and that is the cause of all the
trouble.”</p>
<p>“It is unreasonable and absurd in her to entertain such
feelings; and, moreover, she has no right to cherish any
jealousy towards my ward.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_166"></a>166</span></div>
<p>“Unreasonable! Yes, quite true; but did you ever know
a woman to be very reasonable concerning the man she loves?”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey’s quiet face flushed, and he rose instantly, looking
incredulous and embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Surely, my dear sister, you do not intend to insinuate, or
desire me to infer, that Salome has any—”</p>
<p>He paused, bit his lip, and walked to the window.</p>
<p>“I mean to say, in plain Anglo-Saxon, and I desire you to
understand, that Salome is no longer a child; and that she
loves you, my dear boy, better than she will ever love any other
human being. These things are very strange, indeed, and
girls’ whims baffle all rules and disappoint all reasonable expectations;
but, nevertheless, it does no good to shut your eyes
to facts that are as clear as daylight. It is not a sudden
freak that has seized the poor child; it has grown upon her,
almost without her understanding herself; but I discovered it
the day that you left home so unexpectedly for New York.
Her distress betrayed her real feelings; and, since then, I have
watched her, and can see how completely her thoughts centre
in you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Janet, I hope you mistake her! I cannot believe it
possible, for I recall nothing in her conduct that justifies your
supposition; and I do not think I lack penetration. If she
were really interested in me, as you imagine, she certainly
would not thrust so prominently and constantly before me
faults of character which she well knows I cannot tolerate.
Moreover, my dear sister, consider the disparity in our years,
the incompatibility of our tastes and habits, and the improbability
that a handsome young girl should cherish any feeling
stronger than esteem or friendship for a staid man of my age!
No, no; it is too incredible to be entertained, and I am sorry
you ever suggested such an annoying chimera to me. Salome
is rather a singular compound, I willingly admit, but I acquit
her of the folly you seem inclined to impute to her.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey walked up and down the library floor, and, as
his sister watched him, a sad smile trembled over her thin,
wrinkled face.</p>
<p>“Ulpian, you are considerably younger than our poor
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_167"></a>167</span>
father was when he married a beautiful creature not one
month older than Salome is to-day. Will you sit in judgment
on your own young mother?”</p>
<p>“Nay, Janet; the parallelism is not as apparent as you
imagine, for my manner toward Salome has been calculated
to check and chill any sentiment analogous to that which my
father sought to win from my mother. Pray, do not press
upon me a surmise which is indescribably painful to me.”</p>
<p>He resumed his seat, and, thrusting his fingers through his
hair, leaned his head on his open hand.</p>
<p>“My dear boy, if true, why should it prove indescribably
painful to you?”</p>
<p>“Cannot your womanly intuitions spare me an explicit
reply?”</p>
<p>“No; speak frankly to me.”</p>
<p>“No man of honor—no man who has any delicacy or refinement
of feeling—can fail to be distressed and annoyed by
the thought that he has unintentionally and unconsciously
aroused in a woman’s heart an interest which he cannot possibly
reciprocate.”</p>
<p>“But, if you have never considered the subject until now,
how do you know that you may not be able to return the
affection?”</p>
<p>“Because, when I examine my own heart, I find not even
the germ of a feeling which years might possibly ripen into
love.”</p>
<p>“Will you candidly answer the question I am about to ask
you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think I can safely promise that much, simply because
I wish to conceal nothing from you; and I cannot conjecture
any inquiry on your part from which I should shrink.
What would you ask?”</p>
<p>“Is it because you are interested in some other woman,
that you speak so positively of the hopelessness of my poor
Salome’s case?”</p>
<p>“No, my sister; no woman has any claim or hold on my
heart stronger than that of mere friendship. I have never
loved any one as I must love the woman I make my wife; and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_168"></a>168</span>
since I have seen and merely admired so many who were attractive,
lovely, and lovable, I often think that I shall probably
never marry.</p>

<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> ‘For several virtues</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Of course this is a matter with reference to which I shall not
dogmatize, for we are all more or less the victims of caprice;
and, like other men, I may some day set the imperious feet of
fancy upon the neck of judgment and sound reason. As yet,
I have not met the perfect character whom I could ask to
bear my name; still, I may be so fortunate as either to find my
ideal, or imagine that I do; or else become so earnestly attached
to some beautiful woman, that, for her sake, I will
willingly lower my lofty standard. These are the merest
possible contingencies, and I have little inclination to discuss
them; but I wish at all times to be entirely frank with you.
Salome would never suit me as a life-long companion. She
meets none of the requirements of my intellectual nature, and
her perverse disposition, and what might almost be termed
<i>diablerie</i>, repel instead of attracting me. I pity the child, and
can sympathize cordially with her efforts to redeem herself
from the luckless associations of earlier years that wofully
distorted her character; and I can truly say that I am interested
in her welfare and improvement, and have a faint
brotherly affection for her; but I thoroughly comprehend my
own feelings when I assure you, Janet, that were Salome and
I left alone in the world I could never for a moment entertain
the idea of calling such a wayward child my wife. Are
you satisfied?”</p>
<p>“Convinced, at least, that you are not deceiving me. But,
Ulpian, the girl is growing very beautiful—don’t you think
so?—or, is it my love that makes me see her through flattering
lenses?”</p>
<p>“Her lips are too thin, and her eyes too keen and restless
for perfect beauty, which claims repose as one of its essential
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_169"></a>169</span>
elements; but, notwithstanding these flaws, she has undoubtedly
one of the handsomest faces I have ever seen, and
certainly a graceful, fine figure.”</p>
<p>“And you are such an admirer of beauty,” said Miss Jane,
slipping her fingers caressingly into her brother’s hand.</p>
<p>“Yes; I shall not deny that I yield to no one in appreciation
of lovely faces; but, if I am aware that, like some rich
crimson June rose whose calyx cradles a worm, the heart
beneath the perfect form is gnawed by some evil tendency, or
shelters vindictive passion and sinful impulses, I should certainly
not select it in making up the precious bouquet that is
to shed perfume and beauty in my home, and call my thoughts
from the din and strife of the outer world to holiness and
peace.”</p>
<p>“You have no mercy on the child.”</p>
<p>“I ought to have no mercy on glaring faults which she
should ere this have corrected.”</p>
<p>“But she is so young—only seventeen! Think of it!”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey frowned, and partially withdrew his hand from
his sister’s clasp.</p>
<p>“Janet, you grieve me. Surely you are not pleading with
me in behalf of Salome?”</p>
<p>Tears trickled over Miss Jane’s sallow cheeks and dripped
on the doctor’s hand, as she replied,—</p>
<p>“Bear with me, Ulpian. The girl is very dear to me; and,
loving you as she unquestionably does, I know that you could
make her a noble, admirable woman,—for she has some fine
traits, and your influence would perfect her character. Believe
me, my dear boy, you, and you only, can remould her
heart.”</p>
<p>“Possibly,—if I loved her; for then I would be patient
and forbearing towards her faults. But I cannot even respect
that handsome, fiery, impulsive, unreasonable child, much less
love her; and, if I ever marry, my wife must be worthy to
remould my own defective life and erring nature. I am surprised,
my dear sister, that you, whose sincere affection I can
not doubt, should be willing to see me link my life with that
of one so much younger, and, I grieve to say it, so far inferior
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_170"></a>170</span>
in all respects. What congenial companionship could
I promise myself? What confidence could I repose—what
esteem could I entertain—for a silly girl, who, without warrant
and utterly unsought, bestows her love (if, indeed, what
you say be true) upon a man who never even dreamed of such
folly, and is old enough to be her father?”</p>
<p>“I can not comprehend the logic that condemns Salome,
and justifies your own mother; for, if there be any difference
in their lines of conduct, I am too stupid to see it.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane lifted her head from her brother’s shoulder, resolutely
dried her eyes, and settled her cap.</p>
<p>“My mother’s tombstone should shelter her from all animadversion,
especially from the lips that owe their existence
to her. Do not, my sister, disturb the mouldering ashes of
the long-buried past. The unfortunate fact you have mentioned,
and which I should gladly doubt if you would only
permit me to do so, renders it necessary for me to be perfectly
candid with you, and you will, I trust, pardon what I feel
compelled to say to you. I have remarked that you watch me
quite closely whenever I am engaged in conversation with my
ward or her governess, and yesterday, when Muriel came,
stood by me, and leaned her arm on my shoulder, you frowned
and looked harshly at the child. Once for all, let me tell
you that there is no more possibility of my loving Muriel or
Edith, than Salome. Of the three, I care most for Muriel,
who looks upon me as her second father, and to whom I am
deeply attached. If I caress the poor, stricken child, and
allow her to approach me familiarly, you ought to understand
your brother sufficiently well not to ascribe his conduct to any
feeling which he would blush to confess to his sister. The
day before Horace died, he said, ‘Be a father to my daughter;
take my place when I am gone.’ If I were at liberty to
divulge some matters confided to me, I could easily assure
you that there is not a shadow of possibility that Muriel will
ever grieve and mortify me as Salome has done. Now look
at me, dear Janet, and kiss me, and trust your brother; for he
will never deceive you, and can not endure a moment’s estrangement
from you.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_171"></a>171</span></div>
<p>Miss Jane put up her lips for the caress, and, after a short
silence, Dr. Grey continued,—</p>
<p>“Tell me now what you think best under the circumstances,
and I will endeavor to coöperate with you. Does Salome
know you are cognizant of her weakness—her misfortune—”</p>
<p>He stammered, and again his face flushed.</p>
<p>“Upon my word, Ulpian, you are positively blushing!
Don’t worry yourself, dear, over what can not be helped, or at
least is attributable to no fault of yours. No; you may be
sure Salome would be drawn, quartered, and broiled, before
she would confess to me the feeling which she does not suspect
I have discovered. Poor thing! I can’t avoid pitying her
whenever you take Muriel’s hand or caress her in any way.
This morning you smoothed the hair back from her forehead
while she was stooping over her drawing, and poor Salome’s
eyes flashed and looked like a leopard’s. She clenched her
fingers as if she were strangling something, and an expression
came over her face that was dangerous, and made me shiver a
little. Something must be done; but I am sure I do not know
what to advise.”</p>
<p>“How futile and mocking are merely human schemes!
My principal object in bringing Muriel and Miss Dexter here,
was to provide agreeable and improving companions for your
pet and to afford her the privilege of sharing the educational
advantages which Muriel enjoyed. <i>L’homme propose, et Dieu
dispose</i>, if, indeed, an occurrence so earnestly to be deplored
can be deemed providential. What are her plans relative to
Jessie?”</p>
<p>“If she has matured any, she keeps them shut up in her
own heart. Once she talked freely to me on all subjects, but
recently she seems to avoid acquainting me with her intentions
or schemes. Of course, Ulpian, you know I have always
expected to leave her a portion of my property.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, dear Janet; you ought to provide comfortably
for the girl whom you have taught to rely upon your bounty.
It would be cruel and unpardonable to foster hopes that you
could not fully realize.”</p>
<p>“It was my intention to put into your hands the share I
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_172"></a>172</span>
intended for her, and to leave her also to your care, when I
die; but now I know not what is best. If she could be separated
from you, she might divert her thoughts and become interested
in other things or persons; but so long as you are in
the same house I know there will be nothing but wretchedness
and disappointment for her.”</p>
<p>After a long pause, during which Dr. Grey looked seriously
pained and perplexed, he said, sorrowfully,—</p>
<p>“You are right in thinking separation would be best; and I
will go away at once—”</p>
<p>“Go where?” exclaimed his sister, grasping his coat-sleeve.</p>
<p>“I will furnish the rooms over my office, and live there. It
will be more convenient for my business; but I dislike to leave
you and the dear old homestead.”</p>
<p>“Stuff! You will churn the Atlantic, with the North Pole
for a dasher! Ulpian Grey! come weal come woe, I don’t intend
to give you up. Here, right here, you will live while
there is breath in my body,—unless you wish to make me sob
it out and die the sooner. Pooh! Salome’s shining eyes can
not recompense me for the loss of my boy’s blue ones, and I
will not hear of such nonsense as the move you propose. You
know, dear, I can’t be here very long at the best, and while
God spares me I want you near me. Besides, the separation
of a few miles would not be worth a thimbleful of chaff; for,
of course, Salome would hear of or see you daily, and the
change would amount to nothing but anxiety and grief on my
part. We will think the matter over, and do nothing rashly.
But try to be patient with my little girl; and, for my sake,
Ulpian, do not allow her to suspect that you dream of her
feeling towards you. It is pitiable,—it is distressing beyond
expression; and God knows, if I had thought for an instant
that such a state of things would ever have come to pass, I
would have left her in the poor-house sooner than have been
instrumental in bringing such misery upon her young life.
Last night I was suffering so much with my shoulder that
I could not sleep, and I heard the child pacing her room until
after three o’clock. It was useless to question her; for, of
course, she would not confess the real cause, and I did not
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_173"></a>173</span>
wish her to know that I noticed what I could not cure. But,
my dearest boy, we are not to be blamed; so don’t look so
mortified and grieved. I would not have opened your unsuspecting
eyes if I had not feared that your ignorance of
the truth might increase the trouble, and I knew I could
safely appeal to my sailor-boy’s honor. Now you know all,
and must be guided by your own good sense and delicacy in
your future course toward the poor, proud young thing. Be
guarded, Ulpian, and don’t torment her by petting Muriel in
her presence; for sometimes I am afraid there is bad blood in
her veins, that brings that wicked glow to her eyes, and I
dread that she might suddenly say or do some desperate thing
that would plunge us all in sorrow. You know she is not a
meek creature, and we must pity her weakness.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey had grown very pale, and the profound regret
printed on his countenance found expression also in the deepened
and saddened tones of his voice.</p>
<p>“Trust me, Janet! I will do all a man can to rectify the
mischief, of which, God knows, I have been an innocent and
entirely unintentional cause. Salome’s course is unwomanly,
and lowers her in my estimation; but she is so young I shall
hope and pray that her preference for me is not sufficiently
strong to prove more than an idle, fleeting, girlish fancy.”</p>
<p>He took his gloves from the table and left the room; and,
for some time after his departure, his sister sat rocking herself
to and fro, pondering all that had passed. Finally, she
struck her hand decisively upon the cushioned top of her
crutch, and muttered,—</p>
<p>“Yes, he certainly is as nearly perfect as humanity can be;
but, after all, Ulpian Grey is only flesh and blood, and despite
his efforts to crush it, there must be some vanity hidden under
his proud humility,—for certainly he is both humble in one
sense, and inordinately proud in another; and I do not believe
there lives a man of his age who would not be flattered by the
love of a fresh young beauty like Salome. He thinks now
that he is distressed and mortified; and, of course, he is
honest in what he tells me; but I have studied human nature
to very little purpose for the last fifty years, if, before long,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_174"></a>174</span>
he does not find himself more interested in Salome than he
will be willing to confess. Her love for him will invest her
with a charm she never possessed before, for men are vulnerable
as women to the cunning advances of flattery. One
thing is as sure and clear as that two and two make four,—if
he is proof against Salome’s devotion it will be attributable to
the fact that he gives his heart to some one else; and I thought
his blue eyes rather shied away from mine when he said he
had yet to meet the woman he could marry. You don’t intend
to deceive me, my precious boy, I know you don’t; but I
should not be astounded if you had hoodwinked yourself,—a
very little. But ‘sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,’
and I will wait,—and we shall see what we shall see.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Elsie, it is worse than useless to talk to me. Once I
could listen to you,—once I felt as you do now; but that time
has gone by forever. I will read to you as often as you desire
it, provided you do not make every chapter a text for a <ins title="Was a comma">sermon.</ins>
What do you wish to hear this morning?”</p>
<p>“The fortieth Psalm.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome opened the Bible, and, when she had finished
the psalm designated, shut the book and laid it back close to
Elsie’s pillow.</p>
<p>The old woman placed her hand on the round, white arm of
her mistress, who rested carelessly against the bed.</p>
<p>“You know, my child, that David’s afflictions were sore
indeed; but he declares, ‘I waited patiently for the Lord, and
he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.’ You will not be
patient, and God can’t help you till you are. We are like
children punished for bad conduct,—as long as we rebel and
struggle, of course we must be still further chastised; but the
moment we show real penitence, our parents notice that we are
bearing correction patiently, and then they throw away the
rod and stretch out their arms, and snatch us close to their
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_175"></a>175</span>
loving hearts. Even so God holds one hand to draw us tenderly
to Him; and, if we are obstinately sinful, with the other
He scourges us into the right path,—determined to help us,
even against our own wills. Ah, if I could see you waiting
patiently for the Lord!”</p>
<p>“You will never see it. Patience was ‘scourged’ out of
me, and now I stand still because I am worn out with struggling,
waiting—not patiently, but wearily and helplessly—to
see the end of my punishment. What have I done that I
should feign a penitence I shall never feel? I was a happy,
trusting, unoffending woman, when God smote me fiercely;
and, because I was so innocent, I could not kiss my stinging
rod, I grappled desperately with it. Elsie, don’t stir up the
bitter dregs in my soul, and mix them with every thought.
Let them settle.”</p>
<p>“My darling, I don’t want them to settle. I pray either
that they may be stirred up and taken out, or sweetened by
the grace of God. Do you ever think of the day when you
will face your sainted mother?”</p>
<p>“No. I think only of enduring this present life until
death, my deliverer, comes to my rescue.”</p>
<p>“But, my bairn, you are not fit to die.”</p>
<p>“Fit to die as to live,” answered her mistress, morosely.</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, don’t flout the Almighty in that wicked
manner! If you would only be baptized and take refuge in
prayer, as every Christian should, you would find peace for
your poor, miserable soul.”</p>
<p>“No; peace can’t be poured out of a pitcher with the baptismal
water; and all the waves tossing and glittering out there
in the ocean could not wash one painful memory from my
heart. I have had one baptism, and it was ample and
thorough. I went down into the waters of woe, and all their
black billows broke over me. Instead of the Jordan, I was
immersed in the Dead Sea, and the asphaltum cleaves to me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, dearie, you will break my heart! I wish now that
you had died when you were only fourteen months old, for
then there would have been one more precious lamb in the
flock of the Good Shepherd, safe in heavenly pastures—one
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_176"></a>176</span>
more dear little golden head nestling on Jesus’ bosom,—instead
of—of—”</p>
<p>Elsie’s emotion mastered her voice, and she sobbed convulsively.</p>
<p>“Why did not you finish? ‘Instead of a gray head waiting
to go down into the pit of perdition.’ Yes, it was a terrible
blunder that I was not allowed to die in my infancy; but it
can’t be helped now, and I wish you would not fret yourself
into a fever over the irremediable. Why will you persist in
tormenting yourself and me about my want of resignation
and faith, when you know that exhortation and persuasion
have no more effect upon me than the whistle of the plover
down yonder in the sedge and seaweed,—where I heartily
wish I were lying, ten feet under the shells? Rather a damp
pillow for my fastidious, proud head, but, at least, cool and
quiet. Calm yourself, my dear Elsie, for God will not hold
you responsible if I miss my place among the saints, when He
divides the sheep from the goats, in the last day,—<i>Dies iræ
dies illa</i>. Let me straighten your pillow and smooth your
cap-border, for I see your doctor coming up the walk. There,—dry
your eyes. When you want me, send Robert or Katie to
call me.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome leaned over the helpless, prostrate form on
the bed, pressed her cheek against that of her nurse, where
tears still glistened, and glided swiftly out of the room just
before Dr. Grey entered.</p>
<p>Never had he seen his patient so completely unnerved; but,
observing her efforts to compose herself, he forbore any allusion
to an agitation which he suspected was referable to
mental rather than physical causes. Bravely the stubborn
woman struggled to steady her voice, and still the twitching
tell-tale muscles about her mouth; but the burden of anxiety
finally bore down all resolves, and, covering her face with her
broad hand, she wept unrestrainedly.</p>
<p>In profound silence Dr. Grey sat beside her for nearly five
minutes; then, fearful that the excitement might prove injurious,
he said, gently,—</p>
<p>“I hope you are not suffering so severely from bodily pain?
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_177"></a>177</span>
What distresses you, my good woman? Perhaps, if I knew
the cause, I might be able to render you some service.”</p>
<p>“It is not my body,—that, you know, is numb, and gives
me no pain,—but my mind! Doctor, I am suffering in mind,
and you have no medicine that can ease that.”</p>
<p>“Possibly I may accomplish more than you imagine is
within reach of my remedies. Of one thing you may rest
assured,—you will never have reason to regret any confidence
you may repose in me.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I believe you are a Christian; at least, I have
heard so; and, since my affliction, I have been watching you
very closely, and begin to think I can trust you. Are you a
member of the church?”</p>
<p>“I am; although that fact alone should not entitle me to
your confidence. We are all erring, and full of faults, but I
endeavor to live in such a manner that I shall not bring disgrace
upon the holy faith I profess.”</p>
<p>“Shut the door, and come back to me.”</p>
<p>He bolted the door, which stood ajar, and resumed his seat.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I know as well as you do that I can’t last a
great while, and I ought to prepare for what may overtake me
any day. I have tried to live in accordance with the law of
God, and I am not afraid to die; but I am afraid to leave
my mistress behind me. When I am gone there will be no one
to watch over and plead with her, and I dread lest her precious
soul may be lost. She won’t go to God for herself, or by herself,
and who will pray for her salvation when I am in my
shroud? Oh, I can not die in peace, leaving her alone in the
world she hates and despises! What will become of my poor,
bonnie bairn?”</p>
<p>Elsie sobbed aloud, and Dr. Grey asked,—</p>
<p>“Has Mrs. Gerome no living relatives?”</p>
<p>“None, sir, in America. There are some cousins in Scotland,
but she has never seen them, and never will.”</p>
<p>“Where are the members of her husband’s family?”</p>
<p>A visible shudder crept over that portion of the woman’s
body which was not paralyzed, and her face grew dark and
stern.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_178"></a>178</span></div>
<p>“He was an orphan.”</p>
<p>“His loss seems to have had a terrible effect upon Mrs.
Gerome, and rendered her bitter and hopeless.”</p>
<p>“How hopeless, none but she and I and the God above us
know. Once she was the meekest, sweetest spirit, that ever
gladdened a nurse’s heart, and I thought the world was
blessed by her coming into it; but now she is sacrilegious and
scoffing, and almost dares the Lord’s judgments. Dr. Grey, it
would nearly freeze your blood to hear her sometimes. Poor
thing! she will have no companions, and so has a habit of
talking to herself, and I often hear her arguing with the Almighty
about her life, and the trouble He allowed to fall into
it. Last night she was walking there under my window, begging
God to take her out of the world before I die. Begging,
did I say? Nay,—demanding. My precious, pretty bairn!”</p>
<p>“Elsie, be candid with me. Is not Mrs. Gerome partially
deranged?”</p>
<p>She struggled violently to raise herself, but failing, her
head fell back, and she lifted her finger angrily.</p>
<p>“No more deranged than you or I. That is a vile slander
of busybodies whom she will not receive, and who take it for
granted that no lady in her sound senses would refuse the
privilege of gossiping with them. She is as sane as any one,
though there is an unnatural appearance about her, and if her
heart was only as sound as her head I could die easily. They
started the report of craziness long, long ago, in order to get
hold of her fortune; but it was too infamous a scheme to
succeed.”</p>
<p>Elsie’s strong white teeth were firmly set, and her clenched
fingers did not relax.</p>
<p>“Who started the report of her insanity?”</p>
<p>“One who injured her, and made her what you see her.”</p>
<p>“She had no children?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Once I begged her to adopt a pretty little orphan
girl we saw in Athens, but she ridiculed me for an old fool,
and asked me if I wished to see her warm a viper to sting
what was left of her heart.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome has indulged her grief for her husband’s
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_179"></a>179</span>
loss, until she has become morbidly sensitive. She should go
into the world, and interest herself in benevolent schemes;
and, ultimately, her diseased thoughts would flow into new
and healthful channels. The secluded life she leads is a hotbed
for the growth of noxious fungi in heart and mind. If
you possess any influence over her, persuade her to re-enter
society. She is still young enough to find not only a cure for
her grief, but an ample share of even earthly happiness.”</p>
<p>Elsie sighed, and waved her hand impatiently.</p>
<p>“You do not know all, or you would understand that in
this world she can not expect much happiness. Besides, she
is peculiarly sensitive about her appearance; and, of course,
when she is seen, people stare, and wonder how such a young
thing got that pile of white hair. That is the reason she quit
travelling and shut herself up here.”</p>
<p>“Was it grief that prematurely silvered her hair?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; it was as black as your coat, until her trouble
came; and then in a fortnight it turned as gray as you see it
now. Doctor, I said she was not deranged, and I spoke truly;
but sometimes I have feared that, when I am gone, she might
get desperate, and, in her loneliness, destroy herself. You are
a sensible man, and can hold your tongue, and I feel that I
can trust you. Now, I know that Robert loves her, and while
he lives will serve her faithfully; but you are wiser than my
son, and I should be better satisfied if I left her in your
charge, when I go home. Will you promise me to take care
of her, and to try to comfort her in the day when she sees
me buried?”</p>
<p>“Elsie, you impose upon me a duty which I am afraid Mrs.
Gerome will not allow me to discharge; and, since she is so
exceedingly averse to meeting strangers, I should not feel
justified in thrusting myself into her presence.”</p>
<p>“Not even to prevent a crime?”</p>
<p>“I hope that your excited imagination and anxious heart
exaggerate the possibility of the danger to which you allude.”</p>
<p>“No; exaggeration is not one of my habits, and I know my
mistress better than she knows herself. She thinks that suicide
is not a sin, but says it is cowardly; and she utterly detests
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_180"></a>180</span>
and loathes cowardice. Dr. Grey, I could not rest quietly
in my coffin if she is left alone in this dreary house, after I
am carried to my long home. Will you stay here awhile, or
take her to your house,—at least for a short time?”</p>
<p>“I will, at all events, promise to comply with your wishes
as fully as she will permit. But recollect that I am comparatively
a stranger to her, and her haughty reception of me
the day I was compelled to come here on your account, does
not encourage me to presume in future. Respect for her
wishes, however unreasonable, and respect for myself, would
forbid an intrusion on my part.”</p>
<p>“If you saw an utter stranger drowning, would fear of
being considered presumptuous or impertinent prevent your
trying to save him? Your self-love should not hold you back
from a Christian duty.”</p>
<p>“And you may rest assured that it never shall, when I feel
that interference—no matter how unwelcome or ungraciously
received—will prove beneficial. But remember that your
mistress is eccentric and shrinking, and all efforts to befriend
her must be made very cautiously.”</p>
<p>“True, doctor; yet sometimes, instead of consulting her, it
is best to treat her as a wilful child. I believe you could
obtain some influence over her if you would only try to break
the ice, because she has spoken kindly of you several times
since I have been so helpless, and asked what she could do to
show her gratitude for your goodness to me. Yesterday she
said she intended to direct Robert to take some fine fruit to
your house, and she remarked that your eyes were, in comparison
with other folks’, what Sabbath is to working week-days,—were
so full of rest, that tired anxious people might be
refreshed by looking at them. Sir, that is more than I have
heard her utter for seven years about anybody; and, therefore,
I think you might do her some good.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey shook his head, but remained silent; and presently
Elsie touched his arm, and continued,—</p>
<p>“There is something I wish to say to you before I die, but
not now. I want you to promise me that when you see my end
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_181"></a>181</span>
is indeed at hand, you will tell me in time to let me talk a
little to you. Will you?”</p>
<p>“You may linger for months, and it is possible that you
may die quite suddenly; consequently, it might be impracticable
for me to fulfil the promise you require. Still, if I can
do so, I will certainly comply with your wishes. Would it not
be better to tell me at once what you desire me to know?”</p>
<p>“While I live it is not necessary that any one should know,
and it is only when I am about to die that I shall speak to
you. For my sake, for humanity’s sake, try to become acquainted
with my mistress and make her like you, as she
certainly will, if she only knows you.”</p>
<p>A tap at the door interrupted the conversation, and soon
after, Dr. Grey quitted the sick-room.</p>
<p>He paused in the hall to examine a fine copy of Landseer’s
“Old Shepherd’s Chief Mourner,” and, while he stood before
it, a large greyhound started up from the mat at the front
door, and bounded towards him. Simultaneously Mrs.
Gerome appeared at the threshold of the parlor.</p>
<p>“Come here, sir! Poor fellow, come here!”</p>
<p>The dog obeyed her instantly; and, pressing close to her,
looked up wistfully in her face.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Gerome. I must thank you for coming
so promptly to my assistance. I have never seen this dog
until to-day, and, consequently, was not on my guard.”</p>
<p>“He arrived only yesterday, and is so overjoyed to be with
me once more that he allows no one else to approach.”</p>
<p>“He is by far the handsomest dog I have ever seen in
America.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I had great difficulty in obtaining him. My agent
assures me that he belongs to the best that are reared in the
tribe of Beni Lam; and that he is a genuine Arab, there can
be no doubt.”</p>
<p>“How long have you owned him?”</p>
<p>“Two years. Unfortunately he was bitten by a snake one
day while wandering with me among the ruins at Pæstum, and
was so singularly affected that I was forced to leave him at
Naples. Various causes combined to delay his restoration to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_182"></a>182</span>
me until last week, when he crossed the Atlantic; and yesterday
he went into ecstasies when I received him from the express
agent. Hush! no growling! Down, sir! Take care,
Dr. Grey; he will bear no hand but mine, and it is rather
dangerous to caress him, as you may judge from the fangs he
is showing you.”</p>
<p>The dog was remarkably tall, silky, beautifully formed,
and of a soft mole-color; and around his neck a collar formed
of four small silver chains, bore an oval silver plate on which
was engraved in German text, “<i>Ich Dien—Agla Gerome</i>.”</p>
<p>“I congratulate you upon the possession of such a treasure,”
said the visitor, with unfeigned admiration,—as, with
the eye of a <i>connoisseur</i>, he noted the fine points about the
sleek, slim animal, who eyed him suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Thank you. How is Elsie to-day?”</p>
<p>“More nervous than I have seen her since the accident, and
some of her symptoms are rather discouraging, though there
is no immediate danger. Do not look so hopeless; she may be
spared to you for many months.”</p>
<p>“Why will you not let me hope that she may ultimately
recover?”</p>
<p>“Because it is utterly futile, and I have no desire to deceive
you, even for an instant. Good morning, Robert.”</p>
<p>The gardener approached with a large basket filled with
peaches and nectarines, and, taking off his hat, bowed profoundly.</p>
<p>“My mistress ordered these placed in your buggy, as I
believe our nectarines ripen earlier than any others in the
neighborhood.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Maclean. Mrs. Gerome is exceedingly kind,
and I have an invalid sister who will enjoy this beautiful
fruit. Those nectarines would not disgrace Smyrna or Damascus,
and are the first of the season.”</p>
<p>Robert passed through the hall, bearing the basket to the
buggy; and at that instant there was a startling crash, as of
some heavy article falling in the parlor. The dog sprang up
with a howl, and Dr. Grey followed Mrs. Gerome into the
room to ascertain the cause of the noise. A glance sufficed
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_183"></a>183</span>
to explain that a picture in a heavy frame had fallen from a
hook above the mantelpiece, and in its descent overturned
some tall vases, which now lay shattered on the hearth. Dr.
Grey lifted the painting from the rubbish, and, as he turned
the canvas towards the light, Mrs. Gerome said,—</p>
<p>“‘<i>Une tristesse implacable, une effroyable fatalité pèse sui
l’œuvre de l’artiste. Cela ressemble à une malediction amère,
lancée sur le sort de l’humanité.</i>’ There is, indeed, some
fatality about that copy of Durer’s ‘Knight, Death, and the
Devil,’ which seems really ill-omened, for this is the second
time it has fallen. Thank you, sir. The frame only is injured,
and I will not trouble you to remove it. Let it lean
against the grate, until I have it rehung more securely.”</p>
<p>“It is too grim a picture for these walls, and stares at its
companions like the mummy at Egyptian banquets.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, it impresses me as grotesque in comparison
with Durer’s ‘Melancholy,’ yonder, or with Holbein’s
‘Les Simulachres de la mort.’”</p>
<p>“Durer’s figure of ‘Melancholy’ has never satisfied me, and
there is more ferocity than sadness in the countenance, which
would serve quite as well for one of the Erinney hunting
Orestes, even in the adytum at Delphi. The face is more
sinister than sorrowful.”</p>
<p>“Since your opinion of that picture coincides so entirely
with mine, tell me whether I have successfully grasped
Coleridge’s dim ideal.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome drew from a corner of the rear room an easel
containing a finished but unframed picture; and, gathering
up the lace curtain drooping before the arch, she held the
folds aside, to allow the light to fall full on the canvas.</p>
<p>“Before you examine it, recall the description that suggested
it.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry to say that my recollection of the passage is
exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory. Will you oblige me by
repeating it?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me; your hand is resting upon the book, which
is open at the fragment.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey bowed, and, lifting the volume from the table
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_184"></a>184</span>
glanced rapidly over the lines designated, then turned to the
picture, where, indeed,</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Stretched on a mouldering abbey’s broadest wall,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Where ruining ivies propped the ruins steep,<br>
Her folded arms wrapping her tattered pall,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Had Melancholy mused herself to sleep.<br>
The fern was pressed beneath her hair,<br>
The dark green adder’s tongue was there;<br>
And still as past the flagging sea-gale weak,<br>
The long, lank leaf bowed fluttering o’er her cheek.<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>That pallid cheek was flushed; her eager look<br>
Beamed eloquent in slumber! Inly wrought,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Imperfect sounds her moving lips forsook,<br>
And her bent forehead worked with troubled thought.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The beautiful face of the reclining figure was dreamily
hopeless and dejected, yet pathetically patient; and, in the
strange amber light reflected from a sunset sea, the fringy
shadow of a cluster of fern-leaves seemed to quiver over the
pale brow and still mouth, and floating raven hair, where the
green snake glided with crest erect and forked tongue within
an inch of one delicate, pearly ear. The gray stones of the
lichen-spotted wall, the graceful sweep of the shrouding drab
drapery, whose folds clung to the form and thence swung
down from the edge of the rocky battlement, the mouldering
ruins leaning against the quiet sky in the rear, and the glassy
stretch of topaz-tinted sea in the foreground, were all painted
with pre-Raphaelite exactness and verisimilitude, and every
detail attested the careful, tender study, with which the picture
had been elaborated.</p>
<p>Was it by accident or design that the woman on the painted
wall bore a vague, mournful resemblance to the owner and
creator? Dr. Grey glanced from Durer’s “Melancholy” to
the canvas on the easel; then his fascinated eyes dwelt on
the dainty features of the artist, and he thought involuntarily
of another Coleridgean image,—of the “pilgrim in whom the
spring and the autumn, and the melancholy of both, seemed to
have combined.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_185"></a>185</span></div>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, in this wonderful embodiment of Coleridge’s
fragmentary ideal you have painted your own portrait.”</p>
<p>“No, sir. Look again. My ‘Melancholia’ has a patient
face, hinting of possible peace. When I design its companion,
‘Desolation,’ I may be pardoned if my canvas reflects what
always fronts it.”</p>
<p>“May I ask when you wrought out this extraordinary conception?”</p>
<p>“During the past month. The last touch was given this
morning, and the paint is not yet dry on that cluster of
purplish seaweed clinging to the base of the battlement. Last
night I dreamed that Coleridge stood looking over my shoulder
and while I worked he touched the sea, and it flushed a ruby
red brighter than laudanum; and then he leaned down,
and with a pencil wrote <i>Dele</i> across the fragment in his
Sibylline Leaves.’ To-day I tried the effect of the hint, but
the amber water mellows the woman’s features, and the ruby
light rendered them sullen and rigid.”</p>
<p>“Were I to judge from the <i>bizarre</i> themes that you select,
I should be tempted to fear that the wizard spell of opium
evoked some of these strangely beautiful creations of your
brush. What suggested this picture?”</p>
<p>“You merely wish to complete your diagnosis of my
psychological condition? If so, there is no reason why I
should hesitate to tell you that while I was playing one of
Chopin’s <i>Nocturnes</i> the significance of the Polish ‘<i>Zäl</i>’ perplexed
me. In striving to analyze it, Coleridge’s ‘Melancholy’
occurred to my mind, and teased and haunted me until
I wrought it out palpably. My work there means more than
his fragment, and includes something which I suppose Chopin
meant by that insynonymous word ‘<i>Zäl</i>.’”</p>
<p>Standing under the arch, with one hand holding back the
lace drapery, the other hanging nerveless at her side, she
looked as weird as any of her ideal creations; and, in the
greenish seashine breaking through the dense foliage of the
trees about the house, her wan face, snowy muslin dress, and
floating white ribbons, seemed unsubstantial as the figures on
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_186"></a>186</span>
the wall. To-day there was no spot of color in face or dress,
save the azure gleam of the large, brilliant ring, on her uplifted
hand; and, as Dr. Grey scrutinized her appearance, he
found it difficult to realize that blood pulsed in that marble
flesh, and warm breath fluttered in that firm, frigid mouth.
Glancing around the rooms, he said,—</p>
<p>“Solitude is indeed a misnomer for a home peopled with
such creations as adorn these walls.”</p>
<p>“No. Have you forgotten the definition of Epictetus?
‘<i>To be friendless is solitude.</i>’”</p>
<p>“I hope, madam, that you may never find yourself in that
unfortunate category, and certainly there are—”</p>
<p>“Sir, I know what Michael Angelo felt when he wrote from
Rome, ‘I have no friends; I need none.’”</p>
<p>She interrupted him with an indescribably haughty gesture,
and an anomalous spasm of the lips that belonged to no
known class of smiles.</p>
<p>“On the contrary, Mrs. Gerome, the hunger for true friends
has rendered you morose and cynical.”</p>
<p>He did not shrink from the wide eyes that flashed like
blue steel in moonshine; and as his own, calm, steady, and
magnetic, dwelt gravely on her face, he fancied she winced,
slightly.</p>
<p>“No, sir. When I hunt or recognize friends, I shall
borrow Diogenes’ lantern. Good morning, Dr. Grey.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me if I detain you for a moment to inquire who
taught you to paint.”</p>
<p>“The absolute necessity of self-forgetfulness.”</p>
<p>“But you surely had some tuition in the art?”</p>
<p>“Yes; I had the usual boarding-school privilege of a
master for perspective, and pastel. Dr. Grey, have you been
to Europe?”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam; on several occasions.”</p>
<p>“You visited Dresden?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“Step forward a little,—there. Now, sir, do you know
that painting hanging over my <i>escritoire</i>?”</p>
<p>“It is Ruysdael’s ‘Churchyard,’ and, from this distance,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_187"></a>187</span>
seems a remarkably fine copy of that sombre, desolate, ghoul-haunted
picture.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. That is the only piece of work of which I
feel really proud. Some day, when the light is pure and
strong, come in and examine it. Now there is a greenish
tinge over all things in the room thrown by sea-shimmer
through the clustering leaves. Ah, what a long, low, presageful
moan that was, which broke from foaming lips, on
yonder strand!”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Gerome. The inspection of your
pictures has yielded me so much pleasure that I must tender
you my very sincere thanks for your courtesy.”</p>
<p>She bowed distantly; and, when he reached his buggy, he
glanced back and saw that perfect, pallid face, pressed against
the cedar facing of the oriel, looking seaward. He lifted his
hat, but she did not observe the salute; and, as he drove away,
she kept her eyes upon the murmuring waves, and repeated,
as was her habit, the lines that chanced to present themselves,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Listen! you hear the solemn roar<br>
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,<br>
With tremulous cadence, slow, and bring<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Miss Dexter, where is Muriel?” asked Dr. Grey,
glancing around the library, where the governess sat sewing,
while Salome read aloud a passage in Ariosto.</p>
<p>“She is not very well, and went up stairs, two hours ago,
to rest. Do you wish to see her immediately?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Call her down.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_188"></a>188</span></div>
<p>When the teacher left the room, Dr. Grey approached the
table where Salome sat, and looked over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“I went to the Asylum to-day, and found little Jessie
very well, but quite dissatisfied because you visit her so rarely.
You should see her as often as possible, since she is so dependent
upon you for sympathy and affection.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Miss Dexter gives a flattering report of your aptitude for
acquiring languages, and assures me that you will soon speak
Italian fluently.”</p>
<p>“Miss Dexter doubtless believes that praise of a pupil
reflects credit on the skill of the teacher. Unfortunately for
her flattering estimate of me, I must disclaim all polyglot
proclivities, and have no intention of eclipsing Mezzofanti,
Max Muller, or Giovanni Pico Mirandola. I needed, for a
special purpose, a limited acquaintance with Italian; and, as I
have attained what I desired, I shall not trouble myself much
longer with dictionaries and grammars.”</p>
<p>“And that special purpose—”</p>
<p>“Concerns nobody else, consequently I keep it to myself.”</p>
<p>He turned from her and advanced to meet his ward, who
came rapidly forward, holding out both hands.</p>
<p>“Doctor, where have you been all day? I did not see
you at breakfast or dinner, and it seems quite an age since
yesterday afternoon. You see I am moping, horribly.”</p>
<p>“My dear child, I see you are looking pale and weary, which
is overt and unpardonable treason. I sent for you to ask if
it would be agreeable to you to walk, or drive with me.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,—either or both.”</p>
<p>She had placed her hands in his, and stood looking up
joyfully into his quiet countenance.</p>
<p>“Get your hat, while I order my buggy brought to the
door.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my dear doctor. The very thing I longed
for, as I noticed you riding up the avenue. I never saw
you on horseback until to-day. It is a delightful evening
for a drive.”</p>
<p>She gaily swung his hands, like a gratified child, and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_189"></a>189</span>
started off for her hat, but, ere she crossed the threshold,
turned back, and, walking up to her guardian, laid her arm on
his shoulder and whispered something.</p>
<p>He laughed, and put his hand under her chin, saying, as he
did so,—</p>
<p>“Little witch! How did you know it?”</p>
<p>Her reply was audible only to the ears for which it was
framed, and she darted away, evidently much happier than
she had seemed for many days.</p>
<p>While awaiting her return, Dr. Grey picked up her sketch-book,
and was examining the contents, when Salome rose and
hurried towards the door. As she passed him, his back was
turned, and her muslin dress swept within reach of his spur,
which caught the delicate fabric. She impatiently jerked
the dress to disengage it, but it clung to the steel points, and
a long rent was made in the muslin. With a half-smothered
ejaculation, she tried to wrench herself free, but the dress
only tore across the breadth from seam to seam. Dr. Grey
turned, and stooped to assist her.</p>
<p>“Wait an instant, Salome; you have almost ruined your
dress.”</p>
<p>He was endeavoring to disentangle the shreds from the
jagged edge of the spur, but she bent down, and, seizing the
skirt in both hands, tore it away, leaving a large fragment
trailing from the boot-heel.</p>
<p>“‘More haste, less speed.’ Patience is better than petulance,
my young friend.”</p>
<p>His grave, reproving voice, rendered her defiant; and, with
a forced, unnatural laugh, she bowed, and hurried away,
saying, as she looked over her shoulder,—</p>
<p>“And spurs than persuasion? You mistake my nature.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey had been riding, all the morning, across a broken
stretch of country, where the roads were exceedingly insecure,
and, as he removed the troublesome spur and laid it on the
mantelpiece, he folded up the strip of muslin and put it into
his pocket.</p>
<p>“I am waiting for you,” cried Muriel, from the hall door.</p>
<p>He sighed, and went to his buggy; but the cloud did not
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_190"></a>190</span>
melt from his brow, for, as he drove off, he noticed Salome’s
gleaming eyes peering from the window of her room; and
pity and pain mingled in the emotions with which he recalled
his sister’s warning words.</p>
<p>“Muriel, here is your letter, and, better still, Gerard will
be with us to-morrow. Diplomatic affairs brought him
temporarily to Washington, and he will spend next week with
us. I cordially congratulate you, my dear child, and hastened
home to bring you the good news, which I felt assured you
would prefer to receive without witnesses.”</p>
<p>Muriel’s blushing face was bent over her letter; but she
put her hand on her guardian’s, and pressed it vigorously.</p>
<p>“A thousand thanks for all your goodness! Gerard writes
that it was through your influence he was enabled to visit
Washington; and, indeed, dear Dr. Grey, we are both very
grateful for your kind interest in our happiness. Even poor
papa could not be more considerate.”</p>
<p>“For several days past I have observed that you were
unusually depressed, and that Miss Dexter looked constrained.
Are you not pleasantly situated in my sister’s house. Do not
hesitate to speak frankly.”</p>
<p>Muriel’s eyes filled with tears, and she answered, evasively,—</p>
<p>“Miss Jane is very kind and affectionate.”</p>
<p>“Which means that Salome is not.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, why does she dislike me so seriously? I have
tried to be friendly and cordial towards her; but she constantly
repels me. I really admire her very much; but I am
afraid she positively hates me.”</p>
<p>“No, that is impossible; but she is a very peculiar, and, I
am sorry to be forced to say, an unamiable girl, and is
governed by every idle caprice. I hope that you will not
allow yourself to be annoyed by any want of courtesy which
she may unfortunately have displayed. Although a member
of the household, Salome has no right to dispense or to withhold
the hospitalities of my sister’s home, or to insult her
guests; and I trust that her individual whims will have no
effect whatever upon you, unless they create a feeling of compassion
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_191"></a>191</span>
and toleration in your kind heart. She has some
good traits hidden under her <i>brusquerie</i>, and when you know
her better you will excuse her rudeness.”</p>
<p>“Why is she so moody? I have not seen a pleasant smile
on her face since I came here.”</p>
<p>“My dear child, let us select some more agreeable topic
for discussion. Gerard will probably arrive on the early
train, which will enable him to breakfast with us to-morrow.
He will endeavor to persuade you to return at once to
Europe; but I must tell you, in advance of his proposal, that
I hope you will not yield to his wishes, since it would grieve
me to part with you so soon.”</p>
<p>Muriel turned aside her head to avoid her guardian’s penetrating
gaze, and silently listened to his counsel concerning
the course she should pursue towards her betrothed.</p>
<p>For a year they had been affianced without the knowledge
of her father, from whom she had been separated; but the
frankness with which both had discussed the matter with Dr.
Grey forbade the possibility of his withholding his approbation
of the engagement; though he assured them he could
not consent to its speedy consummation, as Muriel was too
young and childish to appreciate the grave responsibility of
such a step. Gerard Granville was several years older than
his betrothed, and Dr. Grey had been astonished at his
choice; but a long and intimate acquaintance led him to esteem
the young man so highly, that, while he felt that Muriel
was far inferior, he strove to stimulate her ambition, and
hoped she would one day be fully worthy of him.</p>
<p>To-day Dr. Grey drove for an hour through quiet, unfrequented
country roads; and finally, when Muriel expressed
herself anxious to catch a glimpse of the sea and a breath
of its brine, he turned into a narrow track that led down to
some fishermen’s huts on the beach.</p>
<p>While they paused on the edge of the low, yellow strand,
and inhaled the fresh ocean air, Dr. Grey grew silent, and
his companion fell into a blissful reverie relative to to-morrow’s
events. Suddenly he placed his hand on her arm,
and said, “Listen! What a wonderfully sweet, flexible voice!
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_192"></a>192</span>
Surely, fishermen’s wives are not singing Mendelssohn’s compositions?
Did you hear that gush of melody? It comes not
from that house, but seems floating from the opposite direction.
Such strains almost revive one’s faith in the Hindoo
<i>Gandharvas</i>,—musical genii, filling the air with ravishing
sounds. There! is it not exquisite? Hold these reins while
I ascertain who owns that marvellous voice.”</p>
<p>Eager and curious as a boy, he sprang from the buggy,
and, following the bend of the beach, passed two small
deserted huts, and plunged into a grove of stunted trees,
whence issued the sound that attracted his attention. Ere
he had proceeded many yards he saw a woman sitting on a
bank of sand and oyster-shells, and singing from an open
sheet of music, while she made rapid gestures with one hand.
Her face was turned from him, but, as he cautiously approached,
the <i>pose</i> of the figure, the noble contour of the head
and neck, and a certain muslin dress which matched the strip
in his pocket, made his heart beat violently. Intent only on
solving the mystery, he stepped softly towards her; but just
then a brace of plover started up at his feet, and, as they
whirred away, the woman turned her head, and he found
himself face to face with his musician.</p>
<p>“Salome!”</p>
<p>“Well, Dr. Grey.”</p>
<p>She had risen, and a beautiful glow overspread her cheeks,
as she met his eyes.</p>
<p>“What brings you to this lonely spot, three miles from
home, when the sun has already gone down?”</p>
<p>“Have I not as unquestionable a right to walk alone to
the seaside as you to drive your ward whithersoever you list?
Poverty, as well as wealth, sometimes makes people strangely
independent. What have you done with Miss Muriel Manton?”</p>
<p>There was such a sparkle in her eyes, such a bright flush
on her polished cheeks and parted lips, that Dr. Grey wondered
at her beauty, which had never before impressed him
as so extraordinary.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_193"></a>193</span></div>
<p>“Salome, why have you concealed your musical gift from
me? Who taught you to sing?”</p>
<p>“I am teaching myself, with such poor aid as I can obtain
from that miserable vagabond, Barilli, who is generally
intoxicated three days out of every six. Did you expect to
find Heine’s yellow-haired Loreley, or a treacherous Ligeia,
sitting on a rock, wooing passers-by to speedy destruction?”</p>
<p>“I certainly did not expect to meet my friend Salome alone
at this hour and place. Child, do not trifle with me,—be
truthful. Did you come here to meet any one?”</p>
<p>“One never knows what may or may not happen. I came
here to practise my music lesson, <i>sans</i> auditors, and I meet
Dr. Grey,—the last person I expected or desired to see.”</p>
<p>He came a step nearer, and put his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Salome, you distress and perplex me. My child, are you
better or worse than I think you?”</p>
<p>She lifted her slender hand and laid it lightly on his, which
still rested upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>“I am both,—better and worse. Better in aim than you
believe; worse in execution than you could realize, even if I
confessed all, which I have not the slightest intention of
doing. Ah, Dr. Grey, if you read me thoroughly, you would
not be surprised, or consider it presumptuous that I sometimes
think I am that anomalous creature, whom Balzac defined
as ‘Angel through love, demon through fantasy, child
through faith, sage through experience, man through the
brain, woman through the heart, giant through hope, and
poet through dreams.’”</p>
<p>As Dr. Grey looked down into the splendid eyes, softened
and magnified by a crystal veil of unshed tears, he sighed,
and answered,—</p>
<p>“You are, indeed, a bundle of contradictions. Why have
you so sedulously concealed the existence of your fine voice,
which the majority of girls would have been eager to exhibit?”</p>
<p>“It was not lack of vanity, but excess, that prompted me
to keep you in ignorance, until I could astonish you by its
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_194"></a>194</span>
perfection. You have anticipated me only by a few days,
and I intended singing for you next week.”</p>
<p>“It is not prudent for you to venture so far from home,
especially at this hour.”</p>
<p>“We paupers are not so fastidious as our lucky superiors,
and cannot afford timid airs, and affectation of extreme
nervousness. Having no escort, and expecting none, I walk
alone in any direction I choose, with what fearlessness and
contentment I find myself able to command.”</p>
<p>“It will be dark before you can reach the public road.”</p>
<p>“No, sir; there is a young moon swinging above the tree-tops,
to light me on my lonesome ramble; and I come here so
often that even the rabbits and whippoorwills know me.
Where is Miss Muriel?”</p>
<p>“Waiting in the buggy, on the beach. I must go back to
her.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Pray do not delay an instant, or she will imagine
that some dire calamity has befallen her knight, who, in
hunting a siren, encountered Scylla or Charybdis. Good
evening, Dr. Grey.”</p>
<p>“I am unwilling to leave you here so unprotected. Come
and ride with Muriel, and I will walk beside the buggy. My
horse is so gentle that a child can guide him.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Not for a ten-acre lot in Mohammed’s
Paradise would I mar Miss Muriel’s happiness, or punish
myself by a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her. It would be positively ‘discourteous’
in me to accept your proposal; and, moreover, I
abhor division,—<i>tout ou rien</i>.”</p>
<p>“Wilful, silly child! It is not proper for you to wander
along that dreary road in the dark. Come with me.”</p>
<p>“Not I. Make yourself easy by recollecting that ‘naught
is never in danger.’ See yonder in the west,—</p>

<p class="cg">‘Where, lo! above the sandy sunset rose<br>

<p>She laughed lightly, derisively, and collected the sheets of
music scattered on the bank.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_195"></a>195</span></div>
<p>Silently Dr. Grey returned to his ward, who exclaimed, at
sight of him,—</p>
<p>“I am glad to see you again, for you stayed so long I was
growing frightened. Did you find the singer?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What is the matter? You look troubled and solemn.”</p>
<p>“I am merely annoyed by circumstances beyond my <ins title="Added quote">control.”</ins></p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, who was that sweet singer?”</p>
<p>“Salome Owen.”</p>
<p>“How can such a thing be possible, when I have never
heard a note from her lips? You told me she had no musical
talent.”</p>
<p>“I was not aware that she sang at all, until this afternoon,
and your surprise does not equal mine.”</p>
<p>“Where did you find her?”</p>
<p>“Sitting on a mound of sand, singing to the sea.”</p>
<p>“Who is with her?”</p>
<p>“No one. I requested her to come with us, and offered to
walk beside my buggy; but she declined. Please be so considerate
as to say nothing about this occurrence, when you
reach home; because animadversion only hardens that poor
girl in her whimsical ways. Now we will dismiss the matter.”</p>
<p>Muriel endeavored to render herself an agreeable companion
during the remainder of the drive; but her guardian,
despite his efforts to become interested in her conversation,
was evidently <i>distrait</i>, and both felt relieved when they
reached Grassmere, where Miss Jane and the governess welcomed
their return.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey dismissed his buggy and entered the hall; but
passed through the house, and, crossing the orchard, followed
the road leading seaward.</p>
<p>Only a few summer stars were sprinkling their silvery rays
over the gray gloom of twilight, and the shining crescent in
the violet west had slipped down behind the silent hills that
girded the rough, winding road.</p>
<p>When Salome put her fingers on the gloved hand which,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_196"></a>196</span>
in the surprise of their unexpected meeting, Dr. Grey had
involuntarily placed on her shoulder, she had felt that he
shrank instantly from her touch, and withdrew his hand
hastily, as if displeased with the familiarity of the action.
All the turbid elements in her nature boiled up. Could it
be possible that he really loved his rosy-faced, bright-eyed,
prattling ward? She set this conjecture squarely before her,
and forced herself to contemplate it. If he desired to marry
Muriel, of course he would do so whenever he chose, and the
thought that he might call her his wife, and give her his
name, his caresses, wrung a cry of agony from Salome’s lips.
She threw herself on the sand-bank, and, resting her chin on
her folded arms, gazed vacantly across the yellow strand at
the glassy, leaden sea that stared back mockingly at her.</p>
<p>She was too miserable to feel afraid of anything but Dr.
Grey’s marriage; and, moreover, she had so often, during the
early years of her life, gone to and fro in the darkness, that
she was a stranger to that timidity which girls usually indulge
under similar circumstances. The fishermen had
abandoned the neighboring huts some months before, and
“Solitude,” one mile distant, was the nearest spot occupied
by human beings.</p>
<p>She neither realized nor cared that it was growing darker,
and, after awhile, when the sea was no longer visible through
the dun haze that brooded over it, she shut her eyes and
moaned.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey had walked on, hoping every moment to meet her
returning home; and, more than once, he was tempted to
retrace his steps, thinking that she might have taken some
direct path across the hills, instead of the circuitous one
bending around their base. Quickening his pace till it
matched his pulse, which an indefinable anxiety accelerated,
he finally saw the huts dimly outlined against the starry sky
and quiet sea.</p>
<p>Pausing, he took off his hat to listen to</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg"><span class="indent10"> </span>“The water lapping on the crag,<br>
And the long ripple washing in the reeds,”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_197"></a>197</span></div>
<p>and, while he stood wiping his brow, there came across the
beach,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,<br>
And, as it were one voice, an agony<br>
Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills<br>
All night in a waste land, where no one comes,<br>
Or hath come since the making of the world.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In the uncertain light he ran towards the clump of trees
where he had left Salome, and strained his eyes to discover
some moving thing. He knew that he must be very near the
spot, but neither the expected sound nor object greeted him,
and, while he stopped and held his breath to listen, the
silence was profound and death-like. He was opening his
lips to call the girl’s name, when he fancied he saw something
move slightly, and simultaneously a human voice smote
the oppressive stillness. She was very near him, and he heard
her saying to herself, with mournful emphasis,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Have I brought Joy, and slain her at his feet?<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Have I brought Peace, for his cold kiss to kill?<br>
Have I brought youth, crowned with wild-flowers sweet,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>With sandals dewy from a morning hill,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>For his gray, solemn eyes, to fright and chill?<br>
Have I brought Scorn the pale, and Hope the fleet,<br>
And First Love, in her lily winding-sheet,—<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>And is he pitiless still?”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Dr. Grey knew now that she was not crying. Her hard,
ringing, bitter tone, forbade all thought of sobs or tears; but
his heart ached as he listened, and surmised the application
she was making of the melancholy lines.</p>
<p>Unwilling that she should know he had overheard her, he
waited a moment, then raised his voice and shouted,—</p>
<p>“Salome! Salome! Where are you?”</p>
<p>There was no answer, and, fearing that she might elude
him, he stretched out his arms, and advanced to the spot,
which he felt assured was only a few yards distant.</p>
<p>She had risen, and, standing in the gloom of the coming
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_198"></a>198</span>
night, deepened by the interlacing boughs above her, she felt
Dr. Grey’s hand on her dress, then on her head, where the
moisture hung heavily in her thick hair.</p>
<p>“Salome, why do you not answer me?”</p>
<p>Shame kept her silent.</p>
<p>He passed his hand over her hot face, then groped for her
fingers, which he grasped firmly in his.</p>
<p>“Come home with your best friend.”</p>
<p>He knew that she was in no mood to submit to reprimand,
to appreciate argument, or even to listen to entreaty, and
that he might as profitably undertake to knead pig-iron as
expostulate with her at this juncture.</p>
<p>For a mile they walked on without uttering a word; then
he felt the fingers relax, twitch, and twine closely around his
own.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, where is Muriel? Where is your buggy?”</p>
<p>“Both are at home, where others should have been, long
ago.”</p>
<p>“You walked back to meet me?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“How did you find me, in the dark?”</p>
<p>“I heard your voice.”</p>
<p>“But not the words?”</p>
<p>“Why? Are you ashamed for me to hear what any strolling
stranger, any unscrupulous vagabond, might have listened
to?”</p>
<p>“It is such a desolate, lonely place, I thought no one would
stumble upon me, and I have been there so often without
meeting a living thing except the crabs and plover.”</p>
<p>“You are no longer a child, and such rashness is altogether
unpardonable. What do you suppose my sister would think
of your imprudent obstinacy?”</p>
<p>They walked another mile, and again Salome convulsively
pressed the cool, steady, strong hand, in which hers lay hot
and quivering.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, tell me the truth,—don’t torture me.”</p>
<p>“What shall I tell you? You torture yourself.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear what I was saying to my own heart?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_199"></a>199</span></div>
<p>“I heard you repeating some lines which certainly should
possess no relevancy for the real feeling of my young friend.”</p>
<p>She snatched her fingers from his, and he knew she covered
her face with them.</p>
<p>They reached the gate at the end of the avenue, and Salome
stopped suddenly, as the lights from the front windows flashed
out on the lawn.</p>
<p>“Go in, and leave me.”</p>
<p>She threw herself on the sward, under one of the elm-trees,
and leaned her head against its trunk.</p>
<p>“I shall do no such thing, unless you desire the entire
household to comment upon your reckless conduct.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Dr. Grey, I care little now what the whole world
thinks or says! Let me be quiet, or I shall go mad.”</p>
<p>“No; come into the house, and sing something to compensate
me for the anxiety and fatigue you have cost me. I
do not often ask a favor of you, and certainly in this instance
you will not refuse to grant my request.”</p>
<p>She did not reply, and he bent down and softly stroked
the hair that was damp with dew and sea-fog.</p>
<p>The long-pent storm broke in convulsive sobs, and she
trembled from head to foot, while tears poured over her
burning cheeks.</p>
<p>“Poor child! Can you not confide in me?”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, will you forget all that has passed to-day?
Will you try never to think of it again?”</p>
<p>“On condition that you never repeat the offence.”</p>
<p>“You do not despise me?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You pity me?”</p>
<p>“I pity any human being who is so unfortunate as to
possess your wilful, perverse, passionate disposition. Unless
you overcome this dangerous tendency of character, you may
expect only wretchedness and humiliation in coming years.
I am sincerely sorry for you, but I tell you unhesitatingly,
that I find it difficult to tolerate your grave and obtrusive
faults.”</p>
<p>She raised her clasped hands, and said, brokenly,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_200"></a>200</span></div>
<p>“This is the last time I shall ever ask you to forgive me.
Will you?”</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“As</ins> freely and fully as a grieved brother ever forgave a
wayward sister.”</p>
<p>He took the folded hands, lifted her from the grass, and
led her to a side door opening upon the east gallery.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, give me one kind word before I go.”</p>
<p>The lamp-light from the hall shone full on his pale face,
which was sterner than she had ever seen it, as he forcibly
withdrew his hands from her tight clasp, and, putting her
away from him, said, very coldly,—</p>
<p>“I exhausted my store of kind thoughts and words when I
called you my sister.”</p>
<p>He saw that she understood him, for she tried to hide her
face, but a spasm passed over it, and she would have fallen
had he not caught her in his arms and carried her up to her
own room.</p>
<p>Stanley was asleep with his head pillowed on his open
geography, but the candle burned beside him, and Dr. Grey
placed Salome on a lounge near the window, and sprinkled
her face with water.</p>
<p>Kneeling by the low couch, he rubbed her hands vigorously
with some cologne he found on her bureau; and, watching
her pale, beautiful features, his heart swelled with compassion,
and his calm eyes grew misty. Consciousness very soon
returned, and when she saw the noble, sorrowful countenance,
bent anxiously over her, she covered her face with her hands
and moaned rather than spoke,—</p>
<p>“I can’t endure your pity. Leave me with my self-contempt
and degradation.”</p>
<p>“My little sister, I leave you in God’s merciful hands, and
trust you to the guidance of your womanly pride and self-respect.
Good-night. We will not engrave this unfortunate
day on our tablets, but forget its record, save one fact, that
for all time it makes me your brother; and, Salome,—</p>

<p class="cg">“‘So we’ll not dream, nor look back, dear,<br>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Dr. Grey, who is that beautiful girl to whom Muriel introduced
me this morning? I was so absorbed in admiration
of her face that I lost her name.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Mr. Gerard Granville struck the ashes from
his cigar, and walked up to the table where Dr. Grey was
sealing some letters.</p>
<p>“Her name is Salome Owen, and she is my sister’s adopted
child.”</p>
<p>“What is her age, if I may be pardoned such impertinent
queries?”</p>
<p>“I believe she has entered her eighteenth year.”</p>
<p>“She is a regal beauty, and shows proud blood as plainly
as any princess.”</p>
<p>“Take care, Granville; imagination has cantered away
with your penetration. Salome’s family were coarse and
common, though doubtless honest people. Her father was a
drunken miller, who died in an attack of delirium tremens,
and left his children as a legacy to the county. I merely
mention these deplorable facts to show you that your boasted
penetration is not entirely infallible.”</p>
<p>“Miller or millionaire,—the girl would grace any court in
Europe, and only lacks a dash of <i>aplomb</i> to make her irresistible.
I have seen few faces that attracted and interested
me so powerfully.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she certainly is very handsome; but I do not agree
with you in thinking that she lacks <i>aplomb</i>. Granville, if
you have finished your cigar, we will adjourn to the parlor,
where the ladies are taking their tea.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey collected his letters and walked away, followed
by his guest; and, a moment after, a low, scornful laugh,
floated in through the window which opened on the little
flower-garden.</p>
<p>Miss Jane had requested Salome to gather the seeds of some
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_202"></a>202</span>
apple and nutmeg geraniums that were arranged on a shelf
near the western window of the library; and, while stooping
over the china jars, and screened from observation by a
spreading lilac-bush, the girl had heard the conversation relative
to herself.</p>
<p>Excessive vanity had never been numbered among the
faults that marred her character, but Dr. Grey’s indifference to
personal attractions, which strangers admitted so readily,
piqued, and thoroughly aroused a feeling that was destined
to bring countless errors and misfortunes in its train; and,
henceforth,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“There was not a high thing out of heaven,<br>
Her pride o’ermastereth not.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Hitherto the love of one man had been the only boon she
craved of heaven; but now, conscious that the darling hope
of her life was crushed and withering under Dr. Grey’s
relentless feet, she resolved that the admiration of the world
should feed her insatiable hunger,—a maddening hunger
which one tender word from his true lips would have assuaged,—but
which she began to realize he would never utter.</p>
<p>During the last eighteen hours, a mournful change had
taken place in her heart, where womanly tenderness was
rapidly retreating before unwomanly hate, bitterness, and
blasphemous defiance; and she laughed scornfully at the
“idiocy” that led her to weary heaven with prayers for the
preservation of a life that must ever run as an asymptote to
her own. How earnestly she now lamented an escape, for
which she had formerly exhausted language in expressing
her gratitude; and how much better it would have been if
she could mourn him as dead, instead of jealously watching
him,—living without a thought of her.</p>
<p>All the girlish sweetness and freshness of her nature
passed away, and an intolerable weariness and disappointment
usurped its place. Since her acquaintance with Dr. Grey, he
had been her sole <i>Melek Taous</i>, adored with Yezidi fervor;
but to-day she overturned, and strove to revile and desecrate
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_203"></a>203</span>
the idol, to whose vacant pedestal she lifted a colossal vanity.
Her bruised, numb heart, seemed incapable of loving any one,
or anything, and a hatred and contempt of her race took
possession of her.</p>
<p>The changing hues of Muriel’s tell-tale face when Mr.
Granville arrived, and the excessive happiness that could not
be masked, had not escaped Salome’s lynx vision; and very
accurately she conjectured the real condition of affairs, relative
to which Dr. Grey had never uttered a syllable. Bent
upon mischief, she had, malice prepense, dressed herself
with unusual care, and arranged her hair in a new style of
coiffure, which proved very becoming.</p>
<p>Now, as the hum of conversation mingled with the sound
of Muriel’s low, soft laugh, reached her from the parlor, her
chatoyant eyes kindled, and she hastily went in to join the
merry circle.</p>
<p>“Come here, child, and sit by me,” said Miss Jane, making
room on the sofa, as her <i>protégée</i> entered.</p>
<p>“Thank you, I prefer a seat near the window.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey sat in a large chair in the centre of the floor, with
Muriel on an ottoman close to him, and Mr. Granville leaned
over the back of the chair, while Miss Dexter shared Miss
Jane’s old-fashioned ample sofa. In full view of the whole
party, Salome seated herself at a little distance, and, with
admirably assumed nonchalance, began to enclose and sew
up the geranium-seeds, in some pretty, colored paper bags,
prepared for the purpose.</p>
<p>After a few minutes Mr. Granville sauntered across the
room, looked at the cuckoo clock, and finally went over to
the window, where he leaned against the facing and watched
Salome’s slender white fingers.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a delicate muslin, striped with narrow
pink lines, and flounced at the bottom of the skirt, and wore
a ribbon sash of the same color; while in the broad braids
of hair raised high on her head, she had fastened a superb
half-blown Baron Provost rose, just where two long glossy
curls crept down. The puffed sleeves, scarcely reaching the
elbows, displayed the finely rounded white arms, and the exactness
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_204"></a>204</span>
with which the airy muslin fitted her form, showed its
symmetrical outline to the greatest advantage.</p>
<p>Muriel touched her guardian, and whispered,—</p>
<p>“Did you ever see Salome look so beautiful? Her coiffure
to-night is almost Parisian, and how very becoming!”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey was studying the innocent, happy countenance of
his unsuspecting ward, and he could not repress a sigh, when,
turning his eyes towards Salome, he noticed the undisguised
admiration in Mr. Granville’s earnest gaze.</p>
<p>A nameless dread made him take Muriel’s hand and lead
her to the piano.</p>
<p>“Play something for me. I am music-hungry.”</p>
<p>“Is Saul sad to-night?” she asked, smiling up at him.</p>
<p>“A little fatigued and perplexed, and anxious to have his
cares exorcised by the magic of your fingers.”</p>
<p>With womanly tact she selected a <i>fantasia</i> which Mr. Granville
had often pronounced the gem of her <i>repertoire</i>, and
momentarily expected to hear his whispered thanks; but page
after page was turned, and still her lover did not approach
the piano, where Dr. Grey stood with folded arms and
slightly contracted brows. Muriel played brilliantly, and
was pardonably proud of her proficiency, which Mr. Granville
had confessed first attracted his attention; and to-night, when
the piece was concluded and she commenced a <i>Polonaise</i>, she
looked over her shoulder hoping to meet a grateful, fond
glance. But his eyes were riveted on the fair rosy face at
his side, and his betrothed bit her pouting lip and made sundry
blunders.</p>
<p>As she rose from the piano-stool, Mr. Granville exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Miss Muriel, you love music so well that I trust you will
add your persuasions to mine, and induce Miss Owen to
sing for us, as she declares she is comparatively a tyro in
instrumental music, and would not venture to perform in
your presence.”</p>
<p>“She has never sung for me, but I hope she will not refuse
your request. Salome, will you not oblige us?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_205"></a>205</span></div>
<p>Muriel’s eyes were dim with tears, but her sweet voice did
not falter.</p>
<p>“I was not aware that you sang at all,” said Miss Dexter,
looking up from a mat which she was crocheting.</p>
<p>“She has a fine voice, but is very obstinate in declining to
use it. Come, Salome, don’t be childish, dear. Sing something,”
coaxed Miss Jane.</p>
<p>The girl waited a few seconds, hoping that another voice
would swell the general request, but the lips she loved best
were mute; and, suddenly tossing the paper bags from her
lap, she rose and moved proudly to the piano.</p>
<p>“Miss Manton, will you or Miss Dexter be so kind as to
play my accompaniment for me? I am neither Liszt, nor
Thalberg, and the vocal gymnastics are all that I can venture
to undertake.”</p>
<p>Muriel promptly resumed her seat before the instrument,
and played the symphony of an aria from “Favorite,” which
Salome placed on the piano-board. Barilli had assured her
that she rendered this fiery burst of rage and hatred as well
as he had ever heard it; and, folding her fingers tightly
around each other she drew herself up to her full height, and
sang it.</p>
<p>Mr. Granville leaned against the piano, and Dr. Grey was
standing in the recess of the window when the song began,
but ere long he moved forward unconsciously and paused,
with his hand on his ward’s shoulder and his eyes riveted in
astonishment on Salome’s countenance. She knew that the
approbation and delight of this small audience was worth all
the <i>encore</i> shouts of the millions who might possibly applaud
her in future years; and if ever a woman’s soul poured itself
out through her lips, all that was surging in Salome’s heart
became visible to the man who listened as if spell-bound.</p>
<p>Miss Jane grasped her crutches, and rose, leaning upon
them, while a look of mingled joy and wonder made her sallow
face eloquent; and Miss Dexter dropped her ivory needle,
and gazed in amazement at the singer. Muriel forgot her
chords,—turned partially around, and watched in breathless
surprise the marvelous execution of several difficult passages,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_206"></a>206</span>
where the rich voice seemed to linger while improvising
sparkling turns and trills that were strangely intricate, and
indescribably sweet.</p>
<p>As she approached the close of her song, Salome became
temporarily oblivious of pride, wounded vanity, and murdered
hopes,—forgot all but the man at her side, for whose commendation
she had toiled so patiently, and turning her
flushed, radiant face, toward him, her magnificent eyes aflame
with triumph looked appealingly up at his, and her hands
were extended till they rested on his arm.</p>
<p>So the song ended, and for a moment the parlor was still
as a tomb. Dr. Grey silently enclosed the girl’s two hands
in his, and, for the first time since she had known him, Salome
saw tears swimming in his grave, beautiful eyes, and noticed
a slight tremor on his usually steady lips.</p>
<p>“There is nothing in the old world or the new comparable
to that voice, and I flatter myself I speak <i>ex cathedra</i>. Miss
Owen, you will soon have the public at your feet.”</p>
<p>She did not heed Mr. Granville’s enthusiastic eulogy. She
saw nothing but Dr. Grey’s admiring eyes,—felt nothing but
the close warm clasp, in which her folded fingers lay,—and
her ears ached for the sound of his deep voice.</p>
<p>“Salome, I shall not soon forgive you for keeping me in
ignorance of the existence of the finest voice it has ever been
my good fortune to hear. Knowing your adopted brother’s
fondness for music, how could you hoard your treasure so
parsimoniously, denying him such happiness as you might
have conferred?”</p>
<p>He untwined her fingers, which clung tenaciously to his,
and saw that the blood ebbed out of cheeks and lips as she
listened to his carefully guarded language. Silently she
obeyed Miss Jane’s summons to the sofa.</p>
<p>“You perverse witch! Where have you been practising
all these months, that have made you such a wonderful cantatrice?
Child, answer me.”</p>
<p>“I did not wish to annoy the household by thrumming on
the piano and afflicting their ears with false flat scales, consequently
I followed the birds, and rehearsed with them, under
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_207"></a>207</span>
the trees, and down on the edge of the sea. If you like my
voice I am glad, because I have studied to perfect it.”</p>
<p>“Like it, indeed! As if I could avoid liking it! But you
must have had good training. Who taught you?”</p>
<p>“I took lessons from Barilli.”</p>
<p>“Aha,—Ulpian! Now you can understand how he contrives
to feed his family. Salome’s sewing-money explains
it all. Kiss me, dear. I always believed there was more in
you than came to the surface.”</p>
<p>“Miss Owen ought to go upon the stage. Such gifts as
hers belong to the public, who would soon crown her queen
of song.”</p>
<p>Salome glanced at the handsome stranger, and bowed.</p>
<p>“It is my purpose, sir, to dedicate myself and future to the
Opera, where I trust I shall not utterly fail, as I have been
for a year studying with reference to this step.”</p>
<p>A bomb-shell falling in that quiet circle, would scarcely
have startled its members more effectually; and, anxious to
avoid comment, Salome quitted the parlor and ran out on the
lawn.</p>
<p>After awhile she heard Muriel’s skilful touch on the piano,
and, when an hour had elapsed, the echo of voices died away,
and soon a profound silence seemed to reign over the house.</p>
<p>The hot blood was coursing thick and fast in her veins,
and evil purposes brooded darkly over her oppressed and
throbbing heart. She was thoroughly cognizant of the intense
admiration with which Mr. Granville regarded her, and
to-night she had compared his handsome face with the older,
graver, and less regular features of Dr. Grey, and wondered
why the latter was so much more fascinating. Her beauty
transcended Muriel’s, and it would prove an easy task to
supplant her in the affections of her not very ardent lover.
Life in Paris, spiced with the political intrigues incident to
diplomatic circles, would divert her thoughts, and might
possibly make the coming years endurable. Was the game
worth the candle? No thought of Muriel’s misery entered
for an instant into this entirely sordid calculation, or would
have deterred her even momentarily, had it presented itself
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_208"></a>208</span>
in expostulation. The girl’s heart had suddenly grown callous,
and her hand would have ruthlessly smitten down any
object that dared to cross her path, or retard the accomplishment
of her schemes. Weary at last of pacing the dim starlit
avenue, and yet too wretched to think of sleeping, she <ins title="Was re-ëntered">re-entered</ins>
the house, and cautiously locking the door, threw
herself into a corner of the parlor sofa, which stood just beneath
the portrait she so often studied.</p>
<p>If she had not at this juncture been completely absorbed
in gazing upon it, she might have seen the original, who soon
rose and came forward from the shadow of the curtains.</p>
<p>“Salome, I wish to make you my confidante,—to tell you
something which I have not yet mentioned even to Janet.
Can I trust you, little sister?”</p>
<p>Resting against the arm of the sofa, he looked intently into
her face, reading its perturbed lines.</p>
<p>“I presume you are amusing yourself by tantalizing my
curiosity, as your experiments appear to have thoroughly
satisfied you that I am utterly unworthy of trust. I follow
the flattering advice you were so kind as to give me some
time since, and make no promises, which shatter like crystal
under the hammer of the first temptation. You see, sir, you
are teaching me to be cautious.”</p>
<p>“You are teaching yourself lessons in dissimulation and
maliciousness, that you will heartily rue some day, but your
repentance will come too tardily to mend the mischief.”</p>
<p>She tried to screen her countenance, but he was in no
mood for trifling, and putting his palm under her chin, forced
her to submit to his scrutiny.</p>
<p>“Salome, if I did not cherish a strong faith in the latent
generosity of your soul, I would not come to you as I do
now to offer confidence, and demand it in return.”</p>
<p>She guessed his meaning, and her eyes glowed with all the
baleful light that he had hoped was extinguished forever.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey makes a grace of necessity, and a pretence of
confiding that which has ceased to be a secret. Is such his
boasted candor and honesty?”</p>
<p>“If I believed that you were already acquainted with what
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_209"></a>209</span>
I propose to divulge, I would not fritter away my time in
appealing to a nobility of feeling which that fact alone
would prove the hopelessness of my ever finding in you.”</p>
<p>He felt her face grow hot, and for an instant her eyes
drooped before his, stern and almost threatening.</p>
<p>“Well, sir; I wait for your confidential disclosures. Is
there a Guy Fawkes, or Titus Oates, plotting against the
peace and prosperity of the house of Grey?”</p>
<p>“Verily I am disposed to apprehend that there may be.”</p>
<p>She endeavored to wrench her face from his hand, but he
held it firmly, and continued,—</p>
<p>“I wish to say to you that Muriel is very sensitive, and I
hope that during Mr. Granville’s visit, you will try to be as
considerate and courteous as possible, to both. Salome,
Gerard Granville has asked Muriel to be his wife, and she has
promised to marry him at the expiration of a year.”</p>
<p>The girl laughed derisively, and exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Pray, Dr. Grey, be so good as to indulge me with your
motive in furnishing this piece of information?”</p>
<p>“Your astuteness forbids the possibility of any doubt with
reference to my motives,—which are, explicitly, anxiety for
Muriel’s happiness, and for the preservation of your integrity
and self-respect.”</p>
<p>“What jeopardizes either?”</p>
<p>“Your heartless, contemptible vanity, which tempts you to
demand a homage and incense that should be offered only
where it is due,—at another, and I grieve to add, a purer
shrine.”</p>
<p>“Ah! My unpardonable sin consists in having braided my
black locks, and made myself comely! If you will procure
an authentic portrait of the Witch of Endor, I will do proper
penance by likening my appearance thereunto. Poor little
rose! Can’t you open your pink lips and cry <i>peccavi</i>? Come
down, sole ally and accomplice of my heinous vanity, and
plead for me, and make the <i>amende honorable</i> to this grim
guardian of Miss Muriel’s peace!”</p>
<p>She snatched the drooping rose from her hair, and tossed
it at his feet.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_210"></a>210</span></div>
<p>“Salome, you forget yourself!”</p>
<p>His stern displeasure rendered her reckless, and she continued,—</p>
<p>“True, sir. I did forget that the poor miller’s child had
no right to obtrude her comeliness in the presence of the
banker’s daughter. I confess my ‘high crime and misdemeanor’
against the pet of fortune, and await my condign
punishment. Is it your sovereign will that I shear my shining
locks like royal Berenice, and offer them in propitiation?
Or, does it seem ‘good, meet, and your bounden duty,’ to
have me promptly inoculated with small-pox, for the destruction
of my skin, which is unjustifiably smoother and
clearer than—”</p>
<p>“Hush, hush!”</p>
<p>He laid his hand over her lips, and, for a while, there
was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>“If it were only possible to inoculate your heart with a
little genuine womanly charity,—if it were possible to persuade
you to adopt as your rule of conduct that golden one
which Christ gave as a patent of peace to all who followed
it. But it is futile, hopeless. You will not, you will not,—and
my fluttering dove is at the mercy of a famished eagle,
already poised to swoop. I ‘reckoned without my host’ when
I so confidently appealed to your magnanimity, to your
feminine integrity of soul. You are a ‘deaf adder that
stoppeth her ear.’”</p>
<p>“Which will not ‘hearken to the voice of the charmer,
charm he never so wisely.’ Dr. Grey, what has the pampered
heiress, the happy <i>fiancée</i> of that handsome man upstairs,
to fear from the poverty-stricken daughter of a miller, who
you conscientiously inform your guest passed from time to
eternity through the gate opened by delirium tremens. Mark
you, my ‘adder ears’ have not been sealed all the evening.”</p>
<p>She had taken his hand from her lips, and thrown it from
her.</p>
<p>“People who condescend to listen to conversations that are
not intended for them, generally deserve the punishment of
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_211"></a>211</span>
hearing unpleasant truths discussed. Salome, our interview
is at an end.”</p>
<p>“Not yet. Do you sincerely desire to see Muriel Mr.
Granville’s wife?”</p>
<p>“I do, because I know that she is strongly attached to
him.”</p>
<p>“And you are sufficiently generous to sacrifice your happiness,
in order to promote hers? Oh, marvellous magnanimity!”</p>
<p>“Your insinuation is beneath my notice.”</p>
<p>“How long have you known of her engagement?”</p>
<p>“Since the first interview I had with her, after her father’s
death.”</p>
<p>“Let me see your face, Dr. Grey. If truth has not been
hunted out of the earth, it took refuge in your eyes. There,
I am satisfied. You never loved her. I think I must have
been insane, or I would not have imagined it possible. No,
no; she never touched your heart, save with a feeling of
compassion. Don’t go, I want to say something to you. Sit
down, and let me think.”</p>
<p>She walked up and down the room for ten minutes, and,
with his face bowed on his hand, Dr. Grey watched and
waited.</p>
<p>Finally he stooped to pick up the crushed rose on the floor,
and then she came back and stood before him.</p>
<p>“I promise you I will not lay a straw in the path of
Muriel’s happiness, and it shall not be my fault if Mr. Granville
fails in a lover’s <i>devoir</i>. I was tempted to entice him
from his sworn allegiance. Why should I deny what you
know so well? But I will not, and when I give my word, it
shall go hard with me but I keep it; especially when you
hold the pledge. Are you satisfied? I know that you have
little cause to trust me, but I tell you, sir, when I deceive
you, then all heaven with its hierarchies of archangels can
not save me.”</p>
<p>After all, Ulpian Grey was only a man of flesh and blood,
and his heart was touched by the beauty of the young face,
and the mournful sweetness of the softened voice.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_212"></a>212</span></div>
<p>“Thank you, Salome. I accept your promise, and rely
upon it. As a pledge of your sincerity I shall retain this
rose, and return it to you when little Muriel is a happy wife.”</p>
<p>She clasped her hands, and looked at him with a mournful,
wistful expression, that puzzled him.</p>
<p>“My friend, my little sister, what is it? Tell me, and let
me help you to do your duty, for I see that you are wrestling
desperately with some great temptation.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, be merciful to me. Send me away. Oh, for
God’s sake, send me away!”</p>
<p>She had grown ghastly pale, and her whole face indexed
a depth of anguish and despair that baffled utterance.</p>
<p>“My dear child, where do you desire to go? If your wishes
are reasonable they shall be granted.”</p>
<p>“Will you persuade Miss Jane to take Jessie in my place,
and send me to France or Italy?”</p>
<p>“To study music with the intention of becoming a <i>prima
donna</i>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“My young friend, I cannot conscientiously advise a compliance
with wishes so fraught with danger to yourself.”</p>
<p>“You fear that my voice does not justify so expensive an
experiment?”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, I have not a doubt that your extraordinary
voice will lift you to the highest pinnacle of musical
celebrity; and, because your career on the stage promises to
prove so brilliant, I shudder in anticipating the temptations
that will unavoidably assail you.”</p>
<p>“You are afraid to trust me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my little sister; you are so impulsive, so prone to
hearken to evil dictates rather than good ones, that I dread
the <ins title="Was though">thought</ins> of seeing you launched into the dangerous career
you contemplate, without some surer, safer, more infallible
pilot than your proud, passionate heart. If you were homely,
and a dullard, I should entertain less apprehension about your
future.”</p>
<p>Her broad brow blackened with a frown that became a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_213"></a>213</span>
terrible scowl, and her eyes gleamed like lightning under the
edge of a thunderous summer cloud.</p>
<p>“What is it to you whether I live or die? The immaculate
soul of Ulpian Grey, M.D., will serenely wing its way up
through the stars, on and on to the great Gates of Pearl,—oblivious
of the beggar who, from the lowest Hades, where
she has fallen, eagerly watches his flight.”</p>
<p>“The anxious soul of Ulpian Grey will pray for yours, as
long as we remain on earth. Salome, I am the truest friend
you will ever find this side of the City of God; and, when I
see you plunging madly into ruin, I shall snatch you back,
cost me what it may. Your jeers and struggle have not
deterred me hitherto, nor shall they henceforth. You are as
incapable of guiding yourself aright, as a rudderless bark is
of stemming the gulf-stream in a south-west gale; and I am
afraid to trust you out of my sight.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand you; the good angel in your nature
pities the demon in mine. But your pity stifles me; I could
not endure it; and, besides, I cannot stay here any longer.
I must go out into the world, and seize the fortune that
people tell me my voice will certainly yield me.”</p>
<p>Flush and sparkle had died out of her face, which, in its
worn, haggard pallor, looked five years older than when she
entered the parlor, three hours before.</p>
<p>“Pecuniary considerations must not influence you, because,
while Janet and I live, you shall want nothing; and when
either dies, you will be liberally provided for. Dismiss from
your mind a matter that has long been decided, and which no
wish of yours can annul or alter.”</p>
<p>With an impatient wave of the hand, she answered,—</p>
<p>“Give to poor little Jessie and Stanley what was intended
for me. They are helpless, but I can take care of myself;
and, moreover, I am not contented here. I want to see
something of the world in which—<i>bon gré mal gré</i>—I find
myself. Let me go. Rousseau was a sage. ‘<i>Le monde est le
livre des femmes</i>.’”</p>
<p>He shook his head, and said, sorrowfully,—</p>
<p>“No, your instincts are unreliable; and if you roam away
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_214"></a>214</span>
from Jane and from me, you will sip more poison than
honey. Be wise, and remain where Providence has placed
you. I will bring Jessie here, and you shall teach her what
you choose, and <ins title="Original wording retained">Stanley can command all the educational advantages
he will improve</ins>. After a while, you shall, if you
prefer it, have a pleasant home of your own, and dwell there
with the two little ones. Such has long been my scheme and
purpose; but, during my sister’s life, she will never consent
to give you up; and you owe it to her not to desert her in the
closing years, when she most urgently requires the solace of
your love and society.”</p>
<p>Salome covered her face with her hands, and something
like a heavy dry sob shook her frame; but the spring of
bitterness seemed exhaustless, and her voice was indescribably
scornful in its defiant ring.</p>
<p>“You are very charitable, Dr. Grey, and I thank you for
all your embryonic benevolent plans for me and my pauper
relatives; but I have drawn a very different map for my
future years. You seem to regard this house as a second
‘<i>La Tour sans venin</i>,’ which, like its prototype near Grenoble,
possesses an atmosphere fatal to all poisonous, noxious
things; but surely you forget that it has long sheltered me.”</p>
<p>“No, it has never arrogated the prerogative of ‘<i>La Tour
sans venin</i>,’ but of one thing, my poor wilful child, you shall
never have reason to be skeptical,—that dear Jane and I will
indefatigably strive to serve you as faithfully and successfully,
as did in ancient days, the Psylli whom Plutarch immortalized.”</p>
<p>While he spoke Dr. Grey had been turning over the leaves
of the old family Bible, which happened to lie within his
reach; and now, without premonition, he read aloud the fifty-fifth
Psalm.</p>
<p>She listened, not willingly, but <i>ex necessitate rei</i>, and rebelliously;
and, when he finished the Psalm, and knelt, with his
face on his arms, which were crossed upon the back of a chair,
she stood haughtily erect and motionless beside him.</p>
<p>His prayer was brief and fervent, that God would aid her
in her efforts to curb her passionate temper, and to walk in
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_215"></a>215</span>
accordance with the teachings of Jesus; and that he would
especially overrule all things, and guide her decision in the
important step she contemplated. He rose, and turned towards
her, but her countenance was hidden.</p>
<p>“Good night, Salome. God bless you and direct you.”</p>
<p>She raised her face, and her eyes sought his with a long,
questioning, pleading gaze, so full of anguish that he could
scarcely endure it. Then he saw the last spark of hope expire;
and she bent her queenly head an instant, and silently
passed from the parlor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Pardon my intrusion, Mrs. Gerome, and ascribe it to
Elsie’s anxiety concerning your health. In compliance with
her request, I have come to ascertain whether you really
require my attention.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey placed his hat and gloves on the piano, and established
himself comfortably in a large chair near the arch,
where Mrs. Gerome, palette in hand, sat before her easel.</p>
<p>“Elsie’s nerves have run away with her sound common
sense, and filled her mind with vagaries. She imagines that
I need medicine, whereas I only require quiet and peace,
which neither she nor you will permit me to enjoy.”</p>
<p>She did not even glance at the visitor, but mixed some
colors rapidly, and deepened the rose-tints in a cluster of
apple-blossoms she was scattering in the foreground of a
picture.</p>
<p>“If it is not of vital importance that those pearly petals
should be finished immediately, I should be glad to have you
turn your face towards me for a few moments. There,—thank
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_216"></a>216</span>
you. Mrs. Gerome, do I look like a nervous, whimsical
man, whose fancy mastered his professional judgment, or
blunted his acumen?”</p>
<p>“You certainly appear as phlegmatic, as utterly unimaginative,
as any lager-loving German, whom Teniers or
Ostade ever painted ‘<i>Unter den linden</i>.’”</p>
<p>“Then my words should possess some influence when they
corroborate Elsie’s statement, that you are far from well.
Do not be childishly incredulous, and impatiently shake your
head; from a woman of your age and sense one expects more
dignity and prudence.”</p>
<p>“Sir, your rudeness has at least a flavor of stern honesty
that makes it almost palatable. Do you propose to take my
case into your skilful hands?”</p>
<p>“I merely propose to expostulate with you upon the unfortunate
and ruinous course of life you have decided to
pursue. No eremite of the Thebaid, or the Nitroon, is more
completely immured than I find you; and the seclusion from
society is quite as deleterious as the want of out-door air and
sunshine. Your mind, debarred from communion with your
race and denied novel and refreshing themes, centres in its
own operations and creations, broods over threadbare topics
until it has grown morbid; and, instead of deriving healthful
nourishment from the world that surrounds it, exhausts and
consumes itself, like fabled Araline, spinning its substance
into filmy nothings.”</p>
<p>“Filmy nothings! Thank you. I flatter myself, when I
am safely housed under marble, the world will place a different
estimate upon some things I shall leave behind to challenge
criticism.”</p>
<p>“How much value will public plaudits possess for ears
sealed by death? Mrs. Gerome, you are too lonely; you must
have companionship that will divert your thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Not I, indeed! All that I require, I have in abundance,—music,
books, and my art. Here I am independent, for remember
that he was a petted son of fame, who said, ‘Books
are the true Elysian fields, where the spirits of the dead
converse, and into these fields a mortal may venture unappalled.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_217"></a>217</span>
What king’s court can boast such company,—what
school of philosophy such wisdom?’ Verily if you had ever
examined my library you would not imagine I lacked companionship.
Why sir, yonder,—</p>

<p class="cg">‘The old, dead authors throng me round about,<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Count Oxenstiern spoke truly, when he declared, ‘Occupied
with the great minds of antiquity, we are no longer annoyed
by contemporaneous fools.’”</p>
<p>She rose and pointed to the handsome cases in the rear
room, filled with choice volumes; and, while she stood with
one arm resting on the easel, Dr. Grey looked searchingly at
her.</p>
<p>To-day there was a <i>spirituelle</i> beauty in the white face that
he had never seen before; and the large eloquent eyes were
full of dreamy sunset radiance, unlike their wonted steely
glitter. A change, vague and indefinable, but unmistakable,
had certainly passed over that countenance since its owner
came to reside at “Solitude,” and, instead of marring, had
heightened its loveliness. The features were thinner, the
cheeks had lost something of their pure oval moulding, and
the delicate nostrils were almost transparent in their waxen
curves; but the arch of the lip was softened and lowered, and
the face was like that of some marble goddess on which mid-summer
moonshine sleeps.</p>
<p>Her white mull robe was edged at the skirt and up the
front with a rich border of blue morning-glories, and a blue
cord and tassel girded it at her waist, while the broad braids
of hair at the back of her head were looped and fastened with
a ribbon of the same color. Her sleeves were gathered up to
keep them clear of the paint on the palette, and the dimples
were no longer visible in her arms. The ivory flesh was
shrinking closer to the small bones, and the diaphanous hands
were so thin that the sapphire asp glided almost off the slender
finger around which it was coiled.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, you have lost twenty pounds of flesh within
the last two months, and your extreme pallor alarms me.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_218"></a>218</span></div>
<p>“All things look pallid in these rooms, for the light is
bluish, reflected from carpet, furniture, and curtains.”</p>
<p>“I have noticed that you invariably wear blue, to the
exclusion of all other colors.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Throughout the Levant it is considered a mortuary
color; and, moreover, I like its symbolism. The <i>Mater
dolorosa</i> often wears blue vestments; also the priests during
Lent; and even the images of Christ are veiled in blue, as
holy week approaches. Azure, in its absolute significance,
represents truth, and is the symbol of the soul after death;
so, as I walk the earth,—a fleshy ‘death in life,’—I clothe
myself symbolically. In pagan cosmogonies the Creator is
always colored blue. Jupiter Ammon, Vischnou, Cneph,
Krischna,—all are azure. And because it is a solemn, consecrated
color, mystic and mournful, I wear it.”</p>
<p>“My dear madam, this is a morbid whimsicality that
trenches closely upon monomania, and would be more tolerable
in a lackadaisical school-girl, than in a mature, intelligent,
and gifted woman. Some of your fantasies would be
positively respectable in a Bedlamite, and you seem an anomalous
compound of eccentricities peculiar to extreme youth
and to advanced age.”</p>
<p>“I believe, sir, that you are entirely correct in your
analysis. I stand before you, young in years, but forsaken by
that ‘blue-eyed Hope’ who frolics hand in hand with youth;
and yet utterly devoid of that philosophy and wisdom which
justly belong to the old age of my heart.”</p>
<p>Her tone was indescribably weary, and, as she laid aside
her brush and folded her hands together on the cross-beam
of the easel, the transient light died out of her countenance,
and the worn, tired look, came back and settled on every
feature.</p>

<p>wove a strange spell over the visitor, whose gaze was riveted
on the only woman who had ever aroused even temporary
interest in his heart.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_219"></a>219</span></div>
<p>She was always beautiful, but to-day there was a helpless,
hopeless abandonment in her listless demeanor, that appealed
successfully to the manly tenderness and chivalry of his
nature; and into his strong, true, noble soul, came a longing
to cheer, and guide, and redeem this strange, desolate woman,
whose personal loveliness would have made her regnant over
the gay circles of fashionable life, yet whose existence was
more lonely than that of an eaglet in some mountain eyrie.</p>
<p>Rising, he leaned against the easel and looked down into
the colorless face that possessed such a wondrous charm for
him.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, for natures diseased like yours, the only
remedy, the only cure, is earnest, vigorous labor; and the
regimen you really require is mournfully at variance with
your present habits and modes of thought.”</p>
<p>“I do labor incessantly; more indefatigably than any
plowman, or mason, or carpenter. Your prescription has
been thoroughly tested, and found worthless, as an antidote
to my malady,—hopelessness.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately the labor has all been mental; heart and
soul have stood aloof, while the brain almost wore itself out.
This canvas is destroying you; your creations are too rapid,
too exhausting.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, you grievously misapprehend the whole matter,
for my work reminds me of what Canova once said of West’s
pictures, ‘He groups; he does not compose.’”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey put his hand on her wrist, and counted the rapid,
feeble, irregular pulse.</p>
<p>She made an effort to throw off his fingers, but they clung
tenaciously to the polished arm.</p>
<p>“How many hours do you sleep, during the twenty-four?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes three, occasionally one, frequently none.”</p>
<p>“How much longer do you suppose your constitution will
endure such merciless taxation?”</p>
<p>“I know very little about these things, and care still less,
but as Horne Tooke said, when a foreigner inquired how
much treason an Englishman might venture to write without
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_220"></a>220</span>
being hanged, ‘I cannot inform you just yet, but I am trying.’”</p>
<p>“Has life become such an intolerable burden that you are
impatient to shake it off?”</p>
<p>“Even so, Dr. Grey. When Elsie dies the last link will
have snapped, and I trust I shall not long survive her. If I
prayed at all, it would be for speedy death.”</p>
<p>“If you prayed at all, existence would not prove so wearisome;
for resignation would cure half your woes.”</p>
<p>“Confine your prescriptions to the body,—that is tangible,
and may be handled and scrutinized; but venture no nostrums
for a heart and soul of which you know nothing. Once I was
almost a Moslem in the frequency and fervor of my prayers;
but now, the only petition I could force myself to offer would
be that prayer of Epictetus, ‘<i>Lead me, Zeus and Destiny,
whithersoever I am appointed to go; I will follow without
wavering; even though I turn coward and shrink, I shall
have to follow, all the same.</i>’”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey sighed heavily, and answered,—</p>
<p>“It is painful to hear from feminine lips a fatalism so
grim as to make all prayer a mockery; and it would seem
that the loss of those dear to you, would have insensibly and
unavoidably drawn your heart heavenward, in search of its
<ins title="Was transplated">transplanted</ins> idols.”</p>
<p>He knew from the sudden spasm that seized her calm features,
and shuddered through her tall figure, that he had
touched, perhaps too rudely, some chord in her nature which—</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed, my heart was drawn after them,—but not
heavenward! No, no, no! My idols were not transplanted,—they
were shattered!—shattered!”</p>
<p>She leaned forward, looking up into his face; and, raising
her hand impressively, she continued in a voice so mournful,
so hopelessly bitter, that Dr. Grey shivered as he listened.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_221"></a>221</span></div>
<p>“Oh, sir, you who stand gazing down in sorrowful reproach
upon what you regard as my unpardonable impiety,

beautiful faith, as flames crisp and blacken chaff. I am

pain, sparing the world my moans and tears, my wry faces and

<p>He did not comprehend her, but felt that her past must
have been melancholy indeed, of which the bare memory was
so torturing.</p>
<p>“At least, Mrs. Gerome, let us thank God, that beyond
the grave there remains an eternal reunion with your idol,
and—”</p>
<p>“God forbid! You talk at random, and your suggestion
would drive me mad, if I believed it. Let me be quiet.”</p>
<p>She walked away, and seemed intently watching the sea, of
whose protean face she never wearied; and, puzzled and
tantalized, Dr. Grey turned to examine the unfinished picture.</p>
<p>It represented an almost colossal woman, kneeling under
an apple-tree, with her folded hands lifted towards a setting
sun that glared from purple hills, across waving fields of
green and golden grain. The azure mantle that enveloped
the rounded form, floated on the wind and seemed to melt
in air, so dim were its graceful outlines; and on one shoulder
perched a dove with head under its wing, nestling to sleep,—while
a rabbit nibbled the grass at her feet, and a squirrel
curled himself comfortably on the border of her robe. In
the foreground were scattered sheaves of yellow wheat, full
ears of corn, bunches of blue, bloom-covered grapes, clusters
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_222"></a>222</span>
of olives, and various delicate flowers whose brilliant hues
seemed drippings from some wrung and broken rainbow.</p>
<p>The face was unlike flesh and blood,—was dim, elfish, wan,
with large, mild eyes, as blue and misty as the <i>nebulæ</i> that
Herschel found in Southern skies,—eyes that looked at
nothing, but seemed to penetrate the universe and shed soft
solemn light over all things. Back from the broad, low brow,
floated a cloud of silky yellow hair, that glittered in the slanting
rays of sunshine as if powdered with gold dust; and over
its streaming strands fluttered two mottled butterflies, and a
honey-laden bee. On distant hill-slopes cattle browsed, and
at the right of the kneeling woman a young lamb nibbled a
cluster of snowy lilies, while a dappled fawn watched the
gambols of a dun kid; and on the left, in a tuft of bearded
grass, a brown snake arched its neck to peer at a brood of
half-fledged partridges.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, will you be so kind as to explain this mythologic
design?”</p>
<p>She came back to the easel, and took up her palette.</p>
<p>“If it requires an explanation it is an egregious failure,
and shall find a vacant corner in some rubbish garret.”</p>
<p>“It is exceedingly beautiful, but I do not fully comprehend
the symbolism.”</p>
<p>“If it does not clearly mean the one thing for which it
was intended, it means nothing, and is worthless. Look, sir,
she—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘Forgets, remembers, grieves, and is not sad;<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>The quiet lands and skies leave light upon her eyes;<br>
None knows her weak, or wise, or tired, or glad.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Dr. Grey bit his lip, but shook his head.</p>
<p>“You must read me your painted riddle more explicitly.
Is it Ceres?”</p>
<p>“No, sir; a few sheaves do not make a harvest. I am a
stupid bungler, spoiling canvas and wasting paint, or else you
are as obtuse as the critics who may one day hover hungrily
over it. Try the aid of one more clew, and if you fail to
catch my purpose, I will dash my brush all loaded with ochre,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_223"></a>223</span>
right into those mystic, prescient eyes, and blur them forever.
Listen, and guess,—</p>

<span class="indent4"> </span>Between her hands.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“Pray do not visit the sin of my stupidity upon that
fascinating picture. I am not familiar with the lines you
quote, but know that you have represented Nature, have embodied
an ideal Isis, or Hertha, or Cybele; though I can not
positively name the phase of the Universal Mother, which
you have seized and perpetuated.”</p>
<p>He caught her arm, and removed from her fingers the palette
and brushes.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, it is more than either or all of the three you
mention; for Persian mythology, like Persian wines and
Persian roses, is richer, more subtle, more fragrant, more
glowing than any other. That woman is ‘<i>Espendérmad</i>.’”</p>
<p>“Thank you; now I comprehend the whole. God has
endowed you with wonderful talent. The fruit and flowers
in that foreground must have cost you much labor, for indeed
you seem to have faithfully followed the injunction of Titian,
‘Study the effect of light and shade on a bunch of grapes.’
That luscious amber cluster lying near the poppies is tantalizingly
suggestive of Rhineland, and of the vines that
garland the hills of Crete and Cyprus.”</p>
<p>A shade of annoyance and disappointment crossed the artist’s
face.</p>
<p>“Now, I quite realize what Cespedes felt, when, finding
that visitors were absorbed by the admirable finish of some
jars and vases in the foreground of the ‘Last Supper,’ upon
which he had expended so much time and thought, he called
his servant and exclaimed in great chagrin, ‘Andres, rub me
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_224"></a>224</span>
out these things, since, after all my care and study, people
choose to see nothing but these impertinences.’”</p>
<p>“If Zeuxis’ grandest triumph consisted in painting grapes,
you assuredly should not take umbrage at my praise of that
fruit on your canvas, which hints of Tokay and Lachrima
Christi. I am not an artist, but I have studied the best
pictures in Europe and America, and you must acquit me of
any desire to flatter when I tell you that background yonder
is one of the most extraordinary successes I have ever seen,
from either amateur or professional painters.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome arched her black brows slightly, and replied,—</p>
<p>“Then the success was accidental, and I stumbled upon it,
for I bestow little study on the backgrounds of my work.
They are mere dim distances of bluish haze, and do not
interest me, and, since I paint for amusement, I give most
thought to my central figure.”</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten the anecdote of Rubens, who, when
offered a pupil with the recommendation that he was sufficiently
advanced in his studies to assist him at once in his
backgrounds, laughed, and answered, ‘If the youth was
capable of painting backgrounds he did not need his instruction;
because the regulation and management of them required
the most comprehensive knowledge of the art.’”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am aware that is one of the <i>dogmata</i> of the craft,
but Rubens was no more infallible than you or I, and his
pictures give me less pleasure than those of any other artist
of equal celebrity. Dr. Grey, if I am even a tolerable judge
of my own work, the best thing I have yet achieved is the
drapery of that form. Perhaps I am inclined to plume myself
upon this point, from the fact that it was the opinion of
Carlo Maratti that ‘The arrangement of drapery is more
difficult than drawing the human figure; because the right
effect depends more upon the taste of the artist than upon any
given rules.’ That sweep of blue gauze has cost me more toil
than everything else on the canvas.”</p>
<p>“Pardon the expression of my curiosity concerning your
modes of composition in these singular and quaint creations,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_225"></a>225</span>
for which you have no models; and tell me how this ideal
presented itself to your imagination.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I am not a great genius like Goethe, and unfortunately
can not candidly echo his declaration, that,
‘Nothing ever came to me in my sleep.’ I can scarcely tell
you when this idea was first born in my busy, tireless brain,
but it took form one evening after I had read Charlotte
Bronté’s ‘Woman Titan,’ in ‘Shirley,’ and compared it with
that glowing description of Jean Paul Richter, ‘And so the
Sun stands at the border of the Earth, and looks back on
his stately Spring, whose robe-folds are valleys, whose breast-bouquet
is gardens, whose blush is a vernal evening, and who,
when she rises, will be Summer.’ Still it was vague, and
eluded me, until I found somewhere in my most desultory
reading, an account of ‘<i><ins title="Was Espendermad">Espendérmad</ins></i>,’ one of the six angels
of Ormuzd, to whom was entrusted the guardianship of the
earth. That night I dreamed that I stood under a vine at
Schiraz, gathering golden-tinted grapes, when a voice arrested
me, and, looking over my shoulder, I saw that face peeping
at me across a hedge of crimson roses. Next day I sketched
the features as they had appeared in my dream, but I was
not fully satisfied, and waited and pondered. Finally, I read
‘Madonna Mia,’ and then all was as you see it now, startlingly
distinct and palpable.”</p>
<p>“Why did you not select some dusky-haired, dusky-eyed,
olive-tinted oriental type, instead of a blonde who might
safely venture into Valhalla as a genuine Celtic Iduna?”</p>
<p>“With the exception of the yellow locks, I suspect the face
of my ‘<i><ins title="Was Espendermad">Espendérmad</ins></i>’ might easily be matched among the
maidens of the Caucasus, who furnish the most perfect types
of Circassian beauty. You know there is a tradition that
when Leonardo da Vinci chanced to meet a man with an expression
of character that he wished to make use of in his
work, he followed him until he was able to delineate the face
on canvas; but, on the contrary, the countenances I paint
present themselves to my imagination, and pursue me inexorably
until I put them into pigment. I do not possess
ideals,—they seize and possess me, teasing me for form and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_226"></a>226</span>
color, and forcing me to object them on canvas. Such is the
<i>modus operandi</i> of whims that give me my ‘<i><ins title="Was Espendermad">Espendérmad</ins></i>’
praying to the Sun for benisons on the Earth, which she is
appointed to guard. Ah, if like the lambkins and birds, I,
too, could creep to the starry border of her azure robe, and
lay my weary head down and find repose. Some day, if my
mind ever grows calm enough, I want to paint a picture of
Rest, that I can hang on my wall and look upon when I am
worn out in body and soul, when, indeed,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired,<br>
<span class="indent8"> </span>My heart oppressed,<br>
And I desire, what I long desired,<br>
<span class="indent8"> </span>Rest,—only Rest.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“My dear madam, unless you speedily change your present
mode of life, you will not paint that contemplated picture, for
a long rest will soon overtake you.”</p>
<p>A gleam that was nearer akin to joy than any expression
he had yet seen, passed from eye to lip, and she answered,
almost eagerly,—</p>
<p>“If that be true, it offers a premium for the continuance of
habits you condemn so strenuously; but I dare not hope it,
and I beg of you not to tantalize me with vain expectations
of a release that may yet be far, far distant.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey’s heart stirred with earnest sympathy for this
lonely hopeless soul, who, standing almost upon the threshold
of life, stretched her arms so yearningly to woo the advance of
death.</p>
<p>The room was slowly filling with shadows, and, leaning
there against her easel, she looked as unearthly as the pearly
forms that summer clouds sometimes assume, when a harvest-moon
springs up from sea foam and fog, and stares at them.
When she spoke again, her voice was chill and crisp.</p>
<p>“My malady is beyond your reach, and baffles human skill.
You mean only kindness, and I suppose I ought to thank
you, but alas! the sentiment of gratitude is such a stranger
in my heart, that it has yet to learn an adequate language.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_227"></a>227</span>
Dr. Grey, the only help you can possibly render me is to prolong
Elsie’s life. As for me, and my uncertain future, give
yourself no charitable solicitude. Do you recollect what Lessing
wrote to Claudius? ‘I am too proud to own that I am
unhappy. I shut my teeth, and let the bark drift. Enough
that I do not turn it over with my own hands.’ Elsie is
signalling for me. Do you hear that bell? Good-night, Dr.
Grey.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“I have had a long conversation with Ulpian, and find
him violently opposed to the scheme you mentioned to me
several days since. He declares he will gladly share his last
dollar with you sooner than see you embark in a career so
fraught with difficulties, trials, and—”</p>
<p>Miss Jane paused to find an appropriate word, and Salome
very promptly supplied her.</p>
<p>“Temptations. That is exactly what you both mean. Go
on.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, dear. I am afraid the profession you have
selected is beset with dangerous allurements for one so inexperienced
and unsophisticated as yourself.”</p>
<p>“Bah! Speak out. I am sick of circumlocution. What
do you understand by unsophisticated?”</p>
<p>“Why, I mean,—well, what can I mean but just what the
word expresses,—unsophisticated? That is, young, thoughtless,
ignorant of the ways of the world, and the excessive
cunning and deceit of human nature.”</p>
<p>“Begging your pardon, it has another significance, which
you will find if you look into your dictionary,—that blessed
Magna Charta of linguistic rights and privileges. I do not
claim the prerogatives of Ruskin’s class of the ‘well educated,
who are learned in the peerage of words; know the words
of true descent and ancient blood at a glance, from words
of modern <i>canaille</i>;’ but I venture the assertion that I am
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_228"></a>228</span>
sufficiently sophisticated to plunge into the vortex of public
life, and yet keep my head above water.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see my little girl an actress, or a <i>prima
donna</i>, bold, forward, and eager to face a noisy, clamorous
crowd, who feel privileged to say just what they please about
her. It would break my heart; and, if you are bent on such
a step, I hope you will wait, at least, till I am dead.”</p>
<p>“You ought to be willing to see me do anything honest,
that will secure my dependent brother and sister from want.”</p>
<p>“The necessity of laboring for them is not especially imperative
at this juncture, and why should you be more sensitive
now than formerly? Do not deceive yourself, dear
child, but face the truth, no matter how ugly it may possibly
be. It is not a sense of duty to the younger children, but an
inflated vanity, that prompts you to parade your beauty and
your wonderful voice on the stage, where they will elicit applause
and flattering adulation. My little girl, that is the
most dangerous, the most unhealthy atmosphere, a woman
can possibly breathe.”</p>
<p>“Pray tell me how you learned all this? You, who have
spent your life in this quiet old house, who have been almost
as secluded as some Cambrian Culdee, can really know nothing
of that public life you condemn so bitterly.”</p>
<p>“The history of those who have walked in the path you
are now preparing to follow, proves the deleterious influences
and ruinous associations that surround that class of women.”</p>
<p>“Jenny Lind and Sarah Siddons redeem any class, no
matter how much maligned.”</p>
<p>“But what assurance have I, that, unlike the ninety-nine,
you will resemble the one-hundredth?”</p>
<p>“Only try me, Miss Jane.”</p>
<p>“Ah, child! A rash boy said the same thing when he
tried to drive the sun, and not only consumed himself but
nearly burned up the world. There is rather too much at
stake to warrant such reckless experiments.”</p>
<p>“Quit mythology,—it is not in your line,—and come back
to stern facts and serious realities. Because I wish to dance
a quadrille or cotillion, and acquit myself creditably, does it
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_229"></a>229</span>
ensue as an inexorable consequence, that I shall join some
strolling ballet troupe, and out-Bayadère the Bayadères?”</p>
<p>“That depends altogether upon your agility and grace. If
you could reasonably hope to rival your Hebrew namesake, I
am afraid my little girl would think it ‘her duty’ to dance
instead of to sing, for the acquisition of a fortune; and insist
upon executing wonderful things with her heels and toes,
instead of her voice.”</p>
<p>“You and Dr. Grey seem to have simultaneously arrived at
the charitable conclusion that my heart is pretty much in the
same condition that the Hebrew temple was, when Christ
undertook to drive out the profane. Thongs in hand you two
have overturned my motives, and, by a very summary court-martial,
condemned them to be scourged out. Now, mark
you, I am neither making change nor selling doves, and still
less are you and your brother—Jesus. Dr. Grey does me
the honor to indulge a chronic skepticism concerning the possibility
of any good and unselfish impulse in my nature, and
I am sorry to see that you have caught the contagious doubt
of me, and of my motives.”</p>
<p>She began the sentence in a challenging, sneering voice,
but it was ended in a lower and faltering tone.</p>

<p class="cg">“While in the light of her large angry eyes,<br>

<p>“My dear, don’t attempt to whip Ulpian over my shoulders.
You know very well that I have invested in you an amount of
faith that the united censure of the world cannot shake; and
if Ulpian does not follow my example, whose fault is it, I
should be glad to know? Evidently not his,—certainly not
mine,—but undoubtedly yours. I have noticed that you took
extraordinary care and a very peculiar pleasure in making
him believe you much worse in all respects than you really
are; and since you have labored so industriously to lower
yourself in his estimation, it would be a poor compliment to
your skill and energy if I told you that you had not entirely
succeeded in your rather remarkable aim. Before he came
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_230"></a>230</span>
home you were as contented, and amiable, and happy, as my
old cat there on the rug; but Ulpian’s appearance affected
you as the entrance of a dog does my maltese, who arches
her back, and growls, and claws, as long as he is in sight. I
am truly sorry you two could never agree, but I feel bound
to tell you that you have only yourself to blame. I do not
claim that my sailor-boy is a saint, but he is assuredly some
inches nearer sanctification than my poor little Salome.
Don’t you think so? Be honest, dear.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane’s hand tenderly caressed the beautiful head; and,
as Salome was too sullen or too much mortified to reply, the
old lady continued,—</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, Ulpian is a true and devoted friend, and
can not bear the thought of your leaving us, for any purpose,
much less the one you contemplate. Last night he said,
‘Janet, I am her brother, and think you I shall allow my
sister to go out from the sacred precincts of home, and become
a target for the envy and malice of the better classes
who will criticise her, and for the coarse plaudits of the pit?
Do you suppose I can willingly see her bare feet turned towards
a path paved with glowing ploughshares? Tell her,
for me, that if ever she should carry her unfortunate freak
into execution, I shall never wish to touch her hand again,
for I shall feel that it has lost its purity in the clasp of many
to whom she can not refuse it during a professional career.’”</p>
<p>The orphan lifted her head from the arm of Miss Jane’s
chair, where it had rested for some minutes, and striking her
palms forcibly together, she exclaimed, proudly,—</p>
<p>“Tell Dr. Grey I humbly thank him, but the threat has
lost its sting; and if I should chance to meet him years hence,
though my hands shall be pure and clean as Una’s, and as
unsullied as his own,—so help me heaven! I will never
thrust my touch on his, nor so far forget myself as to suffer
his fingers to approach mine. When I pass from this
threshold, we will have shaken hands forever.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey’s ears are not proof against such elevated, ringing
tones of voice, and he could not avoid hearing, as he came
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_231"></a>231</span>
up the steps, the childish words which he assures you he has
no intention of believing or remembering.”</p>
<p>He had tapped twice at the half-open door, and now came
forward with a firm, quick step, to the ottoman where Salome
sat. Taking her hands, he patted the palms softly against
each other, and smiling good-humoredly, continued,—</p>
<p>“They are very white, and shapely, and pure, and I am
not afraid that my little sister will soil them. Her brother
looks forward to the day when they will gently and gracefully
help him in his work among God’s suffering poor. I have
not forgotten how dexterous and docile I found your fingers,
when I had temporarily lost the use of my own, and I shall
not fail to levy contributions of labor in the coming years.”</p>
<p>She had snatched her fingers from his, and no sooner had
he ceased speaking, than she bowed haughtily, and answered,—</p>
<p>“Our reconciliations all belong to the Norman family, and
are quite as lasting as Lamourette’s. Ceaseless war is preferable
to a violated truce, and since I have not swerved from
my purpose, I shall not falter in its enunciation. If I live
it shall not be my fault if I fail to go upon the stage. I am
not so fastidious as Dr. Grey, and one who sprang from
<i>canaille</i> must be pardoned if she betrays a longing for the
‘flesh-pots of Egypt.’”</p>
<p>She would have given her right hand to recall her words,—when,
a moment later, she met the gaze of profound pity and
disappointment with which Dr. Grey’s eyes dwelt upon her
countenance, hardened now by its expression of insolent
haughtiness; but he allowed her no opportunity for retraction,
even had she mastered her overweening pride, and stooping
to whisper a brief sentence in his sister’s ear, he took a medical
book from the table, and left the room.</p>
<p>The silence that ensued seemed interminable to Salome,
and at last she turned, bowed her head in Miss Jane’s lap,
and muttered through set teeth,—</p>
<p>“You see it is best that I should go. Even you must be
weary of this strife.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_232"></a>232</span></div>
<p>The old lady’s trembling hands were laid lovingly on the
girl’s hot brow and scorched cheeks.</p>
<p>“Not half so weary as your own oppressed heart. My dear
child, why do you persist in tormenting yourself so unmercifully?
Why will you say things that you do not mean?—that
are absolute libels on your actual feelings? I have often
seen and deplored affectations of generosity and refinement,
but you are the first person I ever met who delighted in a pretence
of meanness, which her genuine nature abhorred.
Salome, I have tried to prove myself a mother to you since
the day that I took you under my roof; and now, when I am
passing away from the world,—when a few short months will
probably end my feeble life, I think you owe it to me to give
me no sorrow that your hands can easily ward off. Don’t
leave me. When I am gone there will be time and to spare,
for all your schemes. Stay here, and let me have peace and
sunshine about me, in my last fading hours. Ah, dear, you
can’t be cruel to the old woman who has long loved you so
tenderly.”</p>
<p>The orphan pressed the withered hands to her lips, and,
covering her face with the folds of Miss Jane’s black silk
apron, exclaimed passionately,—</p>
<p>“Do not think me ungrateful,—do not think me insensible
to your love and kindness; but, indeed I am very miserable
here. Oh, Miss Jane! if you knew how I have suffered, you
would not chide, you would only pity and sympathize with
me; for your heart will never steel itself against your poor
wretched Salome!”</p>
<p>She lost control of herself, and sobbed violently.</p>
<p>“My dear little girl, tell me all your sorrows. To whom
can you reveal your trials and griefs, if not to me? For
some weeks past I have observed that you shunned my gaze,
and seemed restless when I endeavored to discover how you
were employing your time; and I have realized that you were
sorely distressed, but I disliked to force your confidence, or
appear suspicious. Now, I have a right to ask what makes
you miserable in my house? Is the little girl ashamed to
show me her heart?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_233"></a>233</span></div>
<p>“One month since, I would have gone to the stake rather
than have shown it to you, or have had any one dream of the
wretchedness locked in its chambers; but a week ago I was
overwhelmed with humiliation, and now I am not ashamed
to tell you. Now that Dr. Grey knows it, I would not care
if the whole world were hissing and jeering at my heels, and
shouting my shame with a thousand trumpets. I tried to
keep it from him, and failing, the world is welcome to roll it
as a sweet morsel under its busy, stinging, slanderous tongue.
Miss Jane, I have intended to be sincere in every respect,
but it appears that, after all, I have probably been an arrant
hypocrite if you believe that I dislike your brother. I want
to go away, because I can no longer endure to live in the
same house with Dr. Grey, who shows me more plainly every
hour that he can never return the affection I have been idiotic
and presumptuous enough to cherish for him. There! I
have said it,—and my lips are not blistered by the unwomanly
confession, and you still permit my head to rest in your lap.
I expected you would be indignant and insulted, and gladly
send such a lunatic from your family circle,—or that you
would dismiss me coolly, with lofty contempt; but only a
woman can properly pity a woman’s weakness, and you are
crying over me. Ah, if your tears were falling on my grave,
instead of my face!”</p>
<p>Miss Jane was weeping bitterly, but now and then she
stooped and kissed the quivering lips of her unhappy charge,
who found some balm in the earnest sympathy with which
her appeal was received.</p>
<p>“My precious child, why should you be ashamed of your
love for the noblest man who ever unconsciously became a
woman’s idol? I do not much wonder at your feelings, because
you have seen no one else in any respect comparable to
him, and it is difficult for you to realize the disparity in your
ages. Poor thing! It must be terrible, indeed, to one who
loves him as you do, to have no hope of possessing his affection
in return. But I suppose it can’t be helped,—and one
half the world seem to pour out their love on the wrong
persons, and find misery where they should have only joy and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_234"></a>234</span>
peace. Thank God, all this mischief is shut out of heaven!
Dear, don’t hide your face, as if you had stolen half of my
sheep; whereas my poor innocent sailor-boy has unintentionally
stolen my little girl’s heart.”</p>
<p>“Miss Jane, you are too good,—too kind. Do not help
me to excuse myself,—do not teach me to palliate my pitiable
weakness. It is a grievous, a shameful, a disgraceful thing,
for a woman to allow herself to love any man who gives her
no evidence of affection, and shows her beyond all doubt that
he is utterly indifferent to her. This is a sin against womanly
pride and delicacy that demands sackcloth and ashes,
and penance and long years of humiliation and self-abasement;
and I tell you this is the one sin which my proud soul
will never pardon in my poor weak, despised heart.”</p>
<p>“If you feel this so keenly, you will soon succeed in conquering
and casting out of your heart an affection, which,
having nothing to feed upon, will speedily exhaust itself.
You are young, and your elastic nature will rebound from
the pressure that you now find so painful. My dear, a few
months or years will bring comparative oblivion of this period
of your life.”</p>
<p>“No; they will engrave more deeply the consciousness
that I have missed my sole chance of earthly happiness, for
Dr. Grey is the only man I shall ever love,—is the only man
who can lift me to his own noble height of excellence. I know
it is customary to laugh at a girl’s protestations of undying
devotion, and that the theory of feminine constancy is as
entirely effete as the worship of the Cabiri, or the belief in
Blokula and its witches; but, unfortunately, the world has
not sneered it entirely out of existence, and I am destined to
furnish a mournful exemplification of its reality. Whether
my nature is unlike that of the majority of women, I shall
not undertake to decide; but this I know,—God gave me only
so much love to spend, and I poured it all out, I deluged my
idol with it, instead of doling it carefully through the future
years. Like the woman of Bethany, I have broken my box
of alabaster, and spilled all my precious ointment, which
might have served for a lifetime of anointing, and I cannot
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_235"></a>235</span>
renew the shattered receptacle, nor gather back the wasted
fragrance; and so my heart must remain without spikenard
or balm during its earthly sojourn. I have been prodigal,—have
beggared my womanly nature,—and henceforth shall
feast on husks. But this piece of folly can be laid on no
shoulders but my own, and I must not wince if they are galled
by burdens which only I have imposed. Some women, under
similar circumstances, console themselves by fostering a tender
and excessive gratitude, which they pet and fondle and call
second love; but the feeling belongs to a different species,
and is to strong, earnest, genuine love, what the stunted pines
of second growth are to the noble, stalwart, unapproachable
oaks, that spring from the primitive virgin soil.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane lifted the bowed face, and rested the head against
her bosom.</p>
<p>“If you are so thoroughly convinced of the impossibility of
mastering this affection, why talk of going away? You will
be happier here, under any circumstances, than among
strangers.”</p>
<p>“Do not misapprehend me. I do not intend to cherish my
weakness,—to caress and pamper it. I mean to strangle,
and mangle, and bury it, if possible. I meant, not that I
should always love Dr. Grey, but that I should never be able
to regard any one else as I once loved him. I can not stay
here, seeing him daily trample my alabaster and ointment
under his feet. I can not endure the humiliation that has
for some days past made this house more intolerable than I
may one day find Phlegethon. I want to go into the whirl
and din of life, where my thoughts can dwell on some more
comforting theme than the peerless preëminence of the man
who is master here, where I can spend hours in elaborating
<i>toilettes</i> and <i>coiffures</i> that will show to the greatest advantage
my small stock of personal charms; where the admiration and
love of other men will at least amuse and soothe the heart
that has no more love for anybody, or anything. Miss Jane,
if I had never become so deeply attached to Dr. Grey, it
might perhaps be unsafe for me to venture into the career
which now lies before me; but when a woman’s heart is cold
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_236"></a>236</span>
and dead in her bosom, there is no peril she need fear; for
only her warm, pleading heart, can ever silence the iron clang
of conscience and the silvery accents of reason. Worshipping
some clay god, my loving, yearning heart, might possibly
have led me astray; but now, pride and ambition stand
as sentinels over its corpse, and a heartless woman, desirous
only of amassing a fortune and making herself a celebrity in
musical circles, is as safe from harm as the bones of her grandmother,
twenty years <ins title="Added quote">buried.”</ins></p>
<p>The agony that convulsed the orphan’s features, and
shivered the smoothness of her usually sweet voice, touched
the old lady’s sympathy, and she wept silently; straining her
imagination for some argument that would make an impression
on the adamantine will with which she found her own
in conflict.</p>
<p>“My child, tell me how long you have had this trouble.
When did you first feel an interest in Ulpian?”</p>
<p>Unhesitatingly Salome related all that had occurred in her
intercourse with Dr. Grey, and her companion was surprised
at the frankness and mercilessness with which she analyzed
her own feelings at each stage of the acquaintance that proved
so disastrous to her peace of mind; and not only held her
weakness up for scorn, but exonerated Dr. Grey from all censure.</p>
<p>The minuteness of the confession was exceedingly painful;
and, at its conclusion, she pressed her palms to her cheeks,
and moaned,—</p>
<p>“There, Miss Jane, I have not winced; I have kept back
nothing. I have been as patient and inexorable in laying
open my nature, in treating you to a <i>post-mortem</i> examination
of my heart, as a dentist in scraping and chiselling a
sensitive tooth, or a surgeon in cutting out a cancer that
baffled cauterization. Now you know all that I can tell you,
and I here lay the past in a sepulchre, and roll the stone upon
it, and henceforth I trust you will respect the dead; at least,
let silence rest upon its ashes. <i>Hic jacet cor cordium.</i>”</p>
<p>Salome extricated herself from the arms of her best friend,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_237"></a>237</span>
and smoothed the hair that constant strokes had somewhat
disordered.</p>
<p>“Salome, I can not live much longer.”</p>
<p>“I know that, dear Miss Jane, and it pains me even to
think of leaving the only person who ever really loved me.”</p>
<p>“For my sake, dear child, bear the trial of remaining here a
little longer; at least, until I die. Do not desert me in my
last hours. I do not want the hands of strangers about me,
when I am cold and stiff.”</p>
<p>Salome rose and walked several times up and down the
room; then paused beside the easy-chair, and laid her clasped
hands in Miss Jane’s.</p>
<p>“You alone have a right to control me. Do with me as
you think best. I will not forsake the true, tender friend,
who has done more for me than all else on earth, or in heaven.
For the present I remain here; but allow me to say that I
do not abandon my scheme. I relinquish none of its details,—I
only bide my time.”</p>
<p>“‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’ Thank you,
my precious little girl, for yielding to my wishes when they
conflict with yours. Some day you will rejoice that you made
what seemed a sacrifice of inclination on the altar of duty.
Now, listen to me. Ulpian is so enraptured with your voice,
that, while he will never consent to this stage-struck madness,
he is exceedingly anxious that you should enjoy every
musical advantage, and is curious to ascertain to what degree
of perfection your voice can be trained. After consulting me,
he wrote two days ago to a celebrated professor of music in
Philadelphia or New York (I really forget where the man is
now residing), and offered him a handsome salary if he would
come and teach you for at least six months, or as much longer
as he deems requisite. I believe the gentleman is delicate
and threatened with consumption, which obliges him to spend
the winters in a warm climate, and Ulpian first met him in
Italy. My boy thinks that the opinion of this Professor Von
Somebody is oracular in musical matters; and, as he has
trained some of the best singers in Europe, Ulpian wishes
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_238"></a>238</span>
him to have charge of your voice. Say nothing about it until
we hear whether he can accept our offer. Kiss me.”</p>
<p>Salome’s face crimsoned, and she said, hesitatingly,—</p>
<p>“Miss Jane, I can not consent that Dr. Grey should contribute
one cent toward my musical tuition. I can humbly
and gratefully accept your charitable aid, but not his. You
love me, and therefore your bounty is not oppressive or humiliating,
but he only pities and tolerates me, and I would
starve in some gutter rather than live as the recipient of
his charity. If you can conveniently spare the money necessary
to give me additional cultivation, I shall thankfully receive
it, for Barilli has taught me all of which he is master,
and there is no one else in town in whom I have more confidence.
It was my desire and determination that the work
of my hands should pay for polishing my voice, but embroidery-fees
would not suffice to defray the expenses of the
professor to whom you allude; and, if Dr. Grey pays for his
services, I must in advance assure you and him that I shall
decline them, and rely upon Barilli and myself.”</p>
<p>“Pooh! pooh! It is poor philosophy to quarrel with your
bread and butter, no matter who happens to hand it to you.
Don’t be so savage on Ulpian, who really cares more for you
than you deserve. But if it comforts your proud, fierce spirit,
you are welcome to know that I—Jane Grey—pay Professor
Von—whatever his name may be; and Ulpian’s pocket, about
which you seem so fastidious, will not be damaged one dollar
by the transaction. Are you satisfied,—you pretty piece of
beggarly pride?”</p>
<p>“I am more grateful to you, dear Miss Jane, than I shall
ever be able to express. God only knows what would have
become of me if you had not mercifully snatched me, soul and
body, from the purlieus of ruin.”</p>
<p>She stooped to receive the fond kiss of her benefactress,
and went into her own room.</p>
<p>Nearly an hour later she slowly descended the stairs, and
took her hat from the stand in the hall. As she adjusted it
on her head, and tied the ribbons behind her knot of hair,
Mr. Granville came out of the parlor and seized her hand.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_239"></a>239</span></div>
<p>“Why will you torment me so cruelly? I have been
waiting and watching for you, at least half an hour.”</p>
<p>She haughtily took her fingers from his, and indignantly
drew herself up,—</p>
<p>“Mr. Granville presumes on his position as guest, to intrude
upon some who do not desire his society. I was not
aware, sir, that I had any engagement with you.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Salome! How have I offended you? If you
could realize how much pleasure your presence affords me,
you would not punish me by absenting yourself as you have
persistently done for three days past.”</p>
<p>He bent his handsome face closer to hers, looking appealingly
into her beautiful flashing eyes; but she put up her
hands to push him aside, and answered,—</p>
<p>“I shall be happy to entertain you in the evenings, when
the remainder of the household assemble in the parlor; and
will, with great pleasure, sing for you whenever Miss Muriel
will kindly oblige me by playing my accompaniments; but
I prefer to confine our acquaintance to such occasions.”</p>
<p>“Will you not allow me the privilege of accompanying you
in the walk for which you seem prepared?”</p>
<p>“No, sir; I respectfully decline your attendance.”</p>
<p>She saw his cheek flush, and he said, hastily,—</p>
<p>“Salome, I shall begin to hope that you fear to trust your
own heart.”</p>
<p>“Do not forget yourself, sir. If you knew where my heart
is housed, you would spare yourself the fruitless trouble, and
me the annoyance, of attentions and expressions of admiration
which I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you
are particularly disagreeable to me. I wish to treat you
courteously, as the guest of those under whose roof I am permitted
to reside, but ‘thus far, and no farther,’ must you
venture. Moreover, Mr. Granville, since we are merely comparative
strangers, I should be gratified if you will in future
do me the honor to recollect that it is one of my peculiarities,—one
of my idiosyncrasies,—to prefer that only those I respect
and love should call me Salome. Good afternoon, sir.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_240"></a>240</span></div>
<p>She took her music-book, bowed coolly, and made her exit
through the front door, which she closed after her.</p>
<p>In the hammock that was suspended on the eastern side of
the piazza, Dr. Grey had thrown himself to rest; and meanwhile,
to search for some surgical operation recorded in one
of his books.</p>
<p>Just behind him a window opened from the hall, and to-day,
though a rose-colored shade was lowered, the sash had
been raised, and every word that was uttered in the passage
floated distinctly to him.</p>
<p>The whole conversation occurred so rapidly that he had
no opportunity of discovering his presence to the persons
within, and though he cleared his throat and coughed rather
spasmodically, his warning was unheeded by those for whom
it was intended.</p>
<p>He knew that Salome could not possibly have guessed his
proximity, as he was not accustomed to use this hammock,
and was completely shielded from observation; and, while
pained and surprised by Mr. Granville’s dishonorable course,
which threatened life-long wretchedness for poor Muriel, Dr.
Grey’s heart throbbed with joy at the assurance that Salome
was not so ungenerous as he had feared. Probably no other
human being would have so highly appreciated her conduct
on this occasion; and, as he mused, with his thumb and forefinger
thrust between the leaves of the book, a glad smile broke
over his grave face.</p>
<p>“God bless the girl! Her prayers and mine have not been
in vain, and she is putting under her feet the baser impulses
that mar her character. Granville is considered by the world
exceedingly handsome and agreeable, and many,—yes, the
majority of women, would have yielded, and indulged in a
‘harmless flirtation,’ where Salome stood firm. There was
something akin to the scornful ring of Rachel’s voice in that
child’s tones, when she told Gerard he presumed on his position
as guest; and I will wager my hand that her large eyes
did not exactly resemble a dove’s when she informed him it
was not his privilege to call her Salome. She has a fierce,
imperious, passionate temper, that goads her into mischief;
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_241"></a>241</span>
but, after all, she is—she must be—nobler than I have sometimes
thought her. God grant it! God bless her!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Doctor Grey, are you awake? Dr. Grey, here is a
note from ‘Solitude,’ and the messenger begs that you will
lose no time, as one of the servants is supposed to be
dying.”</p>
<p>Salome had knocked twice at Dr. Grey’s door, without
arousing him, and the third time she beat a tattoo that would
have broken even heavier slumbers than his.</p>
<p>“I am awake, and will strike a light in a moment.”</p>
<p>She heard him stumbling about the room, and finally there
was a crash, as of a broken vase or goblet.</p>
<p>“What is the matter? Can’t you find your matches?”</p>
<p>“No; some one has removed the box from its usual place,
and I am fumbling about at random, and smashing things
indiscriminately. Will you be so good as to bring me a
match?”</p>
<p>“I have a candle in my hand, which you can take, while I
order Elbert to get your buggy ready.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Salome.”</p>
<p>She placed the candle on the mat before his door, laid
the note beside it, and went down to the servants’ rooms to
call the driver.</p>
<p>It was two o’clock, and Dr. Grey had come home only an
hour before, from a patient who resided at some distance.</p>
<p>Dressing himself as expeditiously as possible, he read the
blurred and crumpled note.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Dr. Grey: For God’s sake come as quick as possible.
I am afraid my mother is dying.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_242"></a>242</span></div>
<p>Three days before, when he visited Elsie, he found her more
composed and comfortable than she had been for several
weeks, and Mrs. Gerome had seemed almost cheerful, as she
sat beside the bed, crimping the borders of the invalid’s muslin
caps which the laundress had sent in, stiff and spotless.</p>
<p>Recollecting Elsie’s desire to confide something to him before
her death, and dreading the effect which this sudden
termination of her life might have upon her mistress, in
whom he was daily becoming more deeply interested, Dr.
Grey hurried down stairs and met the orphan.</p>
<p>“Elbert is not quite ready, but will be at the door directly.
I told him the case was urgent.”</p>
<p>“You are very considerate, Salome, and I am much obliged
for your thoughtfulness; though I regret that the messenger
waked you, instead of Rachel or me. I have never before
known Rachel fail to hear the bell, and I was so weary that I
think a ten-inch columbiad would scarcely have aroused me.”</p>
<p>“I was not asleep,—was sitting at my window; and hearing
some one slam the gate and gallop up the avenue, I went to
the door and opened it, to prevent the ringing of the bell
and waking of the entire household.”</p>
<p>“You should have been asleep four hours ago, and I had
no idea you were still up, when I came home. There was no
light in your room. Are you quite well?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, I am quite well.”</p>
<p>She was dressed as he had seen her at dinner, and now, as
she stood resting one hand on the balustrade of the stairway,
he thought she looked paler and more weary than he had
ever observed her.</p>
<p>The scarlet spray of pelargonium had withered from the
heat of her head, where it had rested all the evening, and the
large creamy Grand Duke jasmine fastened at her throat by
a sprig of coral, was drooping and fading, but still exhaled
its strong delicious perfume.</p>
<p>“Your appearance contradicts your assertion. Is your
wakefulness attributable to any anxiety or trouble which I can
remove?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_243"></a>243</span></div>
<p>“No, sir. I hear Elbert opening the gate. Who is sick at
‘Solitude’?”</p>
<p>“The servant who was so severely injured many months
ago, by a fall from a carriage, has grown suddenly worse.”</p>
<p>Salome accompanied him to the front door, in order to
lock it after his departure; and, as he descended the steps, he
turned and said, in a subdued voice,—</p>
<p>“You have probably heard that Mrs. Gerome is a very
peculiar,—indeed, a decidedly eccentric person?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; it is reported that she is almost a lunatic.”</p>
<p>“Which is totally false. She is very sensitive, and shrinks
from strangers, and consequently has no friends here. If I
should find Elsie dying, or if I need you, I wish you to come
promptly. It may be necessary to have some one beside the
household, and you are the only person I can trust. Try to
go to sleep immediately, for I may send for you very early in
the morning.”</p>
<p>“I shall be ready to come when I am needed.”</p>
<p>The buggy rolled up to the steps, and Dr. Grey sprang into
it and drove swiftly down the avenue.</p>
<p>Salome crept softly back up stairs, but Miss Jane called
out,—</p>
<p>“Who is there, in the hall? What is the matter?”</p>
<p>The girl opened the door, and put her head inside.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey has been called to see a sick woman at ‘Solitude,’
and I have just locked the door after him.”</p>
<p>“Why could not Rachel do that, and save you from coming
down stairs? What time of night is it?”</p>
<p>“About half-past two. Rachel is asleep. Good-night.”</p>
<p>“‘Solitude,’ did you say?”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>“Well, if people will persist in burrowing in that unlucky
den, they must take the consequences. Ulpian, poor fellow,
will be completely worn out. Good-night, dear; don’t get up
to breakfast, if you feel sleepy.”</p>
<p>Salome went to her own room, changed her dress, laid
gloves, hat, and shawl in readiness upon the bed, and threw
herself down on the lounge to rest, and if possible to sleep.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_244"></a>244</span></div>
<p>When Dr. Grey reached “Solitude,” he found Robert Maclean
pacing the paved walk that led to the gate.</p>
<p>“Oh, doctor! Have you come at last? It seems to me I
could have crawled twice to your house, since Jerry came
back.”</p>
<p>“What change has taken place in your mother’s condition?
She was better than usual, when I saw her last.”</p>
<p>“We thought she was getting along very well, till all of
a sudden she became speechless. Go in, sir; don’t stop to
knock.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome sat at the bedside, mechanically chafing one of
the hands that lay on the coverlet, and the face of the dying
woman was not more ghastly than the one which bent over
her. As Dr. Grey approached, the mistress of the house
rose, and put out her hands towards him, with a wistful,
pleading, childish manner, that touched him inexpressibly.</p>
<p>“Do not let her die.”</p>
<p>He leaned over the pillow, and put his finger on the
scarcely palpable pulse.</p>
<p>“Elsie, tell me where or how you suffer.”</p>
<p>A ray of recognition leaped up in her sunken eyes, and she
looked at him with a yearning, imploring expression, that was
pitiable and distressing indeed.</p>
<p>He saw that she was struggling to articulate, but failing
in the effort, a groan escaped her, and tears gathered and
trickled down her pinched face. He smoothed her contracted
forehead, and said, soothingly,—</p>
<p>“Elsie, you feel that I will do all that I can to relieve you.
You can not talk to me, but you know me?”</p>
<p>She inclined her head slightly, and in examining her he
discovered that only one side was completely paralyzed, and
that she could still partially control her left arm. When he
had done all that medical skill could suggest, he stood at her
side, and she suddenly grasped his fingers.</p>
<p>He put his face close to hers, and observing her tears start
afresh, whispered,—</p>
<p>“You wish to tell me something before you die?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_245"></a>245</span></div>
<p>A gurgling sound, and a faint motion of her lips was the
only reply of which she was capable.</p>
<p>He placed a pencil between her fingers, but she could not
use it intelligibly, and he noticed that her eyes moved from
his to those of her mistress, as if to indicate that she was
the subject of the desired conversation.</p>
<p>It was distressing to witness her efforts to communicate
her wishes, while the tears dripped on her pillow; and unable
to endure the sight of her anguish, Mrs. Gerome sank on her
knees and hid her face in the coverlet.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey gently lifted Elsie’s arm and placed her hand on
the head of her mistress, and the expression of her face assured
him he had correctly interpreted her feelings. Something
still disturbed her, and he suggested,—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, put your hand in hers.”</p>
<p>She silently obeyed him, and then the old woman’s eyes
looked once more intently into his. He could not conjecture
her meaning, until, in feeling her pulse, he found that she
was trying to touch his fingers with hers.</p>
<p>He slipped his own into the palm where Mrs. Gerome’s lay,
and, by a last great effort, she pressed them feebly together.</p>
<p>Even then, the touch of those white, soft fingers, thrilled
his heart as no other hand had ever done, and he said,—</p>
<p>“Elsie, you mean that you leave her in my care? That
you put her in my hands? That you trust her to me?”</p>
<p>It was impossible to mistake the satisfied expression that
flashed over her countenance.</p>
<p>“I accept the trust. Elsie, I promise you that while I
live she shall never want a true and faithful friend. I will
try to take care of her body, and pray for her soul. I will
do all that you would have done.”</p>
<p>Once more, but very faintly, she pressed the two hands she
had clasped, and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, doctor, can’t you save her?” sobbed Robert.</p>
<p>In the solemn silence that ensued Mrs. Gerome lifted her
face, and Dr. Grey never forgot the wild, imploring gaze, that
met his. He understood its import, and shook his head. She
rose instantly, moved away from the bed, and left the room.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_246"></a>246</span></div>
<p>For nearly an hour Dr. Grey hung over the prostrate form,
which lay with closed eyes, and gradually sank into the
heavy lethargic sleep, from which he knew she could never
awake.</p>
<p>Leaving her to the care of Robert and two female servants,
he went in search of the mistress of the silent and dreary
house.</p>
<p>Taking a lamp from the escritoire in the back parlor, he
went from room to room, finding nowhere the object he
sought, and at length became alarmed. As he stood in the
front door, perplexed and anxious, the thought presented itself
that she might have gone down to the beach. He went back
to the apartment occupied by the dying woman,—felt once
more the sinking pulse, and took a last look at the altered
and almost rigid face.</p>
<p>“Robert, I can do her no good. Her soul will very soon
be with her God.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sir, don’t leave her! Don’t give her up, while there
is life in her body!” cried the son, grasping the doctor’s
sleeve.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey put his hand on the Scotchman’s shoulder, and
whispered,—</p>
<p>“I am going to hunt for Mrs. Gerome. She is not in the
house. I may be able to render her some service, but your
mother is beyond all human aid.”</p>
<p>“Is there any pulse?”</p>
<p>“It is so feeble now, I can scarcely count it.”</p>
<p>“Please, doctor, stay here by her while she breathes.
Don’t desert the dear soul. My poor mother!”</p>
<p>Robert lost all control of himself, and wept like a child.</p>
<p>Loth to forsake him in this hour of direst trial, Dr. Grey
leaned against the bed, and for some moments watched the
irregular convulsive heaving of the woman’s chest.</p>
<p>“Oh, sir, if my mistress hadn’t a heart of stone, she would
have let her die peacefully. She might at least have granted
her dying prayer.”</p>
<p>“What was it?”</p>
<p>“All of yesterday afternoon she pleaded with her to be
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_247"></a>247</span>
baptized. My mother—God bless her dear soul!—my mother
told her that she could not consent to die until she saw her
baptized; and, with the tears pouring down her poor face,
she begged and prayed that I might fetch the minister from
town, and that she might see the ceremony performed. But
my mistress walked up and down the floor, and said, ‘Never!
never! I have done with mockeries. I have washed my hands
of all that,—long, long ago.’ And now—it is too late; and
my poor mother can never—God be merciful to us! is it all
over?”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey raised the head, but the breathing was imperceptible
and, after a little while, he softly pressed down the
lids that were partially lifted from the glazed eyes, and quitted
the room.</p>
<p>His buggy stood at the rear gate, and the driver was
asleep, but his master’s voice aroused him.</p>
<p>“Elbert, go home, and ask Miss Salome please to come over
as soon as you can drive her here.”</p>
<p>The east was purple and gold, the sea a purling mass of
molten amber, and only two stars were visible low in the west,
where a waning moon swung on the edge of the distant misty
hills. The air was chill, and a silvery haze hung above the
moaning waves, and partially veiled the windings of the
beach. Under the trees that clustered so closely around the
house, the gloom of night still lingered like a pall, but as Dr.
Grey approached the terrace, he felt the pure fresh presence
of the new day. Up and down the sands his eyes wandered,
hoping to discern a woman’s figure, but no living thing was
visible, except the flamingo and yellow pheasant still
perched where they had spent the night, on the stone balustrade
that bordered the terrace. He took off his hat to
enjoy the crystalline atmosphere, and while he faced the
brightening east, the sharp peculiar bark of the Arab greyhound
broke the solemn silence that brooded over sea and
land.</p>
<p>The sound proceeded from the boat-house, and he hastened
towards it, startling a mimic army of crabs and fiddlers that
had not yet ended their nightly marauding. The tide was
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_248"></a>248</span>
higher than usual at this early hour, and the waves were breaking
sullenly against the stone piers.</p>
<p>As Dr. Grey ascended the iron steps leading to the pavilion,
the dog growled and showed his teeth, but the visitor succeeded
in partially winning him over, and now passed unmolested
into the circular room. A cushioned seat extended
around the wall, where windows opened at the four points
of the compass; and on the round table in the centre of the
marble-tiled floor lay a telescope.</p>
<p>At the eastern window sat Mrs. Gerome, with her head
resting on her crossed arms. Although Dr. Grey’s steps
echoed heavily, as he trod the damp mosaic where the mist
had condensed, she gave no evidence of having discovered his
presence until he stood close beside her. Then she raised one
hand, with a quick gesture of caution and silence. He sat
down near her, and watched the countenance that was fully
exposed to his scrutiny.</p>
<p>No tears had dimmed the wide, mournful, almost despairing
eyes, that gazed with strange intentness over the amber
sea, at the golden radiance that heralded the coming sun; and
every line and moulding of her delicate features seemed cold
and rigid enough for a cenotaph. Even the lips were still and
compressed, and a bluish shadow lay about their dimpled
corners, and under the heavy jet eyelashes. Her silver comb
had become loosened, and was finally dragged down by the
coil of hair that slipped slowly until it fell upon the morocco
cushion of the seat, and the glistening waves of gray hair
rolled around her shoulders, and rippled low on her brow.
Sea fog had dampened and sea wind tossed this mass of white
locks, till it made a singular burnished frame for the wan
face that looked out hopeless and painfully quiet.</p>
<p>Her silk <i>robe de chambre</i> of leaden gray, bordered with
blue, was unbuttoned at the throat, and showed its faultless
curve and contour; while the full, open sleeves, blown back
by the strong breeze, bared the snowy arms, where one of the
jet serpents that formed her bracelets, pressed so heavily on
the white flesh that a purple band was visible when the hand
was raised and the bracelet slipped back.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_249"></a>249</span></div>
<p>Watching her intently, Dr. Grey could not detect the slightest
quiver of nerve or muscle; and she breathed so low and
softly that he might have doubted whether she was really
conscious, if he had not correctly interpreted the strained expression
of the unwinking gray eyes whose pupils contracted
as the sky flushed and kindled.</p>
<p>On the floor lay a dainty handkerchief, and stooping to
pick it up, he inhaled the delicate, tenacious perfume of tube-rose,
which, blended with orange-flowers, he had frequently
discovered when standing near her.</p>
<p>Placing it within reach of her fingers, he said, very gently
and more tenderly than he was aware of,—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome,—”</p>
<p>“Hush! I know what you have come to tell me. I knew
it when I came away. Let me alone, now.”</p>
<p>She raised her head, and turned her eyes to meet his, and he
shuddered at the hard, bitter look, that came swiftly over the
blanched features. For some seconds they gazed full at each
other, and Dr. Grey’s eyes filled with a mist that made hers
seem large and radiant as wintry stars.</p>
<p>He knew then that his heart was no longer his own,—that
this wretched, solitary woman, had installed herself in its
most sacred penetralia; that she had not suddenly, but gradually,
become the dearest object that earth possessed.</p>
<p>He did not ask himself whether she filled all his fastidious
and lofty requirements,—whether she rose full-statured to his
noble standard,—whether reverence, perfect confidence, and
unqualified admiration would follow in the footsteps of mere
affection. He neither argued, nor trifled, nor deceived himself,
but bravely confessed to his own true soul, that, for the
first time in his life, he loved warmly and tenderly the only
woman whose touch had power to stir his quiet, steady pulses.</p>
<p>He had not intended to surrender his affections to the custody
of any one until reason and judgment had analyzed,
weighed, and cordially endorsed the wisdom of his choice;
and now, although surprised at the rashness with which his
heart, hitherto so tractable and docile, vehemently declared
allegiance to a new sovereign, he did not attempt to mask or
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_250"></a>250</span>
varnish the truth. Thoroughly comprehending the fact that
it was neither friendship nor compassion, he gravely looked
the new feeling in the face, and acknowledged it,—the tyrant
which sooner or later wields the sceptre in every human heart.</p>
<p>Had he faithfully kept his compact with himself, and followed
the injunction of Joubert, “Choose for a wife only the
woman, whom, were she a man, you would choose for your
friend”?</p>
<p>Because he found a fascination in her society, should he
conclude that it was a healthful atmosphere for his sturdy,
exacting, uncompromising nature?</p>
<p>To-day he swept aside all these protests and questions, postponing
the arraignment of his heart before the tribunal of
slighted and indignant reason, and allowed the newly mitred
pontiff to lead him whither she chose.</p>
<p>Unconscious of the emotions that brought an unusual glow
to his face and light to his eyes, Mrs. Gerome had dropped
her head once more on her arms, and the weary, despairing
expression of her countenance, as she looked at the gilded
horizon, where sea and sky seemed divided only by a belt of
liquid gold,—might have served for the face of some careless
Vestal, who, having allowed the fire to expire on the altar
she had sworn to guard sleeplessly, sat hopeless, desolate, and
doomed,—watching from the dim, cheerless temple of Hestia,
the advent of that sun whose rays alone could rekindle the
sacred flame, and which, ere its setting, would witness the execution
of her punishment.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey bent over her, and said,—</p>
<p>“I came here in quest of you, hoping to persuade you to
return to the house.”</p>
<p>“No. You came to tell me that Elsie is dead. You came
to break the news as gently as possible,—and to pity and try
to comfort me. You are very good, I dare say; but I wish to
be alone.”</p>
<p>“You have been too long alone, and I can not consent to
leave you here.”</p>
<p>At the sound of his subdued voice, she turned her face towards
him, and, for a moment,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_251"></a>251</span></div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“A strange slow smile grew into her eyes,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>As though from a great way off it came<br>
And was weary ere down to her lips it fluttered,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>And turned into a sigh, or some soft name<br>
Whose syllables sounded likest sighs<br>
Half-smothered in sorrow before they were uttered.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“Dr. Grey, my loneliness transcends all parallels, and is
beyond remedy. Why should I not stay here? All places are
alike to me, now. That cold, silent corpse at the house, is
not Elsie; and, since she has been taken, I shall be utterly
alone, go where I may.”</p>
<p>She shivered, and he picked up a crape shawl lying in a
heap under the table, and wrapped it around her. The soft
folds were damp, and, as he lifted the veil of hair, to draw
the shawl closer about her shoulders and throat, he felt that
it was moist from the humid atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Sir, I am not cold,—I wish I were. It is useless to wrap
up my body so warmly, and leave my heart shivering until
death freezes it utterly.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey took her beautiful white hands in his warm palms,
and held them firmly.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, you do not know what is best for you, and
must be guided by one who will prove himself your truest
friend.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mock my misery! I never had but one friend, and
henceforth must live friendless. I knew what was before me,
and therefore I dreaded this dark, dark day, and begged you
to save her. She was the world to me. She supplied the
place of father, mother, husband, society, and because God
saw that her loving sympathy and care made my existence
a trifle less purgatorial than He saw fit to render it, He took
her away. My poor Elsie would quit the highest throne in
heaven to come back to her desolate, dependent child; for only
she knew how and why I trusted and leaned upon her. Ah,
God! it is hard that I who have so long shunned strangers
should be at their mercy, in the last hour of trial that can be
devised by fiends, or allowed by heaven to afflict me.”</p>
<p>She struggled to free her hands and hide her face, but her
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_252"></a>252</span>
companion clasped them in one of his, and attempted to draw
her head down to his shoulder.</p>
<p>“No, sir! The grave is the only resting-place for my poor,
accursed head. Do not touch me.”</p>
<p>She shrank as far as possible from him, and her voice,
hitherto so firm and dry, trembled.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, I intend to take Elsie’s place. You had
confidence in her sagacity and penetration, and know that she
was cautious in all things. During her long illness she
studied my character and antecedents, and finally begged me
to take you under my guardianship when she could no longer
watch over you. She was importunate in her appeal, and to
comfort and compose her I gave her a solemn promise that at
her death I would take her place. You may deem me intrusive,
and perhaps presumptuously impertinent, but time
proves all things, and, after a little while, you will cling to
me as you so long clung to her. I shall wait patiently for
your confidence; shall deserve,—and then exact it. You need
a strong arm to curb and guide you,—you need a true, honest
heart, to sympathize with your sorrows and difficulties,—you
need a fearless friend to defend you from the assaults of gossip
and malice; and all these, if God spares my life, I am resolved
to be to you. You can not repulse, or offend, or chill,
or wound me, for my word is sacredly pledged to the dead;
and, by the grace of God, I will strictly and fully redeem it,
when we meet at the last day.”</p>
<p>The earnestness of his manner, the grave resolution of his
tone, and the invincible fearlessness with which his clear,
calm, penetrating eyes, looked into hers, seemed momentarily
to overawe her; and she sat quite still, pondering his unexpected
words. Pressing her cold fingers very gently, he
continued,—</p>
<p>“Elsie had such confidence in my discretion, and friendly
interest in your welfare, that she requested me to warn her of
her approaching dissolution in order that she might communicate
something, which she assured me she desired to confide
to me before her death. The paralysis of her tongue prevented
the fulfilment of her wish, but you saw how keenly she
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_253"></a>253</span>
suffered from her inability to utter what was pressing on her
heart. You can not have forgotten that her last act was to
put your hand in mine, and you heard my solemn acceptance
of the charge committed to me.”</p>
<p>An expression of dread that bordered on horror, came over
her ghastly face, and her hands grasped his, almost spasmodically.</p>
<p>“Did she hint what she wished to tell you? Did you guess
it all?”</p>
<p>“No. Whatever her secret may have been, it passed unuttered
into that realm where all mysteries are solved. I
neither know nor surmise the nature of her desired revelation,
but some day when you fully understand me, I shall ask you
to tell me that which she believed I ought to know. My dear
madam, when I come to you and demand your confidence, I
have no fear that you will withhold it.”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes as if to shut out some painful vision,
and drooped her head lower, till it rested on her chest.</p>
<p>The sun flashed up from his ocean bed, and, as the first
beams fell on the woman’s hair, Dr. Grey softly passed his
broad white hand over its perfumed masses, redolent of orange
flowers.</p>
<p>“The air is too damp for you. Come with me to the
house.”</p>
<p>She did not heed his words, and perhaps his touch on her
head recalled some exquisitely painful memory, for she shook
it off, and exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Doubtless, like the remainder of the curious herd, you are
wondering at my ‘crown of glory,’—and conjecturing what
dire tragedy bequeathed it to me. Sir,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘My hair was black, but white my life:<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>The colors in exchange are cast!<br>
The white upon my hair is rife,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>The black upon my life has passed.’</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Dr. Grey, I understand you; but you need not stay here to
keep guard over me, as if I were an imbecile or a refugee from
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_254"></a>254</span>
an insane asylum. That I am not the one or the other, is
attributable to the fact that my powers of endurance are almost
fabulous. You fear that in my loneliness and complete
isolation I may turn coward, at the last ordeal I am put
through,—and, like Zeno cry out, and in a fit of desperation
strangle myself? Dr. Grey, make yourself easy. I do not
love my Creator so devotedly that I must needs hurry into his
presence before He sees proper to send me a summons.’”</p>
<p>“I am afraid to leave you here, for any woman who does
not love and reverence her Maker, requires a guardian. Of
course you will do as you like, but I shall remain here as long
as you do.”</p>
<p>He rose, and crossing his arms on his chest, began to walk
about the pavilion. She caught up her hair, twisted it hastily
into a knot, and secured it with her comb. As she did so, a
small cluster of double violets dropped into her lap. She had
gathered them the preceding afternoon, had carried them as
an offering to Elsie, who insisted that she should wear them
in her hair, “they looked so bonnie just behind the little
roguish ear.” At her request Mrs. Gerome had placed them
at the side of her head, and the old woman made her lean
down that she might smell them, and leave a kiss on their blue
petals. Now the sight of the withered flowers melted her icy
composure, and, as she lifted the little crushed, faded bouquet,
and pressed it against her wan cheek, a moan broke from her
colorless lips.</p>
<p>“Oh, Elsie,—Elsie! How could you desert me? You knew
you were all I had to love and trust,—and how could you die
and leave me alone,—utterly alone, in this miserable world
that has so cruelly injured me!”</p>
<p>She clasped her hands passionately over the flowers, and the
motion caused the sapphire ring, which was now much too
large, to slip from the thin finger, and roll ringing across
the marble floor.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey picked it up, and as he replaced it, drew her hand
under his arm, and led her out of the boat-house. They
walked slowly, and as they ascended the steps, he saw his
buggy approaching the side gate.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_255"></a>255</span></div>
<p>Opening the parlor door, he drew his companion into the
room, where the Psyche lamp still burned brightly.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, will you trust me?”</p>
<p>He had hoped that a return to the house would touch her
heart and make her weep, but the cold, dry glitter of her eyes
disappointed him.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I trust neither men nor women, nor even the
angels in heaven; for one of them turned serpent, and if
tradition be true, made earth the dismal ‘Bochin’ I have
found it.”</p>
<p>She turned from him, and threw herself wearily upon the
divan that filled the recess of the oriel window.</p>
<p>Securing the door of the library, he extinguished the lamp,
and closing the parlor went out to meet Salome.</p>
<hr class="toprule">
<div class="chsp">
<a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Doctor Grey, you look weary and anxious.”</p>
<p>“I feel so, for this has been a memorable night.”</p>
<p>“The servant who opened the gate for us said that the poor
old woman died about day-break.”</p>
<p>“Yes; when I arrived I found her speechless, and of course
could <ins title="Was no">do</ins> nothing but watch her die. Come down this walk, I
wish to talk to you before you go into the house.”</p>
<p>He pointed to a serpentine walk, overarched by laurustinus,
and they had proceeded some yards before he spoke again.</p>
<p>“Salome, I believe you told me that you had met Mrs.
Gerome?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; once upon the cliffs, a mile below, I saw her for
a few moments.”</p>
<p>“She is a very eccentric woman.”</p>
<p>“I should judge so, from her appearance.”</p>
<p>“Her life seems to have been blighted by early griefs, and
she has grown cynical and misanthropic. Loving no one but
her faithful and devoted nurse, she has completely isolated
herself, and consequently the death of this servant—companion—nay,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_256"></a>256</span>
foster-mother—is a terrible blow to her. I
want your promise that what you may hear or witness in this
house shall not travel beyond its walls to feed the worse-than-Ugolino
hunger of never-satiated scandal and gossip.”</p>
<p>Salome’s brow contracted and darkened.</p>
<p>“Do you class me among newsmongers and character-cannibals?”</p>
<p>“If I did, you certainly would not be here at this instant.
I sent for you to come and take my place temporarily, as I
am compelled to see a patient many miles distant, who is
dangerously ill. The majority of women might go away, and
comment upon the occurrences of this melancholy day, but I
wish to keep sacred all that Mrs. Gerome desires to screen
from public gaze and animadversion. Because she is not fond
of society, it revenges itself by circulating reports detrimental
to the owner of a house which is elegantly furnished, not for
popular praise, but solely for her own comfort and gratification.
While I regard her course as very deplorable, and
particularly impolitic for one so young and unprotected, I am
totally unacquainted with the reasons that control her; and,
in this hour of grief and bitterness, I earnestly desire to
shield her from intrusion and impertinent scrutiny.”</p>
<p>“In other words, you wish me to have eyes and yet see not,—and
having ears to hear not? You must indeed have little
confidence in my good sense, and still less in my feminine sympathy
for the afflicted, if you suppose that under existing circumstances
I could come to the house of mourning to collect
materials to be rolled as sweet morsels under the slanderous
tongues, that already wag so industriously concerning ‘Solitude’
and its solitary mistress. Verily, I occupy a lofty niche
in your estimation, and it would doubtless be pardonably
prudent in you to reconsider, and bid Elbert take me home
with all possible dispatch, before I see Fatima or Bluebeard.”</p>
<p>“When will you cease to be childish, and remember that a
woman’s work lies before you?”</p>
<p>“You may date that desirable transmogrification from the
hour when you cease to stir up the mud and dregs in my
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_257"></a>257</span>
nature, by doubting the possibility that they will ever settle,
and leave a pure medium between your soul and mine. Just
so soon,—and no sooner.”</p>
<p>“My young friend, you are too sensitive. I now offer you
the strongest proof of confidence that I can ever hope to command.
Will you take charge of this stricken household in my
absence, and not only superintend the arrangements necessary
for the funeral, but watch over Mrs. Gerome and see that no
one disturbs her?”</p>
<p>“You may trust me to execute her wishes and your orders.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. There certainly is no one except you whom I
would trust in this emergency. One thing more; if Mrs.
Gerome leaves the house, do not lose sight of her. It may be
necessary to keep a very strict surveillance over her, and I
will return as soon as possible, and relieve you.”</p>
<p>As they entered the house, Salome said,—</p>
<p>“You will stop at home and get your breakfast?”</p>
<p>“No, I shall not have time.”</p>
<p>“Let me make you a cup of coffee before you start.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, it is not necessary; and besides, the house is
in such confusion that it would be difficult to obtain anything.
Come with me.”</p>
<p>She followed him into the dim room, where the tall but
emaciated form of Elsie Maclean had been dressed for its last
long sleep. The housemaid sat at the bedside, and Robert
stood at one of the windows.</p>
<p>The first passionate burst of grief had spent itself, and the
son was very calm.</p>
<p>At a sign from Dr. Grey he came forward, and bowed to the
stranger.</p>
<p>“Robert, I am obliged to be absent for several hours, and
Miss Owen will remain until I return. If you need advice or
assistance come to her, and do not disturb Mrs. Gerome, who is
lying on a sofa in the parlor. I will drive through town, and
send your minister out immediately.”</p>
<p>“You are very good, sir. Do you think the funeral should
take place before to-morrow? I want to speak to my mistress
about it.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_258"></a>258</span></div>
<p>“For her sake, it is advisable that it should not be delayed
beyond this afternoon. It is very harrowing to know that the
body is lying here, and I think she would prefer to leave all
these matters to you. It would be better for all parties to
have the funeral ceremonies ended this evening.”</p>
<p>“I suppose, sir, you know that my poor mother will be
buried here, in the grounds.”</p>
<p>“For what reason? The cemetery is certainly the best
place.”</p>
<p>Robert handed a slip of paper to Dr. Grey, who read, in a
remarkably beautiful chirograph, the following words,—</p>
<p>“Robert, it was your mother’s desire and is my wish that
she should be buried near that cluster of deodar cedars, just
beyond the mound. Send for an undertaker, and for the
minister who visited her during her illness; and let everything
be done as if it were my funeral instead of hers. Put some
geranium leaves and violets in her dear hands, and upon her
breast.”</p>
<p>“When did you receive this?” asked Dr. Grey.</p>
<p>“A moment ago, Phœbe, the cook, brought it to me from
my mistress.”</p>
<p>“Of course you have no choice, but must comply with her
wishes and those of the dead. Still, I regret this decision.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; it is ill luck to keep a grave near the eaves of a
house, and it will be bad for my mistress to have it always in
sight; for she mopes enough at best, and does not sleep
o’ nights, and the Lord only knows what will become of her
with my poor mother’s corpse and coffin within ten yards of
her window. Sir, how does she take this awful blow? It
comforted me to know you were with her.”</p>
<p>“She bears this affliction as she seems to have endured all
others that have overtaken her, in a spirit of rebellious bitterness
and defiance. I am afraid that the excitement will
seriously injure her. Salome, I will return as early as the
safety of a patient will permit.”</p>
<p>Robert followed the doctor to his buggy, to consult him
with reference to some of the sad details of the impending
funeral, and after a hasty glance at the placid countenance of
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_259"></a>259</span>
the dead, Salome went back to the hall, and sat down opposite
to the parlor door, which had been pointed out to her. Her
nerves were strong, healthy, and firm, but the presence of
death, the profound silence that reigned, the chill atmosphere,
and dreary aspect of the house,—all conspired to oppress her
heart.</p>
<p>Through the open door she could see the ever restless sea,
and hear its endless murmuring monotone, and imagination
seizing the ill-omened legends she had heard recounted concerning
this spot, peopled the corners of the hall with phantoms,
and every flitting shadow on the lawn became a spectre.</p>
<p>Now and then the servants—two middle-aged women—passed
softly to and fro, and twice Robert crossed the passage,
but not a sound issued from the parlor; and once, when
Phoebe came with her mistress’s breakfast on a waiter, and
tried the bolt, she found the door locked. She knocked several
times, but receiving no answer went quietly back to the
kitchen.</p>
<p>Weary of sitting on one of the hard, uncomfortable walnut
chairs, that stood with its high carved back close to the wall,
Salome rose, and amused herself by studying the engravings
that surrounded her. In the midst of her investigations she
was startled by a loud, doleful, blood-curdling sound, that
seemed to proceed from some spot immediately beneath the
floor of the hall. It was different from anything she had ever
heard before, but resembled the prolonged howl of a dog, and
rose and fell on the air like a cry from some doomed spirit.</p>
<p>Robert came out of the room which his mother had always
occupied, and, as he passed Salome, she asked,—</p>
<p>“What is the matter? What is the meaning of that horrible
noise?”</p>
<p>“Only the greyhound howling at the dead that he knows is
lying over his head. Ah, ma’am! The poor brute sees what
we can’t see, and his death-baying is awful.”</p>
<p>“Where is he? The sound seems to come through the
floor.”</p>
<p>“He is so savage that I was afraid he would hurt some of
the strangers who will come here to-day, so I chained him in
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_260"></a>260</span>
the basement. Hist, ma’am! Did you ever hear anything so
dreadful? It raises the hair off my head.”</p>
<p>He went down stairs, and the howling, which was caused by
the fact that the dog was hungry and unaccustomed to being
chained, ceased as soon as he was set free. Ere long Robert
came back, followed by the greyhound, whose collar he grasped
firmly. At sight of Salome he growled and plunged towards
her, but Robert was on the alert, and held him down. Leading
him to the parlor door, the gardener knocked, and put his
mouth to the key-hole.</p>
<p>“If you please, ma’am, will you let Greyhound in? It
won’t do to leave him at large, and when I chain him he almost
lifts the roof with his howls.”</p>
<p>No reply reached Salome’s strained ears, but the door was
opened sufficiently to admit the dog, who eagerly bounded in,
and then the click of the lock once more barred intrusion;
and when the joyful barking had ceased, all grew silent once
more.</p>
<p>From a basket of fresh flowers brought in by the boy who
assisted Robert, Salome selected the white ones and made a
wreath, which she laid aside and sprinkled; then gathering
some rose and nutmeg geranium-leaves, and a few violets
blooming in jars that stood on the gallery, she cautiously
glided into the chamber of death, and arranged them in
Elsie’s rigid hands.</p>
<p>Soon after, the undertaker and minister arrived, and while
they conferred with Robert concerning the burial service, the
girl went back to her vigil before the parlor door, and endeavored
to divert her thoughts by looking into a volume of
poems that lay on the hall table. The book opened at
“Macromicros,” where a brilliant verbena was crushed between
the leaves, and delicate undulating pencil-lines enclosed
the passage beginning,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“O woman, woman, with face so pale!<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Pale woman, weaving away<br>
A frustrate life at a lifeless loom.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Slowly the hours wore away, and at noon Elsie’s body was
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_261"></a>261</span>
placed in the coffin and left on a table in the room opposite
the parlor.</p>
<p>It was two o’clock when Dr. Grey came up the steps, looking
more fatigued than Salome had ever seen him. He sat
down beside her on the gallery, and sighed as he caught a
glimpse of the men who were bricking up the grave that
yawned on the right hand side of the lawn.</p>
<p>“Where is Mrs. Gerome?”</p>
<p>“In the parlor. Once I heard her pacing the floor very
rapidly, and saying something to her dog. Since then—two
hours ago—not a sound has reached me.”</p>
<p>“She has taken no food?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. The servant who prepared her breakfast knocked
twice at the door, but was refused admittance.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey went into the hall, and rapped vigorously on the
door, but there was no movement within.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, please permit me to speak to you for a few
minutes. If it were not necessary, I would not disturb you.”</p>
<p>The appeal produced no effect; and, without hesitating, he
walked to the door of the library or rear parlor,—took the key
from his pocket, opened it, and entered.</p>
<p>The dog was asleep on the velvet rug before the hearth,
and his mistress sat at her escritoire, with her arms resting on
the blue desk, and her face hidden upon them. A number of
letters and papers were scattered about, and, in an open
drawer a silver casket was visible, with a pearl key in its
lock.</p>
<p>Before the marble Harpocrates stood two slender violet-colored
Venetian glasses, representing tulips, and filled with
fuchsias and clematis that were dropping their faded velvet
petals, and the atmosphere was sweet with the breath of carnations
and mignonette blooming in the south window.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey hoped that Mrs. Gerome had fallen asleep; but
when he bent over her, he saw in the mirror above her that the
large, bright eyes were gazing vacantly into the recess of the
desk.</p>
<p>She noticed his image reflected in the glass, and instantly
sat upright, spreading her hands over her papers as if to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_262"></a>262</span>
screen them. He drew a chair near hers, and put his finger
on her pulse, which throbbed so rapidly he could scarcely
count it.</p>
<p>“Have you slept at all, since I left you this morning?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You promised that you would not attempt to destroy
yourself.”</p>
<p>“I have kept my word.”</p>
<p>“Yes; you ‘keep it to our ear, and break it to our hope,’
for you must know that unless you take some rest and refreshment,
you will be seriously ill.”</p>
<p>He saw a spark leap up in her eyes, like a bubble tossed
into sunshine by a sudden ripple, and she shook back the hair
that seemed to oppress her.</p>
<p>“Do not tease and torment me, now. I want to be quiet.”</p>
<p>“My task is an unpleasant one, therefore I shall not postpone
it. In a short time—within the next hour—Elsie will
be buried, and you owe a last tribute of gratitude and respect
to her remains. Will you refuse it to the faithful friend to
whom you are indebted for so much affection and considerate
care?”</p>
<p>“She would not wish me to do anything that is so repugnant,
so painful to me.”</p>
<p>“Have you no desire to look at her kind, placid face once
more?”</p>
<p>“I wish to remember it as in life,—not rigid and repulsive
in death.”</p>
<p>“She looks so tranquil you would think she was sleeping.”</p>
<p>“No,—no! Don’t ask me. I never saw but one corpse,
and that was of a sailor drowned in mid ocean, and I shall
never be able to forget its ghastliness and distortion as it lay
on deck, under sickly moonshine.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, you must follow Elsie’s body to the grave.
Believe that I have good reasons for this request, and grant
it.”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Your habits of seclusion have subjected you to uncharitable
remarks, and your absence from the funeral would
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_263"></a>263</span>
create more gossip than any woman can afford to give grounds
for. There is a rumor that you are deranged, and the best
refutation will be your quiet presence at the grave of your
faithful nurse.”</p>
<p>She straightened herself, haughtily.</p>
<p>“Seven years ago I turned my back upon the world, and
scorned its verdict.”</p>
<p>“The men or women who defy public opinion invite social
impalement, and rarely fail to merit the branding and opprobrium
they invariably receive. Madam, I should imagine
that to a nature so refined and shrinking as yours, almost any
trial would seem slight in comparison with the certainty of
becoming a target for sarcasm, pity, and malice, in every
kitchen in the neighborhood. Permit my prudence to prevail
over your reluctance to the step I have advised, and some day
you will thank me for my persistency. You have time to make
the proper changes in your dress, and, when the hour arrives,
I will knock at your own door. My dear madam, do not
delay.”</p>
<p>She rose, and began to replace the papers in the drawers of
her desk, which she closed and locked.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, why should you care if I am slandered?”</p>
<p>“Because I am now your best friend, and must tell you
frankly your foibles and dangers, and endeavor to guard you
from the faintest breath of detraction.”</p>
<p>“I am very suspicious concerning the motives of all who
come about me; and, at times, I have been so unjust as to
ascribe even my poor Elsie’s devotion to a desire to control
my fortune for the benefit of herself and child. Do you expect
me to trust you more implicitly than I ever trusted
her?”</p>
<p>“I shall make it impossible for you to doubt me. Come to
your room. Elsie’s few acquaintances will soon be here.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome thrust the key of her desk into her pocket,
but a moment after, when she drew out her handkerchief, it
fell on the carpet, and without observing it, she passed swiftly
across the hall, and into her own apartment.</p>
<p>As Dr. Grey lingered to secure the door, his eye fell upon
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_264"></a>264</span>
the silver key on the floor; and, placing it in his vest pocket,
he rejoined Salome.</p>
<p>At four o’clock several of Robert’s friends came and seated
themselves in the room where the coffin sat wreathed with
flowers; and immediately after, Mr. and Mrs. Spiewell made
their appearance, accompanied by two ladies whose features
were concealed by thick veils. Robert and the servants soon
joined them, and Salome stole into the room and sat down in
one corner.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey tapped softly at the door of Mrs. Gerome’s apartment,
and she came out instantly, and walked firmly forward
till she stood in the presence of the dead. She was dressed in
black silk, and wore two heavy lace veils over her bonnet,
which effectually screened her countenance. Crossing the
floor, she stood at Robert’s side, and the minister rose and began
the burial service.</p>
<p>When a prayer was offered, all the other persons present
bowed their heads, but the mistress of the mansion remained
erect and motionless; and, as the pall-bearers took up the coffin
and proceeded to the grave, she followed Robert.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey stepped to her side and offered his arm, but she
took no notice of the act, and walked on as if she were an
automaton.</p>
<p>The service was concluded, the coffin lowered, and, amid
Robert’s half-smothered sobs, the mound was raised under the
deodars, whose long shadows slanted athwart it, in the dying
sunlight.</p>
<p>The little group dispersed, and Mr. Spiewell led his wife to
the owner of “Solitude.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, Mrs. Spiewell and I have long desired the
pleasure of your acquaintance, and hope, if you need friends,
you will permit us—”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your kindness in visiting my faithful old
Elsie.”</p>
<p>The tall, veiled figure had cut short his speech by a quick,
imperative gesture of her hand; and, turning instantly away,
disappeared in one of the densely shaded walks that wound
through the grounds.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_265"></a>265</span></div>
<p>Dr. Grey escorted the party to their carriages, and as he
handed Mrs. Spiewell in, she said, in her sharp nasal tones,—</p>
<p>“I heard that Mrs. Gerome was devotedly attached to the
poor old creature who had nursed her, but she certainly seems
to me very indifferent and heartless.”</p>
<p>“She is more deeply afflicted by her loss than you can
possibly realize, and I am exceedingly apprehensive that she
will be ill in consequence of her inability to sleep or eat. My
dear madam, we must not judge too hastily from appearances,
else we shall deserve similar treatment. Who are those two
ladies veiled so closely?”</p>
<p>“Friends, I presume, or they would not be here.”</p>
<p>But the little woman seemed uneasy, and flushed under the
doctor’s searching gaze.</p>
<p>“I hope dear Miss Jane is as well as one can ever expect
her to be in this life. Come, Charles; you forget, my dear,
that we have a visit to make before tea-time. I notice, doctor,
that you have a new carpet on the floor of your pew, and
a new cushion-cover to match; and, indeed, you are so fine
that the remainder of the church seems quite faded and
shabby. Good evening, doctor; my love to all at home.”</p>
<p>The clergyman’s gray pony trotted off with his master and
mistress, and Dr. Grey returned to Salome, who waited for
him at the steps of the terrace.</p>
<p>“What do you suppose brought Mrs. Channing and Adelaide
to the poor old woman’s funeral?” asked the orphan.</p>
<p>“How did you discover them?”</p>
<p>“I found this handkerchief, whose initials I embroidered
two months ago, and recognize as belonging to Mrs. Channing.
As for Miss Adelaide, when she moved her veil a little aside to
peep at Mrs. Gerome, I caught a glimpse of her pretty face.
Do they visit here?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not; nobody visits here but the butcher, baker,
and doctor. Those ladies came solely on a tour of inspection,
and to gratify a curiosity that is not flattering to their characters.
My dear child, you look tired.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, what is there so mysterious about this house
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_266"></a>266</span>
and its owner that all the town is agog and agape when the
subject is mentioned? What is Mrs. Gerome’s history?”</p>
<p>“I am totally unacquainted with its details, and only
know that since she became a widow, she has been a complete
recluse. She is very unhappy, and we must exert ourselves
to cheer her. This has been a lonely, dreary day to you, I
fear, and I trust it will not be necessary for me to ask you to
remain here to-night.”</p>
<p>The sun had set, leaving magnificent cloud-pictures on sky
and sea, and while the orphan turned to enjoy the glorious
prospect above and around her, Dr. Grey went in search of the
lonely women who now continually occupied his thoughts.</p>
<p>She was standing under the pyramidal cedars, looking down
at the new grave, where Salome’s wreath hung on the head-board,
and hearing approaching footsteps would have moved
away, but he said, pleadingly,—</p>
<p>“Do not avoid me.”</p>
<p>She paused, and suddenly held out her hands to him.</p>
<p>“Ah,—is it you? Dr. Grey, what shall I do? How can
I bear to live here,—alone,—alone.”</p>
<p>He took her hands and looked down into her white, chill
face.</p>
<p>“My dear friend, take your suffering heart to God, and He
will heal, and comfort, and strengthen you. If He has sorely
afflicted you, try to believe that Infinite love and mercy
directed all things, and that ultimately every sorrow of earth
will be overruled for your eternal repose and happiness. Remember
that this world is but a threshing-floor, where angels
use afflictions as flails, to beat the chaff and dust from our
hearts, and present them as perfect grain for the garners of
God. I know that you are desolate, but you can never be
utterly alone, since the precious promise, ‘Lo! I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the world.’”</p>
<p>Despairingly she shook her head.</p>
<p>“All that might comfort some people, but it falls on my
ears and heart like the sound of the clods on Elsie’s coffin. I
have no religion,—no faith,—no hope,—in time or eternity.
My miserable past entombs all things.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_267"></a>267</span></div>
<p>“Do not unearth your woes,—let the grave seal them.
Your life stands waiting to be sanctified,—dedicated to Him
who gave it. My dear friend,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘Cleanse it and make it pure, and fashion it<br>
After His image: heal thyself; from grief<br>
Comes glory, like a rainbow from a cloud.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The sound of his voice, more than the import of his words,
seemed to soothe her, for her eyes softened; but the effect was
transitory, and presently she exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Mere ‘sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal!’ Pretty
words, and musical; but empty as those polished shells yonder
that echo only hollow strains of the never silent sea. Once,
Dr. Grey,—”</p>
<p>She paused, and a shiver crept through her stately form;
then she slowly continued, in a tone of indescribable pathos,—</p>
<p>“Once I could have listened to your counsel, for once my
soul was full of holy aims, and my heart as redolent of pure
Christian purposes as a June rose is of perfume; but now,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘They are past as a slumber that passes,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>As the dew of a dawn of old time;<br>
More frail than the shadows on glasses,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>More fleet than a wave or a rhyme.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Dr. Grey drew her arm through his, and silently led her to
the house, and into the parlor. He noticed that her breathing
was quick and short, and that she sank wearily upon the sofa,
as if her strength had well-nigh failed her.</p>
<p>He untied her bonnet-strings and removed it, and she threw
her head down on the silken cushion, as a spent child might
have done.</p>
<p>Taking a vial from his pocket, he dropped a portion of the
contents into a wine-glass, and filled it with sherry wine.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, drink this for me. It will benefit you.”</p>
<p>She swallowed the mixture, and remained quiet for some
seconds; then a singularly scornful smile curved her mouth as
she said,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_268"></a>268</span></div>
<p>“You drugged the wine. Well, so be it. Nepenthe or
poison are alike welcome, if they bring me death, or even temporary
oblivion.”</p>
<p>Katie came in and lighted the lamp, and Dr. Grey sat beside
the sofa and watched the effect of his prescription.</p>
<p>Tired at length of the sober sea and dark gloomy grounds,
Salome came back to the house and stood on the threshold of
the parlor door, looking curiously at the quiet, silent group,
and at the pictures on the walls.</p>
<p>She could see very distinctly the beautiful white face of the
mistress pressed against the blue damask cushion, and clear in
outline as she had once observed it on the background of
ocean; and she noticed that the features were sharper and
that the figure was thinner. From the silvery lamp-light
the gray hair seemed to have caught a metallic lustre on the
ripples that ebbed back from the blue-veined temples, and the
woman looked like a marble snow-crowned image, draped in
black.</p>
<p>With one elbow on his knee, and his cheek resting in his
hand, Dr. Grey leaned forward, studying the features turned
towards him, and watching her with almost breathless interest.
He was not aware of Salome’s presence, and was unconscious
of the strained, troubled gaze, that she fixed upon him.</p>
<p>The tender love that filled his heart looked out of his grave
deep eyes, which never wandered from the face so dear to
him, and moved his lips in an inaudible prayer for the peace
and welfare of the lonely waif whom Providence or fate had
brought into his path, to evoke all the tenderness latent in
his sturdy, manly nature.</p>
<p>In the twinkling of an eye, Salome had learned the whole
truth and standing there, she staggered and grasped the doorway
for support, wishing that the heavens and earth would
pass away—that death might smite her, and end the agony
that never could be patiently endured.</p>
<p>Recently she had tutored herself to bear the loss of his love
and the deprivation of his caresses,—she had mapped out a
future in which her lot was one of loneliness,—but through all
the network of coming years there ran like a golden cord binding
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_269"></a>269</span>
their destinies the precious hope that at least Dr. Grey
would die as he had lived hitherto,—without giving to any
woman the coveted place in his heart, where the orphan would
sooner have reigned than upon the proudest throne in Europe.</p>
<p>She had prayed that, with this assurance, God would help
her to be contented—would enable her to make her life useful
and pure, and, like Dr. Grey’s, a blessing to those about her.</p>
<p>It had never occurred to her that the man whom she reverenced
above all things human or divine, and whose exalted
ideal of feminine perfection soared as far above her as the
angels in Lebrun’s “Stoning of St. Stephen” soared above
the sinning multitude below them—that the man whose fastidiousness
concerning womanly character and deportment
seemed exaggerated and almost morbid, could admire or defend,
much less love that gray-haired widow, whom the world
pronounced either a lunatic, or a scoffing, misanthropic infidel.</p>
<p>The discovery was so unexpected, so startling, that it
partially stunned her; and, like one addicted to somnambulism,
she softly crossed the room and stood behind Dr. Grey’s
chair.</p>
<p>He had taken Mrs. Gerome’s hand to examine her pulse,
and retained it in his, looking fondly at the dainty moulding
of the fingers and the exquisite whiteness of the smooth skin.
How long she stood there Salome never knew, for paralysis
seemed creeping, numb and cold, over her heart and brain.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey saw that his exhausted patient was asleep, and
knew that the opiate he had administered in the wine would
not relinquish its hold until morning; and when her breathing
became more quiet and regular he bent his head and
softly kissed the hand that lay heavily in his.</p>
<p>Salome covered her face and groaned; and rising, he was
for the first time cognizant of her presence. His face flushed
deeply.</p>
<p>“How long have you been here?”</p>
<p>“Long enough to discover why you visit ‘Solitude’ so
often.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_270"></a>270</span></div>
<p>He could not see her countenance, but her unnaturally
hollow tone pained and shocked him.</p>
<p>“You are very much fatigued, my dear child, and as soon
as I have given some directions to Robert, I will take you
home. Get your bonnet, and meet me at the door.”</p>
<p>He took a shawl that was lying on the piano and laid it
carefully over the sleeper, then bent one knee beside the sofa,
and mutely prayed that God would comfort and protect the
woman who was becoming so dear to him.</p>
<p>With one long, anxious, tender look into her hopeless yet
beautiful face, he left the room and went in search of Robert
and Katie. When he had given the requisite directions, and
descended the steps, he found Salome waiting, with her fingers
grasping the side of the buggy. Silently he handed her
in; and, as she sank back in one corner and muffled her face,
they drove swiftly through the sombre grounds, where the
aged trees seemed murmuring in response to the ceaseless
mutter of the sullen sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Ulpian, you certainly do not intend to sit up again to-night?
Even brass or whitleather would not stand the wear
and tear that your constitution is subjected to. You really
make me unhappy.”</p>
<p>“My dear Jane, it would make you still more unhappy if
from mere desire to promote my personal ease and comfort, I
could forget the solemn responsibility imposed by my profession.
Moreover, my physical strength is quite equal to
the tax I exact from it.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_271"></a>271</span></div>
<p>“I doubt it, for we have all remarked how pale and worn
you look.”</p>
<p>“My jaded appearance is attributable to mental anxiety,
rather than bodily exhaustion.”</p>
<p>“If Mrs. Gerome is so ill as to require such unremitting
care and vigilance, she should have a nurse, instead of expecting
a physician to devote all his time and attention to her.
Where is Hester Denison?”</p>
<p>“I have placed her at the steam-mill above town, where
there is a bad case of small-pox, and even if she were not thus
engaged, I should not take her to ‘Solitude.’”</p>
<p>“Pray, why not? She took first-rate care of me when I was
so sick last year.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome is morbidly sensitive at all times, and at
this juncture I should be afraid to introduce a stranger into
her sick room.”</p>
<p>“When people are so excessively nervous about being seen,
I can’t help feeling a little suspicious. Do you suppose that
Mrs. Gerome loved her husband so much better than the
majority of widows love theirs, that seven years after his death
she can’t bear to be looked at? I like to see a woman show
due respect to her husband’s memory, but I tell you my experience—or
rather my observation—leads me to believe that
these young widows who make the greatest parade of their
grief, and load themselves with crape and bombazine till they
can scarcely stagger under their flutings, flounces, and jet-fringes,
are the most anxious to marry again.”</p>
<p>“Stop, my darling sister! Who has been filling your
tongue and curdling all the ‘milk of human kindness’ in your
generous heart? If women refuse to each other due sympathy
in sorrow, to what quarter can they turn for that balm which
their natures require? I never before heard you utter sentiments
that trenched so closely upon harsh uncharitableness.
Your lips generally employ only the silvery language of
leniency, which I so much love to hear, but to-day they adopt
the dialect of Libeldom. Recollect, my dear sister, that even
the pagan Athenians would never build a temple to Clemency,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_272"></a>272</span>
which they contended found her most appropriate altars in
human hearts.”</p>
<p>“Pooh, Ulpian! You need not preach me such a sermon,
as if I were a heathen. Facts, when they happen to be real
facts, are the best umpires in the world, and to their arbitrament
I leave my character for charity. When Reuben Chalmers
died, his wife was so overwhelmed with grief that she
shut herself up like a nun; and when she drove out for fresh
air wore two heavy crape veils, and never allowed any one to
catch a glimpse of her countenance. Not even to church did
she venture, until one morning, at the end of two years, she
laid aside her weeds, clad herself in bridal array, was married
in her own parlor, and the next Sunday made her first appearance
in public after the death of her husband, leaning on
the arm of her second spouse. Now, that is true,—is no
libel,—pity it is not! Though ‘one swallow does not make
a summer,’ I can’t help feeling suspicious of very young and
hopelessly inconsolable widows, and am always reminded of
Anastasia Chalmers. So you see, my blue-eyed preacher, when
your old Janet talks of these things, she is not caught ‘reckoning
without her host.’”</p>
<p>“One deplorable instance should not bias you against an
entire class, and the beautiful constancy of Panthea ought to
neutralize the example of a hundred Anastasia Chalmers. Is
it not unfortunate that poor human nature so tenaciously
recollects all the evil records, and is so oblivious of the noble
acts furnished by history? Do cut the acquaintance of the
huge family of <i>on dits</i>, who serve the community in much the
same capacity as did the cook of Tantalus, when he dressed
and garnished Pelops for the banquet table. Unluckily,
devouring malice can not furnish the ‘ivory shoulder’ requisite
to mend its mischief. We are all prone to forget the
injunction, ‘Judge not, that ye be not judged,’ and instead of
remembering that we are directed to bear one another’s burdens,
we gall the shoulders of many, by increasing the weights
we should lighten. Janet, don’t flay all the poor young
widows; leave them to such measures of peace as they may
find among their weeds.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_273"></a>273</span></div>
<p>Miss Jane listened to her brother’s homily with a half-smile
lurking about the puckered corners of her eyes and mouth, and
putting her finger in the button-hole of his coat, drew him
closer to her, as they sat together on the sofa.</p>
<p>“How long since you took the tribe of widows under your
special protection?”</p>
<p>“Since the moment, that, owing to some inexplicable
freak, my dear Janet suffered ‘evil communications to corrupt’
her ‘good manners,’ and absolutely forgot to be just
and generous.”</p>
<p>He kissed his sister and rose, but the troubled look that
settled once more on his countenance did not escape her observation.</p>
<p>“Ulpian, is Mrs. Gerome very ill?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am exceedingly unhappy about her. She is dangerously
ill with a low, nervous, fever that baffles all my remedies.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey walked up and down the room, and Miss Jane
pressed her spectacles closer to her nose, and watched him.</p>
<p>“If the poor woman leads such a lonely, miserable life, I
should think that death would prove a blessed release to her.
Of course it is natural and reasonable that you should desire
to save all your patients, but why are you so very unhappy
about her?”</p>
<p>He did not answer immediately, and when he spoke his deep
tone was tremulous with fervent feeling.</p>
<p>“Because I find that she is dearer to me than all the other
women in the world, except my sister; and her death would
grieve me more than any trial that has yet overtaken me—more
than you can realize, or than I can express.”</p>
<p>He took Miss Jane’s face in his hands, kissed her, and left
the room.</p>
<p>Meeting Muriel and Salome in the hall, the former seized
his arm, and exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“You shall not leave home again! Let me tell Elbert to
put up your buggy. If you continue to work yourself down,
as you are now doing, you will be prematurely old, and gray,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_274"></a>274</span>
and decrepit. Come into the parlor, and let me play you to
sleep.”</p>
<p>“I heartily wish I could follow your pleasant prescription,
but duty is inexorable, and knows no law but that of obedience.”</p>
<p>“Must you sit up to-night? Is that poor lady no better?”</p>
<p>“I can see no improvement, and must remain until I do.”</p>
<p>“You are afraid that she will die?”</p>
<p>“I hope that God will spare her life.”</p>
<p>His serious tone awed Muriel, who raised his hand to her
lips, and murmured,—</p>
<p>“My dear doctor, I wish I could help you. I wish I could
do something to make you look less troubled.”</p>
<p>“You can help me, little one, by being happy yourself, and
by aiding Salome in cheering my sister, while I am forced
to spend so much time away from her. Good evening. Take
care of yourselves till I come home.”</p>
<p>Humming a bar of a Genoese barcarole, Muriel ran up
stairs to join her governess; but Salome turned and followed
the master of the house to the front door.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, can I render you any assistance at ‘Solitude’?”</p>
<p>“Thank you,—the time has passed when you might have
aided me. Two weeks ago, when I requested you to go with
me, Mrs. Gerome was rational and would have yielded to your
influence, but now she is delirious and you could accomplish
nothing. The servants are faithful and attentive, and can be
trusted during my absence to execute my orders.”</p>
<p>A bright flush rose to Salome’s temples, and her eyes
drooped beneath his, so anxious and yet so calmly sad.</p>
<p>“At the time you spoke to me I could not go, but now I
really should be glad to accompany you. Will you take me?”</p>
<p>“No, Salome.”</p>
<p>“Your reason, Dr. Grey?”</p>
<p>“Is one whose utterance would pain you, consequently I
trust you will pardon me for withholding it.”</p>
<p>“At my own peril, I demand it.”</p>
<p>“The motive which prompts your offer precludes the possibility
of my acceptance.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_275"></a>275</span></div>
<p>“How dare you sit in judgment on my motives? You who
prate and homilize of charity! charity! and who quote the
‘golden rule’ solely for the edification and guidance of those
around you. Example is more potent than precept, and we
are creatures of imitation. Suppose I should question the
disinterestedness of your motives in allowing one patient to
monopolize your attention to the detriment of the remainder?
Of course you would be shocked and think me presumptuous,
for one’s sins and follies often play hide and seek, and sometimes
we insult our own pet fault when we find it housed in
some other piece of flesh.”</p>
<p>“Good night, Salome. I shall endeavor to forget all this,
since I am too sincerely your friend to desire to set your
hasty words in the storehouse of memory.”</p>
<p>He looked down pityingly, sorrowfully, into her angry imperious
eyes, and sudden shame smote her, making her cheeks
glow and tingle as if from the stroke of an open hand.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, wait one moment! Let me say something, that
will show,—that will—”</p>
<p>“Only make matters worse. No, Salome, I have little time
for trifling, still less for recrimination, none at all for dissimulation;
and, in your present mood, the least we can say
will prove the most powerful for good.”</p>
<p>He went down to his buggy, but stopped and reflected;
and fearing that he might have been too harsh, he turned and
approached her, as she stood leaning against one of the
columns of the gallery.</p>
<p>“Do not think me rude. I am not less your friend than
formerly, though I am anxious, and doubtless appear preoccupied.
Let us shake hands in peace.”</p>
<p>He extended his own, but the girl stood motionless, and the
remorseful anguish and humiliation of her uplifted face
touched his heart.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, if you really forgive and forget, prove it by
taking me to ‘Solitude.’”</p>
<p>“Do not ask what you well know I have quite determined it
is best that I should not grant.”</p>
<p>The spark leaped up lurid as ever, in her dilating eyes.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_276"></a>276</span></div>
<p>“You take this method to punish me for my refusal to
comply with your wishes a fortnight since?”</p>
<p>“I have neither the right nor inclination to punish you
in any respect, and you must pardon my inability to accede
to a request which my judgment does not approve. Good-by.”</p>
<p>He put his hand into his pocket, and left her; and while
she stood irresolute and disappointed, a servant summoned
her to Miss Jane’s presence.</p>
<p>“Can I do anything for you?” asked the orphan, observing
the cloud on the old lady’s brow.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear; sit down here and talk to me. I feel lonely,
now that Ulpian is away so constantly. He seems very uneasy
about that woman at ‘Solitude,’ and I never saw him
manifest so much anxiety about any one. By the by, Salome,
tell me something concerning her.”</p>
<p>“I have already told you all I know of her.”</p>
<p>“Wherein consists her attractiveness?”</p>
<p>“Who said she was attractive? She is handsome, and there
is something peculiar and startling about her, but she is by
no means a beauty. I have heard Dr. Grey say that she possessed
remarkable talent, but I have been favored with no
exhibition of it. Why do you not question your brother?
Doubtless it would afford him much pleasure to furnish an inventory
of her charms and accomplishments, and dilate upon
them <i>ad libitum</i>.”</p>
<p>“What makes you so savage?”</p>
<p>“Simply because there happens to be a touch of the wild
beast in my nature, and I have not a doubt that if the doctrine
of metempsychosis be true, I was a tawny dappled leopardess
or a green-eyed cougar in the last stage of my existence.
Miss Jane, sometimes I feel as if it would be a luxury—a relief—to
crunch and strangle something or somebody,—which
is not an approved trait of orthodox Christian character, to
say nothing of meek gentility and lady-like refinement.”</p>
<p>She laughed with a degree of indescribable scorn and bitterness
that was pitiable indeed in one so young.</p>
<p>“There is an evil fit on Saul.”
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_277"></a>277</span></p>
<p>“Yes; and you are neither my harp nor my David.”</p>
<p>“Does my little girl expect to find a ‘cunning player,’ who
will charm away all the barbarous notions that occasionally
lead her astray, and tempt her to wickedness?”</p>
<p>“Verily,—no. The son of Jesse has forsaken his own
household, and made unto himself an idol elsewhere; and I—Saul—surrender
to Asmodeus.”</p>
<p>Miss Jane laid her hand on the girl’s arm, and said, in a
hesitating, troubled manner,—</p>
<p>“Has Ulpian told you?”</p>
<p>“Why should he tell me? My eyes sometimes take pity on
my ears,—and seeing very distinctly, save the necessity of
hearing. My vision is quite as keen now as when in my anterior
existence, I crouched in jungles, watching for my prey.
Oh, Miss Jane! if you could look here, and know all that I
have suffered during the past three weeks, you would not
wonder that the tiger element within me swallows up every
other feeling.”</p>
<p>She struck her hand heavily upon her heart, and the old
lady was frightened and distressed by the glitter of the eyes
and the dilation of the slender nostrils.</p>
<p>“When I came in, I knew from your countenance that you
had heard something which you desired to prepare me for,—which
you intended to break gently to me. But your kindness
is unavailing. The truth crashed in on my heart without premonition;
and I saw, and understood, and accepted the inevitable;
and since then,—ah, my God! since then—”</p>
<p>Her head drooped upon her bosom, and a groan concluded
the sentence.</p>
<p>“Perhaps Ulpian only pities the poor woman’s desolation,
and will lose his interest in her when she recovers her health.
You know how tenderly he sympathizes with all who suffer,
and I dare say it is more compassion than love.”</p>
<p>“What hypocrites we often are, in our desire to comfort
those whom we see in agony! Miss Jane, your kind heart is
holding a hand over the mouth of conscience, to smother its
cries and protests while you utter things in which you know
there is no truth. You mean well; but you ought to know
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_278"></a>278</span>
better than to expect to deceive me. I understand the difference
between love and compassion, and so do you; and Dr.
Grey has not kept the truth from you. He has given his heart
to that gray-haired, gray-eyed woman,—and if she lives, he
will marry her; and then, if there were twenty oceans, I
should want them all to roll between us. I tell you now, I
can not and will not stay here to see the day that makes that
pale gray phantom his wife. I should go mad, and do something
that might add new horrors to that doomed and abhorred
‘Solitude,’ that has become Dr. Grey’s Mecca. I
could live without his love, but I can not stand tamely by and
see him lavish it on another. Some women,—such, for instance,
as we read of in novels, would meekly endure this
trial, as one appointed by Heaven to wean them from earth;
would fold their hands, and grow devout, and romantically
thin and wan,—and get sweet, patient, martyr expressions
about their unkissed lips; but I am in no respect a model
heroine, and it will prove safer for us all if I am far away
when Dr. Grey brings his bride to receive your sisterly embrace.
If you are lonely, send for Muriel and Miss Dexter,
and let them entertain you. Just now, I am not fit company
for any but the dwellers in Padalon; so let me go away where
I can be quiet.”</p>
<p>“Stay, Salome! Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“To walk.”</p>
<p>The orphan disengaged her dress from Miss Jane’s fingers,
which had clutched its folds to detain her, and made her
escape just as Muriel tapped at the door.</p>
<p>During the three weeks that had elapsed since Elsie’s death
Mrs. Gerome had not left the house, and the third day after
the funeral she laid her head down on the pillow from which
it seemed probable she would never again lift it.</p>
<p>A low steady fever seized her, and at length her brain became
so seriously affected that all hope of recovery appeared
futile and delusive. In the early stages of her illness, Dr.
Grey requested Salome to assist him in nursing her, but the
girl dared not trust herself to witness the manifestations of
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_279"></a>279</span>
an affection that nearly maddened her, and had almost rudely
refused compliance.</p>
<p>As the days wore drearily on, and Dr. Grey’s haggard,
anxious countenance, told her that her rival was indeed upon
the brink of dissolution, a wild hope whispered that perhaps
she might be spared the fierce ordeal she so much dreaded;
that if Mrs. Gerome died, the future might brighten,—life
would be endurable. In her wonted impulsive manner, the
girl had thrown herself on her knees, and passionately prayed
the Almighty to remove from earth the one woman who
proved an obstacle to all her hopes of peace and contentment.</p>
<p>She did not pause to inquire whether her petition was not
an insult to Him who alone could grant it; she neither
analyzed, nor felt self-rebuked for her sinful emotions and
intense hatred of the sick woman,—but vowed repeatedly
that she would lead a purer, holier life, if God would only interpose
and prevent Dr. Grey from becoming the husband
of any one.</p>
<p>She had no faith in the superior wisdom of her Maker, and
would not wait patiently for the developments of His divine
will toward her; but chose her own destiny, and demanded
that Omnipotence should become an ally for its accomplishment.
Like many who are less honest in confessing their
faith, this girl professed allegiance to her Creator only so
long as He appeared a coadjutor in her schemes; and, when
thwarted and disappointed, fierce rebellion broke out in her
heart, and annulled her oaths of fealty and obedience.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey was not ignorant of the emotions that swayed and
controlled her conduct, and when she declared herself ready
to attend the invalid, he was thoroughly cognizant of the fact
that she longed to witness the death which she deemed impending;
and he could not consent to see her eager eyes watching
the feeble breathing of the woman whom he now loved so
fervently.</p>
<p>While he believed that in most matters Salome would not
deceive him, he realized that in one of her passionate moods
of jealous hate, irremediable mischief might result, and prudently
resolved to keep her beyond the pale of temptation.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_280"></a>280</span></div>
<p>It was almost dark when he reached the secluded house
where he had passed so many days and nights of anxiety, and
went into the quiet room in which only a dim light was permitted
to burn. Katie was sitting near the bed, but rose at
his approach, and softly withdrew.</p>
<p>Emaciated and ghastly, save where two scarlet spots burned
on the hollow cheeks, Mrs. Gerome lay, with her wasted arms
thrown over her head, and her eyes fixed on vacancy. Even
when delirium was at its height she yielded to the physician’s
voice and touch, like some wild creature who recognizes no
control save that of its keeper; and from his hand alone would
she take the medicines administered.</p>
<p>Whether the influence was merely magnetic, he did not
inquire, but felt comforted by the assurance that his presence
had power to tranquillize her.</p>
<p>Now, as he drew her arms down from the pillow, and took
her thin hot hand in his cool palms, a shadowy smile stole
over her features, and she fixed her eyes intently on his.</p>
<p>“I knew you would protect me from him.”</p>
<p>“Protect you from whom?”</p>
<p>“From Maurice. He is hiding yonder,—behind the window-curtain.”</p>
<p>She pointed across the room, and a scowl darkened her
countenance.</p>
<p>“You have only been dreaming.”</p>
<p>“No, I am awake; and if you look behind the curtain you
will find him. His eyes are burning my face.”</p>
<p>Willing to dispel this fantasy, Dr. Grey went to the window,
and, drawing aside the lace drapery, showed her the vacant
recess.</p>
<p>“Ah, he has escaped! Well, perhaps it is better so, and
there will be no blood shed. Let him go back to Edith,—‘golden-haired
Edith Dexter,’—and live out the remnant of
his days. He came hoping to find me dead, but I am not as
accommodating now as formerly. Where are those violets?
Tell Elsie to bring the jars in, where I can smell them.”</p>
<p>He took a bunch of the fragrant flowers from his coat
pocket, and put them in her hand, for during her illness she
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_281"></a>281</span>
was never satisfied unless there was a bouquet near her; and
now, having feebly smelled them, her eyes closed.</p>
<p>More than once she had mentioned the name of Edith Dexter,
always coupling it with that of Maurice, who she evidently
believed was lurking with evil purposes around her
home; and Dr. Grey was sorely perplexed to follow the thread
that now and then appeared, but failed to guide him to any
satisfactory solution of the mystery. He knew that since she
made “Solitude” her place of residence, Mrs. Gerome had
never met Muriel’s governess, and he conjectured that she had
either known her in earlier years or now alluded to another
person bearing the same name. Miss Dexter was very fair,
with a profusion of light yellow hair, and suited in all respects
the incoherent description that fell from the sick
woman’s lips.</p>
<p>While at home for a short time that afternoon, Dr. Grey
had spoken of the dangerous condition of his patient, and
asked the governess if she had ever seen or known Mrs. Gerome.
Without hesitation, Edith Dexter quietly replied in
the negative.</p>
<p>Formerly he had indulged little curiosity with reference to
the widow’s history, but since she had become endeared to
him, he was conscious of an earnest desire to possess himself
of a record of all that had so darkened and chilled the life
of the only woman he had ever loved.</p>
<p>Once she had been merely an interesting psychological puzzle,
and in some degree a physiological anomaly: but from
the day of Elsie’s death, his heart had yielded more and more
to the strange fascination she exerted over him; and now, as
he sat looking into her face, so mournfully sharpened and
blanched by disease, he acknowledged to his own soul that if
she should die the brightest and dearest hopes that ever gladdened
his life would be buried in her grave.</p>
<p>Thoroughly convinced that his happiness depended on her
recovery, he prayed continually that if consistent with God’s
will, He would spare her to him, and save him from the
anguish of a lonely life, which her love might bless and
brighten.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_282"></a>282</span></div>
<p>But above the petition,—above all the strife of human love,
and hope, and fear,—rose silvery clear, “Nevertheless,
Father, not my will, but Thine.”</p>
<p>During his long vigils he had allowed imagination to paint
beautiful pictures of the To-Come, wherein shone the figure
of a lovely wife whose heart was divided only between God
and her husband,—whose life was consecrated first to Christ,
secondly to promoting the happiness of the man who loved her
so truly.</p>
<p>The apprehension of losing her was rendered still more
acute by the reflection that her soul was not prepared for its
exit from the realm of probation, and the thought of a separation
that would extend through endless æons, was well-nigh
intolerable.</p>
<p>If she survived this attack, he believed that his influence
would redeem and sanctify her life; if she died, would God
have mercy on her wretched soul?</p>
<p>His faith in Providence was no jagged, quivering reed, but
a strong, staunch, firm staff that had never yet failed him,
and in this hour of severe trial he leaned his aching heart
confidently and calmly upon it.</p>
<p>That some mysterious circumstances veiled the earlier portion
of Mrs. Gerome’s life, he had inferred from Elsie’s
promise of confidence, and since death denied her the desired
revelation, he had put imagination upon the rack, in order to
solve the riddle.</p>
<p>What could the old nurse wish to tell him, that she was
unwilling to divulge until her latest breath? Could the stain
of crime cling to that pale face on the pillow, or to those
white hands that rested so helplessly in his? Had she soiled
her life by any deed that would bring a blush to those thin
sunken cheeks, or a flush of shame to the brow of the man
who loved her? Now bending fondly over her, the language
of his heart was,—</p>
<p>“Let her dead past bury its dead! Let the bygone be what
it may,—come sorrow, come humiliation, but I will dauntlessly
shield her with my name, defend her with my strong
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_283"></a>283</span>
arm, uphold her by my honor, save her soul by my prayers,
comfort and gladden her heart with my deathless love.”</p>
<p>He was well aware that this night must decide her fate,—that
her feeble frame could not much longer struggle with the
disease that had almost vanquished it,—and leaning his forehead
against her hand, he silently prayed that God would
speedily restore her to health, or give him additional grace to
bear the bitter bereavement.</p>
<p>She slept more quietly than she had been able to do for
some days, and Dr. Grey sent for Robert, who was pacing the
walk that led to the stables. They sat down together on the
steps at the rear of the house, and the gardener asked in a
frightened, husky tone,—</p>
<p>“Is there bad news?”</p>
<p>“I see little change since noon, except that she is more
quiet, which is certainly favorable; but she is so very ill that
I thought it best to consult you about several matters. Do
you know whether she has made a will?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. How should I know it, even if she had?”</p>
<p>“Who is her agent?”</p>
<p>Robert hesitated, and pretended to be busy filling and lighting
his pipe.</p>
<p>“Maclean, I have no desire to pry into Mrs. Gerome’s affairs,
but it is necessary that those who direct or control her
estate should be appraised of her condition. It is supposed
that her fortune is ample, and her heirs should be informed
of her illness.”</p>
<p>“She has no heirs, except—”</p>
<p>He paused, and after a few seconds exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me! All I know is that I heard her say she
intended to leave her fortune to poor painters.”</p>
<p>“To whom shall I write, or rather telegraph? Where did
she live before she came to ‘Solitude’? Who were her
friends?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Simonton, of New York, is her lawyer and agent.
Two letters have come from him since she has been sick. Of
course I did not open them, but I know his handwriting.
They are behind the clock in the back parlor.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_284"></a>284</span></div>
<p>“Would it not be better to telegraph him at once?”</p>
<p>“What good could he do? Better send for the minister,
and have her baptized. Oh! but this is truly a world of
trouble, and I almost wish I was safely out of it.”</p>
<p>“If she were conscious, she would not submit to baptism;
and it would not be right to take advantage of her delirium
and force a ceremony to which she is opposed.”</p>
<p>“Not even, sir, to save her soul?”</p>
<p>“Her soul can not be affected by the actions of others, unless
her will coöperates, which is impossible in her present
condition. Robert, after your mother was partially paralyzed,
she said that she desired to confide something to me just before
her death, and intimated that it referred to Mrs. Gerome.
She wished me to befriend her mistress, and felt that I ought
to know the particulars of her early history. Unfortunately,
Elsie was speechless when I arrived, and could not tell me
what she had intended to acquaint me with. I mention this
fact to assure you that if your mother could trust me, you
need not regard me so suspiciously.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, as far as I am concerned, you are very welcome
to every thought in my head and feeling in my heart; but
where it touches my mistress I have nothing to say. I will
not deny that I know more than you do, but when my poor
mother told me, she held my hand on the Bible and made me
swear a solemn oath that what she told me should never pass
my lips to any man, woman, or child. So you must not blame
me, sir.”</p>
<p>“Certainly not, Robert. But if she has any friends it is
your duty to send for them at once.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey rose and went into the library, where for some
moments he walked to and fro, perplexed and grieved. As his
eye rested on the escritoire, he recollected the key which he
had kept in his pocket since the hour that he picked it up
from the carpet.</p>
<p>Doubtless a few minutes’ search in its drawers and casket
would place him in possession of the facts which Elsie wished
to confide; but notwithstanding the circumstances that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_285"></a>285</span>
might almost have justified an investigation, his delicate sense
of honor forbade the thought. Taking the letters from the
mantelpiece, he turned them to the lamp-light.</p>

<p>They were post-marked New York, and from the size and
appearance of the envelopes he suspected that they contained
legal documents. Perhaps one of them might prove a will,
awaiting signature and witnesses. Dr. Grey carried them
into the room where his patient still slept, and placed them
on the dressing-table. Accidentally his glance fell on a large
worn Bible that lay contiguous, and brightening the light, he
opened the volume, and turned to the record of births.</p>
<p>“Vashti Evelyn, born June 10th, 18—.</p>
<p>“Henderson Flewellyn, born April 17th, 18—.</p>
<p>“Vashti Flewellyn, born January 30th, 18—.”</p>

<p>“Married, September 8th, 18—, Evelyn Flewellyn to
Maurice Carlyle.”</p>
<p>The only deaths recorded were those of Henderson and
Vashti Flewellyn.</p>
<p>Whatever the mystery might be, Dr. Grey resolved to pursue
the subject no further; but wait patiently and learn all
from the beautiful lips of the white-faced sphinx, who alone
possessed the right to unseal the record of her blighted life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>
<p>The profound stillness that pervades a room where life
and death grapple for mastery, invites and aids that calm,
inexorable introspection, which Gotama Buddha prescribes
as an almost unerring path to the attainment of peace; and,
in the solemn silence of his last and memorable vigil, Dr.
Grey brought his heart into complete unmurmuring subjection
to the Divine will. A <i>soi-disant</i> “resignation” that
draws honied lips to the throne of grace, leaving a heart of
gall in the camp of sedition, could find no harbor in his
uncompromisingly honest nature; and though the struggle
was severe, he felt that faith in Eternal wisdom and mercy
had triumphed over merely human affection and earthly
hopes, and his strong soul chanted to itself the comforting
strains of Lampert’s “Trust Song.”</p>
<p>No mere gala barge, gay with paint and gaudy with
pennons, was his religion; no fair summer-day toy bearing
him lightly across the sun-kissed, breeze-dimpled sea of prosperity
and happiness, and frail as the foam that draped its
prow with lace; but a staunch, trim, steady, unpretending
bark, that with unfaltering faith at the helm, rode firmly all
the billows of adversity, and steered unerringly harborward
through howling tempests and impenetrable gloom. Human
friendships and sympathy he considered unstable and treacherous
as Peter, when he shrank from his Lord; but Christian
trust was one of the silver-tongued angels of God, ringing
chimes of patience and peace, far above the din of wailing,
bleeding hearts, and the fierce flames of flesh martyrdom.</p>
<p>One o’clock found Dr. Grey sitting near the pillow, where
for five hours Mrs. Gerome had slept as quietly as a tired
child. The fever-glow had burned itself out, and left an
ashen hue on the lips and cheeks.</p>
<p>Wishing to arouse her, he spoke to her several times and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_287"></a>287</span>
raised her head, but though she drank the powerful stimulant
he held to her mouth, her heavy eyelids were not lifted,
and when he smoothed the pillow and laid her comfortably
upon it, she slumbered once more.</p>
<p>At the foot of the bed, with his keen yellow eyes fastened
on his mistress, crouched the greyhound, his silky head on his
paws; and on a pallet in one corner of the room slept Katie,
ready to render any assistance that might be required.</p>
<p>The apartment was elegantly furnished, and green and
gold tinted all its appointments. On an Egyptian marble
table stood a work-box curiously inlaid with malachite and
richly gilded, and there lay some withered flowers, a small
thimble, and a pair of scissors with mother-of-pearl handles.
Around the walls hung a number of paintings, which, with
one exception, were landscapes or ocean-views; and as Dr.
Grey sat watching the shimmer of lamp-light on their
carved frames and varnished surfaces, they seemed to furnish
images of</p>

<p class="cg">“Green glaring glaciers, purple clouds of pine,<br>
White walls of ever-roaring cataracts;<br>
Blue thunder drifting over thirsty tracts,<br>
Rose-latticed casements, lone in summer lands,—<br>
Some witch’s bower; pale sailors on the marge<br>
Of magic seas, in an enchanted barge<br>
Stranded at sunset, upon jewelled sands.<br>
Some cup of dim hills, where a white moon lies,<br>
Dropt out of weary skies without a breath<br>

<p>No sweet-lipped, low-browed Madonnas, no rapt Cecilias, no
holy Johns nor meek Stephens, no reeling Satyrs nor vine-clad
<i>Bacchantés</i> relieved the eye, weary of mountain <ins title="Added comma">ghylls,</ins>
red-ribbed deserts, and stormy surfage.</p>
<p>One long narrow picture baffled interpretation, and excited
speculations that served in some degree to divert the sad
current of the physician’s thoughts.</p>
<p>It was a dreary plain, dotted with the “fallen cromlechs
of Stonehenge,” and in front of the desecrated stone altars
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_288"></a>288</span>
stood a veiled woman, with her hands clasped over a silver
crescent-curved knife, and her bare feet resting on oaken
chaplets and mistletoe boughs, starred and fringed with
snowy flowers. Under the dexterously painted gauze that
shrouded the face, the outline of the features was distinctly
traceable, end behind the film,—large, oracular, yet mournful
eyes, burned like setting stars, seen through magnifying
vapors that wreathe the horizon.</p>
<p>It was a solemn, desolate, melancholy picture, relieved by
no flush of color,—gray plain, gray distance, gray sky, gray
temple tumuli, and that ghostly white woman, gazing grimly
down at the gray-haired sufferer on the low bed beneath her.</p>
<p>Under some circumstances, certain pictures seem basilisk-eyed,
riveting a gaze that would gladly seek more agreeable
subjects, and it chanced that Dr. Grey found a painful
fascination in this piece of canvas that hung immediately in
front of him. Wherein consisted the magnetism that so
powerfully attracted him, he could not decide, but several
times when the wind blew the scalloped edge of the lace curtain
between the lamp and the picture, and threw a dim
wavering shadow over the figure on the wall, he almost expected
to see the veil float away from the stony face, and
reveal what the artist had adroitly shrouded. Now it looked a
doomed “Norma,” and anon the Nemesis of a dishonored
faneless faith, that was born among Magi, and had tutored
Pythagoras; and finally Dr. Grey rose and turned away to
escape its spectral spell.</p>
<p>Waking Katie, he charged her to call him if any change
occurred in his patient, and went to the front of the house
for a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Narcissus-like, a three-quarter moon was staring down at
her own image, rocked on the bosom of the sea, while dim
stars printed silver photographs on the deep blue beneath
them,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“And the hush of earth and air<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The wind that had blown steadily for two days past from
the south-east, had gone down into some ocean lair; but the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_289"></a>289</span>
sullen element refused to forget its late scourging, and occasionally
a long swelling billow dashed itself into froth
against the stone piers of the boat-house, and the cliffs which
stood like a phantom fleet along the southern bend of the
beach, were fringed with a white girdle of incessant breakers.</p>
<p>Far out from shore the rolling mass of water was darkly
blue, but now and then a wave broke over its neighbor, and
in the distance the foam flashed under moonshine like some
reconnoitring Siren-face, peeping landward for fresh victims;
or as the samite-clad arm that Arthur and Sir Bedivere saw
rise above the mere to receive Excalibar.</p>
<p>Following the beckoning of those snowy hands, and listening
to the low musical monologue that sea uttered to shore,
Dr. Grey started in the direction of the terrace, whence he
could see the whole trend of the beetling coast, but some
unaccountable impulse induced him to pause and look back.</p>
<p>The dense shadow of the trees shut out from the spot where
he stood the golden radiance of the moon, but over the lawn
it streamed in almost unearthly splendor,—and there he
saw some white object glide swiftly towards the group of
deodars. The first solution that occurred to his mind was
that Katie had fallen asleep, and Mrs. Gerome in her delirium
making her way out of the house, was seeking her favorite
walk; but a moment’s reflection convinced him that she was
too utterly prostrated to cross the room, still less the grounds,
and, resolved to satisfy himself, he followed the moving object
that retreated before him.</p>
<p>Walking rapidly but stealthily in the shadow of the trees
and shrubbery, he soon ascertained that it was a woman’s
figure, and saw that it stopped at Elsie’s grave, and bent down
to touch the head-board. Creeping forward, he had approached
within ten yards of her, when his hat struck the
lower limbs of a large acacia, and startled a bird that uttered
a cry of terror and darted out. The sound caused the figure
to turn her head, and catching a glimpse of Dr. Grey, she ran
under the dense boughs of the deodars, and disappeared.</p>
<p>He followed, and groped through the gloom, but when he
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_290"></a>290</span>
emerged, no living thing was visible; and, perplexed and
curious, he stood still.</p>
<p>After some moments he heard a faint sound, as of some
one smothering a cough, and pursuing it, found himself at
the boundary of the grounds. Here a thick hedge of osage
orange barred egress, and he saw the woman disentangling
her drapery from the thorns that had seized it.</p>
<p>Springing forward, he exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Stand still! You can not escape me. Who are you?”</p>
<p>A feigned and lugubrious voice answered,—</p>
<p>“I am the restless spirit of Elsie Maclean, come back to
guard her grave.”</p>
<p>In another instant he was at her side, and laying his hand
on the white netted shawl with which she was veiling her
features, he tore it away, and Salome’s fair face looked defiantly
at him.</p>
<p>“If I had known that my pursuer was Dr. Grey, I would
not have troubled myself to play the ghost farce, for of
course I could not expect to frighten you off; but I hoped you
were one of the servants, who would not very diligently chase
a spectre. I did not suppose that you could be coaxed or
driven thus far from your arm-chair beside the bed where
Mrs. Gerome is asleep.”</p>
<p>Astonishment kept him silent for some seconds, and, in the
awkward pause, the girl laughed constrainedly—nervously.</p>
<p>“After all your show of bravery in pursuing a woman, I
verily believe you are too much frightened to arrest me if
I chose to escape.”</p>
<p>“Salome, has something terrible happened at home, that
you have come here at midnight to break to me?”</p>
<p>“Nothing has happened at home.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you here? Are you, too, delirious?”</p>
<p>Her scornful laugh rang startlingly on the still night air.</p>
<p>“Oh, Salome! You grieve, you shock me!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Dr. Grey, you have assured me of that fact too
frequently—too feelingly—to permit me to doubt your sincerity.
You need not repeat it; I accept the assertion that
you are shocked at my indiscretions.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_291"></a>291</span></div>
<p>Compassion predominated over displeasure, as he observed
the utter recklessness that pervaded her tone and manner.</p>
<p>“I am unwilling to believe that you would, without some
very cogent reason, violate all decorum by coming alone at
dead of night two miles through a dreary stretch of hills and
woods. Necessity sometimes sanctions an infraction of the
rules of rigid propriety, and I am impatient to hear your
defence of this most extraordinary caprice.”</p>
<p>She was endeavoring to disengage the fringe of her shawl
from the hedge, but finding it a tedious operation, she caught
her drapery in both hands and tore it away from the thorns,
leaving several shreds hanging on the prickly boughs.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I have no defence to offer.”</p>
<p>“Tell me what induced you to come here.”</p>
<p>“An eminently charitable and commendable interest in
your fair patient. I came here simply and solely to ascertain
whether Mrs. Gerome would die, or whether she could possibly
recover.”</p>
<p>Unflinchingly she looked up into his eyes, and he thought
he had never seen a fairer, prouder, or lovelier face.</p>
<p>“How did you expect to accomplish your errand by wandering
about these grounds, exposing yourself to insult and to
injury?”</p>
<p>“I have been on the gallery since twilight, looking through
the lace curtains at Mrs. Gerome lying on her bed, and at
you sitting in the arm-chair. Her eyes are keener than
yours, for she saw me peeping through the window, and told
you so. When you left the room I came out among the trees
to escape observation. I scorn all equivocation, and have no
desire to conceal the truth, for if I am not dowered</p>

<p>They had walked away from the hedge, and Dr. Grey
paused at the mound, where the Ariadne gleamed cold and
white in the moonbeams that slanted across it like silver
lances.</p>
<p>Revolving in his mind the best method of extricating the
orphan from the unfortunate predicament in which her rashness
had plunged her, he did not answer immediately, and
Salome continued, impatiently,—</p>
<p>“If you imagine that I came here to act as spy upon your
actions, you most egregiously mistake me, for I know all that
the most rigid surveillance could possibly teach me. I heard
you say that this night would prove a crisis in Mrs. Gerome’s
case, and I was so anxious to learn the result that I could
not wait quietly at home until morning. I begged you to
bring me, and you refused; consequently, I came alone. Deal
frankly with me,—tell me, will that woman die?”</p>
<p>The breathless eagerness with which she bent towards him,
the strained, almost ferocious expression of her keen eyes,
sickened his soul, and he put his hand over his face to shut
out the sight of hers.</p>
<p>“Tell me the truth. I must and will know it.”</p>
<p>Her sweet clear voice had become a low hoarse pant, and
the knotted lines were growing harder and tighter on her
beautiful brow.</p>
<p>“I pray ceaselessly that God will spare her to me, and I
hope all things from His mercy. Another hour will probably
end my suspense, and decide the awful question of life or
death. Salome, if she should die, my future will be very
lonely,—and my heart bereft of the brightest, dearest hopes,
that have ever cheered it.”</p>
<p>A half-smothered cry struggled across the orphan’s trembling
lips that had suddenly grown colorless, and he saw her
clutch her fingers.</p>
<p>“And if she lives?”</p>
<p>“If she lives, and will accept the affection I shall offer
her, the remainder of my years will be devoted to the work
of making her forget the sorrows that have darkened the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_293"></a>293</span>
early portion of her life. I do not wish to conceal the fact
that she is inexpressibly dear to me.”</p>
<p>During the long silence that ensued, a lifetime of agony
seemed compressed into the compass of a few moments, but
Salome stood motionless, with her arms pressed over her
aching heart, and her head thrown haughtily back, while the
moonlight streamed down on her face where pride and pain
were struggling for right to reign.</p>
<p>When all expectation of earthly happiness is smothered in
a proud, passionate soul, and the future robes itself in those
dun hues that only the day-star of eternity can gild, nerves
and muscles shrink and shiver at the massacre of hopes which
despair hews down, in the hour that it “storms the citadel
of the heart, and puts the whole garrison to the sword.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey could not endure the sight of that fixed, hardened
face, and sorely distressed by the consciousness of the suffering
which he had unintentionally inflicted on one so young,
he moved away, and for some time walked slowly under the
arching laurestines. Although his stern integrity of purpose
acquitted him of all blame, and he could accuse himself of
no word or deed that might be held amenable to conscience
for the mischief and misery that had resulted from his acquaintance
with this unfortunate girl, he regretted that he
had remained in the same house, and, by constant association,
fed the flame that absence might have extinguished.</p>
<p>While he pitied the weakness that had induced her to yield
so entirely to the preference she indulged for him, he felt
humiliated at the thought that he, who had intended to guide
and elevate this wayward child of nature, had been instrumental
in darkening and embittering her young life.</p>
<p>When he came back to the spot, whence she had not moved,
and laid his hand gently on her shoulder, she smiled strangely,
and</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Unbent the grieving beauty of her brows.<br>
But held her heart’s proud pain superbly still.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“My little sister, you must not stay here any longer.
Would you prefer to go home at once in my buggy, or remain
in the parlor until daylight?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_294"></a>294</span></div>
<p>“Neither. Let me sit down on the stone terrace till the
end comes. I will disturb no one. It will be three hours
before day breaks, and when you know whether your idol will
live or die, come and tell me. Take your hand from my
shoulder.”</p>
<p>He had endeavored to detain her, but she shrank away
from his grasp, and glided down the smooth sward to the
terrace which divided it from the ripple-barred and ringed
sands of the shelving beach.</p>
<p>As he returned to the house, the wind sprang up and
moaned through the dense foliage above him, and an owl,
perched in some clustering bough that overhung the portico,
screamed and hooted dismally. The sound was so startling
that the greyhound leaped to his feet and set up an answering
howl, which almost froze Katie with fright, and caused even
Mrs. Gerome’s heavy eyelids to unclose.</p>
<p>Salome sat down on the paved terrace, crossed her arms
over the low stone balustrade, and resting her chin upon
them, looked out at the burnished bosom of the ocean. Just
beneath her, and near enough to moisten the granite with
the silvery spray,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Its waves are kneeling on the strand,<br>

<p>If the old Rabbinical legend of Sandalphon be grounded in
some solemn vision granted to the saints of eld, who walked
in Syria, then peradventure on this night, the angel must
have been puzzled indeed concerning the petitions that floated
up, and demanded admission to the Eternal ear.</p>
<p>From the anxious heart of the sincere and humble Christian
who knelt at the bedside of the invalid, rose a fervent prayer
that if consistent with the Father’s will, He would lay His
healing hand upon the sufferer, and restore her to health and
strength; while the wretched girl on the terrace prayed
vehemently that God would crush the feeble flicker of life in
Mrs. Gerome’s wasted frame, would take from the world a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_295"></a>295</span>
woman whose existence was a burden to herself and threatened
to prove a curse to others.</p>
<p>The passionate cry of Salome’s soul was,—</p>
<p>“Punish me in any way, and all other ways! Send sickness,
destitution, humiliation,—let every other affliction smite
me; but save me from the intolerable anguish of seeing that
woman his wife! O my God! the world is not wide enough
to hold us both. Take her, or else call me speedily hence.
I am not fit to die, but I shall never be better, if I am doomed
to witness this marriage. I would sooner go down to perdition
now, than live to see that thing of horror. Of two hells,
I choose that which takes me farthest from her.”</p>
<p>For the first time in her life she felt that the hours were
flying, that the day of doom was rushing to meet her, and
she shuddered when one after another the constellations
slipped softly and solemnly down the sky, and vanished behind
the dim shadowy outline of the western hills. Gradually
the moon sank so low that the sea could no longer reflect her
beams, and as the mighty waste of waters slowly darkened,
and the wind stiffened, and the song of the surf swelled like
a rising requiem, the girl felt that all nature was preparing
to mourn with her over the burial of her only hope of earthly
peace.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Gerome died, a quiet future stretched before the
orphan, and she could bear to live without the love which she
had the grim satisfaction of knowing brightened no other
woman’s life.</p>
<p>The happiness of the man for whom she almost impiously
prayed, was a matter of little importance compared with the
ease of her own heart; and she had yet to learn that the
welfare and peace of the object she loved so selfishly would
one day become paramount to all other aims and considerations.
That pure and sublime spirit of self-abnegation which
immolates every hope and wish that is at variance with the
happiness of the beloved had not yet been born in Salome’s
fiery nature; and she cared little for the anguish that might
be Dr. Grey’s portion, provided her own heart could be spared
the pang of witnessing his wedded bliss.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_296"></a>296</span></div>
<p>Through the trees, she could see the steady light of the
lamp that burned in the room where the sick woman lay, and
so she watched and waited, shivering in the shadow that fell
over earth and ocean just before the breaking of the new day.</p>
<p>Along the eastern horizon, the white fires of rising constellations
paled and flickered and seemed to die, as a gray
light stole up behind them; and the gray grew pearly, and
the pearly opaline, and ere long the sky crimsoned, and the
sea reddened until its waves were like ruby wine or human
gore.</p>
<p>In the radiant dawn of that day which would decide the
earthly destinies of three beings, Salome saw Dr. Grey coming
across the lawn. His step was quiet,—neither slow nor hasty,
and she could not conjecture the result; but as he approached,
she rose, wrapped her shawl about her, and advanced to meet
him. He paused, took off his hat, and she knew all before a
syllable passed his lips.</p>
<p>“Salome, God has heard my prayers,—has mercifully taken
my darling from the arms of death, and given her to me. I
do not think I am too sanguine in saying that she will
ultimately recover, and my heart can not find language that
will interpret its gratitude and joy.”</p>
<p>Never before had such a light shone in his clear, calm blue
eyes, and illumined his usually grave countenance; and though
continued vigils and keen anxiety had left their signet on his
pale face, his great happiness was printed legibly on every
feature, and found expression even in the deepened and softened
tones of his voice.</p>
<p>The girl did not move or speak, but looked steadily into
his bright eyes, and the calmness with which she listened,
comforted and encouraged him to hope that ere long she
would conquer her preference.</p>
<p>How could he know that at that instant she was impiously
vowing that heaven had heard her last prayer?—that never
again should a petition cross her lips? God had granted one
prayer,—had decided against hers,—had denied her utterly;
and henceforth she would not weary Him,—she would not
mock herself and her misery.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_297"></a>297</span></div>
<p>Dr. Grey saw that there was no quiver on the still, pale
lips, no contraction of the polished forehead; but the rigidity
of her face broke up suddenly in a smile of indescribable
mournfulness,—a smile where self-contempt and pity and
hopeless bitterness all lent their saddest phases.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, in your present happy mood, you certainly can
not be so ungracious as to deny me a favor?”</p>
<p>“Have I ever refused my little sister anything she asked?”</p>
<p>“The only favor you can ever grant me will be to persuade
Miss Jane to consent to my departure. Look to it, sir, that I
am allowed to go, and that right speedily; for go I certainly
shall, at all hazards. Convince your sister that it is best, and
let me go away forever, without incurring the displeasure of
the only friend I ever had or ever shall have.”</p>
<p>She moved away as if to leave the grounds, but he caught
her arm.</p>
<p>“Wait five minutes, Salome, and I will take you home in
my buggy. It is not right for you to walk alone at this early
hour, and I will not allow it.”</p>
<p>She shook off his hand as if it had been an infant’s; and,
as she walked away, he heard her laugh with a degree of
savage bitterness that stabbed his generous heart like a
dagger; while behind her trailed the hissing echo,—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>In the pure, clear light of early morning, “Grassmere,”
with its wide, smooth lawn, and old-fashioned brick house,
weather-stained and moss-mantled, looked singularly peaceful
and attractive. Against the sombre mass of tree-foliage,
white and purple altheas raised their circular censers, as
if to greet the sun that was throwing level beams from the
eastern hill-top, and delicate pink, and deep azure, and pearl-pale
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_298"></a>298</span>
convolvulus held up their velvet trumpets all beaded with
dew, to be drained by the first kiss of the great Day-God. Up
and down the comb of the steep roof, beautiful pigeons with
necklaces that rivalled the trappings of Solomon, strutted
and cooed; on the eaves, busy brown wrens peeped into the
gutters,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“And of the news delivered their small souls,”—</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>gossiping industriously; while from a distant nook some
vagrant partridge whistled for its mate, and shy doves swinging
in the highest elm limbs, moaned plaintively of the last
hunting-season, that had proved a St. Barthlomew’s day to
the innocent feathered folk.</p>
<p>On the lawn a flock of turkeys were foraging among the
clover-blossoms, and over the dewy grass a large brood of
young guineas raced after their mother, or played hide-and-seek,
like nut-brown elves, under the white and purple tufts
of flowers. Save the bird-world—always abroad early—no
living thing seemed astir, and the silence that reigned was
broken only by the distance-softened bleating of Stanley’s
pet lamb.</p>
<p>As Salome walked slowly and wearily up the avenue, she
saw that the housemaid had opened the front door, and when
the orphan ascended the steps, all within was still as a
tomb, except the canary that sprang into its ring and began
to warble a <i>reveille</i> as she approached the cage. Miss Jane
was usually an early riser, and often aroused her servants,
but to-day the household seemed to have overslept themselves,
and when Salome had rearranged her dress, and waked her
little brother, she rang the bell for Rachel, who soon obeyed
the summons.</p>
<p>“Is Miss Jane up?”</p>
<p>“No, ma’am, I suppose not, as she has not rung for me.
You know I always wait for her bell.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps she is not very well this morning. I will go
and see whether she intends to get up.”</p>
<p>Salome went down stairs and knocked at the door of Miss
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_299"></a>299</span>
Jane’s room, but no sound was audible within, and she softly
turned the bolt and entered.</p>
<p>The lamp was burning very dimly on a table close to the
bed, and upon the open Bible lay the spectacles which the
old lady had placed there twelve hours before, when she
finished reading the nightly chapter that generally composed
her mind and put her to sleep.</p>
<p>Salome conjectured that she had forgotten to extinguish
the lamp, and as she cautiously turned the wick down, her
eyes rested on the open page where pencil-lines marked the
twelfth chapter of Ecclesiastes, and enclosed the sixth and
seventh verses, “Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the
golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain,
or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the
dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return
unto God who gave it.”</p>
<p>Removing the glasses, the girl closed the book, and leaned
over the pillow to look at the sleeper. She had turned her
face towards the wall, and one hand lay under her head,
pressed against her cheek, while the other held her handkerchief
on the outside of the counterpane.</p>
<p>Very softly she slumbered, with a placid smile half breaking
over her aged, wrinkled features; and unwilling to shorten
the morning nap in which she so rarely indulged, Salome sat
down at the foot of the bed, and leaning her head on her
hands, fell into a painful and profound reverie.</p>
<p>Nearly an hour passed, unheeded by the unhappy girl,
whose anguish rendered her indifferent to all that surrounded
her; and after a while a keen pang thrilled her heart, as she
heard Dr. Grey’s pleasant voice jesting with Stanley on the
lawn. His happiness seemed an insult to her misery, and
she stopped her ears to exclude the sound of his quiet laugh.</p>
<p>A half hour elapsed, and then his well-known rap was
heard at the door. Miss Jane did not answer, and Salome
was in no mood to welcome him home; but he waited for
neither, and came in, gently closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>At sight of the orphan, he started slightly, and said,—</p>
<p>“Is my sister sick?”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_300"></a>300</span></div>
<p>“I don’t know, but she is sleeping unusually late. I
thought it best not to disturb her.”</p>
<p>The look of dread that swept over his countenance frightened
her, and she rose as he moved hastily to the bedside.</p>
<p>“Salome, open the blinds. Quick! quick!”</p>
<p>She sprang to the window, threw the shutters wide open,
and hastened back. Dr. Grey’s hand was on his sister’s wrist,
and his ear pressed against her heart,—strained to catch
some faint pulsation. His head went down on her pillow,
and Salome held her breath.</p>
<p>“Oh, Janet! My dear, patient, good sister! This is indeed
hard to bear. To die alone—unsoothed—unnoticed;
with no kind hands about you! To die—without one farewell
word!”</p>
<p>He hid his face in his hands, and Salome staggered to the
bed, and grasped Miss Jane’s rigid, icy fingers.</p>
<p>In the silence of midnight, Death stole her spirit from its
clay garments, and while she slept peacefully had borne her
beyond the confines of Time, and left her resting forever in
the City Celestial.</p>
<p>A life dedicated to pure aims and charitable deeds had
been rewarded with a death as painless as the slumber of a
tired child on its mother’s bosom, and, without struggle or
premonition, the soul had slipped from the bondage of flesh
into the Everlasting Peace that remaineth for the children
of God.</p>
<p>It was impossible to decide at what hour she had died; and
when the members of the appalled household were questioned,
Muriel and Miss Dexter stated that she had kissed them good
night and appeared as well as usual at her customary time
of retiring; and Rachel testified that after she was in bed,
she rang her bell and directed her to tell the cook that as Dr.
Grey would probably come home about daylight, she must get
up early and have a cup of coffee ready when he arrived.
Sobbing passionately, Rachel added,—</p>
<p>“When I asked her if I should put out the lamp, she
said, ‘No; Ulpian may lose his patient, and come home sad,
and then he will come in and talk to me awhile.’ And just
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_301"></a>301</span>
as I was leaving the room, she called to me, ‘Rachel, what
coat did Ulpian wear? It turns so cool now before daylight
that he will take cold if he has on that linen one.’ I told
her I did not know, and she would not be satisfied till I
went to his room and found that the linen coat was hanging
in the closet, and the gray flannel one was missing. Then
she opened her Bible and said, ‘Ah, that is all right. The
flannel one will do very well, and my boy will be comfortable.’”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey’s grief was deep, but silent; and, during the
dreary day and night that succeeded, he would allow no one
to approach him except Muriel, whose soft little hands, and
tearful, tender caresses, seemed in some degree to comfort
him.</p>
<p>One month before, Salome would have wept and mourned
with him, but the fountain of her tears was exhausted and
scorched by the intense bitterness and despairing hate that
had taken possession of her since the day of Elsie’s burial;
and stunned and dry-eyed, she watched the preparations for
the obsequies of her benefactress.</p>
<p>Her love for Miss Jane had never been sufficiently fervent
to render her distress very poignant; but in the death of this
devoted friend she was fully aware that at last she was set
once more adrift in the world, without chart or rudder save
that furnished by her will.</p>
<p>Life to-day was not the beautiful web, all aglow with the
tangling of gold and silver threads, that had once charmed
and dazzled her, for the mildew of hopelessness had tarnished
the gilding, and the mesh was only a mass of dark knots,
and subtle crossings, and inextricable confusion.</p>
<p>Like that lost star that once burned so luridly in Cassiopeia,
and flickered out, leaving a gulf of gloom where
stellar glory was, the one most precious hope that lights and
sanctifies a woman’s heart had waned and grown sickly, and
finally had gone out utterly, and dust and ashes and darkness
filled the void. In natures such as hers, this hope is
not allied to the phœnix, and, once crushed, knows no resurrection;
consequently she cheated herself with no vain expectation
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_302"></a>302</span>
that the mighty wizard, Time, could evoke from
corpse or funeral-pyre even a spark to cheer the years that
were thundering before her.</p>
<p>A few months ago the future had glistened as peaceful
and silvery as the Dead Sea at midnight, when a full-orbed
Syrian moon glares down, searching for the palms and palaces
that once marked Gomorrah’s proud places; and, like some
thirsty traveller smitten with surface sheen, she had laid
her fevered lips to the treacherous margin, and, drinking
eagerly, had been repaid with brine and bitumen.</p>
<p>Disappointment was with her no meek, mute affair, but a
savage fiend that browbeat and anathematized fate, accusing
her of rendering existence a mere Nitocris banquet, where,
while every sense is sharpened and pampered, and fruition
almost touches the outstretched hands of eager trust, the
flood-gates of the mighty Nile of despair are lifted, and its
chill, dusky waves make irremediable wreck of all.</p>
<p>With the quiet thoughtfulness and good sense that characterized
her unobtrusive conduct, Miss Dexter had prepared
from Muriel’s wardrobe an entire suit of mourning, which
she prevailed upon Salome to accept and wear; and, on the
morning of the funeral, the latter went down early into the
draped and darkened parlor, where the coffin and its cold
tenant awaited the last offices that dust can perform for dust.</p>
<p>She had not spoken to Dr. Grey for twenty-four hours,
and, finding him beside the table where his sister’s body lay,
the orphan would have retreated, but he caught the rustling
sound of her crape and bombazine, and held out his hand.</p>
<p>“Come in, Salome.”</p>
<p>She took no notice of the offered fingers, but passed him,
and went around the table to the opposite side.</p>
<p>The wrinkled, sallow face, still wore its tranquil half-smile,
and, under the cap-border of fine lace, the grizzled hair lay
smooth and glossy on the sunken temples.</p>
<p>In accordance with a wish which she had often expressed,
the ghostly shroud was abandoned, and Miss Jane was dressed
in her favorite black silk. Salome had gathered a small
bouquet of the fragile white blossoms of apple-geranium, of
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_303"></a>303</span>
which the old lady was particularly fond, and, bending over
the coffin, she laid them between the fingers that were interlaced
on the pulseless heart.</p>
<p>With a quiet mournfulness, more eloquent than passionate
grief, the girl stood looking for the last time at the placid
countenance that had always beamed kindly and lovingly
upon her since that dreary day, when, under the flickering
shadow of the mulberry-tree, she had called her from the
poor-house and given her a happy home.</p>
<p>She stooped to kiss the livid lips, that had never spoken
harshly to her; and, for some seconds, her face was hidden
on the bosom of the dead. When she raised it, the dry,
glittering eyes and firm mouth, betokened the bitterness of
soul that no invectives could exhaust, no language adequately
express.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, if the exchange could be made, I would not
only willingly, but gladly, thankfully, lie down here in this
coffin, and give your sister back to your arms. The Reaper,
Death, has cut down the perfect, golden grain, and left the
tares to shiver in the coming winter. Some who are useless
and life-weary bend forward, hoping to meet the sickle, but it
sweeps above them, and they wither slowly among the
stubble.”</p>
<p>He looked at her, and found it difficult to realize that the
pale, quiet, stern woman, standing there in sombre weeds,
was the same fair young face that he had seen thirty-six
hours before in the moonlight that brightened Elsie’s grave.
He thought that only the slow, heavy rolling of years could
have worn those lines about her faded lips, and those dark
purplish hollows under the steady, undimmed eyes. That
composed, frigid Salome, watching him from across the
corpse and coffin, seemed a mere chill shadow of the fiery,
impetuous, radiant girl, whose passionate waywardness had
so often annoyed and grieved him. The alabaster vase was
still perfect in form, but the lamp that had hitherto burned
within, lending a rosy glow to clay, had fluttered and expired,
and the change was painful indeed.</p>
<p>His attention was so riveted upon the extraordinary alteration
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_304"></a>304</span>
in her appearance, that her words fell on his ear, as
empty, as meaningless, as the echoes heard in dreams, and
when she ceased speaking, he looked perplexed, and sighed
heavily.</p>
<p>“What did you say? I do not think I understand you;
my mind was abstracted when you spoke.”</p>
<p>“True; you never will understand me. Only the dead
sleeping here between us fully comprehended me, and even
unto the end of my life-chapter I must walk on misapprehended.
When the coffin-lid is screwed down over that dear,
kind face, I shall have bidden adieu to my sole and last
friend; for in the Hereafter she will not know me. Ah, Miss
Jane! you tried hard to teach me Christianity, but it was like
geometry, I had no talent for it,—could not take hold of it,—and
it all slipped through my fingers. If there is indeed an
inexorable and incorruptible Justice reigning behind the
stars, you will be so happy that I and my sins, and my desolation
will not trouble you. Good-by, dear Miss Jane; it is
not your fault that I missed my chance of being coaxed into
the celestial fold with the elect sheep, and find myself
scourged out with the despised goats. God grant you His
everlasting rest.”</p>
<p>She turned, but Dr. Grey stretched his arm across his
sister’s body, and caught the orphan’s dress.</p>
<p>“Salome, God has called my own sister to her blessed rest
in Christ, but my adopted sister He has left to comfort, to
sympathize with me. Here, in the sacred presence of my
dear dead, I ask you to take her place, and be to me throughout
life the true, loving, faithful friend whom nothing can
alienate, and of whom only death can deprive me. My little
sister, let the future ripen and sanctify our confidence, affection,
and friendship.”</p>
<p>“No, sir; sinners can not fill the niches of the saints; and
to-day we are more completely divided than if the ocean roared
between us. Once I struggled hard to cure myself of my
faults,—to purify and fashion my nature anew, but the
incentive has died, and I have no longer the proud aspirations
that lifted me like eagle’s wings high above the dust into
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_305"></a>305</span>
which I have now fallen,—and where I expect to remain.
You need not fear that I shall commit some capital sin, and
go down in disgrace to my grave; for there must be some
darling hope, some precious aim, that goads people to crime,—and
neither of these have I. I do not want your friendship,
and I will not allow your dictation; and, if you are as
generous as I have believed you, I think you will spare me
the manifestation of your pity. Miss Jane was the only link
that united us in any degree, and now we are asunder and
adrift. You see at least I am honest, and since I have not
your confidence, I decline your compassion and espionage, and
refuse to accept a sham friendship,—to trust myself upon
a gossamer web that stretches across a dismal gulf of gloom,
and wretchedness, and endless altercation. When I am in one
continent, and you are in another, we shall be better friends
than now.”</p>
<p>Her cold, slow, measured accents, and the calm pallor of
her features told how complete was the change that had set
its stern seal on body and soul; and Dr. Grey’s heart ached,
as he realized how withering was the blight that had fallen
on her once buoyant, sanguine nature.</p>
<p>“My dear Salome, for Janet’s sake, and in memory of all
her love and counsel, let me beg you not to indulge feelings
that can only result in utter—”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, let there be silence and peace between us, at
least in the presence of the dead. Expostulation from your
lips only exasperates and hardens me; so pray be quiet. No!
do not touch me! Our hands have not clasped each other
so often nor so closely that they must needs miss the warmth
and pressure in the coming years of separation, and I will not
soil your palm with mine.”</p>
<p>She coldly put aside the hand that endeavored to take hers,
and, after one long, sad gaze at the marble face in the coffin,
turned away, and went back to her own room.</p>
<p>Miss Jane’s charities had carried her name even to the
secluded nooks of the county, and, when her death was announced,
many humble beneficiaries of her bounty came to
offer the last testimonial of respect and gratitude, by following
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_306"></a>306</span>
the remains to their final resting-place. As the hour
approached for the solemn rites, the house was filled with
friends and acquaintances; and the members of the profession
to which Dr. Grey belonged came to attend the funeral, and
officiate as pall-bearers.</p>
<p>Seated beside Dr. Grey, on one of the sofas, Salome’s dry
eyes noted all that passed while the services were performed;
and, when the hearse moved down the avenue, she took his
offered arm, and was placed in the same carriage.</p>
<p>It was a long, dreary drive to the distant cemetery, and
she was relieved to some extent when they found themselves
at the family vault. Miss Jane had always desired to be
buried under the slab that covered her brother, and had
directed a space left for that purpose. Now the marble was
removed, and the coffins of Jane and Enoch Grey rested side
by side. The voice of the minister ceased, and only little
Stanley’s sobs broke that mournful silence which always ensues
while spade or trowel does its sad work. Then the
sculptured slab was replaced, and brother and sister were left
to that blessed repose which is granted only to the faithful
when “He giveth His beloved sleep.”</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Write, ‘Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord,<br>
Because they rest,’ ... because their toil is o’er.<br>
The voice of weeping shall be heard no more<br>
In the Eternal City. Neither dying<br>
Nor sickness, pain nor sorrow, neither crying,<br>
For God shall wipe away all tears. Rest,—rest.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In the death of his sister, Dr. Grey mourned the loss of
the only mother he had ever known, for his earliest recollections
were of Miss Jane’s tender care and love, and his affection
was rather that of a devoted son than brother; consequently,
the blow was doubly painful: but he bore it with a
silent fortitude, a grave and truly Christian resignation, that
left an indelible impression upon the minds of Miss Dexter
and Muriel, and taught them the value of a faith that could
bring repose and trust in the midst of a trial so severe.</p>
<p>His continued vigils at “Solitude,” and the profound grief
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_307"></a>307</span>
that could not find vent in tears or words, had printed characters
on his pale, wearied face, that should have commanded
the sympathy of all who shared his friendship; but the sight
of his worn features and the sound of his slow step only
embittered the heart of the orphan, who saw in these evidences
of fatigue and anxiety new manifestations of affection
for the patient who was not yet entirely beyond danger.</p>
<p>Four days after the funeral, Dr. Grey came in to breakfast
later than usual, having driven over very early to “Solitude;”
and, as he seated himself at the table and received
from Muriel’s hand a cup of coffee, he leaned forward and
kissed her rosy cheek.</p>
<p>“Thank you, my child. You are very kind to wait for
me.”</p>
<p>“How is that poor Mrs. Gerome? Will she never be well
enough to dispense with your services?”</p>
<p>Once, Salome would have answered, “He hopes not;”
but now she merely turned her head a little, to catch his
reply.</p>
<p>“She is better to-day than I feared I should find her, as
some alarming symptoms threatened her yesterday; but now
I think I can safely say the danger has entirely passed.”</p>
<p>Muriel hung over the back of his chair, pressing him to
try several dishes that she pronounced excellent, but he
gently refused all except the coffee; and, when he had pushed
aside the empty cup, he drew the face of his ward close to
his own, and murmured a few words that deepened the glow
on her fair cheeks, while she hastily left the room to read a
letter.</p>
<p>For some moments he sat with his head resting on his
hand, thinking of the dear old face that usually watched
him from the corner of the fire-place, and of the kind words
that were showered on him while he breakfasted; but to-day
the faded lips were frozen forever, and the dim eyes would
never again brighten at his approach.</p>
<p>He sighed, brushed back the hair that clustered in glossy
brown rings on his forehead, and rose.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_308"></a>308</span></div>
<p>“Salome, if you are not particularly engaged this morning,
I should be glad to see you in the library.”</p>
<p>“At what hour?”</p>
<p>“Immediately, if you are at leisure.”</p>
<p>The orphan put aside the fold of crape which she was converting
into a collar, and inclined her head slightly.</p>
<p>Since that brief and painful interview held beside Miss
Jane’s coffin, not a syllable had passed between them, and
the girl shrank with a vague, shivering dread from the impending
<i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>
<p>Silently she followed the master of the house into the
library, where Dr. Grey drew two chairs to the table, and,
when she had seated herself in one, he took possession of the
other.</p>
<p>Opening a drawer, he selected several papers from a mass
of what appeared to be legal documents, and spread them
before her.</p>
<p>“I wish to acquaint you with the contents of my sister’s
will, which I examined last night. Will you read it, or shall
I briefly state her wishes?”</p>
<p>“Tell me what you wish me to know.”</p>
<p>She swept the papers into a pile, and pushed them away.</p>
<p>“Have you ever read a will?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>She leaned her elbows on the table, and rested her face in
her hands.</p>
<p>“All these pages amount simply to this,—dear Jane made
her will immediately after my return from Europe, and its
provisions are: that this place, with house, land, furniture,
and stock, shall be given to and settled upon you; and moreover
that, for the ensuing five years, you shall receive every
January the sum of one thousand dollars. Until the expiration
of that period, she desired that I should act as your
guardian. By reference to the date and signature of these
papers, you will find that this will was made as soon as she
was able to sit up, after her illness produced by pneumonia;
but appended to the original is a codicil stating that the validity
of the distribution of her estate, contained in the former
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_309"></a>309</span>
instrument, is contingent upon your conduct. Feeling most
earnestly opposed to your contemplated scheme of going upon
the stage as a <i>prima donna</i>, she solemnly declares, that, if
you persist in carrying your decision into execution, the foregoing
provisions shall be cancelled, and the house, land, and
furniture shall be given to Jessie and Stanley; while only one
thousand dollars is set apart as your portion. This codicil
was signed one month ago.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey glanced over the sheets of paper, and refolded
them, allowing his companion time for reflection and comment,
but she remained silent, and he added,—</p>
<p>“However your views may differ from those entertained by
my sister, I hope you will not permit yourself to doubt that a
sincere desire to promote your life-long happiness prompted
the course she has pursued.”</p>
<p>Five minutes elapsed, and the orphan sat mute and still.</p>
<p>“Salome, are you disappointed? My dear friend, deal
frankly with me.”</p>
<p>She lifted her pale, quiet face, and, for the first time in
many weeks, he saw unshed tears shining in her eyes, and
glittering on her lashes.</p>
<p>“I should be glad to know whether Miss Jane consulted
you, in the preparation of her will?”</p>
<p>“She conferred with me concerning the will, and I cordially
approved it; but of the codicil I knew nothing, until her
lawyer—Mr. Lindsay—called my attention to it yesterday
afternoon.”</p>
<p>“You are very generous, Dr. Grey, and no one but you
would willingly divide your sister’s estate with paupers, who
have so long imposed upon her bounty. I had no expectation
that Miss Jane would so munificently remember me, and I
have not deserved the kindness which she has lavished on <ins title="Changed from period">me,</ins>
for Jessie and Stanley I gratefully accept her noble gift, and
it will place them far beyond the possibility of want; while
the only regret of which I am conscious, is, that I feel compelled
to pursue a career, which my best, my only friend
disapproved. In the name of poor little Jessie and Stanley, I
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_310"></a>310</span>
thank you, sir, for consenting to such a generous bequest of
property that is justly yours. You, who—”</p>
<p>“Pray do not mention the matter, for independent of the
large legacy left me by my sister, my own fortune is so ample
that I deserve no thanks for willingly sharing that which I
do not need. My little sister, you must not rashly decide a
question which involves your future welfare, and I can not
and will not hear your views at present. Take one week for
calm deliberation, weigh the matter prayerfully and thoughtfully,
and at the expiration of that time, meet me here, and
I will accept your decision.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, and a dreary smile passed swiftly over
her passionless face.</p>
<p>“Twenty years of reflection would not alter, or in any
degree bend my determination, which is as firmly fixed as
the base of the Blue-Ridge; and—”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Salome, but, until the week has elapsed, I do
not wish or intend to receive your verdict. Before this day
week, recollect all the reasons which dear Janet urged against
your scheme; recall the pain she suffered from the bare contemplation
of such a possibility, and her tender pleadings and
wise counsel. Ah, Salome, you are young and impulsive, but
I trust you will not close your ears against your brother’s
earnest protest and appeal. If I were not sincerely attached
to you, I should not so persistently oppose your favorite
plan, which is fraught with perils and annoyances that you
can not now realize. Hush! I will not listen to you to-day.”</p>
<p>He rose, and laying his hands softly on her head, added, in
a solemn but tremulously tender tone,—</p>
<p>“And may God in His infinite wisdom and mercy overrule
all things for your temporal and eternal welfare, and so
guide your decision, that peace and usefulness will be your
portion, now and forever.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Yes, Dr. Grey, I am better than I ever expected or desired
to be in this world.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, this is scarcely the recompense that my
anxious vigilance and ceaseless exertions merit at your hands.”</p>
<p>The invalid leaned far back in her cushioned easy-chair,
and, as the physician rested his arm on the mantelpiece and
looked down at her, he thought of the lines that had more
than once recurred to his mind, since the commencement of
their acquaintance,—</p>

<p class="cg">“What finely carven features! Yes, but carved<br>

A watery half-moon in a wintry sky<br>
Looks less uncomfortably cold. And ... well,<br>
I never in the eyes of a sane woman<br>
Saw such a strange, unsatisfied regard.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“I suppose I ought to be grateful to you, Dr. Grey, for
Katie and Robert have told me how patiently and carefully
you nursed and watched over me, during my illness; but instead
of gratitude, I find it difficult to forgive you for what
you have done. You fanned into a flame the spark of life
that was smouldering and expiring, and baffled the disease
that came to me as the handmaid of Mercy. Death, transformed
into an angel of pity, kindly opened the door of escape
from the woe and weariness of this sin-cursed world, into the
calmness and dreamless rest of the vast shoreless Beyond;
and just when I was passing through, you snatched me back
to my burdens and my bitter lot. I know, of course, that
you intended only kindness, but you must not blame me if I
fail to thank you.”</p>

<p>“You forget that life is intended as a season of fiery probation,
and that without suffering there is no purification, and
no reward. Remember, ‘Calm is not life’s crown, though calm
is well;’ and those who forego the pain must forego the
palm.”</p>
<p>“I would gladly forego all things for a rest,—a sleep that
could know no end. Katie tells me I have been ill a month,
and from this brief season of oblivion you have dragged me
back to the existence that I abhor. Dr. Grey, I feel to-day as
poor Maurice de Guérin felt, when he wrote from Le Val,
‘My fate has knocked at the door to recall me; for she had
not gone on her way, but had seated herself upon the threshold,
waiting until I had recovered sufficient strength to resume
my journey. “Thou hast tarried long enough,” said
she to me; “come forward!” And she has taken me by the
hand, and behold her again on the march, like those poor
women one meets on the road, leading a child who follows
with a sorrowful <ins title="Added period">air.’”</ins></p>

<p>A moment since, you quoted De Guérin, and perhaps you may
recollect one of his declarations, ‘I have no shelter but resignation,
and I run to it in great haste, all trembling and distracted.
Resignation! It is the burrow hollowed in the cleft
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_313"></a>313</span>
of some rock, which gives shelter to the flying and long-hunted
prey.’ You will never find peace for your heart and
soul until you bring your will into complete subjection to that
of Him ‘who doeth all things well.’ Defiance and rebellious
struggles only aggravate your sorrows and trials.”</p>
<p>She listened to the deep, quiet voice, as some unlettered
savage might hearken to the rhythmic music of Homer,
soothed by the tones, yet incapable of comprehending their
import; and as she looked up at the grave, kingly face, her
eyes fell upon the broad band of crape that encircled his
straw hat, which had been hastily placed on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, you ought to speak advisedly, for Robert told
me that you had recently lost your sister, and that you are
now alone in the world. You, who have severe afflictions,
should know how far resignation lightens them. I was much
pained to learn that your sister died while you were absent,—while
you were sitting up with me. Ah, sir! you ought to have
watched her, and left me to my release. You have been very
kind and considerate toward one who has no claim upon
aught but your pity; and I would gladly lie down in your
sister’s grave, and give her back to your heart and home.”</p>
<p>Her countenance softened for an instant, and she held out
her hand. He took the delicate fingers in his, and pressed
them gently.</p>
<p>“God grant that your life may be spared, until all doubt
and bitterness is removed from your heart, and that when you
go down into the grave it may be as bright with the blessed
faith of a Christian as that which now contains my sister
Janet. Do not allow the gloom of earthly disappointment to
cloud your trust, but bear always in mind those cheering
words of Saadi,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘Says God, “Who comes towards me an inch through doubtings dim,<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“If I am to be kept in this world until all the bitterness is
scourged out of me, I might as well resign myself to a career
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_314"></a>314</span>
as endless as that of Ahasuerus. I tell you, sir, I have been
forced to drink out of quassia-cups until my whole being has
imbibed the bitter; and I am like that tree to which Firdousi
compared Mahmoud, ‘Whose nature is so bitter, that were you
to plant it in the garden of Eden, and water it with the ambrosial
stream of Paradise, and were you to enrich its roots
with virgin honey, it would, after all, discover its innate disposition,
and only yield the acrid fruit it had ever borne.’”</p>
<p>“What right have you to expect that existence should prove
one continued gala-season? When Christ went down meekly
into Gethsemane, that such as you and I might win a place in
the Eternal City, how dare you demand exemption from grief
and pain, that Jesus, your God, did not spare Himself? Are
you purer than Christ, and wiser than the Almighty, that
you impiously deride and question their code for the government
of the Universe, in which individual lives seem trivial
as the sands of the desert, or the leaves of the forest? Oh! it
is pitiable, indeed, to see some worm writhing in the dust, and
blasphemously dictating laws to Him who swung suns and
asterisms in space, and breathed into its own feeble fragment
of clay the spark that enabled it to insult its God. Put away
such unwomanly scoffing,—such irreverent puerilities; sweep
your soul clean of all such wretched rubbish, and when you
feel tempted to repine at your lot, recollect the noble admonition
of Dschelaleddin, ‘If this world were our abiding-place,
we might complain that it makes our bed so hard; but it is
only our night-quarters on a journey, and who can expect
home <ins title="Adding quote">comforts?’”</ins></p>
<p>“I can not feel resigned to my lot. It is too hard,—too
unjust.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, are you more just and prescient than
Jehovah?”</p>
<p>She passed her thin hand across her face, and was silent,
for his voice and manner awed her. After a little while, she
sat erect in her chair, and tried to rise.</p>
<p>“Doctor, if you could look down into the gray ruins of my
heart, you would not reprove me so harshly. My whole being
seems in some cold eclipse, and my soul is like the Sistine
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_315"></a>315</span>
Chapel in Passion-week, where all is shrouded in shadow, and
no sounds are heard but Misereres and Tenebræ.”</p>
<p>“Promise me that in future you will try to keep it like
that Christian temple, pure and inviolate from all imprecations
and rebellious words. If gloom there must be, see to it
that resignation seals your lips. What are you trying to do?
You are not strong enough to walk alone.”</p>
<p>“I want to go into the parlor,—I want my piano. Yesterday
I attempted to cross the room, and only Katie’s presence
saved me from a severe fall.”</p>
<p>She stood by her chair, grasping the carved back, and Dr.
Grey stepped forward, and drew her arm under his.</p>
<p>In her great weakness she leaned upon him, and when they
reached the parlor door, she paused and almost panted.</p>
<p>“You must not attempt to play,—you are too feeble even
to sit up longer. Let me take you back to your room.”</p>
<p>“No,—no! Let me alone. I know best what is good for
me; and I tell you my piano is my only Paraclete.”</p>
<p>Holding his arm for support, she drew a chair instead of
the piano-stool to the instrument, and seated herself.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey raised the lid, and waited some seconds, expecting
her to play, but she sat still and mute, and presently he
stooped to catch a glimpse of her countenance.</p>
<p>“I want to see Elsie’s grave. Open the blinds.”</p>
<p>He threw open the shutters, and came back to the piano.</p>
<p>Through the window, the group of deodars was visible, and
there, bathed in the mild yellow sunshine was the mound, and
the faded wreath swinging in the breeze.</p>
<p>For many minutes Mrs. Gerome gazed at the quiet spot
where her nurse rested, and with her eyes still on the grave,
her fingers struck into Chopin’s Funeral March.</p>
<p>After a while, Dr. Grey noticed a slight quiver cross her
pale lips, and when the mournful music reached its saddest
chords, a mist veiled the steely eyes, and very soon tears rolled
slowly down her cheeks.</p>
<p>The march ended, she did not pause, but began Mozart’s
Requiem, and all the while that slow rain of tears dripped
down on her white fingers, and splashed upon the ivory keys.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_316"></a>316</span></div>
<p>Dr. Grey was so rejoiced at the breaking up of the ice that
had long frozen the fountain of her tears, that he made no
attempt to interrupt her, until he saw that she tottered in
her chair. Taking her hands from the piano, he said
gently,—</p>
<p>“You are quite exhausted, and I can not permit this to
continue. Come back to your room.”</p>
<p>“No; let me stay here. Put me on the sofa in the oriel, and
leave the blinds open.”</p>
<p>He lifted her from the chair and led her to the sofa, where
she sank heavily down upon the cushions.</p>
<p>Without comment or resistance, she drank a glass of strong
cordial which he held to her lips, and lay with her eyes closed,
while tears still trickled through the long jet lashes.</p>
<p>She wore a robe of white merino, and a rich blue shawl of
the same soft material which was folded across her shoulders,
made the wan face look like some marble seraph’s, hovering
over an altar where violet light streams through stained glass.</p>
<p>For some time Dr. Grey walked up and down the long room,
glancing now and then at his patient, and when he saw that
the tears had ceased, he brought from a basket in the hall an
exquisitely beautiful and fragrant bouquet of the flowers
which he knew she loved best,—heliotrope, violets, tube-rose,
and Grand-Duke jessamine, fringed daintily with spicy geranium
leaves, and scarlet fuchsias.</p>
<p>Silently he placed it on her folded hands, and the expression
of surprise and pleasure that suddenly lighted her countenance,
amply repaid him.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, it has been my wish to <ins title="Original word retained">except</ins> services from no
one,—to owe no human being thanks; but your unvarying
kindness to my poor Elsie and to me, imposes a debt of gratitude
that I can not easily liquidate. I fear you are destined
to bankrupt me, for how can I hope to repay all your thoughtful,
delicate care, and generous interest in a stranger? Tell
me in what way I can adequately requite you.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey drew a chair close to the sofa, and answered,—</p>
<p>“Take care lest your zeal prove the contrary, for you know
a distinguished philosopher asserts that, ‘Too great eagerness
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_317"></a>317</span>
to requite an obligation is a species of ingratitude;’ and such
an accusation would be unflattering to you, and unpleasant
to me.”</p>
<p>Turning the bouquet around in order to examine and admire
each flower, Mrs. Gerome toyed with the velvet bells, and
said, sorrowfully,—</p>
<p>“Their delicious perfume always reminds me of my beautiful
home near Funchal, where heliotrope and geraniums grew
so tall that they looked in at my window, and hedges of fuchsias
bordered my garden walks. Never have I seen elsewhere
such profusion and perfection of flowers.”</p>
<p>“When were you in Madeira?”</p>
<p>“Two years ago. The villa I occupied was situated on the
side of a mountain, whose base was covered with vineyards;
and from a grove of lemon and oleanders that stood in front
of the house I could see the surging Atlantic at my feet, and
the crest of the mountain clothed with chestnuts, high above
and behind me. In one corner of my vineyard stood a solitary
palm, which tradition asserted was planted when Zarco discovered
the island; and the groves of orange, citron, and pomegranate
trees were always peopled with humming-birds, and
flocks of green canaries. There, surrounded by grand and
picturesque scenery of which I never wearied, I resolved to
live and die; but Elsie’s desire to return to America, which
held the ashes of her husband and child, overruled my inclination
and the dictates of judgment, and reluctantly I
left my mountain Eden and came here. Now, when I smell
violets and heliotrope, regret mingles with their aroma; and,
after all, the sacrifice was in vain, and Elsie would have slept
as calmly there, under palm and chestnut, as yonder, where
the deodar-shadows fall.”</p>
<p>“Is your life here a faithful transcript of that portion of it
passed at Funchal?”</p>
<p>“Yes; except that there I saw no human being but the
servants, who transacted any business that demanded interviews
with the consul.”</p>
<p>“It was fortunate that Elsie’s wise counsel prevailed over
your caprice, for many of your griefs proceed from the complete
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_318"></a>318</span>
isolation to which you so strangely doom yourself; and
until you become a useful member of that society you are so
fully fitted to adorn and elevate, you need not hope or expect
the peace of mind that results only from the consciousness of
having nobly discharged the sacred obligations to God, and
to your race. ‘Bear ye one another’s burdens,’ was the solemn
admonition of Him who sublimely bore the burdens of an entire
world. Now tell me, have you ever stretched out a finger
to aid the toiling multitudes whose cry for help wails over
even the most prosperous lands? What have you done to
strengthen trembling hands, or comfort and gladden oppressed
hearts? How dare you hoard within your own home
the treasure of fortune, talent, and sympathy, which were
temporarily entrusted to your hands, to be sown broadcast in
noble charities,—to be judiciously invested in promoting the
cause of Truth in the fierce war Evil wages against it?
Hitherto you have lived solely for yourself, which is a sin
against humanity; and have pampered a morbid and rebellious
spirit, that is a <ins title="Original spelling">grevious</ins> sin against your God. Shake off
your lethargy and cynicism, and let a busy future redeem a
vagrant and worthless past. ‘<i>He that goeth forth and weepeth,
bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,
bringing his sheaves with him.</i>’”</p>
<p>The flowers dropped on her bosom, and, clasping her hands
across her forehead, she turned her face towards the sea, and
seemed pondering his words.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, my purse has always been open to the needy,
and Elsie was my almoner. Whenever you find a destitute
family, or hear an appeal for help, I shall gladly respond, and
constitute you the agent for the distribution of my charity-fund.
As for bearing the sorrows of others, pray excuse me.
I am so weighed down with my own burdens that I have no
strength or leisure to spare to my neighbors, and since I ask
no aid, must not be censured for rendering none. It is utterly
useless to urge me to enter society, for like that sad
pilgrim in Brittany, ‘In losing solitude I lose the half of my
soul. I go out into the world with a secret horror. When I
withdraw, I gather together and lock up my scattered treasure,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_319"></a>319</span>
but I put away my ideas sorely handled, like fruits fallen from
the tree upon stones.’ No, no; in seclusion I find the only
modicum of peace that earth can ever yield me, and can
readily understand why Chateaubriand avoided those crowds
which he denominated, ‘The vast desert of men.’”</p>
<p>“You must not be offended, if, in reply, I remind you of
the rude but vigorous words of that prince of cynics, Schopenhauer,
‘Society is a fire at which the wise man from a prudent
distance warms himself; not plunging into it, like the fool
who after getting well blistered, rushes into the coldness of
solitude, and complains that the fire burns.’ Of the two evils,
reckless dissipation and gloomy isolation, the latter is probably
an economy of sin; but since neither is inevitable, we
should all endeavor to render ourselves useful members of
society, and unfurl over our circle the banner of St. Paul,
‘Use this world as not abusing it.’ Mrs. Gerome, do not obstinately
mar the present and future, by brooding bitterly
over the trials of the past; but try to believe that, indeed,—</p>

<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> ‘Sorrows humanize our race;</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>He watched her eagerly yet gravely, hoping that her face
would soften; but she raised her hand with a proud, impatient
motion.</p>
<p>“You talk at random, concerning matters of which you
know nothing. I hate the world and have abjured it, and you
might as well go down yonder and harangue the ocean on the
sin of its ceaseless muttering, as expect to remodel my aimless,
blank life.”</p>
<p>Pained and disappointed, he remained silent, and, as if
conscious of a want of courtesy, she added,—</p>
<p>“Do not allow your generous heart to be disquieted on my
account, but leave me to a fate which can not be changed,—which
I have endured seven years, and must bear to my grave.
Now that you see how desolate I am, pity me, and be silent.”</p>
<p>“It will be difficult for you to regain your strength here,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_320"></a>320</span>
where so many mournful associations surround you, and I
came to-day to beg you to take a trip somewhere, by sea or
land. Almost any change of scene and air will materially
benefit you, and you need not be absent more than a few weeks.
Will you take the matter under consideration?”</p>
<p>“No, sir; why should I? Can hills or waves, dells or
lakes, cure a mind which you assure me is diseased? Can sea
breeze or mountain air fan out recollections that have jaundiced
the heart, or furnish an opiate that will effectually
deaden and quiet regret? I long ago tried your remedy—travelling,
and for four years I wandered up and down, and
over the face of the old world; but amid the crumbling
columns of Persepolis, I was still Agla Gerome, the wretched;
and when I stood on the margin of the Lake of Wan, I saw in
its waves the reflection of the same hopeless woman who now
lies before you. Change of external surroundings is futile,
and no more affects the soul than the roar of surface-surf
changes the hollow of an ocean bed where the dead sleep;
and, verily,—</p>

<p class="cg">‘My heart is a drear Golgotha, where all the ground is white<br>
With the wrecks of joys that have perished,—the skeletons of delight.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>He saw that in her present mood expostulation would only
aggravate the evil he longed to correct, and hoping to divert
the current of her thoughts, he said,—</p>
<p>“I trust you will not deem me impertinently curious if I
ask what singular freak bestowed upon you the name of
‘Agla’?”</p>
<p>A startling change swept over her features, and her tone
was haughtily challenging.</p>
<p>“What interest can Dr. Grey find in a matter so trivial? If
I were named Hecate or Persephone, would the world have a
right to demur, to complain, or to criticise?”</p>
<p>“When a lady bears the mystic name, which, in past ages,
was given to the Deity, by a race who, if superstitious, were
at least devout and reverent, she should not be surprised if it
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_321"></a>321</span>
excites wonder and comment. Forgive me, however, if my inquiry
annoyed you.”</p>
<p>He rose and took his hat, but her hand caught his arm.</p>
<p>“Do you know the import of the word?”</p>
<p>“Yes; I understand the significance of the letters, and the
wonderful power attributed to them when arranged in the
triangles and called the ‘Shield of David.’ Knowing that it
was considered talismanic, I could not imagine why you were
christened with so mystical a name.”</p>
<p>“I was never christened.”</p>
<p>He could not explain the confusion and displeasure which
the question excited, and anxious to relieve her of any feeling
of annoyance, he added,—</p>
<p>“Have you ever looked into the nature of the <i>Aglaophotis</i>?”</p>
<p>She struggled up from her cushions, and exclaimed, with a
vehemence that startled him,—</p>
<p>“What induced you to examine it? I know that it is a
strange plant, growing out of solid marble, and accounted a
charm by Arab magicians. Well, Dr. Grey, do not I belong
to that species? You see before you a human specimen of
<i>Aglaophotis</i>, growing out of a marble heart.”</p>
<p>Sometimes an exaggerated whimsicality trenches so closely
upon insanity, that it is difficult to discriminate between
them; and, as Dr. Grey noted the peculiarly cold glitter of
her large eyes, and the restless movement of her usually quiet
hands, he dreaded that the crushing weight on her heart
would ultimately impair her mind. Now he abruptly changed
the topic.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, whenever it is agreeable to you to drive
down the beach or across the woods and among the hills, it
will afford me much pleasure to place my horse, buggy, and
myself at your disposal; and, in fine weather like this, a drive
of a few miles would invigorate you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I shall not trouble you, for I have my low-swung
easy carriage, and my grays—my fatal grays. Ah if
they would only serve me as they did my poor Elsie! When
I am strong enough to take the reins, I will allow them an
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_322"></a>322</span>
opportunity. Dr. Grey, if I seem rude, forgive me. You are
very kind and singularly patient, and sometimes when you
have left me, I feel ashamed of my inability to prove my
sincere appreciation of your goodness. For these beautiful
flowers, I thank you cordially.”</p>
<p>She held out her hand, and, as he accepted it, he drew from
his pocket the silver key which he had so carefully preserved.</p>
<p>“Accident made me the custodian of this key, which I
found on the floor the day of Elsie’s burial. Knowing that it
belonged to your escritoire, whence I saw you take it, I
thought it best not to commit it to a servant’s care, and have
kept it in my pocket until I thought you might need it.”</p>
<p>Although the room was growing dim, he detected the expression
of dread that crossed her countenance, and saw her
bite her thin lip with vexation.</p>
<p>“You have worn for one month the key of my desk, where
lie all my papers and records; and when I was so desperately
ill, I presume you looked into the drawers, merely to ascertain
whether I had prepared my will?”</p>
<p>The mockery of her tone stung him keenly, but he allowed
no evidence of the wound to escape him. Bending over her as
she sat partially erect, supported by cushions, he took her
white face tenderly in his hands, and said, very calmly and
gently,—</p>
<p>“When you know me better, you will realize how groundless
is your apprehension that I have penetrated into the recesses
of your writing-desk. Knowing that it contained valuable
papers, I guarded it as jealously as you could have done; and,
upon the honor of a gentleman, I assure you I am as ignorant
of its contents as if I had never entered the house. When I
consider it essential to my peace of mind to become acquainted
with your antecedents, I shall come to you and ask what I
desire to learn. While you were so ill, I told Robert that your
friends should be notified of your imminent danger, and inquired
of him whether you had made a will, as I deemed it
my duty to inform your agent of your alarming condition.
He either could not or would not give me any satisfactory
reply, and there the matter ended. When I am gone, do not
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_323"></a>323</span>
reproach yourself for having so unjustly impugned my
motives, for I shall not allow myself to believe that you really
entertain so contemptible an opinion of me; and shall ascribe
your hasty accusation to mere momentary chagrin and pique.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sir! you ought not to wonder that I am so suspicious;
you—but how can you understand the grounds of my distrust,
unless—”</p>
<p>“Hush! We will not discuss a matter which can only excite
and annoy you. Mrs. Gerome, under all circumstances
you may unhesitatingly trust me, and I beg to assure you I
shall never divulge anything confided to me. You need a
friend, and perhaps some day you may consider me worthy to
serve you in that capacity; meantime, as your physician, I
shall continue to watch over and control you. To-day you
have cruelly overtasked your exhausted system, and I can
not permit you to remain here any longer. Come immediately
to your own room.”</p>
<p>His manner was so quietly authoritative that she obeyed
instantly, and when he lifted her from the sofa, she took his
arm, and walked towards the door. Before they had crossed
the hall, he felt her reel and lean more heavily against him,
and silently he took the thin form in his arms, and carried
her to her room.</p>
<p>The gray head was on his shoulder, and the cold marble
cheek touched his, as he laid her softly down on her bed and
arranged her pillows. He rang for Katie, and, in crossing
the floor, stepped on something hard. It was too dusky in
the closely curtained apartment to see any object so small,
but he swept his hand across the carpet and picked up the
key that had slipped from her nerveless fingers. Placing it
beside her, he smiled and said,—</p>
<p>“You are incorrigibly careless. Are you not afraid to tax
my curiosity so severely, and tempt me so pertinaciously, by
strewing your keys in my path? The next time I pick up
this one, which belongs to your escritoire, I shall engage some
one to act as your guardian. Katie, be sure she takes that
tonic mixture three times a day. Good-night.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_324"></a>324</span></div>
<p>When the sound of his retreating footsteps died away, Mrs.
Gerome thrust the key under her pillow, and murmured,—</p>
<p>“I wonder whether this Ulpian can be as true, as trusty, as
nobly fearless as his grand old Roman namesake, whom not
even the purple of Severus could save from martyrdom? Ah!
if Ulpian Grey is really all that he appears. But how dare I
hope, much less believe it? Verily, he reminds me of Madame
de Chatenay’s description of Joubert, ‘He seems to be a soul
that by accident had met with a body, and tried to make the
best of it.’”</p>
<p>“Did you speak to me, ma’am?” asked Katie, who was
bustling about, preparing to light the lamp.</p>
<p>“No. The room is like a tomb. Open the blinds and loop
back all the curtains, so that I can look out.”</p>

</div>
<p>“Doctor Grey, sister says she wants to see you, before you
go to town.”</p>
<p>Jessie Owen came softly up to the table where Dr. Grey sat
writing, and stood with her hand on his knee.</p>
<p>“Very well. Tell sister I will come to her as soon as I
finish this letter. Where is she?”</p>
<p>“In the library.”</p>
<p>“In ten minutes I shall be at leisure.”</p>
<p>He found Salome with a piece of sewing in her hand, and
her young sister leaning on her lap, chattering merrily about
a nest full of eggs which she and Stanley had found that
morning in a corner of the orchard; while the latter swung on
the back of her chair, winding over his finger a short curl
that lay on her neck. It was a pleasant, peaceful, homelike
picture, worthy of Eastman Johnson’s brush, and for thirty
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_325"></a>325</span>
years such a group had not been seen in that quiet old library.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey paused at the threshold, to admire the graceful
pose of Jessie’s fairy figure,—the lazy nonchalance of Stanley’s
posture,—and the finely shaped head that rose above both,
like some stately lily, surrounded by clustering croci; but
Salome was listening for his footsteps, and turned her head at
his entrance.</p>
<p>“Stanley, take Jessie up to my room, and show her your
Chinese puzzle. When I want either or both of you, I will
call you. Close the door after you, and mind that you do
not get to romping, and shake the house down.”</p>
<p>“How very pretty Jessie has grown during the last year.
Her complexion has lost its muddy tinge, and is almost
waxen,” said the doctor, when the children had left the room
and scampered up stairs.</p>
<p>“She is a very sweet-tempered and affectionate little thing,
but I never considered her pretty. She is too much like her
father.”</p>
<p>“Salome, death veils all blemishes.”</p>
<p>“That depends very much on the character of the survivors;
but we will not discuss abstract propositions,—especially
since I have resolved to follow the old oriental maxim,—</p>

<p class="cg">‘Leave ancestry behind, despise heraldic art,<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Dr. Grey, the week has ended, and I took the liberty of reminding
you of the fact, as I am anxious to acquaint you
with my purposes for the future.”</p>
<p>He drew a chair near hers, and seated himself.</p>
<p>“Well, Salome, I hope that reflection has changed your
views, and taught you the wisdom of my sister’s course with
reference to yourself.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, the season of deliberation you forced
upon me has only strengthened and intensified my desire
to carry into execution the project I have so long dreamed of;
and to-day I am more than ever firmly resolved to follow, at
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_326"></a>326</span>
all hazards, the dictates of my own judgment, no matter
with whose opinions or wishes they may conflict.”</p>
<p>She expected that he would expostulate, and plead against
her decision, but he merely bowed, and remained silent.</p>
<p>“My object in asking this interview was to ascertain how
soon it would be convenient for you to place in my hands the
legacy of one thousand dollars which was bequeathed to me on
condition that I went upon the stage; and also to inquire
what you intend to do with the children, of whom Miss Jane’s
will constitutes you the guardian?”</p>
<p>“You wish me to understand that you are determined to
defy the wishes of your best friend, and take a step which
distressed her beyond expression?”</p>
<p>“I shall certainly go upon the stage.”</p>
<p>“I have no alternative but to accept your decision, which
you are well aware I regard as exceedingly deplorable. The
money can be paid to you to-morrow, if you desire it. Hoping
that you would abandon this freak, I had intended to keep
the children here, under your supervision, while I removed to
my house in town, and left their tuition to Miss Dexter; but
since you have decided otherwise, I shall remain here for the
present, keeping them with me, at least until after Muriel’s
marriage. The income from this farm averages two thousand
dollars a year, and will not only amply provide for their
wants and education, but will enable me to lay aside annually
a portion of that amount. When Muriel marries, Miss Dexter
may not be willing to remain here, and if she leaves us I
shall endeavor to find as worthy and reliable a substitute.
Have you any objection to this arrangement?”</p>
<p>“I have no right to utter any, since you are the legal guardian
of the children. But contingencies might arise for which
it seems you have not provided.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean that I can trust Jessie and Stanley to you, but
when you are married I prefer that they should find another
home; or, if need be, Jessie can come to me.”</p>
<p>An angry flush dyed Dr. Grey’s olive face, and kindled a
fiery gleam in his usually mild, clear, blue eyes, but looking at
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_327"></a>327</span>
the girl’s compressed and trembling lips, and noting the underlying
misery which her defiant expression could not cover,
his displeasure gave place to profound compassion.</p>
<p>“Salome, dismiss that cause of anxiety from your mind,
and trust the assurance I offer you now,—that when I marry,
my wife will be worthy to assist me in guiding and governing
my wards.”</p>
<p>She was prepared to hear him retort that the career she had
chosen would render her an unsuitable counsellor for little
Jessie; and conscious that she had deeply wounded him, his
calm reply was the sharpest rebuke he could possibly have
administered.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I have no extraordinary amount of tenderness
for the children, because they are indissolubly associated with
that period of my life to which I never recur without pain
and humiliation that you can not possibly realize or comprehend;
still, I am not exactly a brute, and I do not wish them
to be trained to regard me as a Pariah, or to be told that I
have forfeited their respect and affection. When I am gone,
let them think kindly of me.”</p>
<p>“Your request is a reflection upon my friendship, and is
so exceedingly unjust that I am surprised and pained; but let
that pass. I am sure I need not tell you that your wishes
shall be complied with. I have often thought that after
Stanley completed his studies, I would take him into my office,
and teach him my own profession. Have you any objection
to this scheme?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. I am willing to trust him implicitly to you.
He has one terrible fault which I have been trying to correct,
and which I hope you will not lose sight of. The boy seems
constitutionally addicted to telling stories, and prefers falsehood
to truth. I have punished him repeatedly for this habit,
and you must, if possible, save him from the pauper vice of
lying, which is peculiarly detestable to me. I know less of
the little one’s character, but believe that she is not afflicted
with this evil tendency.”</p>
<p>“Stanley’s fault has not escaped me, and two days ago I
was obliged to punish him for a gross violation of the truth;
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_328"></a>328</span>
but as he grows older, I trust he will correct this defect, and
I shall faithfully endeavor to show him its enormity. Is
there anything else you wish to say to me about the children?
I will very gladly hear any suggestions you can offer.”</p>
<p>“No, sir. I have governed myself so badly, that it ill becomes
me to dictate to you how they should be trained. God
knows, I am heartily glad they were mercifully thrown into
your hands; and if you can only make Stanley Owen such a
man as you are, the old blot on the name may be effaced.
From Mark and Joel I have not heard for several months, and
presume they will be sturdy but unlettered mechanics. If I
succeed, I shall interfere and send them to school; otherwise,
they must take the chances for letters and a livelihood.”</p>
<p>“Salome, you are bartering life-long peace and happiness
for the momentary gratification of a whim, prompted solely
by vanity. How worthless are the brief hollow plaudits of
the world (which will regard you merely as the toy of an
hour), in comparison with the affection and society of your
own family? Here, in your home, how useful, how contented
you might be!”</p>
<p>Her only reply was a hasty, imperious wave of the hand,
and a long silence followed.</p>
<p>In the bright morning light that streamed in through the
tendrils of honeysuckle clambering around the window, Dr.
Grey looked searchingly at the orphan, and could scarcely
realize that this pale, proud, pain-stricken face, was the same
rosy round one, fair and fearless, that had first met his gaze
under the pearly apple-blossoms.</p>
<p>Then, pink flesh, hazel eyes, vermillioned lips, and glossy
hair had preferred incontestable claims to beauty; now, an
artist would have curiously traced the fine lines and curves
daintily drawn about eyes, brow and mouth, by the stylus of
care, of hopelessness, of wild bursts of passion. Her figure
retained its rounded symmetry, but the countenance traitorously
revealed the struggles, the bitter disappointments, the
vindictive jealousy, and rudely-smitten and blasted hopes,
that had robbed her days of peace and her nights of sleep.</p>
<p>Until this moment, Dr. Grey had not fully appreciated the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_329"></a>329</span>
change that had been wrought by two tedious years, and as he
scrutinized the sadly sharpened and shadowed features, a
painful feeling of humiliation and almost of self-reproach
sprang from the consciousness that his inability to reciprocate
her devoted love had brought down this premature blight upon
a young and whilom happy, careless girl,—transforming
her into a reckless, hardened, hopeless woman.</p>
<p>While his inexorable conscience fully exonerated him from
censure, his generous heart ached in sympathy for hers, and
his chivalric tenderness for all things weaker than himself,
bled at the reflection that he had been unintentionally instrumental
in darkening a woman’s life.</p>
<p>But hope,—beautiful, blue-eyed, sunny-browed hope,—whispered
that this was a fleeting youthful fancy; and that
absence and time would dispel the temporary gloom that now
lay on her heart, like some dense cold vapor which would
grow silvery, and melt in morning sunshine.</p>
<p>Under his steady gaze the blood rose slowly to its old signal-station
on her cheeks, and she put up one hand to shield its
scarlet banners.</p>
<p>“Salome, will you tell me when and where you intend to
go? Since you have resolved to leave us, I desire to know in
what way I can aid you, or contribute to the comfort of the
journey you contemplate.”</p>
<p>“From the last letter of Professor V——, declining your
proposal that he should come here and instruct me, I learn
that within the ensuing ten days he will sail for Havre, <i>en
route</i> to Italy, where he intends spending the winter. If
possible, I wish to reach New York before his departure, and
to accompany him. The thousand dollars will defray my expenses
until I have completed my musical training, which
will fit me for the stage, and insure an early engagement in
some operatic company. Knowing your high estimate of
Professor V——, both as a gentleman and as a musician, I
am exceedingly anxious to place myself under his protection;
especially since his wife and children will meet him at Paris,
and go on to Naples. Are you willing to give me a letter of
introduction, commending me to his favorable <ins title="Added quote and question mark">consideration?”</ins></p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_330"></a>330</span></div>
<p>The hesitating timidity with which this request was uttered,
touched him more painfully than aught that had ever passed
between them.</p>
<p>“My dear child, did you suppose that I would permit you
to travel alone to New York, and thrust yourself upon the
notice of strangers? I will accompany you whenever you go,
and not only present you to the professor, but request him
to receive you into his family as a member of his home-circle.”</p>
<p>A quiver shook out the hard lines around her lips, and she
turned her eyes full on his.</p>
<p>“You are very kind, sir, but that is not necessary; and a
letter of introduction will have the same effect, and save you
from a disagreeable trip. Your time is too valuable to be
wasted on such journeys, and I have no right to expect that
solely on my account you should tear yourself away—from—those
dear to you.”</p>
<p>“I think my time could not be more profitably employed
than in promoting the happiness and welfare of my adopted
sister, who was so inexpressibly dear to my noble Janet. It
is neither pleasant nor proper for a young lady to travel without
an escort.”</p>
<p>He had risen, and laid his hand lightly on the back of her
chair.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“She smiled; but he could see arise<br>
Her soul from far adown her eyes,<br>
Prepared as if for sacrifice.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“Is it a mercy, think you, Dr. Grey, to foster a fastidiousness
that can only barb the shafts of penury? What right
have toiling paupers to harbor in their thoughts those dainty
scruples that belong appropriately to princesses and palaces?
Why tell me that this, that, or the other step is not ‘proper,’
when you know that necessity goads me? Sir, I feel now like
that isolated Florentine, and echo her words,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> ‘And since help</p>
<p class="cg">Must come to me from those who love me not,<br>
Farewell, all helpers. I must help myself,<br>
And am alone from henceforth.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_331"></a>331</span></div>
<p>“You prefer that I should not accompany you to New
York?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; but I gratefully accept a letter to Professor
V——.”</p>
<p>“Very well; it shall be in readiness when you wish it.
Have you fixed any time for your departure?”</p>
<p>“This is Friday,—and I shall go on the six o’clock train,
Monday morning.”</p>
<p>“Is there any service that I can render you in the interim?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you.”</p>
<p>“As you have no likeness of the children, would it be agreeable
to you to have their photographs taken to-day,—and, at
the same time, a picture of yourself to be left with them? If
you desire it I will meet you in town, at the gallery, at any
hour you may designate.”</p>
<p>Standing before him, she answered, almost scornfully,—</p>
<p>“I shall not have time. Some day—if I succeed—I will
send them my photograph, taken in gorgeous robes as <i>prima
donna</i>; provided you promise that said robes shall not constitute
a <i>San Benito</i>, and doom the picture to the flames.
I will detain you no longer, Dr. Grey, as the sole object of
the interview has been accomplished.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me; but I have a word to say. Your career will
probably be brilliantly successful, in which event you will feel
no want of admirers and friends,—and will doubtless ignore
me for those who flatter you more, and really love you less.
But, Salome, failure may overtake you, bringing in its train
countless evils that at present you can not realize,—poverty,
disease, desolation, in the midst of strangers,—and all the
woes that, like hungry wolves, attack homeless, isolated
women. I earnestly hope that the leprous hand of disaster
and defeat may never be laid upon your future, but the most
cautious human schemes are fallible—often futile—and if you
should be unsuccessful in your programme, and find yourself
unable to consummate your plans, I ask you now, by the
memory of our friendship, by the sacred memory of the dead,
to promise me that you will immediately write and acquaint
me with all your needs, your wishes, your real condition.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_332"></a>332</span>
Promise me, dear Salome, that you will turn instantly to me,
as you would to Stanley, were he in my place,—that you will
let me prove myself your elder brother,—your truest, best
friend.”</p>
<p>He put his hand on her head, but she recoiled haughtily
from his touch.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I promise you,</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘I will not soil thy purple with my dust,<br>
Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass.’</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>I promise you that if misfortune, failure, and penury lay
hold of me, you shall be the last human being who will learn
it; for I will cloak myself under a name that will not betray
me, and crawl into some lazaretto, and be buried in some
potter’s field, among other mendicants,—unknown, ‘unwept,
unhonored, and unsung.’”</p>
<p>If some motherless young chamois, rescued from destruction,
and pampered and caressed, had suddenly turned, and
savagely bitten and lacerated the hand that fondled and fed it,
Dr. Grey would not have been more painfully startled; but
experience had taught him the uselessness of expostulation
during her moods of perversity, and he took his hat and
turned away, saying, almost sternly,—</p>
<p>“Bear in mind that neither palace nor potter’s field can
screen you from the scrutiny of your Maker, or mask and
shelter your shivering soul in the solemn hour when He demands
its last reckoning.”</p>
<p>“Which ‘reckoning,’ your eminently Christian charity assures
you will prove more terrible for me than the Bloody
Assizes. ‘By the memory of our friendship!’ Oh, shallow
sham! Pinning my faith to the <i>dictum</i>, ‘The tide of friendship
does not rise high on the bank of perfection,’ my fatuity
led me to expect that your friendship was wide as the universe,
and lasting as eternity. Wise Helvetius told me that,
‘To be loved, we should merit but little esteem; all superiority
attracts awe and aversion;’ <i>ergo</i>, since my credentials
of unworthiness were indisputable, I laid claim to a vast
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_333"></a>333</span>
share of your favor. But, alas! the logic of the seers is well-nigh
as hollow as my hopes.”</p>
<p>He looked over his shoulder at her, with an expression of
pity as profound as that which must have filled the eyes of
the angel, who, standing in the blaze of the sword of wrath,
watched Adam and Eve go mournfully forth into the blistering
heats of unknown lands. Before he could reply, she
laughed contemptuously, and continued,—</p>
<p>“<i>Nil desperandum</i>, Dr. Grey. Remember that, ‘Faith and
persistency are life’s architects; while doubt and despair bury
all under the ruins of any endeavor.’ When I have trilled
a fortune into that abhorred vacuum, my pocket, I shall go
down to the Tigris, and catch the mate to Tobias’ fish, and
by the cremation thereof, fumigate my pestiferous soul, and
smoke out the Asmodeus that has so long and comfortably
dwelt there.”</p>
<p>“God grant you a Raphael, as guide on your journey,” was
his calm, earnest reply, as he disappeared, closing the door
after him.</p>
<p>When the sound of his buggy-wheels on the gravelled
avenue told her he had gone, she threw herself on the floor,
and crossing her arms on a chair, hid her face in them.</p>
<p>During Saturday, no opportunity presented itself for renewing
the conversation, and early on Sunday morning Dr.
Grey sent to her room a package marked $1,000.00—though
really containing $1,500.00—and a letter addressed to Professor
V——. Without examining either, she threw them into
her trunk, which was already packed, and went down to
breakfast.</p>
<p>She declined accompanying Miss Dexter and Muriel to
church, alleging, as an excuse, that it was the last day she
could spend with the children.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey approached her when the remainder of the family
had left the table, where she sat abstractedly jingling her
fork and spoon.</p>
<p>He noticed that her breakfast was untasted, and said, very
gently,—</p>
<p>“I suppose that you wish to visit our dear Jane’s grave,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_334"></a>334</span>
before you leave us, and, if agreeable to you, I shall be glad
to have you accompany me there to-day.”</p>
<p>“Thank you; but if I go, it will be alone.”</p>
<p>He stooped to kiss Jessie, who leaned against her sister’s
chair, and, when he left the room, Salome caught the child in
her arms, and pressed her lips twice to the spot where his had
rested.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon she eluded the children’s watchful
eyes, and stole away from the house, taking the road that led
towards “Solitude.” In one portion of the osage hedge that
surrounded the place, the lower branches had died, leaving a
small opening, and here Salome gained access to the grounds.
Walking cautiously under the thick and dark masses of shrubbery
and trees, she reached the arched path near the clump of
pyramidal deodars, whose long, drooping plumes were fluttering
in the evening wind.</p>
<p>Thence she could command a view of the house and grounds
in front, and thence she saw that concerning which she had
come to satisfy herself,—believing that the evidence of her
own eyes would fortify her for the approaching trial of separation.
Dr. Grey’s horse and buggy stood near the side
gate, and Dr. Grey was walking very slowly up and down the
avenue leading to the beach, while Mrs. Gerome’s tall form
leaned on his arm, and the greyhound followed sulkily.</p>
<p>Salome had barely time to look upon the spectacle that fired
her heart and well-nigh maddened her, ere the dog lifted his
head, gave one quick, savage bark, and darted in the direction
of the cedars.</p>
<p>Dread of detection and of Dr. Grey’s pitying gaze was more
potent than fear of the brute, and she ran swiftly towards
the gap in the hedge, by which she had effected an entrance
into the secluded grounds. Just as she reached it, the greyhound
bounded up, and they met in front of the opening. He
set his teeth in her clothes, tearing away a streamer of her
black dress, and, as she silently struggled, he bit her arm
badly, mangling the flesh, from which the blood spouted.
Disengaging a shawl which she wore around her shoulders, she
threw it over his head, and, as the meshes caught in his collar,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_335"></a>335</span>
and temporarily entangled him, she sprang through the gap,
and seized a heavy stick which lay within reach. He followed,
snarling and pawing at the shawl that ultimately dropped at
Salome’s feet; but finding himself beyond the boundary he
was expected to guard, and probably satisfied with the punishment
already inflicted, he retreated before a well-aimed blow
that drove him back into the enclosure.</p>
<p>The instant he started towards the cedars Dr. Grey suspected
mischief, and, placing Mrs. Gerome on a bench that
surrounded an elm, he hurried in the same direction.</p>
<p>When he reached the spot, the dog was snuffing at a patch
of bombazine that lay on the grass; and, confirmed in his sad
suspicion, the doctor passed through the opening in the hedge
and looked about for the figure which he dreaded, yet expected
to see.</p>
<p>Bushy undergrowth covered the ground for some distance,
and, hoping that nothing more serious than fright had resulted
from the escapade, he stowed away the bombazine fragment
in his coat pocket, and slowly retraced his steps.</p>
<p>Secreted by two friendly oaks that spread their low boughs
over her, Salome had seen his anxious face peering around
for the intruder, and when he abandoned the search and disappeared,
she smothered a bitter laugh, and strove to stanch
the blood that trickled from the gash by binding her handkerchief
over it. Torn muscles and tendons ached and
smarted; but the great agony that seemed devouring her heart
rendered her almost oblivious of physical pain. In the dusk
of coming night she crossed the gloomy forest, where a whippoorwill
was drearily lamenting, and, walking over an unfrequented
portion of the lawn, went up to her own room.</p>
<p>She bathed and bound up the wound as securely as the use
of only one hand would permit, and put on a dress whose
sleeves fastened closely at the wrist.</p>
<p>Ere long, Dr. Grey’s clear voice echoed through the hall,
and the sound made her wince, like the touch of some glowing
brand.</p>
<p>“Jessie, where is sister Salome? Tell her tea is ready.”</p>
<p>The orphan went down and took her seat, but did not even
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_336"></a>336</span>
glance at the master of the house, who looked anxiously at her
as she entered.</p>
<p>During the meal Jessie asked for some sweetmeats that
were placed in front of her sister, and, as the latter drew the
glass dish nearer, and proceeded to help her, the child exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Oh, look there! What is that dripping from your sleeve?
Ugh! it is blood.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Jessie! don’t be silly. Hush! and eat your
supper.”</p>
<p>Two drops of blood had fallen on the table-cloth, and the
girl instantly set her cup and saucer over them.</p>
<p>She felt the slow stream trickling down to her wrist, and
put her arm in her lap.</p>
<p>“Is anything the matter?” asked Dr. Grey, who had observed
the quick movement.</p>
<p>“I hurt my arm a little, that is all.”</p>
<p>Her tone forbade a renewal of inquiry, and, as soon as possible,
she withdrew to her room, to adjust the bandage.</p>
<p>The children were playing in the library, and Muriel was
walking with her governess on the wide piazza.</p>
<p>While Salome was trying by the aid of fingers and teeth to
draw a strip of linen tightly over her wound, a tap at the
door startled her.</p>
<p>“I am engaged, and can see no one just now.”</p>
<p>“Salome, I want to speak to you, and shall wait here until
I do.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Dr. Grey. I will come down in ten minutes.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, but I insist upon seeing you here, and hope
you will not compel me to force the door open.”</p>
<p>She wrapped a towel around her arm, drew down her
sleeve, and opened the door.</p>
<p>“To what am I indebted for the honor of this interview?”</p>
<p>“To my interest in your welfare, which cannot be baffled.
Salome, what is the matter? You looked so pale that I
noticed you particularly, and saw the blood on the table-cloth.
My dear child, I will not be trifled with. Tell me
where you are hurt.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_337"></a>337</span></div>
<p>“Pray give yourself no uneasiness. I merely scraped and
bruised my arm. It is a matter of no consequence.”</p>
<p>“Of that I beg to be considered the best judge. Show me
your arm.”</p>
<p>“I prefer not to trouble you.”</p>
<p>He gently but firmly took hold of it, unwound the towel,
and she saw him start and shudder at sight of the mangled
flesh.</p>
<p>“An ugly gash! Tell me how you hurt yourself so
severely.”</p>
<p>“It is a matter that I do not choose to discuss; but since
you have seen it, I wish you would be so good as to dress and
bandage the wound.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my little sister! Will you never learn to trust your
brother?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Dr. Grey! will you never learn to let me alone, when
I am indulging the ‘Imp of the Perverse’ in an audience,
and do not wish to be interrupted?”</p>
<p>She mimicked his pleading tone so admirably that his face
flushed.</p>
<p>“Come to the sitting-room. No one can disturb us there,
and I will attend to your injury, which is really serious.”</p>
<p>She followed him, and stood without flinching one iota,
while he clipped away the jagged pieces of flesh, covered the
long gash with adhesive plaster, and carefully bandaged the
whole.</p>
<p>“Salome, you must dismiss all idea of starting to-morrow,
for indeed it would not be safe for you to travel alone, with
your arm in this condition. It may give you much trouble
and suffering.”</p>
<p>“Which, of course, <i>nolens volens</i>, I must bear as best I
may; but, so surely as I live to see daylight, I shall start,
even if I knew I should have to stop <i>en route</i> and bury my
pretty arm, and be forced to buy a cork one, wherewith to
gesticulate gracefully when I die as ‘Azucena.’ There! thank
you, Dr. Grey; of course you are very good,—you always are.
Shall I bid you all good-by now, or wait till morning? Better
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_338"></a>338</span>
make my adieu to-night, so that I may not disturb the matutinal
slumbers of the household.”</p>
<p>There was a dangerous, starry sparkle in her eyes, that he
would not venture to defy, and, sighing heavily, he answered,—</p>
<p>“I shall accompany you to the depôt, and place you under
the protection of the conductor.”</p>
<p>“I do not desire to give you that trouble, and—”</p>
<p>“Hush! Do not grieve me any more than you have already
done, by your hasty, unkind, unfriendly speeches. I shall
see you in the morning.”</p>
<p>He left the room abruptly, to conceal the distress which he
did not desire her to discover; and having found Muriel and
Miss Dexter, Salome bade them good-by, requested them not
to disturb themselves next morning on her account, and called
the children to her room.</p>
<p>For two hours they sat beside her on the lounge, crying
over her impending departure, but when she had promised to
take them as far as the depôt, their thoughts followed other
currents, and very soon after, both slumbered soundly in
their trundle-bed.</p>
<p>With her cheek resting on her hand, Salome sat looking at
them, noting the glossiness of their curling hair, the flush on
their round faces, the regular breathing of peaceful childhood’s
sleep. Once she could have wept, and would have knelt
and prayed over them; but now her own overmastering misery
had withered all the tenderness in her heart, and, while her
eyes of flesh rested on the orphans, her mental vision was
filled with the figure of that gray-haired woman hanging on
Dr. Grey’s arm. In a dull, cold, abstract way, she hoped that
the little ones would be happy,—how could they be otherwise
when fortune had committed them to Dr. Grey’s guardianship?
But a numb, desperate feeling had seized her, and she
cared for nothing, loved nothing, prayed for nothing.</p>
<p>How the hours of that night of wretchedness passed she
never knew; but when the little bird in the parlor clock
“cuckooed” three times, she was aroused from her reverie by
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_339"></a>339</span>
the tramp of horses’ hoofs on the gravel, and then the sharp
clang of the bell echoed through the silent house.</p>
<p>It was not unusual for messengers to summon Dr. Grey
during the night, and she was not surprised when, some moments
later, she heard his voice in the hall. After the lapse
of a quarter of an hour, his firm, well-known step approached
and paused at her threshold.</p>
<p>“Salome, are you up?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Come into the passage.”</p>
<p>She opened the door, and stood with the candle in her
hand.</p>
<p>“I regret exceedingly that I am compelled to leave here
immediately, as I must hasten to see a man and child who
have been horribly burned and injured by the falling in of a
roof. The parties live some distance in the country, and I
fear I shall not be able to get back in time to go with you to
the cars. I shall drive as rapidly as possible, and hope to accompany
you, but if I should be detained, here is a note which
I hastily scribbled to Mr. Miller, the conductor, whom you
will find a very kind and courteous gentleman. I sincerely
deplore this summons, but the sufferers are old friends of my
sister, and I hope you will believe that nothing but a case of
life and death would prevent me from seeing you aboard the
train.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, sir, that you thought it necessary to apologize.”</p>
<p>She was not yet prepared to part from him forever,—she
had been nerving herself for the final interview at the depôt;
but now it came with a shock that utterly stunned her, and
she reeled against the door-facing, as if recoiling from some
fearful blow.</p>
<p>The livid pallor of her lips, and the spasm of agony that
contracted her features, frightened him, and, as he sprang
closer to her, the candle fell from her fingers. He caught it,
ere it reached the mat, and placed it on a chair.</p>
<p>“My dear child, your arm pains you, and I beg you to defer
your journey at least until Tuesday. I shall be anxious and
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_340"></a>340</span>
miserable about you, if you go this morning, and, for my
sake, Salome, if not for your own, remain here one day longer.
I have not asked many things of you, and I trust you will not
refuse this last request I may ever be allowed to make.”</p>
<p>She attempted to speak, but there came only a quiver across
her mouth, and a sickly smile that flickered over the ghastly
proud face, like the lying sunshine of Indian summer on
marble cenotaphs.</p>
<p>“Salome, you will, to oblige me, wait until Tuesday?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, and mastered her weakness.</p>
<p>“No, Dr. Grey; I must go at once. I take all the hazard.”</p>
<p>“Then you will find on the mantelpiece in my room, a
paper containing directions for the treatment of your arm,
which demands care and attention. I am sorry you are so
obstinate, and, if I possessed the authority, I would forbid
your departure.”</p>
<p>He could not endure the despairing expression of her eyes,
which seemed supernaturally large and brilliant, and his own
quailed, for the first time within his recollection. She knew
that she was going away forever, to avoid the sight of his happiness
with Mrs. Gerome; that, in comparison with that torture,
all other trials, even separation, would be endurable, but
the least evil was more severe than she had dreaded. Now, as
she looked up at his noble face, overshadowed with anxiety
and regret, and paler than she had ever seen it, the one prayer
of her heart was, that, ere a wife’s lips touched his, death
might claim him for its prey.</p>
<p>“Salome, I am deeply pained by the course you persist in
following, but I will not provoke and annoy you by renewed
expression of a disapprobation that has proved so ineffectual
in influencing your decision. God grant that the results may
sanction your confidence in your own judgment,—your distrust
of mine. I promised you once that I would pray for you,
and I wish to assure you, that, while I live, I shall never lay
my head upon my pillow without having first committed you
to the mercy and loving care of that Guardian who never
‘slumbers, nor sleeps.’ May God bless and guide you, my dear
young friend, and if not again in this world, grant that we
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_341"></a>341</span>
may meet in the Everlasting City of Peace. Little sister, be
sure to meet me in the Kingdom of Rest, where dear Janet
waits for us both.”</p>
<p>His calm eyes filled with tears, and his voice grew tremulous,
as he took Salome’s cold, passive hand, and kissed it.</p>
<p>“Good-by, Dr. Grey; if I find my way to heaven, it will be
because you are there. When I am gone, let my name and
memory be like that of the dead.”</p>
<p>She stood erect, with her fingers lying in his palm, and the
ring of her voice was like the clashing of steel against steel.</p>
<p>He bent down, and, for the first time, pressed his lips to her
forehead; then turned quickly and walked away. When he
reached the head of the stairs, he looked back and saw her
standing in the door, with the candle-light flaring over her
face; and in after years, he could never recall, without a keen
pang, that vision of a girlish form draped in mourning, and
of fair, rigid features, which hope and happiness could never
again soften and brighten.</p>
<p>Her splendid eyes followed him, as if the sole light of her
life were passing away forever; and, with a heavy sigh, he
hurried down the steps, realizing all the mournful burden of
that Portuguese sonnet,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand<br>
Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore<br>
Alone upon the threshold of my door<br>
Of individual life, I shall command<br>
The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand<br>
Serenely in the sunshine as before,<br>
Without the sense of that which I forbore—<br>
Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land<br>
Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine,<br>
With pulses that beat double. What I do<br>
And what I dream include thee, as the wine<br>
Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue<br>
God for myself, He hears that name of thine,<br>
And sees within my eyes the tears of two.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p>“I hope nothing has gone wrong, Robert? You look unusually
forlorn and doleful.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey stepped out of his buggy, and accosted the gardener,
who was leaning idly on the gate, holding a trowel
in his hand, and lazily puffing the smoke from his pipe.</p>
<p>“I thank you, sir; with us the world wags on pretty much
the same, but when a man has been planting violets on his
mother’s grave he does not feel like whistling and making
merry. Besides, to tell the truth,—which I do not like to
shirk,—I am getting very tired of this dismal, unlucky place.
If I had known as much before I bought it as I do now, all
the locomotives in America could not have dragged me here.
I was a stranger, and of course nobody thought it their special
duty to warn me; so I was bitten badly enough by the agent
who sold me this den of misfortune. Now, when it is too
late, there is no lack of busy tongues to tell me the place is
haunted, and has been for, lo! these many years.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Robert! I gave you credit for too much good
sense to listen to the gossip of silly old wives. Put all these
ridiculous tales of ghosts and hobgoblins out of your mind,
man, and do not make me laugh at you, as if you were a
child who had been so frightened by stories of ‘raw-head and
bloody-bones,’ that you were afraid to blow out your candle
and creep into bed.”</p>
<p>“I am neither a fool nor a coward, and I will fight anything
that I can feel has bone and muscle; but I am satisfied
that if all the water in Siloam were poured over this place, it
would not wash out the curse that people tell me has always
rested on it since the time the pirates first located here. I
can’t admit I believe in witches, but undoubtedly I do believe
in Satan, who seems to have a fee-simple to the place.
It is not enough that my poor mother is buried yonder, but
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_343"></a>343</span>
my wheat and oats took the rust; the mildew spoiled my grape
crop; the rains ruined my melons; the worms ate up every
blade of my grass; the cows have got the black-tongue; the
gale blew down my pigeon-house and mashed all my squabs;
and my splendid carnations and fuchsias are devoured by red
spider. Nothing thrives, and I am sick at heart.”</p>
<p>The dogged discontent written so legibly on his countenance,
did not encourage the visitor to enter into a discussion
of the abstract causes of blight, gales, and black-tongue, and
he merely answered,—</p>
<p>“The evils you have enumerated are not peculiar to any
locality; and all the farmers in this neighborhood are echoing
your complaints. How is Mrs. Gerome?”</p>
<p>“Neither better nor worse. You know what miserable
weather we have had for a week. This morning she ordered
the small carriage and horses brought to the door, and when
I took the reins, she dismissed me and said she preferred driving
herself. I told her the grays had not been used, and were
badly pampered standing so long in their stalls, and that I
was really afraid they would break her neck, as she was not
strong enough to manage them; but she laughed, and answered
that if they did, it would be the best day’s work they had ever
accomplished, and she would give them a chance. Down the
beach they went like a flash, and when she came home their
flanks smoked like a lime-kiln. What is ever to be done with
my mistress, I am sure I don’t know. She makes the house so
doleful, that nobody wants to stay here, and only yesterday
Katie and Phœbe, the cook, gave notice that they wished to
leave when the month was out. She has no idea what she
will do, or where she will go. We have wanted a hot-house,
and she ordered me to get the builder’s estimate of the cost of
two plans which she drew; but when I carried them to her,
she pushed them aside, and said she would think of the matter,
but thought she might leave this place, and therefore would
not need the building. She is as notionate as a child; and no
one but my poor mother could ever manage her. Hist! sir!
Don’t you hear her? You may be sure there is mischief brewing
when she sings like that.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_344"></a>344</span></div>
<p>Dr. Grey walked towards the house, and paused on the
portico to listen,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Quis est homo, qui non fleret<br>
Christi matrem si videret,<br>
In tanto supplicio.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The voice was not so strong as when he had heard it in
<i>Addio del Passata</i>, but the solemn mournfulness of its cadences
was better suited to the <i>Stabat Mater</i>, and indexed much
that no other method of expression would have reached.
After some moments she forsook Rossini, and began the <i>Agnus
Dei</i> from Haydn’s Third Mass,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Surely she could not render this grand strain if her soul
was in fierce rebellion; and, with strained ears and hushed
breath, Dr. Grey listened to the closing</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Dona nobis pacem,—pacem,—pacem.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It was a passionate, wailing prayer, and the only one that
ever crossed her lips, yet his heart throbbed with pleasure,
as he noted the tremor that seemed to shiver her voice into
silvery fragments; and as she ended, he knew that tears were
not far from her eyes.</p>
<p>When he entered the room, she had left the piano, and
wheeled a sofa in front of the grate, where she sat gazing,
vacantly into the fiery fretwork of glowing coals.</p>
<p>A copy of Turner’s “Liber Studiorum,” superbly bound in
purple velvet, lay on her knee, and into a corner of the sofa
she had tossed a square of canvas almost filled with silken
Parmese violets.</p>
<p>“Good-evening, Mrs. Gerome; I hope I do not interrupt
you.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey removed the embroidery to the table, and seated
himself in the sofa corner.</p>
<p>“Good evening. Interruption argues occupation and absorbed
attention, and the term is not applicable to me. I
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_345"></a>345</span>
who live as vainly, as uselessly, as fruitlessly, as some fakir
twirling his thumbs and staring at his beard, have little right
to call anything an interruption. My existence here is as
still, as stagnant, as some pool down yonder in the sedge
which last week’s waves left among the sand hillocks, and
your visits are like pebbles thrown into it, creating transient
ripples and circles.”</p>
<p>“You have gone back to the God of your æsthetic idolatry,”
said he, touching the “Liber Studiorum.”</p>
<p>“Yes, because ‘Beauty pitches her tents before him,’ and
his pencil is more potent in conjuring visions that enchant
my wearied mind, than Jemschid’s goblet or Iskander’s
mirror.”</p>
<p>“But why stand afar off, trusting to human and fallible
interpreters, when it is your privilege to draw near and
dwell in the essence of the only real and divine beauty?”</p>
<p>“Better reverence it behind a veil, than suffer like Semele.
I know my needs, and satisfy them fully. Once my heart was
as bare of adoration as Egypt’s tawny sands of crystal rain-pools;
but looking into the realm of nature and of art, I
chose the religion of the beautiful, and said to my famished
soul,</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘From every channel thro’ which Beauty runs,<br>
To fertilize the world with lovely things,<br>
I will draw freely, and be satisfied.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“This morbid sentimentality, this sickly gasping system of
æsthetics, <i>soi-disant</i> ‘Religion of the Beautiful,’ is the curse
of the age,—is a vast, universal vampire sucking the life
from humanity. Like other idolatries it may arrogate the
name of ‘Religion,’ but it is simply downright pagan materialism,
and its votaries of the nineteenth century should look
back two thousand years, and renew the <i>Panathenœa</i>. The
ancient Greek worship of æsthetics was a proud and pardonable
system, replete with sublime images; but the idols
of your emasculated creed are yellow-haired women with
straight noses,—are purple clouds and moon-silvered seas,—and
physical beauty constitutes their sole excellence. Lovely
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_346"></a>346</span>
landscapes and perfect faces are certainly entitled to a liberal
quota of earnest admiration; but a religion that contents
itself with merely material beauty, differs in nothing but
nomenclature from the pagan worship of Cybele, Venus, and
Astarte.”</p>
<p>A chill smile momentarily brightened Mrs. Gerome’s features,
and turning towards her visitor, she answered slowly,—</p>
<p>“Be thankful, sir, that even the worship of beauty lingers
in this world of sin and hate; and instead of defiling and
demolishing its altars, go to work zealously and erect new
ones at every cross-roads. Lessing spoke for me when he
said, ‘Only a misapprehended religion can remove us from
the beautiful, and it is proof that a religion is true and rightly
understood when it everywhere brings us back to the Beautiful.’”</p>
<p>“Pardon me. I accept Lessing’s words, but cavil at your
interpretation of them. His reverence for Beauty embraced
not merely physical and material types, but that nobler,
grander beauty which centres in pure ethics and ontology;
and a religion that seeks no higher forms than those of clay,—whether
Himalayas or ‘Greek Slave,’—whether emerald
icebergs, flashing under polar auroras, or the myosotis that
nods there on the mantelpiece,—a religion that substitutes
beauty for duty, and Nature for Nature’s God, is a shameful
sham, and a curse to its devotees. There is a beauty worthy
of all adoration, a beauty far above Antinous, or Gula or
Greek æsthetics,—a beauty that is not the <i>disjecta membra</i>
that modern maudlin sentimentality has left it,—but that
perfect and immortal ‘Beauty of Holiness,’ that outlives
marble and silver, pigment, stylus, and pagan poems that
deify dust.”</p>
<p>He leaned towards her, watching eagerly for some symptom
of interest in the face before him, and bent his head
until he inhaled the fragrance of the violets which clustered
on one side of the coil of hair.</p>
<p>“‘Beauty of Holiness.’ Show it to me, Dr. Grey. Is it at
La Trappe, or the Hospice of St. Bernard? Where are its
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_347"></a>347</span>
temples? Where are its worshippers? Who is its Hierophant?”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for a moment, as if to shut out some
painful vision evoked by his words.</p>
<p>“Sir, do you recollect the reply of Laplace, when Napoleon
asked him why there was no mention of God in his ‘<i>Mécanique
Celeste</i>?’ ‘<i>Sire, je n’avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse.</i>’
I was not sufficiently insane to base my religion of
beauty upon a holiness that was buried in the tomb supplied
by Joseph of Arimathea,—that was long ago hunted out of
the world it might have purified. Once I believed in, and
revered what I supposed was its existence, but I was speedily
disenchanted of my faith, for,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘I have seen those that wore Heaven’s armor, worsted:<br>
I have heard Truth lie:<br>
Seen Life, beside the founts for which it thirsted,<br>
Curse God and die.’</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Dr. Grey, I do not desire to sneer at your Christian trust,
and God knows I would give all my earthly possessions and
hopes for a religion that would insure me your calm resignation
and contentment; but the resurrection of my faith would
only resemble that beautiful floral <i>Palingenesis</i> (asserted by
Gaffarel and Kircher), which was but ‘the pale spectre of
a flower coming slowly forth from its own ashes,’ and speedily
dropping back into dust. Leave me in the enjoyment
of the only pleasure earth can afford me, the contemplation
of the beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Unless you blend with it the true and good, your love of
beauty will degenerate into the merely sensuous æsthetics,
which, at the present day, renders its votaries fastidious,
etiolated voluptuaries. The deification of humanity, so successfully
inaugurated by Feuerbach and Strauss, is now no
longer confined to realms of abstract speculation; but cultivated
sensualism has sunk so low that popular poets chant
the praises of Phryne and Cleopatra, and painters and sculptors
seek to immortalize types that degrade the taste of all
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_348"></a>348</span>
lovers of Art. The true mission of Art, whether through
the medium of books, statues, or pictures, is to purify and
exalt; but the curse of our age is, that the fashionable
pantheistic raving about Nature, and the apotheosizing of
physical loveliness,—is rapidly sinking into a worship of the
vilest elements of humanity and materialism. Pagan æsthetics
were purer and nobler than the system, which, under that
name, finds favor with our generation.”</p>
<p>She listened, not assentingly, but without any manifestation
of impatience, and while he talked, her eyes rested
dreamily upon the yellow beach, where,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Trampling up the sloping sand,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>In lines outreaching far and wide,<br>
The white-maned billows swept to land.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Whether she pondered his words, or was too entirely absorbed
by her own thoughts to heed their import, he had no
means of ascertaining.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, what have you painted recently?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, since my illness; and perhaps I shall never
touch my brush again. Sometimes I have thought I would
paint a picture of Handel standing up to listen to that sad
song from his own ‘Samson,’—‘<i>Total eclipse, no sun, no
moon</i>!’ But I doubt whether I could put on canvas that
grand, mournful, blind face, turned eagerly towards the
stage, while tears ran swiftly from his sightless eyes. Again,
I have vague visions of a dead Schopenhauer, seated in the
corner of the sofa, with his pet poodle, Putz, howling at
his master’s ghastly white features,—with his Indian Oupnekhat
lying on his rigid knee, and his gilded statuette of Gotama
Buddha grinning at him from the mantelpiece, welcoming
him to Nirwána. There stands my easel, empty and shrouded;
and here, from day to day, I sit idle, not lacking ideas, but
the will to clothe them. Unlike poor Maurice de Guérin,
who said that his ‘head was parching; that, like a tree which
had lived its life, he felt as though every passing wind were
blowing through dead branches in his top,’ I feel that my
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_349"></a>349</span>
brain is as vigorous and restless as ever, while my will alone
is paralyzed, and my heart withered and cold within me.”</p>
<p>“Your brush and palette will never yield you any permanent
happiness, nor promote a spirit of contentment, until
you select a different class of subjects. Your themes are all
too sombre, too dismal, and the sole <i>motif</i> that runs through
your music and painting seems to be <i>in memoriam</i>. Open
the windows of your gloomy soul, and let God’s sunshine
stream into its cold recesses, and warm and gild and gladden
it. Throw aside your morbid proclivities for the melancholy
and abnormal, and paint peaceful <i>genre</i> pictures,—a group of
sunburnt, laughing harvesters, or merry children, or tulip-beds
with butterflies swinging over them. You need more
warmth in your heart, and more light in your pictures.”</p>
<p>“Eminently correct,—most incontestably true; but how do
you propose to remedy the imperfect <i>chiaro-oscuro</i> of my
character? Show me the market where that light of peace
and joy is bartered, and I will constitute you my broker, with
unlimited orders. No, no. I see the fact as plainly as you
do, but I know better than you how irremediable it is. My
soul is a doleful <i>morgue</i>, and my pictures are dim photographs
of its corpse-tenants. Shut in forever from the sunshine,
I dip my brush in the shadows that surround me,
for, like Empedocles,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> ‘I alone</p>
<p class="cg">Am dead to life and joy; therefore I read<br>
In all things my own deadness.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“If you would free yourself from the coils of an intense
and selfish egoism that fetter you to the petty cares and trials
of your individual existence,—if you would endeavor to forget
for a season the woes of Mrs. Gerome, and expend a
little more sympathy on the sorrows of others,—if you would
resolve to lose sight of the caprices that render you so unpopular,
and make some human being happy by your aid
and kind words,—in fine, if, instead of selecting as your model
some cynical, half-insane woman like Lady Hester Stanhope,
you chose for imitation the example of noble Christian usefulness
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_350"></a>350</span>
and self-abnegation, analogous to that of Florence
Nightingale, or Mrs. Fry, you would soon find that your
conscience—”</p>
<p>“Enough! You weary me. Dr. Grey, I thoroughly understand
your motives, and honor their purity, but I beg that
you will give yourself no further anxiety on my account.
You cannot, from your religious standpoint, avoid regarding
me as worse than a heathen, and have constituted yourself
a missionary to reclaim and consecrate me. I am not quite
a cannibal, ready to devour you, by way of recompense for
your charitable efforts in my behalf, but I must assure you
your interest and sympathy are sadly wasted. Do you remember
that celebrated ‘vase of Soissons,’ which was plundered
by rude soldiery in Rheims, and which Clovis so eagerly
coveted at the distribution of the spoils? A soldier broke
it before the king’s hungry eyes, and forced him to take
the worthless mocking fragments. Even so flint-faced fate
shattered my happiness, and tauntingly offers me the ruins;
but I will none of it!”</p>
<p>“Trust God’s overruling mercy, and those fragments, fused
in the furnace of affliction, may be remoulded and restored
to you in pristine perfection.”</p>
<p>“Impossible! Moreover, I trust nothing but the brevity
of human life, which one day cannot fail to release me from
an existence that has proved an almost intolerable burden.
You know Vogt says, ‘The natural laws are rude, unbending
<ins title="Guessing at end quote">powers,’</ins> and I comfort myself by hoping that they can neither
be bribed nor browbeaten out of the discharge of their duty,
which points to death as ‘the surest calculation that can be
made,—as the unavoidable keystone of every individual
life.’ A grim consolation, you think? True; but all I shall
ever receive. Dr. Grey, in your estimation I am sinfully
inert and self-indulgent; and you conscientiously commend
my idle hands to the benevolent work of knitting socks for
indigent ditchers, and making jackets for pauper children.
Now, although it is considered neither orthodox nor modest
to furnish left-hand with a trumpet for sounding the praises
of almsgiving right-hand, still I must be allowed to assert
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_351"></a>351</span>
that I appropriate an ample share of my fortune for charitable
purposes. Perhaps you will tell me that I do not give
in a proper spirit of loving sympathy,—that I hurl my donations
at my conscience, as ‘a sop to Cerberus.’ I have
never injured any one, and if I have no tender love in my
heart to expend on others, it is the fault of that world which
taught me how hollow and deceitful it is. God knows I
have never intentionally wounded any living thing; and if
negatively good, at least my career has no stain of positive
evil upon it. I am one of those concerning whom Richter
said, ‘There are souls for whom life has no summer. These
should enjoy the advantages of the inhabitants of Spitzbergen,
where, through the winter’s day, the stars shine clear
as through the winter’s night.’ I have neither summer nor
polar stars, but I wait for that long night wherein I shall
sleep peacefully.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, defiant pride bars your heart from the
white-handed peace that even now seeks entrance. Some
great sorrow or sin has darkened your past, and, instead of
ejecting its memory, you hug it to your soul; you make it a
mental Juggernaut, crushing the hopes and aims that might
otherwise brighten the path along which you drag this murderous
idol. Cast it away forever, and let Peace and Hope
clasp hands over its empty throne.”</p>
<p>From that peculiar far-off expression of the human eye
that generally indicates abstraction of mind, he feared that
she had not heard his earnest appeal; but after some seconds,
she smiled drearily, and repeated with singular and touching
pathos, lines which proved that his words were not lost upon
her,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“‘Ah, could the memory cast her spots, as do<br>
The snake’s brood theirs in spring! and be once more<br>
Wholly renewed, to dwell in the time that’s new,—<br>
With no reiterance of those pangs of yore.<br>
Peace, peace! Ah, forgotten things<br>
Stumble back strangely! and the ghost of June<br>
Stands by December’s fire, cold, cold! and puts<br>
The last spark out.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_352"></a>352</span></div>
<p>The mournful sweetness and calmness of her low voice made
Dr. Grey’s heart throb fiercely, and he leaned a little farther
forward to study her countenance. She had rested her elbow
on the carved side of the sofa, and now her cheek nestled
for support in one hand, while the other toyed unconsciously
with the velvet edges of the <i>Liber Studiorum</i>. Her dress
was of some soft, shining fabric, neither satin nor silk, and
its pale blue lustre shed a chill, pure light over the wan,
delicate face, that was white as a bending lily.</p>
<p>The faint yet almost mesmeric fragrance of orange flowers
and violets floated in the folds of her garments, and seemed
lurking in the waves of gray hair that glistened in the bright
steady glow of the red grate; and moved by one of those
unaccountable impulses that sometimes decide a man’s destiny,
Dr. Grey took the exquisitely beautiful hand from the book
and enclosed it in both of his.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, you seem strangely unsuspicious of the
real nature of the interest with which you have inspired me;
and I owe it to you, as well as to myself, to avow the feelings
that prompt me to seek your society so frequently. For some
months after I met you, my professional visits afforded me
only rare and tantalizing glimpses of you, but from the day
of Elsie’s death, I have been conscious that my happiness is
indissolubly linked with yours,—that my heart, which never
before acknowledged allegiance to any woman, is—”</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, stop! I cannot listen to you.”</p>
<p>She had wrung her hand violently from his clinging fingers,
and, springing to her feet, stood waving him from her, while
an expression of horror came swiftly into her eyes and over
her whole countenance.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey rose also, and though a sudden pallor spread from
his lips to his temples, his calm voice did not falter.</p>
<p>“Is it because you can never return my love, that you so
vehemently refuse to hear its avowal? Is it because your
own heart—”</p>
<p>“It is because your love is an insult, and must not be
uttered!”</p>
<p>She shivered as if rudely buffeted by some freezing blast,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_353"></a>353</span>
and the steely glitter leaped up, like the flash of a poniard,
in her large, dilating eyes.</p>
<p>Shocked and perplexed, he looked for a moment at her
writhing features, and put out his hand.</p>
<p>“Can it be possible that you so utterly misapprehend me?
You surely can not doubt the earnestness of an affection
which impels me to offer my hand and heart to you,—the
first woman I have ever loved. Will you refuse—”</p>
<p>“Stand back! Do not touch me! Ah,—God help me!
Take your hand from mine. Are you blind? If you were an
archangel I could not listen to you, for—for—oh, Dr. Grey!”</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands, and staggered towards
a chair.</p>
<p>A horrible, sickening suspicion made his brain whirl and
his heart stand still. He followed her, and said, pleadingly,—</p>
<p>“Do not keep me in painful suspense. Why is my declaration
of devoted affection so revolting to you? Why can you
not at least permit me to express the love—”</p>
<p>“Because that love dishonors me! Dr. Grey, I—am—a—wife!”</p>
<p>The words fell slowly from her white lips, as if her heart’s
blood were dripping with them, and a deep, purplish spot
burned on each cheek, to attest her utter humiliation.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey gazed at her, with a bewildered, incredulous expression.</p>
<p>“You mean that your heart is buried in your husband’s
grave?”</p>
<p>“Oh, if that were true, you and I might be spared this
shame and agony.”</p>
<p>A low wail escaped her, and she hid her face in her arms.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome, is not your husband dead?”</p>
<p>“Dead to me,—but not yet in his grave. The man I
married is still alive.”</p>
<p>She heard a half-stifled groan, and buried her face deeper
in her arms to avoid the sight of the suffering she had
caused.</p>
<p>For some time the stillness of death reigned around them,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_354"></a>354</span>
and when at last the wretched woman raised her eyes, she
saw Dr. Grey standing beside her, with one hand on the back
of her chair, the other clasped over his eyes. Reverently
she turned and pressed her lips to his cold fingers, and he felt
her hot tears falling upon them, as she said, falteringly,—</p>
<p>“Forgive me the pain that I have innocently inflicted
on you. God is my witness, I did not imagine you cared for
me. I supposed you pitied me, and were only interested in
saving my miserable soul. The servants told me you were
very soon to be married to a young girl who lived with your
sister; and I never dreamed that your noble, generous heart
felt any interest in me, save that of genuine Christian compassion
for my loneliness and desolation. If I had suspected
your feelings, I would have gone away immediately, or told
you all. Oh, that I had never come here!—that I had never
left my safe retreat, near Funchal! Then I would not have
stabbed the heart of the only man whom I respect, revere,
and trust.”</p>
<p>Some moments elapsed ere he could fully command himself,
and when he spoke he had entirely regained composure.</p>
<p>“Do not reproach yourself. The fault has been mine,
rather than yours. Knowing that some mystery enveloped
your early life, I should not have allowed my affections to
centre so completely in one concerning whose antecedents
I knew absolutely nothing. I have been almost culpably
rash and blind,—but I could not look into your beautiful,
sad eyes, and doubt that you were worthy of the love that
sprang up unbidden in my heart. I knew that you were
irreligious, but I believed I could win you back to Christ;
and when I tell you that, after living thirty-eight years,
you are the only woman I ever met whom I wished to call my
wife, you can in some degree realize my confidence in the
innate purity of your character. God only knows how
severely I am punished by my rashness, how profoundly I deplore
the strange infatuation that so utterly blinded me.
At least, I am grateful that my brief madness has not involved
you in sin and additional suffering.”</p>
<p>The burning spots faded from her cheeks as she listened
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_355"></a>355</span>
to his low, solemn words, and when he ended, she clasped
her hands passionately, and exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Do not judge me, until you know all. I am not as unworthy
as you fear. Do not withdraw your confidence from
me.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, and answered, sadly,—</p>
<p>“A wife, yet bereft of your husband’s protection! A wife,
wandering among strangers, and a deserter from the home
you vowed to cheer! Your own admission cries out in judgment
against you.”</p>
<p>He walked to the table and picked up his gloves, and Mrs.
Gerome rose and advanced a few steps.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, you will come now and then to see me?”</p>
<p>“No; for the present I do not wish to see you.”</p>
<p>“Ah! how brittle are men’s promises! Did you not assure
Elsie that you would never forsake her wretched child?”</p>
<p>“Our painful relations invalidate that promise,—cancel
that pledge. I can not visit you as formerly; still, I shall
at all times be glad to serve you; and you have only to acquaint
me with your wishes to insure their execution.”</p>
<p>“Remember how solitary, how desolate, I am.”</p>
<p>“A wife should be neither, while her husband lives.”</p>
<p>The cold severity of his tone wounded her inexpressibly,
and she haughtily drew herself up.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey will at least allow me an opportunity of explaining
the circumstances that he seems to regard as so
heinous?”</p>
<p>He looked at the proud but quivering mouth,—into the
great, shadowy, gray eyes, and a heavy sigh escaped him.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is better that I should know your history, for it
will diminish my own unhappiness to feel assured that you
are worthy of the estimate I placed upon you one hour ago.
Shall I come to-morrow, or will you tell me now what you
desire me to know?”</p>
<p>“I can not sleep until I have exonerated myself in your
clear, truthful, holy eyes: I can not endure that you should
think harshly of me, even for a day. This room is suffocating!
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_356"></a>356</span>
I will meet you on the portico; and yonder, by the
sea, I will show you my life.”</p>
<p>She went to the escritoire, opened one of the drawers, and
took out a package. Wrapping a cloak around her, she
quitted the parlor, and found Dr. Grey leaning against one
of the columns.</p>
<p>He did not offer her his arm as formerly, but slowly and
silently they walked down towards the beach, where the surf
was rolling heavily in with a steady roar, and tossing sheets
of foam around the stone piers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Doctor Grey, had you possessed a tithe of the ingenuity
of Peiresc, you might long ago have interpreted the deep,
dark incisions in my character, which, like the indentations
on his celebrated amethyst, show where the <i>laminæ</i> of luckless
events inscribed my history with mournful ciphers.
Elsie’s hints would have furnished any woman with a clew;
but, since you have not availed yourself of their aid, I must
lift the shroud that hides the corpse of my youth, my happiness,
my faith in man, my hope in God. Ah! unto what
shall I liken it? This ruined, wretched thing I call my
life? To the <i>Tauk e Kerra</i>,—standing in a dreary waste,
lifting its vast, keyless arch helplessly to heaven? Even such
a crumbling arch, beautiful and grand in its glorious promise,
is the incomplete, crownless life of Agla Gerome,—a lonely
and melancholy monument of a gigantic failure. Two months
before my birth, my father, Henderson Flewellyn, died, and
when I was three hours old, my poor young mother followed
him, leaving me to the care of her nurse, Elsie Maclean, and
of an old uncle who was at that time residing in Copenhagen.
Having no relatives to dictate, Elsie named me Vashti, for
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_357"></a>357</span>
my mother; but my great-uncle wrote that my baptism must
be deferred until he could be present, and instructed her to
call me Evelyn, after himself. But the stubborn Scotch
will would not bend, and my name was written in the family
Bible, Vashti Flewellyn. Before the expiration of three
years, Mr. Mitchell Evelyn died, bequeathing his fortune to
me, as Evelyn Flewellyn, and consigning me to the guardianship
of Mr. Lucian Wright, a widowed minister of New York.
I was a feeble, sickly child, hovering continually upon the
confines of death, and, as city air was deemed injurious to me,
Elsie kept me at a farm-house on the Hudson, belonging to
the estate that I was destined to inherit. Here I remained
until my tenth year, when Mr. Wright removed me to the
vicinity of Albany, and placed me under the care of his
maiden sister, who had a small class of girls to educate.
Elsie accompanied and watched over me, and here I spent
four quiet, happy years; but the death of my teacher set
me once more afloat, and I was carried to New York, and
left at a large and fashionable boarding-school. I was fond
of study, and boundlessly ambitious, and soon formed a warm,
close friendship with a teacher who entered the institution
after I became one of its inmates. I had no one to love but
Elsie, who never left me, and consequently, I gave to Edith
Dexter, the young teacher, all the affection that I would have
lavished on parents, brothers, and sisters, had they been
granted to me. She was several years my senior, and the loveliest
woman I ever saw. Reared in affluence, her family had
become impoverished, and Edith was thrown upon her own resources
for a support. My father’s fortune was very large,
and the property left me by Mr. Evelyn swelled my estate to
very unusual proportions. Mr. Wright had carefully attended
to the investment of the income, and I was regarded
as the heiress of enormous wealth. Tenderly attached to
Edith, whose beauty, intelligence, and varied accomplishments
rendered her peculiarly attractive, I loaded her with presents,
and determined that as soon as my educational career ended,
I would establish myself in an elegant residence on Fifth
Avenue, take Edith to live under my roof, treat her always
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_358"></a>358</span>
as my sister, and share my ample fortune with her. Dr.
Grey, you can form no adequate conception of the depth of
the love I entertained for her. Day and night my busy
brain devised schemes for lightening her labors, for promoting
her happiness; and I spared no exertion to shield her from
the petty vexations and humiliating annoyances incident to
her situation. Waking, I prayed for her; sleeping in her
arms, I dreamed of the future we should spend together. At
the close of the session, she went into Vermont to visit her
invalid mother, and I to Mr. Wright’s quiet home, to remain
until the end of vacation. The minister was a kind-hearted
but weak old man, who treated me tenderly, and humored
every caprice that attacked my brain. I had never before
been his guest, and here, at his house, on the second day
of my sojourn, I met his favorite nephew, Maurice Carlyle.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome uttered the name through firmly set teeth,
and the blue cords on her forehead tangled terribly.</p>
<p>Clenching her fingers, she drew a long breath, and continued,—</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“At</ins> that time, he was by far the most fascinating, and
certainly the handsomest man I have ever met, and when I
recall the beauty of his face, the grace of his manner, the
noble symmetry of his figure, and the sparkling vivacity of
his conversation, I do not wonder that from the first hour
of our acquaintance he charmed me. I was but a child, a
proud, impulsive young thing, full of romance, full of wild
dreams of manly chivalry and feminine constancy and devotion;
and Maurice Carlyle seemed the perfect incarnation
of all my glowing ideals of knightly excellence and heroism.
He was thirty,—I not yet sixteen; he poor and fastidious,—I
generous and trusting, and possessed of one of the largest
estates on the continent. He had spent much of his life
abroad, and was as polished as any courtier who ever graced
St. Cloud or St. James; I an impetuous young simpleton,
who knew nothing of the world, save those tantalizing
glimpses snatched from behind the bars of a boarding-school.
Here, examine these portraits, while the light still lingers,
and you will see the woful disparity that existed between us
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_359"></a>359</span>
at that period. They were painted a fortnight after I met
him.”</p>
<p>She opened a velvet case, and laid before her companion two
oval ivory miniatures, richly set with large pearls.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey took them both in his hand, and, by the dull,
lurid glow that tipped a ridge of clouds lying along the western
horizon, he saw two pictures.</p>
<p>One, a remarkably handsome man, with brilliant black
eyes and regular features, and a cast of countenance that
forcibly reminded him of the likenesses of Edgar A. Poe, while
the expression denoted more of chicane than chivalry in his
character. The other, a fresh, sweet, girlish face, eloquent
with innocence and purity, with clear, gray eyes, overhung
by jetty lashes, and overarched by black brows, while a mass
of dark hair was heaped in short curls on her forehead and
temples, and fell in long ringlets over her neck.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey looked at Mrs. Gerome, and now at the portrait,
but the resemblance could nowhere be traced, save in the delicate
yet haughty arch of the eyebrows, and the dainty moulding
of the faultless nose.</p>
<p>While he glanced from one to the other, she placed a third
miniature beside those in his hand, and he started at sight
of a surpassingly lovely countenance, which recalled the outlines
of one that he had left in his library three hours before,
where Miss Dexter sat reading to Muriel.</p>
<p>“There you have the gods of my old worship,—Edith and
Maurice. Can you wonder at my infatuation?”</p>
<p>She took the pictures, and a derisive smile distorted her
lips, as she looked shiveringly at them, and hastily replaced
them on their velvet cushions. Closing the spring with a
convulsive snap, she tossed the case on the terrace, whence it
fell to the grass below; and drew her blue velvet drapery
closer around her.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, you know quite enough of human nature to anticipate
what followed. Three days after I met Maurice
Carlyle, he swore deathless devotion to his ‘gray-eyed angel,’
and offered me his hand. Ah! when I recall that evening,
and think of the words uttered so tenderly, so passionately,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_360"></a>360</span>
when I summon before me that radiant face, and listen again
to the voice that so utterly bewitched me, the remembrance
maddens me, and I feel a murderous hate of my race stirring
my blood into fierce throbs. With my hands folded in his,
we planned our future, painted visions that made my brain
reel, and when his lips touched my forehead, as sacred seal
of our betrothal, I felt that earth could add nothing to my
blessed lot. Of course Mr. Wright warmly sanctioned my
choice, drugging his conscience with the reflection that if
Maurice was extravagant and inert, my fortune would obviate
the necessity of his attending to his nominal profession, that
of the law. The old man insisted, however, that as I was
a mere child, we must defer our marriage two years. Mr.
Carlyle frowned, and vowed he could not live more than
twelve months without his ‘peerless prize,’ and like any other
silly girl, I believed it as unhesitatingly as I did the lessons
from the gospels that were read to us night and morning.
What cloudless days flew over my young head, during the ensuing
month; days wherein I never tired of kneeling and
thanking God for the marvellous blessing of Maurice Carlyle’s
love. Life was mantling in a crystal goblet, like <i>eau de vie de
Dantzic</i>, and I could not even taste it without watching
the gold sparkles rise and fall and flash; and how could I
dream, then, that the draught was not brightened with gilt
leaves, but really flavored with <i>curare</i>? The only drawback
to my happiness was Elsie’s opposition to my engagement,
and Mr. Carlyle’s refusal to allow me to acquaint Edith with
my betrothal. He was so ‘furiously jealous of that yellow-haired
woman whom his darling loved too well.’ It would
be quite time enough to inform her of my happiness when I
returned to school. From the beginning, Elsie distrusted,
disliked, and eyed him suspiciously, but her expostulations
and arguments only strengthened his influence, and partially
overthrew hers. One day Mr. Carlyle sought me in great
haste, and with considerable agitation informed me that he
had been unexpectedly summoned abroad. Business, with
the details of which he tenderly forbore to weary me, would
detain him many months in Europe, and he implored me to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_361"></a>361</span>
consent to a private marriage before his departure. Mr.
Wright was in very feeble health, had been threatened with
paralysis, and my ardent lover would be too unendurably
miserable separated from me, when death might at any moment
rob me of my guardian. I consented, and hastened to
obtain Mr. Wright’s sanction. That day chanced to be one
of his despondent, hypochondriacal seasons, and after some
persuasion on my part, and much sophistry from his nephew,
the weak old man yielded. Then my lover pressed his advantage,
and vowed he could never leave me, that his young
bride must accompany him to London, that my mind would
be too much engrossed by thoughts of him to permit the
possibility of my studying advantageously in his absence, and
that he would assume the responsibility of superintending
and perfecting his wife’s education. Mr. Wright demurred;
Mr. Carlyle raved; I wept. Maurice clasped me in his arms,
and in the midst of my tears and pleadings, my guardian
succumbed. It was arranged that our marriage should take
place within a fortnight, and that we should immediately
start to Europe. Poor Elsie!—truest, wisest, best friend God
ever gave me,—was enraged and distressed beyond expression.
She wept, wrung her hands, and falling on her knees entreated
me not to execute my insane purpose,—assured me I was a
lamb led to sacrifice, was the victim of an infamous scheme
between uncle and nephew to possess themselves of my estate,
and she exhausted argument and persuasion in attempting
to recall my wandering common sense. Much as I loved
her, this bitter vituperation of my idol incensed and estranged
me, and I temporarily forbade her to enter my presence.
Poor, dear, devoted Elsie! When my heart relented, and I
sought her to assure her of my forgiveness, tears and groans
greeted me, and I found her sitting at the foot of her bed,
with her face hidden in her apron.”</p>
<p>Stretching her arms towards the grave, Mrs. Gerome
paused; her lips quivered, and two tears rolled down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>“Ah! dear old heart! Brave, true, tender soul! How different
my lot would have been had I heeded her prayers
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_362"></a>362</span>
and counsel! Not until I lie down yonder, and mingle my
dust with hers, can I, even for an instant, forget her faithful,
sleepless care and love. I believe she is the only human
being who was ever tenderly and truly attached to me, and
God knows I learned before I lost her how much her affection
was worth.”</p>
<p>The cold, ringing voice grew tremulous, wavering, and some
moments passed before Mrs. Gerome continued,—</p>
<p>“Mr. Carlyle preferred a private wedding, but I insisted
upon a ceremony at the church where Mr. Wright officiated,
and immediately telegraphed to Edith, requesting her presence
as bridesmaid, and offering to provide her outfit and defray
all expenses, if she would accompany us to Europe. My betrothed
bit his lip, and objected; but on this point, at least,
I was firm, and assured him I would not be married unless
Edith could be with me. She wrote, declining my invitation
to Europe, but came to New York, the day of my wedding.
When I look back at what followed, I have a vague, confused
feeling, similar to that which results from taking opium.
Mr. Carlyle had positively interdicted my taking Elsie to
Europe, assuring me that his wife should not be in leading-strings
to a spoiled and presumptuous nurse, and promising
me that, when we returned to America, she might occupy
the position of housekeeper in our establishment. Absorbed
by my own supreme happiness, I scarcely saw Edith until
we were dressed for the ceremony, and when she came and
leaned against the table where the bridal presents were arranged,
I noticed that she was pale and much agitated, but
ascribed her emotion to grief at my approaching departure.
Several of my schoolmates officiated as bridesmaids, and a
large party assembled at the church to witness the marriage.
Mr. Carlyle was a great favorite in society, and his friends
were invited to the wedding breakfast at the parsonage. It
was on the bright morning of my sixteenth birthday, when
I stood before the altar and listened to and uttered the words
that made me a wife. Every syllable, every intonation, of
the minister’s voice is branded on my memory as with a red-hot
iron: ‘Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_363"></a>363</span>
to live together after God’s ordinance, in the holy estate of
matrimony? Wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honor, and
keep him, in sickness and in health; and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?’
And there, before the altar, with the stained glass making a
rainbow behind the pulpit, I answered, ‘<i>I will</i>.’ Oh, Dr.
Grey, pity me! pity me!”</p>
<p>A cry of anguish escaped her, and she extended her arms
until her hands rested on her companion’s shoulder.</p>
<p>In silence he bent his head, and put his lips to the tightly
clasped fingers.</p>
<p>“Tell me, sir,—if that vow means that man may make a
plaything of God’s statutes? If it binds for one hour, does
it not bind while life lasts?”</p>
<p>“‘<i>So long as ye both shall live</i>,’” answered Dr. Grey, solemnly;
and he gently removed her hand, and drew himself
a little farther from her.</p>
<p>She was too painfully engrossed by sad reminiscences to
notice the action, and resumed her narrative.</p>
<p>“There was a gay party at the breakfast, and I could not
remove my fascinated eyes from the radiant face of my husband,
who had never seemed half so princely as now, when he
was wholly my own. Once he bent his handsome head to
mine, and whispered, ‘<i>La Peregrina</i>,’ the pet name he had
given me, because he averred that, in his estimation, my love
was worth as many ducats as that celebrated pearl of Philip.
‘<i>La Peregrina</i>,’ indeed! Ah! he melted it in gall and hemlock,
and drained it at his wedding feast. My heart was so
overflowing with happiness that I slipped my fingers into
his, and, in answer to his fond epithet, whispered, ‘Maurice,
my king.’”</p>
<p>The speaker was silent for a moment, and an expression of
disgust and scorn usurped the place of mournfulness.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I deserved my punishment, for no Aztec ever
worshipped his stone God more devoutly than I did my black-eyed,
smooth-lipped idol. ‘Thou shalt have no other gods
before me.’ Ah! my ‘graven image’ seemed so marvellously
godlike that I bowed down before it; and there, in the midst
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_364"></a>364</span>
of my adoration, the curse of idolatry smote me. Half bewildered
by the rapture that made my heart throb almost to
suffocation, I stole away from the guests and hid myself in
the small hot-house attached to Mr. Wright’s study, longing
for a little quiet that would enable me to realize all the blessedness
of my lot. With childish glee I toyed with my title,—with
my new name,—Maurice Carlyle’s wife—Evelyn Carlyle!
How pretty it sounded,—how holy it seemed! My future
was as brilliant as that vast enchanted hall into which poor
Nouronihar was enticed through her insane love for Vathek,
and, like hers, my illusion was dispelled by a decree that
strangled hope in my heart, and enveloped it in flames.”</p>
<p>Here the flood of melancholy memories drowned her words,
and, crossing her arms on the stone balustrade, she sat silent
and moody.</p>
<p>In the dusky, crepuscular light, Dr. Grey could no longer
discern the emotions that printed themselves so legibly on her
countenance; but the outline of her face, and the listless,
hopeless droop of her figure, curved between him and the
dun waste of waters.</p>
<p>Overhead a few dim, hazy stars shivered on the ragged
skirts of trailing gray clouds, and the ceaseless rustle of the
shuddering poplars formed a mournful accompaniment to
the muttering of the ocean, whose weary waves were sobbing
themselves to rest, like scourged but unconquered children.</p>
<p>“I thank you for your patience, Dr. Grey. You forbear to
hurry me, even as you would shrink from rudely jostling or
pushing forward the mattock which slowly digs into a grave,—removing
human mould and crumbling coffin, searching for
the skeleton beneath. Exhuming human bones is melancholy
work, but sadder still is the mission of one who disinters the
ashes of a woman’s love, hope, and faith. Across the centre of
Mr. Wright’s hot-house ran a light trellis of fine lattice-work
cut into an arch and covered with the dense luxuriant foliage
of the bignonia trained over it. Behind this screen I had
ensconced my happy self, and sat idly bruising the leaves of
a rose geranium that chanced to be near me, when my blissful
reverie was interrupted by the sound of that voice which
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_365"></a>365</span>
had stolen my heart, my reason, my common sense. Believing
that he had missed and was searching for his bride, I
rose and peeped through the glossy leaves of the clambering
vine that divided us. Not four feet distant stood my husband
of an hour, with his arms clasped fondly around Edith,
who, in a broken, passionate voice, denounced his perfidy and
heartlessness. Vehemently he pleaded for an opportunity to
exculpate himself, and there, tearful and sobbing, with her
head on his bosom, my friend listened to an explanation that
was destined to enlighten more than one person. From his
lips I learned that he had become entangled in certain financial
difficulties that involved his honor as a gentleman; he had
used money to enable him to embark in a speculation which,
if successful, would have afforded him the means of marrying
in accordance with the dictates of his heart; but, like the
majority of nefarious schemes, it failed signally, and fear of
detection, and the absolute necessity of obtaining a large
amount of money, had goaded him to the desperate step of
sacrificing his happiness and offering his hand to me. He
strained her to his breast, kissed her repeatedly, and impiously
called God to witness that he loved her, and her only,
truly, tenderly; that never for an instant had his affection
wandered from her, ‘his beautiful, idolized darling.’ He
bitterly denounced his folly, cursed the hour that had thrown
me and my fortune in his path, and swore that he utterly
loathed and despised the silly child whose wealth alone had
made her his dupe; and, as he flatteringly expressed it, his
‘hated and intolerable incubus.’ He had intended to spare
her and himself the agony of this hour,—had determined to
remain always in Europe, where he could escape the mocking
contrast of his bride and his beloved. With indescribable
scorn, and a wonderful fertility of derisive epithets, he held
me up, as on the point of a scalpel, and proved the utter impossibility
of his having been influenced by any other than
the most grossly mercenary motives; while, between the bursts
of invective against me, he lavished upon her a hundred fond,
tender, passionate phrases of endearment that had never been
applied to me. Pressing one hand on her head, he raised the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_366"></a>366</span>
other, and called Heaven to witness, that, although the world
might regard him as the husband of ‘that sallow, gray-eyed,
silly girl,’ whose gold alone had bought his name, the only
woman he could ever love was his own beautiful Edith; and,
should death come to his aid and free him from the detested
bond that linked him to the heiress, he swore he would not
lose a day in claiming the lovely wife that fate had denied
him. All this, and much more, which I have not now the requisite
patience to recapitulate, fell on my ears, startling me
more painfully than the trumpet-blast of the Last Judgment
will ever do. Standing there, in my costly bridal robe, I
listened to the revelation that blotted out all sun and moon
and stars from my life,—that made earth a dismal Sheol and
the future a howling desolation,—a dreary wilderness of
woe. In my agony and shame I clenched my hands so
savagely, one upon the other, that my diamond betrothal-ring
cut sharply into the quivering flesh, and blood-drops oozed
and dripped on my shining gossamer veil and white velvet
dress. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, my whole
nature was metamorphosed; and my coming years swept in
panoramic vision before me, beckoning me to the prompt performance
of a stern and humiliating duty. The blood in my
veins seemed to hiss and bubble like a seething cauldron, and
my heart fired with a hate for which language has no name,
no garb, no provision; but my brain kept faithful guard, and
reason calmly pointed out my future path. When Mr. Carlyle
ended his tirade against me and his curses on his own folly,
I moved forward into the arch and confronted my dethroned
and defiled gods. If the tedious years of the primitive
patriarchs could be allotted to me they would never suffice
to efface the picture that lingers in deep, hot lines on my
memory, and pursues me as ruthlessly as the avenging cross
followed and tortured the miserable fugitive in Gustave
Doré’s ‘<i>Le Juif errant</i>,’ or the Eyeless Christ that proved a
haunting Nemesis to the Empress Irene. Edith’s lovely face
was on his bosom, and his false, handsome lips were pressed
to hers. So, I met my husband and my dearest friend, one
hour after the utterance of vows that were perhaps still echoing
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_367"></a>367</span>
in the courts of heaven. Such spectacles of human perfidy
are the real Medusas that Gorgonize trusting, tender,
throbbing hearts, and in view of this one I laughed aloud,—laughed
so unnaturally that it was no marvel I was called a
maniac. At sight of my desperate white face Edith shrieked
and fainted, and Maurice blanched and stammered and cowered.
Without a word of comment or recrimination I silently
passed on to my own room, where Elsie was waiting to clothe
me in my travelling-suit. In three hours the steamer would
sail, and I had little leisure for resolution and execution.
Summoning the lawyer to whose care my estate was entrusted,
I requested him to call Mr. Wright and Mr. Carlyle into the
dressing-room that adjoined my apartment, and there I held
an audience with the three who were most interested in my
career. Briefly I explained what had occurred, and announced
my determination, then and there, to separate forever
from the man who could never be more than my nominal
husband. I told them I held marriage, next to the Lord’s
Supper, the holiest sacrament instituted by God, but mine
had been an infamous mockery, an unpardonable sin against
me, and an <ins title="Was unsult">insult</ins> to Heaven, whose blessing could never rest
upon it. Marriage, without sanctifying love, was unhallowed,
was a transgression of divine law, and a crime against my
womanhood which neither God nor man should forgive.
Maurice Carlyle had perjured himself,—had never loved the
woman who went with him to the altar,—and the affection
that had stirred my heart one hour before, was now as dead
as the Pharaohs hidden for centuries under the pyramids.
We two, who had sworn to love, honor, and cherish one
another, now hated and despised each other beyond all possibility
of expression; and I considered it a heinous sin to
perpetuate the awful mockery, to cling to the letter of a contract
that bade defiance to every impulse of heart and soul,—to
every dictate of reason and decree of conscience. Wedded
lives and divided hearts I believed a crime, and while I
admitted that man could not put asunder those whom God’s
statutes joined together, I contended that Mr. Carlyle’s perjury
rendered it sinful for him and me to reside under the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_368"></a>368</span>
same roof. I could not recognize the validity of divorces, for
human hands could not unlink God’s fetters, and man’s law
had no power to free either of us from the bonds we had
voluntarily assumed in the invoked presence of Jehovah. I
would neither accept nor permit a divorce, for, in my estimation,
it was not worth the paper that framed it, and was a
species of sacrilegious trifling; but I would never live as
the wife of a man who had repeatedly declared he had not an
atom of affection for me. <i>Under some circumstances I
deemed separation a woman’s duty</i>, and while I fully comprehended
the awful import of the vow ‘<i>Till death us do
part</i>,’ and denied that human legislators could free us, or
annul the marriage, I was resolved, while life lasted, to
consider myself a duped, an unloved, but a lawful wife,—a
woman consecrated by solemn oaths that no human action
could cancel. Since money was the bait, I was willing to
divide my fortune as the price of a quiet separation; and
though from that hour I intended to quit his presence forever,
and regard the tie that linked us as merely nominal, I
would allow him a liberal income until I attained my majority
and would liquidate all his present debts. To your imagination,
Dr. Grey, I leave the details of what ensued,—my
guardian’s remorseful grief, my lawyer’s wonder and expostulation,
Mr. Carlyle’s confusion, chagrin, and rage. He
pleaded, argued, threatened; but he might as well have attempted
to catch and restrain in the hollow of his hand the
steady sweep of Niagara, as hope to change my purpose. My
terms were fixed, and I gave him permission to tell the world
what he chose concerning this strange <i>denouement</i> of the
wedding feast. If I could only go away at once, I cared not
what the public thought or said; and finally, finding me no
longer a yielding child, but a desperate, stern, relentless
woman, my terms were acceded to. Briefly we discussed the
legal provisions, and I signed some hastily prepared papers
that settled a bountiful annuity upon Mr. Carlyle. My trunks
were sent to the steamer, the carriage was brought to the
door, and in the presence of my guardian and the lawyer, I
announced my desire never to look again upon the man who
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_369"></a>369</span>
had so completely blighted my life. In silence I laid upon the
table my betrothal and wedding rings, and the sparkling diamond
cross that had constituted my bridal present. No word
of reproach passed my lips, for women love when they upbraid,
and only aching, fond hearts furnish stinging rebukes;
but I hated and scorned the author of my ruin too utterly to
indulge in crimination and reproach. So we two, who had
just been pronounced man and wife, who had clasped hands
and linked hearts and lives until we should stumble into the
tomb,—we, Maurice Carlyle and Evelyn, his bride, four hours
married, stood up and looked at each other for the last time.
During the interview I had addressed no remark to him, and
the last words I ever uttered to him were contained in that
sentence fondly whispered when he bent over me at the table,
‘Maurice, my king.’ As I bade adieu to my guardian, and
paused before the princely figure whom the world called my
husband, our eyes met, and he flushed, and muttered, ‘You
will rue your rashness.’ Silently I looked on the handsome
features that had so suddenly grown loathsome to me, and he
snatched my wedding ring from the table and held it appealingly
towards me, saying remorsefully, ‘Evelyn, my wife, forgive
your wretched husband!’ Without a word, or a touch
of his outstretched hands, I turned and went down to the
carriage, where my faithful nurse sat weeping and waiting.
One hour later, the vessel swung from her moorings, and Elsie
and I were soon at sea. A girl only sixteen, four hours married,
separated forever from husband and friends,—without
hope or faith in either human or heavenly things,—hating,
with most intolerable intensity, the man whose name she had
just assumed, and to whom she felt indissolubly bound, in
accordance with the vow ‘<i>So long as ye both shall live</i>.’”</p>
<p>Out of the tossing, moaning sea, the moon had risen slowly,
breaking through a rent scarf of cloud that barred her solemn,
white disc, and silvering the foam of the racing waves that
seemed to reflect the glittering fringe of the scudding vapor in
the chill vault above them. There was no mellow radiance, no
golden lustre such as southern moons are wont to shed, but
a weird, fitful glitter on sea and land, that now shone with
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_370"></a>370</span>
startling vividness, and anon waned, until sombre shadows
seemed stalking in spectral ranks from some distant, gloomy
ocean lair. It was one of those melancholy nights when
the supernatural realm threatened to impinge upon the
physical, that shuddered and shrank from the contact,—when
the atmosphere gave vague hints of ghostly denizens, and
every passing breeze seemed laden with sepulchral damps and
vibrating with sepulchral sounds.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome sat erect, with her hands resting on the balustrade,
and under that mysteriously white moon her pearl-pale
face looked as hopelessly cold and rigid as any Persepolitan
sphinx, that nightly fronts the immemorial stars
which watch the ruined tombs of Chilminar.</p>
<p>Raising her fingers to her forehead, she lifted and shook a
band of the shining white hair, and resumed her narration, in
the same steady, passionless tone.</p>
<p>“These gray locks were the fruit of that bridal day, for,
on the afternoon that we sailed, I was taken very ill with what
was called congestion of the brain,—was unconscious throughout
the voyage, and when we reached Liverpool, my hair, once
so black and glossy, was as you see it now. Ah! how often,
since that time, have I heard poor Elsie mourning over my
mother’s untimely death, and quoting that ancient superstition,
‘You should never wean a child while trees are in blossom;
otherwise it will have gray hair.’ Mr. Wright was so
prostrated by grief at what had occurred, that he survived
my departure only a few weeks; and at his death, Mr. Carlyle
attempted to seize and control my estate. Urging the plea of
my minority, he insisted upon assuming the charge of my
property, and in order to consummate his avaricious designs,
and screen his name from opprobrium, he told the world that
I was hopelessly insane; and that the discovery of this fact,
one hour after his marriage, had induced him to send me
abroad under the care of a faithful and judicious nurse. To
give plausibility to this statement, a paragraph was inserted
in the New York papers announcing that I was a raving
maniac and an inmate of an English asylum for lunatics.
Mr. Clayton, my lawyer, was the sole surviving witness of my
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_371"></a>371</span>
final interview, and of its financial provisions; and, had he
yielded to bribes and threats which were unsparingly offered,
God only knows what would have been my fate, since the
tender mercies of my husband destined me to the cheerful
and attractive precincts of a mad-house. To Mr. Clayton’s
stern integrity and brave defence, I am indebted for the
preservation of my fortune and the defeat of a daring and iniquitous
scheme to arrest me in London and commit me to
the custody of an asylum-warden. Fortunately for me, he
lived long enough to transfer to my own guardianship, when
I attained my majority, the estate which had cost me every
earthly hope. Six months after my departure from America
I bade farewell to Europe, and plunged into the most remote
and unfrequented portions of the East, where I wished to remain
unknown and unnoticed. In a half-defiant and half-superstitious
mood, I had assumed the talismanic and mystical
name of Alga Gerome, with the faint hope that it
might shield me from the intrigues and persecutions which I
felt assured would always dog the steps of Evelyn Carlyle.
Having appointed a cautious and confidential agent in New
York and Paris, I destroyed all traces of my whereabouts,
and became as utterly lost to the world as though the portals
of the grave had closed upon me. Without friends, and accompanied
only by Elsie and her son Robert, I lived year after
year in wandering through strange lands. Books and pictures
were my solace, and to strangle time I first devoted myself
to drawing and painting. After a while I came back to
Rome, and frequented the studios and galleries, perfecting
myself in the mechanical department of Art. But fear of
encountering some familiar face drove me from the Eternal
City, and a sudden whim took me to Madeira, where I spent
the only portion of my life to which I recur with any degree
of satisfaction. There, surrounded by magnificent scenery,
and safe from intrusion, I intended to drag out the remainder
of my dreary years; but poor Elsie grew so restless, so homesick,
so impatient to visit the graves of her household band,
that I finally allowed myself to be persuaded into returning
to my native land. Robert preceded us, and purchased this
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_372"></a>372</span>
secluded spot, which I had stipulated must be upon the sea-shore
and secure from all intrusion. Avoiding New York, I
came reluctantly to Boston, thence to ‘Solitude,’ without
seeing or hearing of any whom I had once known. When I
was twenty-one, I transferred to Mr. Carlyle the sum of thirty
thousand dollars, as a final settlement; but my agent scrupulously
obeyed my instructions, and no human being, save himself,
is aware of my place of residence or the name under
which I am sheltered. Strenuous efforts have been made by
Mr. Carlyle to unearth his wretched dupe, but since I left
England, nearly eight years ago, he has been unable to discover
any trace of my location. From time to time I received
bills, contracted by him, and paid by my lawyer after I left
New York; and in my escritoire are two accounts of jewellers,
where I find charged the flashing ring and costly diamond
cross, which I refused to retain but for which I paid, after
my separation. Prone to dissipation, Mr. Carlyle plunged into
excesses that would have squandered royal portions, and
my agent writes that his eagerness to ascertain where I am
residing has recently increased, in consequence of his pecuniary
necessities, although the terms of our separation deprive
him of every shadow of claim upon me or my purse.
Such, Dr. Grey, is the shattered idol of my girlish adoration,—such
the divinity of dust upon which I spent the treasures
of my love and trust. Gray-haired, gray-hearted, mocked, and
maddened in the dawn of my confiding womanhood, nominally
a wife, but in reality a nameless waif, shut out from
happiness, and pitied as a maniac,—such, is that most desolate
and isolated woman, whom, as Agla Gerome, you have
known as the mistress of this lonely place. As for my name,
I sometimes wonder whether in the last great gathering in the
court of Heaven, my own mother will know what to call her
unbaptized child,—whether the sins charged against me will
be read out as those of Vashti, or Evelyn, or Agla. Elsie
<ins title="Was persistenly">persistently</ins> clung to Vashti, and verily there seems a grim
fitness in her selection,—a dismal analogy between my blasted
life and that of the discrowned Persian Queen. Be that as it
may, if I miss a name I surely shall not miss the equity that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_373"></a>373</span>
man denies me. ‘<i>So long as ye both shall live</i>.’ When I
look out in springtime, over the blossoming earth, daisies,
and violets, and primroses range themselves into lines that
spell out these hated words of an ever-echoing vow, and if,
in midnight hours, I raise my weary eyes, the sleepless stars
revengefully group themselves, and flash back to me, in burning
characters, ‘<i>Till death us do part</i>.’ Up yonder, behind
sun, and planet, and nebulæ, I shall look God in the face, and
pointing to my withered heart and blighted life, can say truly,
‘At least I kept the ruins free from perjury; there, at your
feet, is the oath unsullied, that I called you to accept on the
awful day when I knelt at your altar.’ Love, honor, and
obedience, Maurice Carlyle’s unworthiness rendered impossible;
but the vow which consecrated and set me apart, which
forbade the thought that other men might offer homage and
affection, or even ordinary tributes of admiration, I have kept
sacredly and faithfully. I might have plunged into the whirlpool
of fashionable life, and found temporary oblivion of my
humiliation and disappointment; but from such a career my
whole being revolted, and in seclusion I have dragged out a
dreary series of years that can scarcely be termed life.
Recently I have been honored by several proposals for a
divorce, on condition of an additional settlement of money
upon my eminently chivalric and devoted husband; but my
invariable reply has been, <i>human legislation is impotent to
cancel the statutes of Almighty God, which declare that only
death can free what Jehovah has joined together</i>, and the legal
provisions of man crumble and shrivel before the divine command,
‘<i>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by
the law to her husband so long as he liveth</i>.’ With what impatience,
what ceaseless yearning, I await the cold touch of
that deliverer who alone can sever my galling, detested fetters,
none but the God above us can understand and realize. The
eagerness with which I once anticipated my bridal hour does
not approximate the intensity of my longing for the day of
my death. O merciful God! surely, surely, I have been sufficiently
tortured, and the tardy release can not be far distant.”</p>
<p>She raised her face skyward, as if invoking Divine aid, but
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_374"></a>374</span>
her wan lips were voiceless; and only the song of the surf mingled
with the whisper of trembling poplars, whose fading
leaves gleamed ghostly and chill under the silver sheen of
that broad white moon.</p>

<p class="cg">“There heavily, across the troubled night,<br>
A warning comet trails her hideous hair,<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>During the hour in which Dr. Grey listened to the recital
of this woman’s hapless career, she became as utterly dead to
him as though shroud and sepulchre had already claimed her;
and when she ceased speaking, he looked as sorrowfully down
at her fair, frozen face, as if the coffin-lid were shutting it
forever from his view.</p>
<p>Henceforth she was as sacred in his sad eyes as some beloved
corpse, and bowing his head upon his hands, he prayed long
but silently that God would strengthen him for the duties of
a desolate future,—would sanctify this grievous disappointment
to his eternal welfare, and grant him power to lead
heavenward the heart of the only woman whom he had ever
desired to call his own.</p>
<p>Putting away the beautiful dreams wherein this regal form
had moved to and fro as crown and queen of his home and
heart, he calmly resigned the cherished scheme that linked this
woman’s life with his; and felt that he would gladly barter
all his earthly hopes for the assurance, that, throughout
eternity, he might be allowed the companionship which time
denied him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome rose, and folding her mantle around her, said
proudly,—</p>
<p>“Married life, unhallowed by love, is more acceptable in
your righteous eyes than my isolated existence; and you have
passed sentence against me. So be it. Strange code of morality
you Christians hug to your hearts, squeezing the form
that holds no spirit; but some day I shall be acquitted by
that incorruptible tribunal where God alone has the right
to judge us. Till then, farewell.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_375"></a>375</span></div>
<p>She turned to leave the terrace, but he arrested the movement,
and placed himself before her.</p>
<p>“You misinterpret my silence, if you suppose it was employed
in censuring your course. Pondering all that you have
recapitulated, I can conjecture no line of conduct towards
your husband less deplorable than that which you have pursued;
and I honor the stern honesty and integrity of purpose
from which you have never swerved. Mrs. Carlyle, I acquit
you of all guilt, save that of impious defiance, of rebellion
against your God, whose grace could sweeten even the bitter
dregs of the cup you have well-nigh drained.”</p>
<p>At the sound of her name, so long unuttered, she winced
and writhed as if some sensitive nerve had been suddenly
pierced and torn; but without heeding her emotion, Dr. Grey
continued,—</p>
<p>“If your earthly lot has been stinted of sunshine, can you
not bear a little temporary gloom,—must you needs people
it with adverse witnesses, must you thicken the darkness
with imprecations? You forget that life is only the racecourse,
not the goal,—that this world is for human souls
what the plain of Dura proved for the Hebrew trio who braved
its flames. Suppose you are lonely and bereft of the love
that might have cheered you? Was not Christ far more
isolated and loveless? In His fearful ordeal He was forsaken
by God,—but to you remains the everlasting promise, ‘I will
not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.’ O wretched
woman! give your aching heart to Him who emptied it of
earthly idols in order to fit it up for His own temple.</p>

<p class="cg">‘Is God less God, that thou art left undone?<br>

<p>Silently she listened, looking steadily up at his noble face,
where intense mental anguish had left unwonted pallor, and
printed new ciphers on brow and lips; and when his adjuration
ended, she put out her hand.</p>
<p>“That you do not <ins title="Was condem">condemn</ins> me is the most precious consolation
you could offer, for your good opinion is worth much
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_376"></a>376</span>
to my proud, sensitive soul. If all men were like you there
would be no mutilated, ruined lives, such as mine,—no
nominal wives roaming up and down the world in search of
an obscure corner wherein to hide dishonored heads and
crushed hearts. God grant you some day a wife worthy of the
noblest man it has ever been my good fortune to meet. Good-by.”</p>
<p>He did not accept the offered hand, and stood for a moment
as if struggling to master some impulse to which he could not
yield. Perhaps he dared not trust the touch of those gleaming,
slender fingers that had clasped a living husband’s; or
perchance he was so absorbed by painful thoughts that he
failed to observe them.</p>
<p>Laying his palm softly on her snowy head, he said tenderly,—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Carlyle, you have innocently, and I believe unconsciously,
caused me the keenest suffering I have ever endured;
and I feel assured you will not withhold the only reparation
which you could render, or I accept. Will you promise to
consecrate the remainder of your life to the service of Christ?
Will you humble your defiant soul, and so spend your future,
that when this brief earthly pilgrimage ends you can pass joyfully
to the city of Rest? Girded with this hope, I can brave
all trials,—can be content to look upon your face no more in
this world,—can patiently wait for a reunion in that Eternal
Home where they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain
that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry
nor are given in marriage.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Dr. Grey, if it were possible!”</p>
<p>She clasped her hands and bowed her chin upon them, awed
by his tones, and unable to met his grave, pleading eyes.</p>
<p>“Faith and prayer are the talismans that render all things
possible to an earnest Christian; and it has been truly said
‘We mount to heaven mostly on the ruins of our cherished
schemes, finding our failures were successes.’ Recollect,—</p>

<p>and do not indulge a corroding bitterness that has almost destroyed
the nobler elements of your nature. I will exact no
promise, but when I am gone, do not forget the request that
my soul makes of yours. May God point out your work and
help you to perform it faithfully. May His hand guide and
uphold, and His merciful arms enfold you, now and forever,
is and shall be my prayer.”</p>
<p>For a moment his hand lingered as if in benediction upon
the drooping gray head, then he quietly turned and walked
away, knowing full well that he was bidding adieu to the most
precious of all earthly objects,—that he too was shattering
a lovely “graven image,” before which his heart had fondly
bowed.</p>
<p>As the sound of his firm step died away, the lonely woman
lifted her face and looked after the form, vanishing in the
gloom of the overarching trees. When he had disappeared,
and she turned seaward, where the moon, as if inviting her
to heaven, had laid a broad shining band of beaten silver
from wave to sky,—the miserable wife raised her hands appealingly,
and made a new <ins title="Was convenant">covenant</ins> with her pitying God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Merton, you are not conscious of the extent of your infatuation,
which has already excited comment in our limited
circle of acquaintances.”</p>
<p>“Indeed! The members of ‘our limited circle of acquaintances’
are heartily welcome to whatever edification or amusement
they may be able to derive from the discussion of my individual
affairs, or the analysis of my peculiar tastes. You
forget, my dear Constance, that to devour and in turn be
devoured is an inexorable law of this world; and if my eccentricities
furnish a <i>ragout</i> for omnivorous society, I should be
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_378"></a>378</span>
philanthropically glad that tittle-tattledom owes me thanks.”</p>
<p>The speaker did not lay aside the newspaper that partially
concealed his countenance; and when he ceased speaking, his
eyes reverted to the statistical table of Egyptian and Algerine
cotton, which for some moments he had been attentively examining.</p>
<p>“My dear brother, you are spasmodically and provokingly
philosophical! Pray do me the honor to discard that stupid
<i>Times</i>, which you pore over as if it were the last sensation
novel, and be so courteous as to look at me while you are
talking,” replied the invalid sister, beating a tattoo on the side
of her couch.</p>
<p>“I believe I have nothing to communicate just now,” was
the quiet and unsatisfactory answer, as he drew a pencil from
his pocket and made some numeral annotations on the margin
of the statistics.</p>
<p>“Surely, Merton, you are not angry with your poor Constance?”</p>
<p>Merton Minge lowered his paper, restored the pencil to his
vest pocket, and wheeling his chair forward, brought himself
closer to the couch.</p>
<p>“I wish you were as far removed from fever as I certainly
am from anger. Your eyes are too bright, my pretty one.”</p>
<p>He put his fingers on her pulse, and when he removed them,
compressed his lips to stifle a sigh.</p>
<p>“Why will you so persistently evade me?—why will you
always change the subject when I allude to that young lady?”</p>
<p>“Because, when a man attains the sober and discreet age of
forty years, he naturally and logically thinks he has earned,
and is entitled to, an exemption from the petty teasing to
which sophomores and sentimentalists are subjected. While I
gratefully appreciate the compliment implied in your forgetfulness,
permit to remind you of the disagreeable fact that
I am no longer a boy.”</p>
<p>“You lose sight of that same ugly and ill-mannered fact,
much more frequently than I am in danger of doing; and I
affectionately suggest that you stimulate your own torpid
memory. Ah, brother! why will you not be frank, and confide
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_379"></a>379</span>
in me? Women are not easily hoodwinked, except by
their lovers,—and you can not deceive me in this matter.”</p>
<p>“What pleasure do you suppose it would afford me to practice
deceit of any kind towards my only sister? To what
class of motives could you credit such conduct?”</p>
<p>“I think you shrink from acknowledging your real feelings,
because you very well know that I could never sanction
or consent to them.”</p>
<p>Mr. Minge arched his heavy brows, and the sternly drawn
lines of his large mouth relaxed, and threatened to run into
curves that belonged to the ludicrous, as he turned his twinkling
eyes upon his sister’s face.</p>
<p>“What extraordinary hallucinations attack even sage, sedate,
middle-aged men? Ten minutes ago I would have sworn
I was your guardian; whereas, it seems your apron-strings
are the reins that rule me. Don’t pout, my Czarina, if I
demand your credentials before I bow submissively to your
<i>ukase</i>.”</p>
<p>“Irony is not your forte; and, Merton, I beg you to recollect
that I detest bantering,—it is so excessively ungenteel.
No wonder you look nervous and ashamed, after your recent
very surprising manifestation of—well, I might as well say
what I mean—of <i>mauvais goût</i>.”</p>
<p>Constance Minge impatiently threw off the light worsted
shawl that rested on her shoulders, and propped her cheek on
her jewelled hand.</p>
<p>Her brother’s countenance clouded, and his lips hardened,
but after one keen look at her flushed features, he once more
resumed the perusal of the paper. Some moments elapsed,
and his sister sobbed, but he took no notice of the sound.</p>
<p>“Merton, I never expected you would treat me so cruelly.”</p>
<p>“Make out your charges in detail, and when you are sure
you have included all the petty deeds of tyranny as well as the
heinous acts of brutality, I will examine the indictment, and
hear myself arraigned. Shall I bring you some legal cap, and
loan you my pencil?”</p>
<p>For five minutes she held her handkerchief to her eyes, and
then Mr. Minge rose and looked at his watch.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_380"></a>380</span></div>
<p>“You will not be so unkind as to leave me again this afternoon,
and spend your time with that—”</p>
<p>“Constance, you transcend your privileges, and this is a
most <i>apropos</i> and convenient occasion to remind you that
presumption is one fault I find it particularly difficult to forgive.
Since my forbearance only invites aggression, let me
hear say (as an economy of trouble), that you are rashly invading
a realm where I permit none to enter, much less to
dictate. I hope you understand me.”</p>
<p>“I knew it,—I felt it! I dreaded that artful girl would
make mischief between us,—would alienate the only heart I
had left to care for me. Oh, how I wish she had been forty
fathoms under the sea before you ever saw her!—before you
ceased to love me!”</p>
<p>A flood of tears emphasized the sentence, which seemed lost
upon Mr. Minge, as he lighted a cigar, tried its flavor, threw
it away, and puffed the smoke from a second.</p>
<p>“I am sorry you can’t smoke and compose your nerves, as I
am preparing to do,—though I confess I prefer to kiss your
lips untainted by such odors. Shall I?”</p>
<p>He held his cigar aside to prevent the wind from wafting
the curling column of smoke in her face, and bent his head
close to hers; but she put up her hand to prevent the caress,
and averted her face.</p>
<p>“As you like. But mark you, Constance, the next time our
lips touch, you will find yourself in the nominative case, while
I meekly fill an objective position. You are a poor, wilful,
spoiled child, and I must begin to undo my own ruinous
work.”</p>
<p>He picked up his hat and walked off, followed by a pretty
Italian mouse-colored greyhound, whose silver bell tinkled as
she ran down the steps.</p>
<p>“Merton, come back! Do not leave me here alone, or I
shall die. Brother!—”</p>
<p>On strode the stalwart figure, looking neither to right nor
left, and behind him trailed the vaporous aroma of the fine
cigar. Raising herself on her couch, the invalid elevated her
voice, and exclaimed,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_381"></a>381</span></div>
<p>“Please, dear Merton, come back,—at least long enough to
let me kiss you. Please, brother!”</p>
<p>He paused,—wavered,—drew geometrical figures on the
ground with the tip of his boot, and finally took off his hat,
turned and bowed, saying,—</p>
<p>“Show some flag of truce, if you really want me to return.”</p>
<p>She raised her hands and gracefully tossed him several
kisses.</p>
<p>Slowly Mr. Minge retraced his steps, and, as he sat down
once more close to his sister and pushed back his hat, she saw
that he intended her to realize that her reign was at an end;
and she trembled and turned pale at the expression with which
he regarded her.</p>
<p>“Merton, don’t you know—don’t you believe—that I love
you above everything else?”</p>
<p>She sat erect, and stole one arm around the neck that did
not bend toward her, as was its habit.</p>
<p>“If you really loved me, you would desire to see me happy.”</p>
<p>“I do desire it, earnestly and sincerely; and there is no
sacrifice I would not make to see you really happy.”</p>
<p>“Provided I selected your mode of obtaining the boon, and
moreover consulted your caprices and antipathies; otherwise,
my happiness would annoy and insult you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t scold,—kiss me.” She put up her lips, but he did
not respond to the motion, and she pettishly drew his head
down and kissed him several times. “How obstinate you have
grown!—how harsh towards me! It is all the result of
that—”</p>
<p>She bit her lip, and her brother frowned.</p>
<p>“Take care! You seem continually disposed to stumble
very awkwardly into forbidden realms.”</p>
<p>The petted invalid nestled her pretty head on his bosom,
and patted his cheek with one hot hand.</p>
<p>“Brother, Kate Sutherland was here this morning, and left—besides
numerous kind messages for you—a three-cornered
note that I ordered Adèle to place in your dressing-case,
where I felt sure you would see it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I saw it.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_382"></a>382</span></div>
<p>“An invitation to ascend Monte Pellegrini?”</p>
<p>“Which I respectfully decline.”</p>
<p>“O Merton! Why not go?”</p>
<p>“Simply because I never premeditatedly, and with <i>malice
prepense</i>, bore myself by joining parties composed of persons
in whom I have not an atom of interest.”</p>
<p>“But Kate is so lovely?”</p>
<p>“Not to me.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! She was the handsomest young girl in Paris,
and was the acknowledged belle of the season.”</p>
<p>“Possibly. Henna-dyed nails are considered irresistible in
Turkey, but your opalescent ones attract me infinitely more
pleasantly.”</p>
<p>“Pray what have my nails to do with Kate’s beauty?”</p>
<p>“Nothing destructive, I hope,—as I am disposed to think
she has little to spare.”</p>
<p>“Good heavens! You surely would not insinuate that you
believe or consider,—or would admit, that she is not vastly
superior to—to—there, Beauty, down! She is actually
dining on the fringe of my pelerine!”</p>
<p>To cover her confusion, Constance addressed herself to the
diminutive dog at her feet, and taking her flushed face in his
hands, the brother looked steadily down, and answered,—</p>
<p>“I never insinuate. It impresses me as a cowardly and contemptible
bit of plebeian practice that found favor after the
royal purple was trailed in agrarian democratic dust; and
lest you should unjustly impute abhorred innuendoes to me,
I will say perspicuously, that the most attractive and beautiful
woman I have ever seen is not your fair friend Miss
Sutherland, nor any other darling of diamond and satin sheen,
but a young lady whom I admire beyond expression, Miss
Salome Owen.”</p>
<p>An angry flush burned on the invalid’s face, and her mouth
curled scornfully.</p>
<p>“She is rather handsome sometimes,—so are gypsies and
other waifs; but it is a wild sort of beauty,—if beauty you
persist in terming it; and low birth and blood are visible in
everything that appertains to her. I never expected to see
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_383"></a>383</span>
my brother condescend to the level of opera-singers, and I am
astonished at your infatuation. There! you need not expect
to blast me with that fiery look, and besides, you know you
mentioned her name, which I had scrupulously avoided. I
confess I am very proud of my family, and of you, its sole
male representative, and I wish it preserved from all taint.”</p>
<p>“Untainted it shall remain, while a drop of the blood throbs
in my veins, and I, who am jealous of my honor, have carefully
pondered the matter, and maturely decided that he who
entrusts his happiness to Salome Owen will be indeed an enviable
man, and pardonably proud of his prize. Once I bartered
myself away at the altar, and gave my name and hand
for wealth, for aristocratic antecedents, for fashionable status,
and five years of purgatorial misery was the richly merited
penalty for the insult I offered my heart. Death freed me,
and for ten years I have lived at least in peace, indulging no
thought of a second alliance, and merely amused, or disgusted
by the matrimonial snares that have lined my path. I no
longer belong to that pitiable class who feel constrained to
marry for position, and who convert the altar-steps into so
many rounds of the social ladder; and I have earned the right
to indulge my outraged heart in any caprice that promises to
mellow, to gild the evening of my life with that home-sunshine
that was denied its gloomy tempestuous morning. My
future, my fortune, my social standing, my unblemished name,
are all my own,—and I shall exercise my privilege of bestowing
them where and when I please, heedless of the sneers and
howls of disappointed mercenary schemers. Come weal, come
woe, I here announce that neither you nor the world need hope
to influence me one ‘jot or tittle’ in an affair where I allow
no impertinent interference. I warn you this is the last time
I shall permit even an indirect allusion to matters with which
you have no legitimate concern; and provided you do not obtrude
them upon me, it is a question of indifference to me
what your opinion and that of your ‘circle’ may chance to
be. Constance, you here have your ultimatum. Defy me, if
you please, but prompt separation will ensue; and you will unexpectedly
find yourself <i>en route</i> for America. Peace or
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_384"></a>384</span>
war? Before you decide, recollect that all your future will
be irretrievably colored by it.”</p>
<p>“In my state of health it is positively cruel for you to
threaten me; and some day when you follow my coffin to
Mount Auburn, you will repent your harshness. I wish to
heaven I had never left home!”</p>
<p>A passionate fit of weeping curtailed the sentence, and,
while the face was covered with the lace handkerchief, the
brother rose and made his escape.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that forty years had left their whitening
touches on his head and luxuriant beard, Merton Minge,
who had never been handsome, even in youth, was sufficiently
agreeable in appearance to render him an object of deep interest
in the circle where he moved. Medium-statured, and
very robust, a healthful ruddy tinge robbed his complexion
of that sallow hue which mercantile pursuits are apt to induce,
and brightened the deep-set black eyes which his debtors
considered mercilessly keen, cold, and incisive.</p>
<p>The square face, with its broad, full forehead, and deep
curved furrow dividing the thick straight brows,—its well-shaped
but prominent nose, and massive jaws and chin partially
veiled by a grizzled beard that swept over his deep
chest,—was suggestive of ledgers rent-roll, and stock-boards,
rather than æsthetics, chivalry, or sentimentality. The only
son of a proud but impoverished family, who were eager to retrieve
their fortune, he had early in life married the imperious
spoiled daughter of a Boston millionaire, whose dower consisted
of five hundred thousand dollars, and a temper that
eclipsed the unamiable exploits of ancient and modern shrews.</p>
<p>Hopeless of domestic happiness in a union to which affection
had not prompted him, Mr. Minge devoted himself to
the rapid accumulation of wealth, and by judicious and successful
speculations had doubled his fortune, ere, at the comparatively
early age of thirty, he was left a childless widower.
Whether he really thanked fate for his timely release, his
most intimate friends were never able to ascertain, for he
wore mourning, badges for three years, and conducted himself
in all respects with exemplary dignity and scrupulous propriety.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_385"></a>385</span>
But the frigid indifference with which he received all
matrimonial overtures indicated that his conjugal experience
was not so rosy as to tempt him to repeat the experiment.</p>
<p>His mother was a haughty, frivolous woman, jealously tenacious
of her position as one of the oligarchs of <i>le beau monde</i>,
and his fragile sister had from childhood been the victim of
rheumatism that frequently rendered her entirely helpless.
To these two and their fashionable friends, he abandoned his
elegant home, costly equipages, and opera-box, reserving only
a suite of rooms, his handsome riding-horse, and yacht.</p>
<p>Grave and unostentatious, yet not moody,—neither impulsively
liberal and generous nor habitually penurious and uncharitable,—he
led a quiet and monotonously easy life, varied
by occasional trips to foreign lands, and comforted by the assurance
that his income-tax was one of the heaviest in the
state. Two years after the death of his mother, he took his
sister a second time to Europe, hoping that the climate of
the Levant might relieve her suffering; and upon the steamer
in which he crossed the Atlantic he met Salome Owen.</p>
<p>Extravagantly fond of music, though unable to extract it
from any instrument, his attention had first been attracted
by her exquisite voice, which invested the voyage with a novel
charm and rendered her a great favorite with the passengers.</p>
<p>Human nature is wofully inflexible and obstinate, and not
all the Menus, Zoroasters, Solomons, and Platos have taught
it wisdom; wherefore it is not surprising that a caustic wit
and savage cynic asserts, “The vices, it may be said, await us
in the journey of life like hosts with whom we must successively
lodge; and I doubt whether experience would make
us avoid them if we were to travel the same road a second
time.”</p>
<p>Habit may be second nature, but it is the Gurth, the thrall
of the first,—the vassal of inherent impulses; and even the
most ossified natures contain some soft palpitating spot that
will throb against the hand that is sufficiently dexterous to
find it. In every man and woman there lurks a vein of sentiment,
which, no matter how heavily crushed by the super-incumbent
mass of utilitarian, practical commonplaceisms,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_386"></a>386</span>
will one day trickle through the dusty <i>débris</i>, and creep like a
silver thread over the dun waste of selfishness; or, Arethusa-like,
burst forth suddenly after long subterranean wandering.</p>
<p>For forty years it had crawled silently and sluggishly under
the indurated and coldly egoistic nature of Merton Minge,—had
been dammed up at times by avarice and at others by grim
recollections of his domestic infelicity; but finally, after
tedious meandering in the Desert of Heartlessness, it struggled
triumphantly to the surface one glorious autumn night,
when a golden moon illumined the Atlantic waves and kindled
a bewitching beauty in the face of Salome, who sat on
deck, singing an impassioned strain from <i>La Favorite</i>.</p>
<p>Her silvery voice was the miraculous rod that smote his petrified
affections, and a wellspring of tenderness gushed forth,
freshening, softening, and clothing with verdure and bloom
his arid, sterile, stony temperament. Long-buried dreams of
his boyhood stirred in their chilly graves and flitted dimly
before him, and a hope that had slumbered so soundly he had
utterly ignored its memory, started up, eager and starry-eyed,
as in the college days of eld,—the precious hope, underlying
all other emotions in a man’s heart, that one day he too
would be loved and prayed for by a pure womanly heart, and
pure, sweet, womanly lips.</p>
<p>Fifteen years before, he had vowed “to cherish,” not the
haughty girl whose hand he clasped, but the five hundred
thousand dollars that gilded it; and faithfully he had kept
his oath to the god of his idolatry, sacrificing the best half of
his life to insatiate <i>Kuvera</i>.</p>
<p>On that cloudless October night, as he watched the shimmer
of the moon on Salome’s silky hair, and noted the purely
oval outline of her daintily carved face, and the childish grace
of her fine form,—as he listened to flute-like tones, as irresistible
as Parthenope’s, his cold, formal, non-committal mouth
stirred, his hand involuntarily opened and closed firmly, as if
grasping some “pearl of great price,” and his slow, almost
stagnant pulses, leaped into feverish activity, and soon ran
riot. Perhaps more regular features, and deeper, richer carnation
bloom had confronted him, but love makes sad havoc of
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_387"></a>387</span>
ideals and abstract standards, and he who defined beauty,
“the woman I love,” was wiser than Burke and more analytical
than Cousin.</p>
<p>The freshness, the <i>brusquerie</i>, the outspoken honesty, that
characterized Salome, strangely fascinated this grave, selfish,
<i>blasé</i> aristocrat, who was weary of hollow, polished conventionalities
and stereotyped society phrases; and, as he sat on
deck watching her countenance, he would have counted out his
fortune at her feet for the privilege of claiming her fair,
slender hand, and her tremulous, scarlet lips, instinct with
melody that entranced him.</p>
<p>Henceforth life had a different goal, a nobler aim, a
tenderer and more precious hope; and all the energy of his
vigorous character was bent to the fulfilment of the beautiful
dream that one day that young girl would bear his name,
grace his princely home, and nestle in his heart.</p>
<p>He did not ask, Can that fair, graceful, gifted young thing
ever love a gray-haired man, old enough to call her his daughter?
Nay, nay! Common sense was utterly dethroned and
expelled,—romance usurped the realm, and draped the future
with rainbows; and he only set his teeth firmly against each
other, and said to his bounding heart and blinded soul, “Patience,
ye shall soon possess her!”</p>
<p>To Paris, Lyons, Naples, he had followed her, and finally
secured a villa at Palermo, where Prof. V—— had established
himself and his household in a comfortable suite of rooms.</p>
<p>To-day, as he left his sister and approached the house where
the professor dwelt, his countenance was moody and forbidding,
but its expression changed rapidly, as he caught a
glimpse of the white muslin dress that fluttered in the evening
wind.</p>
<p>Salome was swiftly pacing the wide terrace that commanded
a view of the Mediterranean, and her hands were clasped behind
her, as was her habit when immersed in thought.</p>
<p>Over her head she had thrown a white gauze scarf of
fringed silk, which, slipping back, displayed the elaborate
braids of hair wound around the head, where a crescent of
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_388"></a>388</span>
snowy hyacinths partially encircled the glossy coil, and
drooped upon her neck.</p>
<p>Her face wore a haggard, anxious, restless expression, and
the thin lips had lost their bright coral tint,—the smooth,
clear cheeks something of their rounded perfection.</p>
<p>As Mr. Minge came forward, she paused in her walk and
leaned against the marble railing of the terrace, where a
lemon tree, white with bloom, overhung the mosaiced floor and
powdered it with velvety petals.</p>
<p>He held out his hand.</p>
<p>“I hope I find you better?”</p>
<p>“Do I look so, think you?” said she, eyeing him impatiently,
and keeping her hands folded behind her.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, no; and if I possessed the right I have
more than once solicited, other physicians should be consulted.
Why will you tamper with so serious a matter, and unnecessarily
augment the anxiety of those who love you?”</p>
<p>“I beg you to believe that my self-love is infinitely stronger
than any other with which I am honored, and prompts me to
all possible prudential precautions. Three doctors have already
annoyed me with worthless prescriptions, and this
morning I paid their bills and dismissed them; whereupon,
one of them revenged himself by maliciously informing me
that I should not be able to sing a note for one year at <ins title="Added quote">least.”</ins></p>
<p>“To what do they attribute the disease?”</p>
<p>“To that attack of scarlet fever, and also to the too frequent
and severe cauterization of my throat. Time was when
like other fond fools, I fancied Fate was not the hideous hag
that wiser heads had painted her, but an affable old dame,
easily cajoled and propitiated. With Carthaginian gratitude
she repays my complimentary opinion by trampling my hopes
and aims as I crush these petals, which yield perfume to their
spoiler, while I could—”</p>
<p>She put her foot upon the drifting lemon blossoms, and
bit her lip to keep back the bitter words that trembled on
her tongue.</p>
<p>“Come and sit here on the steps, and confide your plans to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_389"></a>389</span>
one whose every scheme shall be subordinated to your wishes,
your happiness.”</p>
<p>Mr. Minge attempted to take her hand, but she drew back
and repulsed him.</p>
<p>“Excuse me. I prefer to remain where I am; and when I
am so fortunate and sagacious as to mature any plans, I shall
be sure to lock them in my own heart beyond the tender
mercies of meddling, marplot fortune.”</p>
<p>Her whole face grew dark, sinister, almost dangerous in its
sudden transformation, and, leaning against the railing, she
impatiently swept off the snowy lemon leaves. Mr. Minge
took the end of her scarf, and as he toyed with the fringe,
sighed heavily.</p>
<p>“Of course you are forced to abandon your contemplated
<i>début</i> in Paris?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A <i>début</i> minus a voice, does not tempt me. Ah!
how bright the future looked when I sang for the agent of
the Opera-House, and found myself engaged for the season.
How changed, how cheerless all things seem now.”</p>
<p>“Salome, fate is Janus-faced, and while frowning on you
smiles benignantly on me. I joyfully hail every obstacle that
bars your path, hoping that, weary of useless resistance, you
will consent to walk in the flowery one I have offered you.
My beautiful darling, why will you refuse the—”</p>
<p>“Silence! I am in no mood to listen to a repetition of sentiments
which, however flattering to my vanity, have no power
to touch my heart. Mr. Minge, I have twice declined the offer
you have done me the honor to make; and while proud of
your preference, my Saxon is not so ambiguous or redundant
as to leave any margin for misconception of my meaning.”</p>
<p>“My dear Salome, I fear your decision has been influenced
by the consciousness that my poor, petted Constance has occasionally
neglected the courtesies which you had a right to
claim from the sister of the man who seeks to make you his
wife.”</p>
<p>“No, sir; your sister’s sneers, and the petty slights and persecutions
for which I am indebted to her friend, Miss Sutherland,
have not sufficient importance to affect me in any degree.
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_390"></a>390</span>
My decision is based upon the unfortunate fact that I do not
love you.”</p>
<p>“No woman can withstand such devotion as I bring you,
and time would soon soften and deepen your feelings.”</p>
<p>“Sir, you unduly flatter yourself. Neither time nor
eternity would change me, and you would do well to remember
that it is my voice, sir,—not my hand and heart,—that I offer
for sale.”</p>
<p>“Your stubborn rejection is explicable only by the supposition
that you have deceived me,—that you have already
bartered away the heart I long to call my own.”</p>
<p>“I am a miller’s child,—you a millionaire, but permit
me to remind you that I allow no imputation on my veracity.
Why should I condescend to deceive you?”</p>
<p>She petulantly snatched her scarf from the fingers that still
stroked it caressingly; but an instant later a singular change
swept over her countenance, and pressing her hands to her
heart, she said in a proud, almost exultant tone,—</p>
<p>“Although I deny your right to question me upon this subject,
you are thoroughly welcome to know that I love one man
so entirely, so deathlessly, that the bare thought of marrying
any one else sickens my soul.”</p>
<p>Mr. Minge turned pale, and grasped the carved balustrade
against which he rested.</p>
<p>“O Salome! you have trifled.”</p>
<p>“No, sir. Take that back. I never stoop to trifling; and
the curse of my life has been my almost fatal earnestness of
purpose. If I ever deliberated one moment concerning the
expediency of clothing myself first with your aristocratic
name, afterwards with satin, velvet, and diamonds,—if I ever
silenced the outcry of my heart long enough to ask myself
whether <i>gilded misery</i> was not the least torturing type of the
epidemic wretchedness,—at least I kept my parley with Mammon
to myself; and if you obstinately cherished hopes of final
success, they sprang from your vanity, not my dissimulation.
Mark you, I here set up no claim to sanctity,—for indeed my
sins are ‘thick as leaves in Vallombrosa’; but my pedigree
does not happen to link me with Sapphira, and deceit is not
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_391"></a>391</span>
charged to me in the real Doomsday Book. Theft would be
more possible for me than falsehood, for while both are labelled
‘wicked,’ I could never dwarf and shrivel my soul by the
cowardly process of mendacity. Mr. Minge, had I been a trifle
less honest and true than I find myself, I might have impaired
my self-respect by trifling.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, Salome, if the pain I endure rendered me
harsh or unjust. My dearest, I did not intend to wound you,
but indeed you are cruel sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Yes; truth is the most savagely cruel of all rude, jagged
weapons, and leaves ugly gashes and quivering nerves exposed,
and these are the hurts that never cicatrize—that gape and
bleed while the heart throbs to feed them.”</p>
<p>“Tell me candidly whether the heart I covet belongs to
that Mr. Granville, who paid you such devoted attention in
Paris.”</p>
<p>A short, scornful, mirthless laugh rang sharply on the air,
and turning quickly, Salome exclaimed contemptuously,—</p>
<p>“I said I loved a man,—a true, honest, brave, noble man,—not
that perfumed, unprincipled, vain, foppish automaton,
who adorns a corner of the diplomatic apartment where <i>attachés</i>
of the American embassy ‘most do congregate’!
Gerard Granville is unworthy of any woman’s affection, for
maugre the indisputable fact that he is betrothed to a fond,
trusting girl, now in the United States, he had the effrontery
to attempt to offer his addresses to me. If an honest man be
the noblest work of God, then, beyond all peradventure, the
disgrace of creation is centred in an unscrupulous one, such
as I have the honor to pronounce Mr. Granville.”</p>
<p>Seizing her hands, Mr. Minge carried them forcibly to his
lips, and said, in a voice that faltered from intensity of feeling,—</p>
<p>“Is it the hope that your love is reciprocated which bars
your heart so sternly against my pleadings? Spare me no
pangs,—tell me all.”</p>
<p>She freed her fingers from his grasp, and retreating a few
steps, answered with a passionate mournfulness which he
never forgot,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_392"></a>392</span></div>
<p>“If I were dowered with that precious hope, not all the
crown jewels in Christendom and Heathendom could purchase
it. Not the proudest throne on that continent of empires
that lies yonder to the north, could woo me one hour
from the only kingdom where I could happily reign,—the
heart of the man I love. No—no—no! That hope is as distant
as the first star up there above us, which has rent the blue
veil of heaven to gaze pityingly at me; and I would as
soon expect to catch that silver sparkle and fold it in my
arms as dream that my affection could ever be returned. The
only man I shall ever love could not bend his noble, regal
nature to the level of mine, and towers beyond me, a pinnacle
of unapproachable purity and perfection. Ah, indeed,
he is one of those concerning whom it has been grandly said:
‘<i>The truly great stand upright as columns of the temple
whose dome covers all,—against whose pillared sides multitudes
lean, at whose base they kneel in times of trouble.</i>’ Mr.
Minge, it is despair that crouches at my heart, not hope that
shuts its portals against your earnest petition; for a barrier
wider, deeper than a hundred oceans divides me from my idol,
who loves, and ere this, is the husband of another.”</p>
<p>She did not observe the glow that once more mantled his
cheek, and fired his eyes, until he exclaimed with unusual
fervor,—</p>
<p>“Thank God! That fact is freighted with priceless comfort.”</p>
<p>Compassion and contempt seemed struggling for mastery,
as she waved him from her, and answered, impatiently,—</p>
<p>“Think you that any other need hope to usurp my
monarch’s place,—that one inferior dare expect to wield his
sceptre over my heart? Pardon me,—</p>

<p>Some day a gentler spirit than mine will fill your home with
music, and your heart with peace and sunshine; and, in that
hour, thank honest Salome Owen for the blessings you owe to
her candor. I must bid you good-night.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_393"></a>393</span></div>
<p>She drew the scarf closer about her head and throat, and
turned to leave the terrace.</p>
<p>“Will you not allow me to drive you to-morrow afternoon
on the Marino? Do not refuse me this innocent and inexpressibly
valued privilege. I will not be denied! Good-night,
my—Heaven shield you, my worshipped one! Hush!—I
will hear no refusal.”</p>
<p>He stooped, kissed the folds of the scarf that covered her
head, and hurried down the steps of the terrace.</p>
<p>The glory of a Sicilian sunset bathed the face and figure
that stood a moment under the lemon-boughs, watching the
retreating form which soon disappeared behind clustering
pomegranate, olive, and palm; and a tender compassion
looked out of the large hazel eyes, and sat on the sad lips that
murmured,—</p>
<p>“God help you, Merton Minge, to strangle the viper that
coils in your heart, and gnaws its core. My own is a serpent’s
lair, and I pity the pangs that rend yours also. But
after a little while, your viper will find a file,—mine, alas!
not until death arrests the slow torture. To-morrow afternoon
I shall be—where? Only God knows.”</p>
<p>She shivered slightly, and raised her beautiful eyes towards
the west, where golden gleams and violet shadows were
battling for possession of a reef of cloud islets, which dotted
the azure upper sea of air, and were reflected in the watery
one beneath.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Muriel, where can I find Miss Dexter?”</p>
<p>“She went out on the lawn an hour ago, to regale herself
with what she calls, ‘atmospheric hippocrene,’ and I have
not heard her come in, though she may have gone to her
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_394"></a>394</span>
room. Pray tell me, doctor, why you wish to see my governess?—to
inquire concerning my numerous peccadilloes?”</p>
<p><ins title="Removed quote">Muriel</ins> adroitly folded her embroidered silk apron over a
package of letters that lay in her lap, and affected an air of
gayety at variance with her dim eyes and wet lashes.</p>
<p>“I shall believe that conscience accuses you of many juvenile
improprieties, since you so suspiciously attack my motives
and intentions. Indeed, little one, you flatter yourself unduly,
in imagining that my interview with Miss Dexter necessarily
involves the <ins title="Was discusson">discussion</ins> of her pupil. I merely wish
to enlist her sympathy in behalf of one of my patients.
Muriel, I would have been much more gratified if I had found
you walking with her, instead of moping here alone.”</p>
<p>“I am not moping.”</p>
<p>The girl bit her full red lip, and strove to force back the
rapidly gathering tears.</p>
<p>“At least you are not cheerful, and it pains me to see that
anxious, dissatisfied expression on a face that should reflect
only sunshine. What disturbs you?—the scarcity of Gerard’s
letters?”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey sat down beside his ward, and throwing her arms
around his neck, she burst into a passionate flood of tears.
The sudden movement uncovered the letters, which slipped
down and strewed the carpet.</p>
<p>“Oh, doctor! I am very miserable!”</p>
<p>“Why, my dear child?”</p>
<p>“Because Gerard does not love me as formerly.”</p>
<p>“What reason have you for doubting his affection?”</p>
<p>“He scarcely writes to me once a month, and then his letters
are short and cold as icicles, and full of court gossip and
fashion items, for which he knows I do not care a straw.
Yesterday I received one,—the first I have had for three
weeks,—and he requests me to defer our marriage at least six
months longer, as he cannot possibly come over in May, the
time appointed when he was here.”</p>
<p>She hid her face on her guardian’s shoulder, and sobbed.</p>
<p>An expression of painful surprise and stern displeasure
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_395"></a>395</span>
clouded Dr. Grey’s countenance, as he smoothed the hair
away from the girl’s throbbing temples.</p>
<p>“Calm yourself, Muriel. If Gerard has forfeited your confidence,
he is unworthy of your tears. Do you apprehend that
his indifference is merely the result of separation, or have you
any cause to attribute it to interest in some other person?”</p>
<p>“That is a question I cannot answer.”</p>
<p>“Cannot, or will not?”</p>
<p>“I know nothing positively; but I fear something, which
perhaps I ought not to mention.”</p>
<p>“Throw aside all hesitancy, and talk freely to me. If
Granville is either fickle or dishonorable, you should rejoice
that the discovery has been made in time to save you from
life-long wretchedness.”</p>
<p>“If we were only married, I am sure I could win him back
to me.”</p>
<p>“That is a fatal fallacy, that has wrecked the happiness of
many women. If a lover grows indifferent, as a husband he
will be cold, unkind, unendurable. If as a devoted fiancée
you can not retain and strengthen his affection,—as a wife
you would weary and repel him. Have you answered the last
letter?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“My dear child, do you not consider me your best friend?”</p>
<p>“Certainly I do.”</p>
<p>“Then yield to my guidance, and follow my advice. Lose
no time in writing to Mr. Granville, and cancel your engagement.
Tell him he is free.”</p>
<p>“Oh, then I should lose him,—and happiness, forever!”
wailed Muriel, clasping her hands almost despairingly.</p>
<p>“You have already lost his heart, and should be unwilling
to retain him in fetters that must be galling.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Dr. Grey! it is very easy for you who never loved any
one, to tell me, in that cold, business-like way, that I ought to
set Gerard free; but you cannot realize what it costs to follow
your counsel. Of course I know that in everything else you
are much wiser than I, but persons who have no love affairs of
their own are not the best judges of other people’s. He is so
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_396"></a>396</span>
dear to me, I believe it would kill me to give him up, and
see him no more.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, you would survive much greater misfortune
than separation from a man who is unworthy of you. I
cannot coerce, but simply counsel you in this matter, and
should be glad to learn what your own decision is. Do you
intend to wait until Gerard Granville explicitly requests you
to release him from his engagement?”</p>
<p>She winced, and the tears gushed anew.</p>
<p>“Oh, you are cruel! You are heartless!”</p>
<p>“No, my dear Muriel; I am actuated by the truest affection
for my little ward, and desire to snatch her from future
humiliation. My knowledge of human nature is more extended,
more profound than yours, but since you seem unwilling
to avail yourself of my experience, it only remains for
you to acquaint me with your determination. Are you willing
to tell me the nature of your answer?”</p>
<p>“I intend to accede to Gerard’s wish, and will defer the
marriage until November; but in the meantime, I shall endeavor
to win back his heart, which I believe has been artfully
enticed from me.”</p>
<p>“By whom?”</p>
<p>She made no reply, and lifting her head from his shoulder,
Dr. Grey looked keenly into her face, and repeated his question.</p>
<p>“Do not urge me to express suspicions that may possibly
be unjust.”</p>
<p>“That are entirely unjust, you may rest assured,” said he,
almost vehemently.</p>
<p>“By what means did you so positively ascertain that fact?”</p>
<p>“The result will prove. Now, my dear child, you must acquit
me of heartlessness and cruelty when I tell you, that,
under existing circumstances, I cannot and will not consent
to the solemnization of your marriage until you are of age.
Once the conviction that an earlier consummation of your
engagement was essential to the happiness of both parties,
overruled the dictates of my judgment, and induced me to acquiesce
in your wishes; but subsequent events have illustrated
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_397"></a>397</span>
the wisdom of my former opposition, and now I am resolved
that no argument or persuasion shall prevail upon me
to sanction or permit your marriage until you are twenty-one.”</p>
<p>With a sharp cry of chagrin and amazement, Muriel sprang
to her feet.</p>
<p>“You surely do not mean to keep me in this torture, for
nearly three years? I will not submit to such tyranny, even
from Dr. Grey.”</p>
<p>“As a faithful guardian, I can see no alternative, and fear
of incurring your displeasure shall not deter me from the performance
of a stern duty to the child of my best and dearest
friend. I must and will do what your father certainly would,
were he alive. My dear Muriel, control yourself, and do not,
by harsh epithets and unjust accusations, wound the heart
that sincerely loves you. To-day, as your guardian, I hearken
to the imperative dictates of my conscience, and turn a deaf
ear to the pleadings of my tender affection, which would
save you from even momentary sorrow and disappointment.
Since my decision is irrevocable, do not render the execution
of my purpose more painful than necessity demands.”</p>
<p>Seizing his hand, Muriel pressed it against her flushed
cheek, and pleaded falteringly,—</p>
<p>“Do not doom your poor little Muriel to such misery. Oh,
Dr. Grey! dear Dr. Grey, remember you promised my dying
father to take his place,—and he would never inflict such
suffering on his child. You have forgotten your promise!”</p>
<p>“No, dear child. It is because I hold it so sacred that I
cannot yield to your entreaties; and I must faithfully adhere
to my obligations, even though I forfeit your affection.
I shall write to Mr. Granville by the next mail, and it is my
wish that henceforth the subject should not be referred to.
Cheer up, my child; three years will soon glide away, and at
the expiration of that time you will thank me for the firmness
which you now denounce as cruelty. Good-morning. Be sure
to think kindly of your guardian, whose heart is quite as sad
as your own.”</p>
<p>She struggled and resisted, but he kissed her lightly on
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_398"></a>398</span>
the forehead, and as he left the room heard her bitter invectives
against his tyranny and hard-heartedness.</p>
<p>Crossing the elm-studded lawn, he approached a secluded
walk, bordered with lilacs and myrtle, and saw the figure of
the governess pacing to and fro.</p>
<p>During the four months that had elapsed since his last
visit to “Solitude,” he scrutinized and studied her character
more closely than formerly, and the investigation only heightened
and intensified his esteem.</p>
<p>No hint of her history had ever passed the calm, patient
lips, which had forgotten how to laugh, and now, as he
watched her pale, melancholy face, which bore traces of extraordinary
beauty, he exonerated her from all blame in the
ruinous deception that had blasted more lives than one; and
honored the silent heroism which so securely locked her disappointment
in her own heart. He knew that consumption
was the hereditary scourge of her family, that she bore in her
constitution the seeds of slowly but surely developing disease,
and did not marvel at the quiet indifference with which she
treated symptoms which he had several times pointed out as
serious and dangerous.</p>
<p>To-day her manner was excited, and her step betrayed very
unusual impatience.</p>
<p>“Miss Dexter, from the frequency of your cough I am
afraid you are imprudent in selecting this walk, which is so
densely shaded that the sun does not reach it until nearly
noon. Are not your feet damp?”</p>
<p>“No, sir; my shoes are thick, and thoroughly protect
them.”</p>
<p>She paused before him, and, in her soft, brown eyes, he saw
a strange, unwonted restlessness,—an eager expectancy that
surprised and disturbed him.</p>
<p>“Are you at leisure this morning?”</p>
<p>“Do you need my services immediately?”</p>
<p>She answered evasively; and he noticed that she glanced
anxiously toward the road leading into town.</p>
<p>“You will greatly oblige me, if some time during the day,
you will be so good as to superintend the preparation of some
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_399"></a>399</span>
calves’-feet jelly, for one of my poor patients. I would not
trouble you, but Rachel is quite sick, and the new cook does
not understand the process. May I depend upon you?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, sir; it will afford me pleasure to prepare the
jelly.”</p>
<p>Looking more closely at her face, he saw undeniable traces
of recent tears, and drew her arm through his.</p>
<p>“I hope you will not deem me impertinently curious if I
beg you to honor me with your confidence, and explain the
anxiety which is evidently preying upon your mind.”</p>
<p>Embarrassment flushed her transparent cheek, and her shy
eyes glanced up uneasily.</p>
<p>“At least, Miss Dexter, permit me to ask whether Muriel
is connected with the cause of your disquiet?”</p>
<p>“My pupil is, I fear, very unhappy; but she withholds
much from me since she learned my disapproval of her approaching
marriage.”</p>
<p>“Will you acquaint me with your objections to Mr. Granville?”</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“Against</ins> Mr. Granville, the gentleman, I have nothing to
urge; but I could not consent to see Muriel wed a man, who,
I am convinced, has no affection for her.”</p>
<p>“Have you told her this?”</p>
<p>“Repeatedly; and, of course, my frankness has offended
and alienated her. Oh, Dr. Grey! the child totters on the
brink of a flower-veiled precipice, and will heed no warning.
Perhaps I should libel Mr. Granville were I to impute mercenary
motives to him,—perhaps he fancied he loved Muriel
when he addressed her,—I hope so, for the honor of manhood;
but the glamour was brief, and certainly he must be aware
that he has not proper affection for her now.”</p>
<p>“And yet, she is very lovable and winning.”</p>
<p>“Yes,—to you and to me; but her good qualities are not
those which gentlemen find most attractive. What is Christian
purity and noble generosity of soul, in comparison with
physical perfection? Muriel often reminds me of one whom
I loved devotedly, whose unselfish and unsuspicious nature
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_400"></a>400</span>
wrought the ruin of her happiness; and from her miserable
fate I would fain save my pupil.”</p>
<p>He knew from the tremor of her lips and hands, and the
momentary contraction of her fair brow, to whom she alluded;
and both sighed audibly.</p>
<p>“My convictions coincide so entirely with yours, that I
have had an interview with my ward, and withdrawn my
consent to her marriage until she is of age.”</p>
<p>“Thank God! In the interim she may grow wiser, or
some fortuitous <ins title="Was occurence">occurrence</ins> may avert the danger we dread.”</p>
<p>In the brief silence that ensued, the governess seemed
debating the expediency of making some revelation; and,
encountering one of her perplexed and scrutinizing glances,
the doctor smiled and said, gravely,—</p>
<p>“I believe I understand your hesitancy; but I assure you I
should never forfeit any trust you might repose in me. You
have some cause of serious annoyance, entirely irrespective
of my ward, and I may be instrumental in removing it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dr. Grey. For some days I have been canvassing
the propriety of asking your advice and assistance;
and my reluctance arose not from want of confidence in you,
but from dread of the pain it would necessarily inflict upon
me, to recur to events long buried. It is not essential, however,
that I should weary you with the minutiæ of circumstances
which many years ago smothered the sunshine in my
life, and left me in darkness, a lonely and joyless woman. I
have resided here long enough to learn the noble generosity
of your character, and to you, as a true Christian gentleman,
I come for aid,—premising only that what I am about to say
is strictly confidential.”</p>
<p>“As such, I shall ever regard it; but if I am to become
your coajutor in any matter, let me request that nothing be
kept secret, for only entire frankness should exist between
those who have a common aim.”</p>
<p>A painful flush tinged her cheek, and the fair, thin face,
grew indescribably mournful, as she clasped her hands firmly
over his arm.</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, when unscrupulous men or women deliberately
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_401"></a>401</span>
stab the happiness of a fellow-creature, they have no wounded
sensibilities, no haunting compunction,—and if remorse finally
overtakes, it finds them well-nigh callous and indurated;
but woe to that innocent being who is the unintentional and
unconscious agent for the ruin of those she loves. I cannot
remember the time when I did not love the only man for
whom I ever entertained any affection. He was the playmate
of my earliest years,—the betrothed of my young maidenhood,—and
just before my poor father died, he joined our
hands and left his blessing on my choice. Poverty was the
only barrier to our union, but I took a situation as teacher,
and hoarded my small gains in the hope of aiding my lover,
who went abroad with a wealthy uncle, and completed his
education in Germany. I knew that Maurice had contracted
very extravagant and self-indulgent habits,—but in the court
of love is there any ‘high crime’ or misdemeanor for which
a woman’s heart will condemn her idol? Nay, nay; she will
plead his defence against the stern evidence of her own incorruptible
reason; and, if need be, share his punishment,—die
in his stead. I denied myself every luxury, and jealously
husbanded my small salary, anticipating the happy hour
when we might invest it in furniture for our little home;
and, indeed, in those blessed days of hope, it seemed no
hardship,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘And joy was duty, and love was law.’</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>From time to time our marriage was deferred, but I well
knew I was beloved, and so I waited patiently, until fortune
should smile upon me. In the interim I became warmly
attached to a young girl in the school where I taught, and
whose affection for me was enthusiastic and ardent. Evelyn
was an orphan, and the heiress of enormous wealth, which
she seemed resolved to share with me; and, more than once,
I was tempted to acquaint her with the obstacle that debarred
me from happiness. Ah! if I had only confided in her,
and trusted her faithful love, how much wretchedness would
have been averted! But she appeared to me such an impulsive
child that I shrank from unburdening my heart to
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_402"></a>402</span>
her, while she acquainted me with every thought and aim of
her pure, guileless life. She was singularly, almost idolatrously
fond of me, and I loved her very sincerely, for her
character was certainly the most admirable I have ever met.</p>
<p>“At vacation we parted for three months, and I hurried
to meet my lover, who had promised to join me in Vermont,
where my mother had gone to recruit her failing health. For
the first time Maurice proved recreant, and wrote that imperative
business detained him in New York. Did I doubt
him, even then? Not in the least; but endeavored by cheerful
letters to show him how patiently I could bear the separation
that might result in pecuniary advantage to him. My
mother looked anxious, and foreboded ill; but I laughed at
her misgivings, and proudly silenced her warning voice. In
the midst of my blissful dream came a lengthy telegraphic
dispatch from my young girl-friend Evelyn, inviting me to
hasten to New York, and accompany her on a bridal tour
through Europe. In a brief and almost incoherent note,
subsequently received, she accidentally omitted the name of
her future husband, and designated him as ‘my prince,’ ‘my
king,’ ‘my liege lover.’ The same mail brought me a long
and exceedingly tender letter from my own betrothed, informing
me that at the expiration of ten days he would
certainly be with me to arrange for an immediate consummation
of our engagement. A railroad accident delayed me
twenty-four hours, and I did not reach New York until the
morning of the day on which my friend was married. The
ceremony took place at ten o’clock, and when I arrived,
Evelyn was already in the hands of the hair-dresser. I was
hurried into the room prepared for me, and while waiting
for my trunk, noticed a basket containing some of the
wedding cards. I picked up one, and you can perhaps imagine
my emotions, when I saw that my own lover was the betrothed
of my friend. Dr. Grey, eight miserable years have gone
wearily over my head since then, but now, in the dead of night,
if I shut my eyes, I see staring at me, like the rayless, glazed
orbs of the dead, that silver-edged wedding card, bearing
in silver letters—Maurice Carlyle, Evelyn Flewellyn. Oh,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_403"></a>403</span>
blacker than ten thousand death-warrants! for all the hopes
of a lifetime went down before it. Every ray of earthly
light was extinguished in a night of woe that can have no
dawn, until the day-star of eternity shimmers on its gloom.”</p>
<p>She shuddered convulsively, and the agonized expression of
her face was so painful to behold that her companion averted
his head.</p>
<p><ins title="Added quote">“I</ins> was alone with my misery, and so overwhelming was the
shock that I fainted. When the hair-dresser came to offer
her services, she found me lying insensible on the carpet.
How bitterly, how unavailingly, have I reproached myself
for my failure to hasten to Evelyn, even then, and divulge
all. But with returning consciousness came womanly pride,
and I resolved to hide the anguish for which I knew there
was no cure. As soon as I was dressed, we were summoned
down stairs to meet the remainder of the bridal party, and
there I saw the man whom I expected to call my husband
talking gayly with his attendants.</p>
<p>“Evelyn impetuously presented me as her ‘dearest friend,’
and, without raising his eyes, he bowed profoundly and turned
away. How I endured all I was called to witness that morning,
I know not; but my strength seemed superhuman.
The ceremony was performed in church, and after our
return to the house, Mr. Carlyle asserted and claimed the
right to kiss the bridesmaids. There were four, and I was
the last whom he approached. I was standing in the shadow
of the window-curtain, which I had clutched for support,
and, as he came close to me, our eyes met for the first
time that day, and I can never, never forget the pleading
mournfulness, the passionate tenderness, the despair, that
filled his. I waved him from me, but he seized my hand,
and pressed his hot lips lingeringly to mine. Then he whispered,
‘My only love, my own Edith, do not judge till you
hear your wretched Maurice. Meet me in the hot-house when
Evelyn goes to change her dress, and I will explain this
awful, this accursed necessity.’ A few moments later he
stood with his bride at the head of the table in the breakfast-room,
while I was placed close to Evelyn, and the mirror
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_404"></a>404</span>
opposite reflected the group. I know now it was sinful, but,
oh! how could I help it? As I looked at the reflection in
the glass, and compared my face with that of the bride, I
felt my poor wicked heart throb with triumph at the thought
that my superior beauty could not soon be forgotten,—that,
though her husband, he was still my lover. Dr. Grey, do
not despise me for my weakness, as I should have despised
him for his perfidy; and remember that a woman cannot
in a moment renounce allegiance to a man who is the one
love of her life. They forced me to drink some wine that
fired my brain and made me reckless, and an hour after,
when Maurice came up and offered his arm, inviting me to
promenade for a few minutes in the hot-house, I yielded and
accompanied him. He told me a tale of dishonorable financial
transactions, into which he had been betrayed solely by the
hope of obtaining money that would enable him to hasten
our union; but the utter failure of the scheme threatened him
with disgrace, possibly with imprisonment, and the only mode
of preserving his name from infamy, was to possess himself
of Evelyn’s large fortune. Just as he clasped me in his arms,
and vehemently declared his deathless affection for me,—his
contempt and hatred of his poor childish bride,—I heard
a strange sound that was neither a wail nor a laugh, a sound
unlike any other that ever smote my ears, and looking up,
I saw Evelyn standing before us.”</p>
<p>Miss Dexter groaned aloud, and covered her eyes with her
hand.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! help me to shut out that horrible vision! If
I could forget that distorted, death-like face, with livid lips
writhing away from the gleaming teeth, and desperate, wide
eyes, glaring like globes of flame! She looked twenty years
older, and from her clenched hands,—her beautiful, exquisite
hands,—that were wont to caress me so tenderly, the blood
was dripping down on her lace veil and her white velvet
bridal dress. How much she heard I know not, for I never
saw her again. I swooned in Maurice’s arms, and was carried
to my own room; and when I finally groped my way to
Evelyn’s apartment, they told me she had been gone two
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_405"></a>405</span>
hours,—had sailed for Europe, leaving her husband in New
York. What passed in her farewell interview with him none
but he and her lawyer knew; but they separated there on
condition that his debts were cancelled. She went abroad
with a faithful old Scotch woman who had been her nurse,
and her husband told the world she was a maniac.”</p>
<p>“Did he tell you so? Did you believe it?” exclaimed Dr.
Grey, with a degree of vehemence that startled the governess.</p>
<p>“I have never seen Maurice Carlyle since that awful hour
in the hot-house. He came repeatedly to my home, but I
refused to meet him, and dozens of his letters have been returned
unopened. Once, while I was absent, he obtained an
interview with my mother, and besought her intercession in
his behalf, pleading for my pardon, and assuring her that,
as his wife was hopelessly insane, he would apply for a divorce,
and then claim the hand of the only woman he had
ever loved. I dreaded the effect upon Evelyn, and had no
means of ascertaining her real condition. Soon after, I
lost my mother, whose death was hastened by grief and humiliation;
and, when I had laid her down beside my father,
I went in search of Evelyn. Several times I had attempted
to communicate with her, and with Elsie, the nurse, but my
letters always came back unopened, and bearing the London
stamp. Having been informed that she was in an insane
asylum in England, I took the money that had been so
carefully hoarded for a different purpose and went to London.
One by one, I searched all the asylums in the United
Kingdom, and finding no trace of her, came back to America.
Finally, on the death-bed of Mr. Clayton, her lawyer, who
understood my great anxiety to discover her, I was told
in strict confidence that she was perfectly sane,—had never
been otherwise,—but preferred that the false report in circulation
should not be corrected, since her husband had set it
in motion. I learned that she was well and pleasantly located
somewhere in the East, but would never see the faces of
either friends or foes, and absolutely refused all intercourse
with her race. From one of her letters (which, a moment
after, he burned in the grate) Mr. Clayton read me a paragraph:
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_406"></a>406</span>
‘<i>The greatest mercy you can show me is to allow
me to forget. Henceforth mention no more the names of any
I ever knew; and let silence, like a pall, shroud all the past
of Vashti.</i>’ He died next day, and since then—”</p>
<p>The sad, sweet voice, which for some moments had been
growing more and more unsteady, here sank into a sob, and
the governess wept freely, while her whole frame shook with
the violence of long-pent anguish, that now defied control.</p>
<p>“Oh, if I could find her! If I could go to her and tell
her all, and exonerate myself! If I could show her that he
was mine always,—mine long before she ever saw him,—then
she would not think so harshly of me. I know not what explanation
Maurice gave her, nor how much of our conversation
she overheard; and I cannot live contentedly,—oh! I cannot
die in peace till I see my poor crushed darling, and hear
from her lips the assurance that she does not hold me responsible
for her wretchedness. Dr. Grey, I love her with
a pitying tenderness that transcends all power of expression.
Perhaps if Maurice had ever loved her, I could not feel as
I do towards her; for a woman’s nature tolerates no rival
in the affection of her lover, and, unprincipled as mine proved
in other respects, I know that his heart was always unswervingly
my own. My dear, noble Evelyn! My pure, loving
little darling! Ah! I have wearied heaven with prayers that
God would give her back to my arms.”</p>
<p>Unable to conceal the emotion he was unwilling she should
witness, Dr. Grey disengaged his arm and walked away, striving
to regain his usual composure.</p>
<p>Did the governess suspect the proximity of her long-lost
friend? If she claimed his assistance in prosecuting her
search, what course would duty dictate?</p>
<p>Retracing his steps, he found that she had seated herself
on a bench near one of the tallest lilacs, and having thrown
aside her quilted hood of scarlet silk, her care-worn countenance
was fully exposed.</p>
<p>She was gazing very intently at some object in her hand,
which she bent over and kissed several times, and did not
perceive his approach until he stood beside her.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_407"></a>407</span></div>
<p>“Dr. Grey, I believe my prayer has been heard, and that at
last I have discovered a clew to the retreat of my lost
Evelyn. Last week I went to a jewelry store in town, to
buy a locket which I intended as a birthday gift for Muriel.
Several customers had preceded me, and while waiting, my
attention was attracted towards one of the workmen who
uttered an impatient ejaculation and dashed down some article
upon which he was at work. As it fell, I saw that it was
an oval ivory miniature, <ins title="Was originaly">originally</ins> surrounded with very large
handsome pearls, the greater portion of which the jeweller
had removed and placed in a small glass bowl that stood near
him. I leaned down to examine the miniature, and though
the paint was blurred and faded, it was impossible to mistake
the likeness, and you cannot realize the thrill that ran along
my nerves as I recognized the portrait of Evelyn. So great
was my astonishment and delight that I must have cried
out, for the people in the store all turned and stared at me,
and when I snatched the piece of ivory from the work-table,
the man looked at me in amazement. Very incoherently I
demanded where and how he obtained it, and, beckoning to the
proprietor, he said, ‘Just as I told you; this has turned out
stolen property.’ Then he opened a drawer and took from
it a similar oval slab of ivory, and when I looked at it and
saw Maurice’s handsome face, my brain reeled, and I grew
so dizzy I almost fell. ‘Madam, do you know these portraits?’
asked the proprietor.</p>
<p>“I told him that I did,—that I had seen these jewelled
miniatures eight years before on the dressing-table of a bride,
and I implored him to tell me how they came into his
possession. He fitted them into a dingy, worn case, which
seemed to have been composed of purple velvet, and informed
me that he purchased the whole from an Irish lad, who asserted
that he picked it up on the beach, where it had evidently
drifted in a high tide. On examination, he found that the
case had indeed been saturated with sea-water, but the pearls
were in such a remarkable state of preservation that he
doubted the lad’s statement. He had bought the miniatures
in order to secure the pearls, which he assured me were unusually
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_408"></a>408</span>
fine, and to satisfy himself concerning the affair had
advertised two ivory miniatures, and invited the owners to
come forward and prove property. After the expiration
of a week, he discontinued the notice, and finally ordered the
pearls removed from their gold frames. When I had given
him the names of the originals, he consented that I should
take the portraits which were now worthless to him, and
gave me also the name of the boy. It was not until two
days afterward that I succeeded in finding Thomas Donovan,
a lad about fourteen years old, whose mother Phœbe is a
laundress, and does up laces and fine muslins. When I
called and stated the object of my visit he seemed much confused,
but sullenly repeated the assertion made to the jeweller.
Yesterday I went again and had a long conversation with
his mother, who must be an honest soul, for she assured me
she knew nothing of the matter, and would investigate it
immediately. The boy was absent, but she promised either
to send him here this morning or come in person, to acquaint
me with the result. I offered a reward if he would confess
where he obtained them; and if he proved obstinate, threatened
to have him arrested. Now, Dr. Grey, you can understand
why I have so tediously made a full revelation of my
past, for I wish to enlist your sympathy and claim your aid
in my search for my long-lost friend. These portraits inadequately
represent the fascinating beauty of one of the originals,
and the sweetness and almost angelic purity of the
other.”</p>
<p>She held up the somewhat defaced and faded miniatures
for the inspection of her companion, but scarcely glancing
at them, he said, abstractedly,—</p>
<p>“You are sure they belong to Mrs. Carlyle?”</p>
<p>“Yes. As she put on her diamonds just before going down
stairs she showed me the portraits in her jewelry casket, where
she had also placed a similar one of myself. Ah! at this
instant I seem to see her beaming face, as she bent down,
and sweeping her veil aside, kissed my picture and Maurice’s.”</p>
<p>“Do you imagine that she is in America?”</p>
<p>“No; I fear she is dead, and that these were stolen from
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_409"></a>409</span>
the old nurse. Who is that yonder? Ah, yes,—Phœbe Donovan.
Now I shall hear the truth.”</p>
<p>Forgetting her shawl, and unmindful of the fact that the
sun was streaming full on her head and face, she hurried
to meet the woman who was ascending the avenue, and very
soon they entered the house.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour elapsed ere Phœbe came out, and
walked rapidly away; and, unwilling to prolong his suspense,
Dr. Grey went in search of the governess.</p>
<p>He met her in the hall, and saw that she was equipped for
a walk. Her cheeks were scarlet, her brown eyes all aglow
with eager expectation, and her lips twitched, as she exclaimed,—</p>
<p>“Oh, doctor, I hope everything; for I learn that the pictures
were found on the lawn at ‘Solitude,’ where Phœbe was
once hired as cook; and she recognized the case as the same
she had one day seen on a writing-desk in the parlor. The
boy confessed that he picked it up from the grass, and, after
taking out the contents, soaked the case in a bucket of salt-water.
Phœbe says the pictures belong to Mrs. Gerome, the
gray-headed woman who owns that place on the beach, and
I am almost tempted to believe she is Elsie, who may have
married again. At all events, I shall soon know where she
obtained the portraits.”</p>
<p>“You are not <ins title="Was gong">going</ins> to ‘Solitude’?”</p>
<p>“Yes, immediately. I cannot rest till I have learned all.
God grant I may not be mocked in my hopes.”</p>
<p>The unwonted excitement had kindled a strange beauty in
the whilom passive face, and Dr. Grey could for the first time
realize how lovely she must have been in the happy days of
eld.</p>
<p>“Miss Dexter, Mrs. Gerome will not receive you. She
sees no visitors, not even ministers of the gospel.”</p>
<p>“She must—she shall—admit me; for I will assure her
that life and death hang upon it.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“If Evelyn is alive, and I can discover her retreat, I will
urge her to go to her husband, who needs her care. You
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_410"></a>410</span>
know Mrs. Gerome,—she is one of your patients. Come with
me, and prevail upon her to receive me.”</p>
<p>In her eagerness she laid her hand on his arm, and even
then noticed and wondered at the crimson that suddenly
leaped into his olive face.</p>
<p>“Some day I will give you good reasons for refusing your
request, which it is impossible for me to grant. If you are
resolved to hazard the visit, I will take you in my buggy
as far as the gate at ‘Solitude,’ and when you return will
confer with you concerning the result. Just now, I can
promise no more.”</p>
<p>An expression of disappointment clouded her brow.</p>
<p>“I had hoped that you would sympathize with and be
more interested in my great sorrow.”</p>
<p>“Miss Dexter, my interest is more profound, more intense,
than you can imagine, but at this juncture circumstances
forbid its expression. My buggy is at the door.”</p>
<hr class="toprule">

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>
<p>Even at mid-day the grounds around “Solitude” were
sombre and chill, for across the sky the winds had woven a
thin, vapory veil, whose cloud-meshes seemed fine as lacework;
and through this gilded netting the sun looked hazy,
the light wan and yellow, and rifled of its customary noon
glitter.</p>
<p>Following one of the serpentine walks, the governess was
approaching the house, when her attention was attracted by
the gleaming surface of a tomb, and she turned towards the
pyramidal deodars that were swaying slowly in the breeze,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Warming their heads in the sun,<br>
Checkering the grass with their shade,”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>and photographing fringy images on the shining marble.</p>
<p>A broad circle of violets, blue with bloom, surrounded a
sexangular temple, whose dome was terminated by a mural
crown and surmounted by a cross. The beautifully polished
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_411"></a>411</span>
pillars were fluted, and wreathed with carved ivy that wound
up to the richly-sculptured cornices, where poppies clustered
and tossed their leaves along the architrave; and, in the
centre, visible through all the arches, rose an altar, bearing
two angels with fingers on their lips, who guarded an exquisite
urn that was inscribed “<i>cor cordium</i>.”</p>
<p>Beneath the eastern arch, that directly fronted the sea,
were two steps leading into the mausoleum, and, as Miss
Dexter stood within, she saw that the floor was arranged
with slabs for only two tombs close to the altar, one side
of which bore in golden tracery,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“<i>Elsie Maclean, 68. Amicus Amicorum.</i>”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Around the base of the urn were scattered some fresh geranium-leaves,
and very near it stood a tall, slender, Venetian
glass vase filled with odorous flowers, which had evidently
been gathered and arranged that day.</p>
<p>For whom had the remaining slab and opposite side of the
altar been reserved?</p>
<p>The heart of the governess seemed for a moment to forget
its functions, then a vague hope made it throb fiercely; and
rapidly the anxious woman directed her steps towards the
house, that seemed as silent as the grave behind her.</p>
<p>The hall door had swung partially open, and, dreading that
she might be refused admittance if she rang the bell, she
availed herself of the lucky accident (which in Elsie’s lifetime
never happened), and entered unchallenged and unobserved.</p>
<p>From the parlor issued a rather monotonous and suppressed
sound, as of some one reading aloud, and, advancing a few
steps, the governess stood inside the threshold.</p>
<p>The curtains of the south window were looped back, the
blinds thrown open, and the sickly sunshine poured in, lighting
the easel, before which the mistress of the house had
drawn an ottoman and seated herself.</p>
<p>To-day, an air of unwonted negligence marked her appearance,
usually distinguished by extraordinary care and taste.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_412"></a>412</span></div>
<p>Her white merino <i>robe de chambre</i> was partially ungirded,
and the blue tassels trailed on the carpet; her luxuriant hair
instead of being braided and classically coiled, was gathered
in three or four large heavy loops, and fastened rather loosely
by the massive silver comb that allowed one long tress to
straggle across her shoulder, while the folds in front slipped
low on her temples and forehead.</p>
<p>Intently contemplating her work, she leaned her cheek on
her hand, and only the profile was visible from the door, as
she repeated, in a subdued tone,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“I stanch with ice my burning breast,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>With silence balm my whirling brain,<br>
O Brandan! to this hour of rest,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>That Joppan leper’s ease was pain.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The easel held the largest of many pictures, upon which she
had lavished time and study, and her present work was a wide
stretch of mid-ocean, lighted by innumerable stars, and a
round glittering polar moon that swung mid-heaven like
a globe of silver, and shed a ghostly lustre on the raging,
ragged waves, above which an Aurora Borealis lifted its
gleaming arch of mysterious white fires.</p>
<p>On the flowery shore of a tropic isle, under clustering
boughs of lime and citron, knelt the venerable figure of
Saint Brandan,—and upon a towering, jagged iceberg, whose
crystal cliffs and diamond peaks glittered with the ghastly
radiance reflected from arctic moon and boreal flames, lay
Judas, pressing his hot palms and burning breast to the frigid
bosom of his sailing sapphire berg.</p>
<p>No hideous, scowling, red-haired arch-apostate was this
painted Iscariot,—but a handsome man, whose features were
startlingly like those in the ivory miniature.</p>
<p>It was a wild, dreary, mournful picture, suggestive of
melancholy mediæval myths, and most abnormal phantasms;
and would more appropriately have draped the walls of some
flagellating ascetic’s cell, than the luxuriously furnished room
that now contained it.</p>
<p>Bending forward to deepen the dark circles which suffering
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_413"></a>413</span>
and remorse had worn beneath the brilliant eyes of the
apostle, the lonely artist added another verse to her quotation,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Once every year, when carols wake<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>On earth the Christmas night’s repose,<br>
Arising from the sinner’s lake<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>I journey to these healing snows.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The motion loosened a delicate white lily pinned at her
throat, and it fell upon the palette, sullying its purity with
the dark paint to which its petals clung. She removed it,
looked at its defaced loveliness, and tossed it aside, saying
moodily,—</p>
<p>“Typical of our souls, originally dowered with a stainless
and well-nigh perfect holiness, but drooping dust-ward continually,
and once tainted by the fall,—hugging the corruption
that ruined it.”</p>
<p>As the governess looked and listened, a half-perplexed,
half-frightened expression passed over her countenance, and
at length she advanced to the arch, and said, tremblingly,—</p>
<p>“Can I have a few moments’ conversation with Mrs.
Gerome, on important business?”</p>
<p>“My God! am I verily mad at last? Because I called up
Judas, must I also evoke the partner of his crime?”</p>
<p>With a thrilling, almost blood-curdling cry Mrs. Gerome
had leaped to her feet at the sound of Miss Dexter’s voice,
and, dropping palette and brush, confronted her with a look
of horror and hate. The quick and violent movement shook
out her comb, and down came the folds of hair, falling like
a silver cataract to her knees.</p>
<p>Bewildered by memories which the face and form recalled,
the governess looked at the shining white locks, and her lips
blanched, as she stammered,—</p>
<p>“Are you Mrs. Gerome?”</p>
<p>Her scarlet hood had fallen back, disclosing her wealth of
golden hair; and gazing at her thin but still lovely features,
rouged by a hectic glow that lent strange beauty to the
wide, brown eyes, Mrs. Gerome answered, huskily,—</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_414"></a>414</span></div>
<p>“I am the mistress of this house. Who is the woman who
has the audacity to intrude upon my seclusion, and vividly remind
me of one whose hated lineaments have cursed my memory
for years? Woman, if I believed <i>she</i> had the effrontery
to thrust herself into my presence, I should fear that at this
instant I am afflicted with the abhorred sight of Edith Dexter,
than whom a legion of devils would be more welcome!”</p>
<p>The name fell hissingly from her stern mouth, and when
she shook back the hair that drooped over her brow, the gray
globe-like eyes glittered as polished blue steel under some fitful
light.</p>
<p>A low, half-stifled cry escaped the governess, and springing
forward she fell on her knees and grasped the white hands
that had clutched each other.</p>
<p>“Evelyn! It must be Evelyn! despite this gray hair and
wan, changed face! and I could never mistake these beautiful,
beautiful hands—unlike any others in the world! Evelyn,
my lost darling! oh, I thank God I have found you before I
die!”</p>
<p>She covered the cold fingers with kisses, and pressed her
face to a band of the floating hair; but with a gesture of
loathing Mrs. Gerome broke away, and retreated a few steps.</p>
<p>“How dare you come into my presence? Goaded by a
desire to witness the ruin you helped to accomplish? Your
audacity at least astounds me; but fate decrees you the enjoyment
of its reward. Lo! here I am! Behold the gray
shadow of what was once a happy, confiding girl! Behold
in the desolate, lonely woman, who hides her disgrace under
the name of Agla Gerome, that bride of an hour, that Evelyn
whose heart you stabbed! Does the wreck entirely satisfy
you? What more could even fiendish malevolence desire?”</p>
<p>“Evelyn, you wrong me. For mercy’s sake do not upbraid
and taunt me so unjustly!”</p>
<p>In vain she held out her hands imploringly, while tears
rolled over her crimsoned cheeks, and sobs impeded her utterance.
Mrs. Gerome laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>“What! I wrong you? Have <i>you</i> gone mad, instead of
your victim? Miss Dexter, you and I can scarcely afford
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_415"></a>415</span>
to deal in mock tragedy, and though you make a pretty
picture kneeling there, I have no mind to paint you yonder,
where I put your colleague, Judas. Is it not a good likeness
of your lover, as he looked that memorable day when the
broad banana-leaves overshadowed his handsome head?”</p>
<p>She rapped the canvas with her clenched hand, and continued,
in accents of indescribable scorn,—</p>
<p>“Do you kneel as penitent or petitioner? You come to
crave my pardon, or my husband?”</p>
<p>The governess had bowed her face almost to the carpet,
like some fragile flower borne down by a sudden flood; but
now she rose, and, throwing her head back proudly, answered
with firm yet gentle dignity,—</p>
<p>“Of Mrs. Gerome I crave nothing. Of Evelyn Carlyle I
demand justice; simply bare justice.”</p>
<p>“Justice! You are rash, Miss Dexter, to challenge fate;
for, were justice meted out, the burden would prove more intolerable
to you than that King Stork whom Zeus sent down
as a Nemesis to quiet clamorous frogs. Justice, let me tell
you, long <ins title="Was age">ago</ins> fled from this hostile and inhospitable earth
and took refuge beyond the stars, where, please God, you and
I shall one day confront her and get our long-defrauded
dues. Justice? Nay, nay! the thing I recognize as justice
would crush you utterly, and you should flee to the <i>Ultima
Thule</i> to avoid it. I divine your mission. You come as
envoy-extraordinary from my honorable and chivalric husband,
to demand release from the bonds that doom me to wear
his name and you to live without that spotless ægis? Since
my fortune no longer percolates through the sieve of his
pocket, and legal quibbles can not now avail to wring thousands
from my purse, he desires a divorce, in order to remove
to your fair wrists the fetters which have proved more galling
to mine than those of iron.”</p>
<p>“Evelyn, insult must not be heaped upon injury. As God
hears me, I tell you solemnly that you have seen your husband
since I have. Upon Maurice Carlyle’s face I have never
looked since that fatal hour when I last saw yours, ghastly
and rigid, against the background of guava-boughs. From
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_416"></a>416</span>
that day until this, I have neither seen, nor spoken, nor written
to him.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you here, to torment me with the sight of
your face, which would darken the precincts of heaven, if
I met it inside of the gates of pearl?”</p>
<p>“I have come to exonerate myself from the aspersions that
in your frenzy you have cast upon me. Evelyn, I am here
to prove that my wrongs are greater than yours,—and if
either should crave pardon, it would best become you to sue
for it at my hands. But for you, I should have been a
happy wife,—blessed with a devoted husband and fond mother;
and now in my loneliness I stand for vindication before her
who robbed me of every earthly hope, and blotted all light,
all verdure, all beauty from my life. You had known Maurice
Carlyle six weeks, when you gave him your hand. I had
grown up at his side,—had loved, trusted, prayed, and
labored for him,—had been his promised wife for seven dreary
years of toil and separation, and was counting the hours
until the moment when he would lead me to the altar. Ah,
Evelyn,—”</p>
<p>A violent spell of coughing interrupted the governess, and
when it ended she did not complete the sentence.</p>
<p>Impatiently Mrs. Gerome motioned to her to continue, and,
turning her head which had been averted, the hostess saw that
her guest was endeavoring to stanch a stream of blood that
trickled across her lips. Involuntarily the former started forward
and drew an easy-chair close to the slender figure which
leaned for support against the corner of the piano.</p>
<p>“Are you ill? Pray sit down.”</p>
<p>“It is only a hemorrhage from my lungs, which I have long
had reason to expect.”</p>
<p>Wearily she sank into the chair, and hastily pouring a glass
of water from a gilt-starred crystal <i>carafe</i>, standing on the
centre-table, Mrs. Gerome silently offered it. As the governess
drained and returned the goblet, a drop of blood that stained
the rim fell on the hand of the mistress of the house.</p>
<p>Miss Dexter attempted to remove it with the end of her
plaid shawl, but her companion drew back, and taking a
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_417"></a>417</span>
dainty, perfumed handkerchief from her pocket, shook out its
folds and said, hastily,—</p>
<p>“It is of no consequence. I see your handkerchief is already
saturated; will you accept mine?”</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, she laid it on the lap of the
visitor, and left the room.</p>
<p>Soon after, a servant brought in a basin of water and
towels, which she placed on the table, and then, without question
or comment, withdrew.</p>
<p>Some time elapsed before Mrs. Gerome re-entered the parlor,
bearing a glass of wine in her hand. Miss Dexter had
bathed her face, and, looking up, she saw that the gray hair
had been carefully coiled and fastened, and the flowing
merino belted at the waist; but the brow wore its heavy cloud,
and the arch of the lip had not unbent.</p>
<p>“I hope you are better. Permit me to insist upon your
taking this wine.”</p>
<p>She proffered it, but the governess shook her head, and
tears ran down her cheeks, as she said,—</p>
<p>“Thank you,—but I do not require it; indeed I could not
swallow it.”</p>
<p>The hostess bowed, and, placing the glass within her reach,
walked to the window which looked out on the marble mausoleum,
and stood leaning against the cedarn facing.</p>
<p>Five, ten minutes passed, and the silence was only broken by
the ticking of the bronze clock on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>“Evelyn.”</p>
<p>The voice was so sweet, so thrilling, so mournfully pleading,
that it might have wooed even stone to pity; but Mrs. Gerome
merely glanced over her shoulder, and said, frigidly,—</p>
<p>“Can I in any way contribute to Miss Dexter’s comfort?
The servants tell me there is no conveyance waiting for you;
but, since you seem too feeble to walk away, my carriage is at
your service whenever you wish to return. Shall I order it?”</p>
<p>“No, I will not trouble you. I can walk; and, after a
little while, I will go away forever. Evelyn, do you think me
utterly unprincipled?”</p>
<p>A moment passed before she was answered.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_418"></a>418</span></div>
<p>“While you are in my house, courtesy forbids the expression
of my opinion of your character.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Evelyn, my darling! God knows I have not merited
this harshness, this cruelty from your dear hands. Eight
tedious, miserable years I have searched and prayed for you,—have
clung to the hope of finding you, of telling you all,—of
hearing your precious lips utter those words for which my
ears have so long ached, ‘Edith, I hold you guiltless of my
wretchedness.’ But at last, when my search is successful, to be
browbeaten, derided, denounced, insulted,—oh, this is bitter
indeed! This is too hard to be borne!”</p>
<p>Her anguish was uncontrollable, and she sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>Across Mrs. Gerome’s white lips crept a quiver, and over
her frozen features rose an unwonted flush; but she did not
move a muscle, or suffer her eyes to wander from the cross
and crown on Elsie’s tomb.</p>
<p>“Evelyn, I believe, I hope (and may God forgive me if I
sin in hoping), that I have not many years, or perhaps even
months to live; and it would comfort me in my dying hour
to feel that I had laid before you some facts, of which I know
you must be ignorant. You have harshly and unjustly prejudged
me,—have steeled yourself against me; still I wish
to tell you some things that weigh heavily upon my aching,
desolate heart. Will you allow me to do so now? Will you
hear me?”</p>
<p>There was evidently a struggle in the mind of the motionless
woman beside the window, but it was brief, and left no
trace in the cold, ringing voice.</p>
<p>“I will hear you.”</p>
<p>Slowly and impressively the governess began the narrative,
of which she had given Dr. Grey a hasty <i>résumé</i>, and when
she mentioned the midnight labors in which she had engaged,
the copying of legal documents, the sale of her drawings, the
hoarding of her salary in order to aid her mother and her
betrothed, and to remove the obstacles to her marriage, Mrs.
Gerome sat down, and, crossing her arms on the window-sill,
hid her face upon them.</p>
<p>Unflinchingly Miss Dexter detailed all that occurred after

her arrival in New York; and finally, approaching the window,
she insisted that her listener should peruse the last letter
received from her lover, and containing the promise that
within ten days he would come to claim his bride. But the
lovely hand waved it aside, and the proud voice exclaimed impatiently,—</p>
<p>“I need no additional proof of his perfidy, which, beyond
controversy, was long ago established. Go on! go on!”</p>
<p>Upon all that followed the ceremony,—the departure of
the wife,—and her own despairing grief, the governess dwelt
with touching eloquence and pathos; and, at last, as she
spoke of her fruitless journey to England,—her sad search
through the insane asylums,—Mrs. Gerome lifted her queenly
head, and bent a piercing glance upon the speaker.</p>
<p>Ah! what a hungry, eager expression looked out shyly from
her whilom hopeless eyes, when, with an imperious gesture,
she silenced her visitor, and asked,—</p>
<p>“You spent your hard earnings, not in <i>trousseau</i>, or preparations
for housekeeping; but hunting for me in lunatic
asylums? Suppose you had found me in a mad-house?”</p>
<p>“Then I should have become an inmate of the same gloomy
walls; and, while you lived, should have shared with faithful
Elsie the care and charge of you. God is my witness, I had
resolved to dedicate my remaining years to the task of cheering
and guarding yours. Oh, Evelyn! not until we stand in
the great Court of Heaven can you realize how sincerely, how
tenderly, and unwaveringly, I love you. My darling, how
can you distrust my faithful heart?”</p>
<p>She sank on her knees, and, throwing her arms around the
tall, slender form, looked with mournful, beseeching tenderness
at the haughty features above her.</p>
<p>For a moment the proud, pale face glowed,—the great
shadowy eyes kindled and shone like wintry planets in some
crystalline sky; but doubt, murderous, cynical doubt, grappled
with hope, and strangled it.</p>
<p>“Edith, I wish I could believe you. I am struggling desperately
to lay hold of the fluttering garments of faith, but
I cannot! Suspicion has walked hand in hand with me so
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_420"></a>420</span>
long that I cannot shake off her numbing touch, and I distrust
all human things, save the dusty heart that moulders
yonder in my old Elsie’s grave.”</p>
<p>She pointed to the white columns of the temple, and then
the uplifted fingers fell heavily on Edith’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Go on. I wish to learn whose treachery betrayed the
secret of my retreat.”</p>
<p>Pressing her feverish lips to the hand she admired so enthusiastically,
Miss Dexter resumed her recital of what had
occurred since her journey to London, and finally ended it
with an account of her removal to ‘Grassmere,’ and of the discovery
of the miniatures that guided her to ‘Solitude.’</p>
<p>A long pause followed, and a heavy sigh, only partially
smothered, indexed the contest that raged under Mrs. Gerome’s
calm exterior.</p>
<p>“Edith, would you have inferred from Dr. Grey’s manner
that he was not only acquainted with my history, but yours,
at least, so far as it intersected mine? Did he furnish no
hint, no clew, that aided you in your search?”</p>
<p>“None whatever. On the contrary, he appeared so preoccupied,
so abstracted, that I reproached him with indifference
to my troubles. It is not possible that he knew all, while
I briefly summed up a portion of the past.”</p>
<p>“At that moment he was thoroughly cognizant of everything
that I could tell him. But, at least, one honorable,
trustworthy man yet graces the race; one pure, incorruptible,
and consistent Christian remains to shed lustre upon a
church that can nowhere boast his peer. I confided all to
Dr. Grey, and he has kept the trust. Ah, Edith, if you had
only reposed the same confidence in me, during those halcyon
days of our early friendship,—days that seem to me now as
far off, as dim and unreal, as those starry nights when I lay
in my little crib, dreaming of that mother whose face I never
saw, whose smile is one of the surprises and blessings reserved
for eternity,—how different my lot and yours might
have been! Why did you not trust me with your happy hopes,
your lover’s name and difficulties? How differently I would
have invested that fortune, which proved our common ruin,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_421"></a>421</span>
and doomed three lives to uselessness and woe. To-day you
might have proudly worn the name that I utterly detest;
and I, the outcast, the wanderer, the tireless, friendless waif,
drifting despairingly down the tide of time,—even I, the unloved,
might have been, not a solitary cumberer, not a household
upas,—but why taunt the hideous Actual with a blessed
and beautiful Impossible? Ah, truly, truly,—</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>She closed her eyes and seemed pondering the past, and
mutely the governess prayed that hallowed memories of their
former affection might soften her apparently petrified heart.</p>
<p>Edith saw a great change overspread the countenance, but
could not accurately interpret its import; and her own heart
began to beat the long-roll.</p>
<p>The heavy black eyelashes lying on Mrs. Gerome’s marble
cheeks glistened, trembled, and tears stole slowly across
her face. She raised her hand, but dropped it in her lap,
and frowned slightly and sighed. Then she lifted it once
more, and looking through the shining mist that magnified
her splendid eyes, she laid her fingers on the golden head of
the kneeling woman.</p>
<p>“You and I have innocently wronged and ruined each
other; you with your beauty, I with my accursed gold. Time
was when at your bidding I would have laid my throbbing
heart at your feet, provided I could thereby save you one
pang; for I loved you as women very rarely love one another.
But now, lonely and hopeless, I have lost the power, the capacity
to love anything, and I have no heart left in my bosom.
I acquit you of much for which I formerly held you responsible,
and I honor the purity of purpose that forbade your
receiving the visits or letters of him who must one day answer
for our worthless lives. I fully forgive you the suffering that
made me prematurely old; but my affection is as dead as all
my girlish hopes, and buried under the crushing years that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_422"></a>422</span>
have dragged themselves over my poor, proud, pain-bleached
head. You are more fortunate, more enviable than I, for
you have the comforting anticipation of a speedy release, the
precious assurance that your torture will ere long be ended;
while I must front the prospect of perhaps fourscore and ten
years: for, despite my ivory skin and fever-blanched locks, I
am maddeningly healthy. Friend of my childhood, friend of
my happy, sunny, sinless days, I cordially congratulate you
on your approaching deliverance. God knows I would pay
you my fortune, if I could innocently and successfully inject
into my veins and lungs the poison that will soon rob you of
care and regret. If I was harsh to-day, forgive and forget it,
for nothing rankles in the grave; and now, Edith, go away
quickly, before I repent and recant the words I here utter.
God comfort you, Edith Dexter, and remember that I hold
you guiltless of my wrecked destiny.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Evelyn! add one thing more. Say, ‘Edith, I love
you.’”</p>
<p>A strangely mournful smile parted Mrs. Gerome’s perfect
lips over her dazzling teeth, as she pushed the kneeling figure
from her, and said coldly,—</p>
<p>“Rise, and leave me. I love no living thing, brute or
human, for even my faithful dog lies buried a few yards
hence. Maurice treated my warm, loving nature, as Tofana
did her unsuspecting victims, and for that slow poison there
is no antidote. The sole interest I have in life centres in my
art, and when death mercifully remembers me, some pictures
I have patiently wrought out will be given to the public; and
the next generation will, perhaps,—</p>

<p class="cg">‘Hear the world applaud the hollow ghost,<br>

<p class="cg">‘Hither to come, and to sleep,<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Both rose, and the two so long divided faced each other
sorrowfully.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_423"></a>423</span></div>
<p>“Dear Evelyn, do not hug despair so stubbornly to your
bosom. You might brighten your solitary existence if you
would, and be comparatively happy in this lovely seaside
home.”</p>
<p>“You think ‘Solitude’ a very desirable and beautiful retreat?
Do you remember the gay raiment and glittering
jewels that covered the radiant bride of Giacopone di Todi?
One day an accident at a public festival mangled her mortally,
and when her gorgeous garments were torn off, lo!</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘A robe of sackcloth next the smooth, white skin.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>A sudden pallor crept over the delicate face of the governess,
and, folding her hands, she exclaimed with passionate
vehemence,—</p>
<p>“I cannot, I must not shrink from the chief object of my
visit here. I came not only to exonerate myself, but to plead
for poor Maurice.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerome started back, and the pitiless gleam came instantly
into her softened eyes.</p>
<p>“Do not mention his name again. I thought you had
neither seen nor heard from him.”</p>
<p>“I must plead his wretched cause, since he is denied the
privilege of appealing to your mercy. Evelyn, my friends
write me that he is almost in a state of destitution. Only
last night I received this letter, which I leave for your perusal,
and which assures me he is in want, and, moreover, is dangerously
ill. Who has the right, the privilege,—whose is the
duty, imperative and stern, to hasten to his bedside, to alleviate
his suffering, to provide for his needs? Yours, Evelyn
Carlyle, and yours alone. Where are the marriage-vows that
you snatched from my lips eight years ago, and eagerly took
upon your own? Did you not solemnly swear in the presence
of heaven and earth to serve him and keep him in sickness,
and, forsaking all others, to hold him from that day forward,
for better, for worse, until death did part ye? Oh, Evelyn!
do not scowl, and turn away. However unworthy, he is your
husband in the sight of God and man, and your wedding
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_424"></a>424</span>
oath calls you to him in this hour of his terrible need. Can
you sleep peacefully, knowing that he is tossing with paroxysms
of pain, and perhaps hungering and thirsting for that
which you could readily supply? If it were right,—if I dared,
I would hasten to him; but my conscience inexorably forbids
the thought, and consigns my heart to torture, for which
there is no name. You will tell me that you provided once,
twice, for all reasonable wants,—that he has recklessly
squandered liberal allowances. But will that satisfy your conscience,
while you still possess ample means to aid him? Will
you permit the man whose name you bear to live on other
charity than your own,—and finally, to fill a pauper’s grave?
Oh, Evelyn! was it for this that you took my darling, my idol,
from my clinging, loving arms? Will you see his body writhing
in the agony of disease, and his precious, immortal soul
in fearful jeopardy, while you stand afar off, surrounded by
every luxury that ingenuity can suggest, and gold purchase?
Oh, Evelyn! be merciful; do your duty. Like a brave, true,
though injured woman, go to Maurice, and strive to make
him comfortable; to lighten, by your pardon, his sad, heavily
laden heart. By your past, your memories of your betrothal,
your hopes of heaven, and above all, by your marriage vows,
I implore you to discharge your sacred duties.”</p>
<p>A bitter smile twisted the muscles about Mrs. Gerome’s
mouth, as she gazed into the quivering, eloquent face of her
companion, and listened to the impetuous appeal that poured
so pathetically over her burning lips.</p>
<p>“Edith, you amaze me. Is it possible that after all your
injuries you can cling so fondly, so madly, to the man who
slighted, and humiliated, and blighted you?”</p>
<p>“Ah! you are his wife, and I am the ridiculed and pitied
victim of his flirtation, so says the world; but my affection
outlives yours. Evelyn, I have loved him from the time
when I can first <ins title="Was recollet">recollect</ins>; I loved him with a deathless devotion
that neither his unworthiness, nor time, nor eternity can
conquer; and to-day, I tell you that he is dear to me,—dear
to me as some precious corpse, over which a gravestone has
gathered moss for eight weary, dreary years. The angels in
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_425"></a>425</span>
heaven would not blush for the feeling in my heart towards
Maurice Carlyle; and the God who must soon judge me
will not condemn the pure and sacred love I cherish for the
only man who could ever have been my husband, but whom
I have resolutely refused to see, even when the world believed
you dead. I cannot go to him, and comfort, and provide for
him now; but, in the name of God, and your oath, and if not
for your own sake, at least for his and for mine, I ask you
once more, Evelyn Carlyle, will you hasten to your erring
but unhappy husband?”</p>
<p>Her scarlet cheeks and lips, her glowing brown eyes, and
waving yellow hair, formed a singular contrast to the colorless,
cold face of her listener; whose steely gaze was fixed on
the distant sea, that lay like a beryl mirror beneath the hazy
sky.</p>
<p>When the sound of the sweet but strained voice had died
away, Mrs. Gerome turned her eyes towards the governess,
and answered,—</p>
<p>“I will do my duty, no matter how revolting.”</p>
<p>“Thank God! When will you go?”</p>
<p>“If at all, at once.”</p>
<p>“Evelyn, when you come home, will you not let me see
you, now and then, and win my way back to my old place in
your dear heart? Oh! my pale, peerless darling, do not deny
me this.”</p>
<p>“Home? I have no home. My heart is grayer than my
head,—and your old niche is full of dust, and skeletons, and
murdered hopes. Let me see you no more in this world; and
perhaps in the Everlasting Rest I shall forget my hideous
past, which your face recalls.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my poor bruised darling! do not banish me,” wailed
the governess, endeavoring to fold her arms about the queenly
form, which silently but effectually held her back.</p>
<p>“At least, dear Evelyn, let me kiss you once more, in token
that you cherish no bitterness against me.”</p>
<p>“Good-by, Edith. I hold you innocent of my injuries.
May God help you, and call us both speedily to our dreamless
sleep under moss and marble.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_426"></a>426</span></div>
<p>She bent down, and with firm, icy lips, lightly touched the
forehead of the governess, and walked away, unheeding the
burst of tears with which the frigid caress was welcomed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>
<p>“Madam, are you aware that you breathe an infected atmosphere?—that
this building is assigned to small-pox cases?
Pray do not cross the threshold.”</p>
<p>The superintendent of the hospital laid aside his pipe, and
advanced to meet the stranger whose knock had startled him
from a <i>post-prandial</i> doze.</p>
<p>“I am not afraid of contagion, and came to see the patient
who was brought here yesterday from No. 139 Elm Street.”</p>
<p>“Have you a permit to visit here?”</p>
<p>“Yes; you will find it on this paper, given me by the proper
authorities.”</p>
<p>“What is the name of the person you desire to see?”</p>
<p>The superintendent opened a book that lay on the table
beside him, and drew his finger up and down the page.</p>
<p>“Maurice Carlyle.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes,—I have it now. Maurice Carlyle, Ward 3,—cot
No. 7. Madam, may I ask,—”</p>
<p>“No, sir; I have no inclination to answer idle questions.
Will you show me the way, or shall I find it?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, I will conduct you; but I was about to remark
that a death has just occurred in Ward No. 3, and I am under
the impression that it was the Elm Street case. Madam, you
look faint; shall I bring you a glass of water?”</p>
<p>“No. Show me the body of the dead.”</p>
<p>“This way, if you please.”</p>
<p>He walked down a dim, low-vaulted passage, and paused at
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_427"></a>427</span>
the entrance of a room lined with cots, where the nurse was
slowly passing from patient to patient.</p>
<p>“Nurse, show this lady to cot No. 7.”</p>
<p>Swiftly the tall figure of the visitor glided down the room,
and placing her hand on the arm of the nurse, she said
huskily,—</p>
<p>“Where is the man who has just died? Quick! do not
keep me in suspense.”</p>
<p>“There, to the right; shall I uncover the face?”</p>
<p>Under the blue check coverlet that was spread smoothly
over the cot, the stiff outlines of a human form were clearly
defined; and, when the nurse stooped, the stranger put out
one arm and held him back, while her whole frame trembled
violently.</p>
<p>“Stop! be good enough to leave me.”</p>
<p>The attendant withdrew a few yards, and curiously watched
the queenly woman, who stood motionless, with her fingers
tightly interlaced.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a gray suit of some shining fabric, and
a long gossamer veil of the same hue hung over her features.
After a few seconds she swept back the veil, and, as she bent
forward, a stray sunbeam dipped through the closed shutters,
and flashed across a white horror-stricken face, crowned with
clustering braids of silver hair.</p>
<p>She shut her eyes an instant, grasped the coverlet, and drew
it down; then caught her breath, and looked at the dead.</p>
<p>It was a young, boyish face, horribly swollen and distorted,
and coarse red locks were matted around his brow and temples.</p>
<p>“Thank God, Maurice Carlyle still lives.”</p>
<p>She involuntarily raised her hands towards heaven, and
the expression of dread melted from her countenance.</p>
<p>Slowly and reverently she re-covered the corpse, and approached
the nurse.</p>
<p>“I am searching for my husband. Which cot is No. 7?”</p>
<p>“That on your left,—next to the dead.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlyle turned, and gazed at the bloated crimson mass
of disease that writhed on the narrow bed, and a long shudder
crept over her, as she endeavored to discover in that loathsome
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_428"></a>428</span>
hideous visage some familiar feature—some trace of the
manly beauty that once rendered it so fascinating.</p>
<p>The swollen blood-shot eyes stared vacantly at the ceiling,
and, while delirious muttering fell upon the ears of the visitor,
she saw that his cheeks were somewhat lacerated, and his
hands, partially confined, were tearing at the inflamed flesh.</p>
<p>She shivered with horror, and a groan broke from her pitying
heart.</p>
<p>“What an awful retribution! My God, have mercy upon
him! He is sufficiently punished.”</p>
<p>Drawing her perfumed lace handkerchief from her pocket,
she leaned over and wiped away the bloody foam that oozed
across his lips, and lifting his hot head turned it sufficiently
to expose the right ear, where a large mole was hidden by the
thick hair.</p>
<p>“Maurice Carlyle! But what a fearful wreck?”</p>
<p>She covered her eyes with her hand, and moaned.</p>
<p>The nurse came nearer, and said hesitatingly,—</p>
<p>“Madam, surely he is not your husband? His clothes are
almost in tatters, while yours are—ahem!—”</p>
<p>“Spare me all comments on the comparison. Can I obtain
a comfortable, quiet room, in this building, and have him removed
to it at once? You hesitate? I will compensate you
liberally, will pay almost any price for an apartment where he
can at least have silence and seclusion.”</p>
<p>“We can accommodate you, but of course if the patient is
carried from this ward to a private room, we shall be compelled
to charge extra.”</p>
<p>“Charge what you choose, only arrange the matter as
promptly as possible. How soon can you make the change?”</p>
<p>“In twenty minutes, madam.”</p>
<p>The nurse rang for an assistant, to whom the necessary instructions
were given, and in the <i>interim</i> Mrs. Carlyle leaned
against the cot, and brushed away the flies that buzzed about
the pitiable victims.</p>
<p>Two men carried the sufferer up a flight of steps, and ere
long he was transferred to a large comfortable bed in an airy,
well-furnished apartment.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_429"></a>429</span></div>
<p>The removal had not been completed more than an hour,
when the surgeon made his evening round, and followed the
patient to his new quarters.</p>
<p>He paused at sight of the elegantly dressed woman who sat
beside the bed, and said, stammeringly,—</p>
<p>“I am informed that No. 7 is your husband, and that you
have taken charge of his case, and intend to nurse him. Have
you had small-pox?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Madam, you run a fearful risk.”</p>
<p>“I fully appreciate the hazard, and am prepared to incur
it. Do you regard this case as hopeless?”</p>
<p>“Not altogether, though the probabilities are that it will
terminate fatally.”</p>
<p>“I have had too little experience to warrant my undertaking
the management of the case, and, while I intend to remain
here, I wish you to engage the services of some trustworthy
nurse who understands the treatment of this disease. Can
you recommend such a person?”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam; I can send you a man in whom I have entire
confidence, and fortunately he is not at present employed.
If you desire it, I will see him within the next hour, and give
him all requisite instructions about the patient.”</p>
<p>“Promptness in this matter will greatly oblige me, and I
wish to spare no expense in contributing to the comfort and
restoration of the sufferer. As I am utterly unknown to you,
I prefer to place in your hands a sufficient amount to defray
all incidental expenditures.”</p>
<p>She laid a roll of bills upon the table, and as Dr. Clingman
counted them, she added,—</p>
<p>“It is possible that I may be attacked by this disease,
though I have been repeatedly vaccinated; and if I should die,
please recollect that you will find in my purse a memorandum
of the disposition I wish made of my body,—also the address
of my agent and banker in New York City.”</p>
<p>With mingled curiosity and admiration the physician looked
at the pale, handsome woman, who spoke of death as coldly
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_430"></a>430</span>
and unconcernedly as of to-morrow’s sun, or next month’s
moon.</p>
<p>“Madam, allow me to ask if you have no friends in this
city,—no relatives nearer than New York?”</p>
<p>“None, sir. It is my wish that our conversation should be
confined to the symptoms and treatment of your patient.”</p>
<p>Dr. Clingman bowed, and, after writing minute instructions
upon a sheet of paper left on the mantelpiece, took his
departure.</p>
<p>Securing the door on the inside, Mrs. Carlyle threw aside
her bonnet and wrappings, and came back to the sufferer on
the bed.</p>
<p>Eight years of reckless excess and dissipation had obliterated
every vestige of manly beauty from features that disease
now rendered loathsome, and the curling hair and long beard
were unkempt and grizzled.</p>
<p>Leaning against the pillow, the lonely woman bent over to
scrutinize the distorted, burning face, and softly took into her
cool palms one hot and swollen hand, which in other days
she had admiringly stroked, and tenderly pressed against her
cheek and lips. How totally unlike that countenance, which,
handsome as Apollyon, had looked down at her on her bridal
day, and fondly whispered—“my wife.”</p>
<p>Memory mercilessly broke open sealed chambers in that
wretched woman’s heart, and out of one leaped a wail that
made her tremble and moan,—“Oh, Evelyn, my wife, forgive
your husband.”</p>
<p>Slowly compassion began to bridge the dark gulf of separation
and hate, and as the wife gazed at the writhing form of
her husband, her stony face softened, and tears gathered in
the large, mournful eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah, Maurice! This world has proved a huge cheat to
you and to me,—and well-nigh cost us all peace in the next
one. My husband, yet my bitterest foe,—my first, my last,
my only love! If I could recall one throb of the old affection,
one atom of the old worshipping tenderness and devotion,—but
it has withered; my heart is scorched and ashen,—and
neither love nor hope haunts its desolate ruins. Poor, polluted,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_431"></a>431</span>
down-trodden idol! Maurice—Maurice—my husband,
I have come. Evelyn, your wife, forgives you, as she hopes
for pardon at the hands of her God.”</p>
<p>Kneeling beside the bed, with her snowy fingers clasped
around his, she bowed her head, and humbly prayed for his
soul, and for her own; and, when the petition ended, that
peace which this world can never give,—which had so long
been exiled, fluttered back and brooded once more in her
storm-riven heart.</p>
<p>Softly she lifted and smoothed the long tangled hair
that clung to his forehead, and tears dripped upon his scarlet
face, as she said; brokenly,—</p>
<p>“<i>Till death us do part!</i> Poor Maurice! Deserted and
despised by your former parasites. After long years, my
vows bring me back in the hour of your need. God grant you
life, to redeem your past,—to save your sinful soul from
eternal ruin.”</p>
<p>Suns rose and set, weary days and solemn nights of vigil
succeeded each other, and tirelessly the wife and hired nurse
watched the progress of the dreadful disease. Occasionally
Mr. <ins title="Was Carlye">Carlyle</ins> talked deliriously, and more than once the name
of Edith Dexter hung on his lips, and was coupled with
tenderer terms than were ever bestowed on the woman who
wore his own. Bending over his pillow, the pale watcher
heard and noted all, and a sad pitying smile curved her mouth
now and then, as she realized that the one holy love of this
man’s life triumphed over the wreck of fortune, health, and
hope, and kept its hold upon the heart that long years before
had sold itself to Lucifer.</p>
<p>Sleeplessly, faithfully, she went to and fro in that darkened
room, whose atmosphere was tainted by infection, and
at last she found her reward. The crisis was safely passed,
and she was assured the patient would recover.</p>
<p>The apartment was so dimly lighted that Mr. Carlyle took
little notice of his attendants, but one afternoon when the
nurse had gone to procure some refreshments, the sick man
turned on his pillow, and looked earnestly at the woman who
was engaged in writing at a table near the bed.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Smith.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlyle rose and approached him.</p>
<p>“Are you Mrs. Smith,—my landlady?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. I am merely your nurse.”</p>
<p>“My nurse? What is the matter with me?”</p>
<p>“Small-pox,—but the danger is now over.”</p>
<p>“Small-pox! Where did I catch it? Am I still in Elm
Street?”</p>
<p>“No, sir; you are in the hospital.”</p>
<p>Shading his inflamed eyes with his hand, he mused for some
moments, and she saw a perplexed and sorrowful expression
cross his features.</p>
<p>“Is there any danger of my dying?”</p>
<p>“That danger is past.”</p>
<p>“What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Gerome.”</p>
<p>“Stand a little closer to me. I find I am almost blind.
Mrs. Gerome? Your voice is strangely like one that I have
not heard for many years,—and it carries me back,—back—to—”
He sighed, and pressed his fingers over his eyes.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, he said,—</p>
<p>“Do give me some water. I am as parched as Dives.”</p>
<p>She lifted his head and put the glass to his lips,—and
while he drank, his eyes searched her face, and lingered admiringly
on her beautiful hand.</p>
<p>“Are you a regular nurse at this hospital?”</p>
<p>“I am engaged for your case.”</p>
<p>“I see no pock-marks on your skin; it is as smooth as
ivory. Shall I escape as <ins title="Added quote and question mark">lightly?”</ins></p>
<p>“It is impossible to tell. Here comes your dinner.”</p>
<p>He caught her arm, and gazed earnestly at her.</p>
<p>“Is your hair really so white, or is it merely an illusion
of my inflamed eyes?”</p>
<p>“There is not a dark hair in my head; it is as white as
snow.”</p>
<p>While the nurse prepared the food and arranged it on the
table, Mrs. Carlyle hastily collected several articles scattered
about the apartment, and softly opened the door.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_433"></a>433</span></div>
<p>Standing there a moment, she looked back at the figure
comfortably elevated on pillows, and a long sigh of relief
crossed her lips.</p>
<p>“Thank God! I have done my duty, and now he needs
me no longer. Next time I see your face, Maurice Carlyle,
I hope it will be at the last bar, in the final judgment; and
then may the Lord have mercy upon us both.”</p>
<p>The words were breathed inaudibly, and, closing the door
gently, she hurried down the steps and in the direction of
a small room which Dr. Clingman had converted into an
office.</p>
<p>As she entered, he looked up and pushed back his spectacles.</p>
<p>“What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“A little thing, which will cost you no trouble, but will
greatly oblige me. Doctor, I have found you a kind and
sympathizing gentleman, and am grateful for the delicate
consideration with which you have treated me. Mr. Carlyle
is beyond danger, and I shall leave him in your care. When
he is sufficiently strong to be removed, I desire that you
will give him this letter, which contains a check payable
to his order. There, examine it, and be so good as to write
me a receipt.”</p>
<p>Silently he complied, and when she had re-enclosed the
check and sealed the envelope she placed it in his hand.</p>
<p>“Dr. Clingman, is there any other place to which small-pox
cases can be carried? To-day I have discovered some symptoms
of the disease in my own system, and I feel assured
I shall be ill before this time to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“My dear madam, why not remain here?”</p>
<p>“Because I do not wish to be discovered by Mr. Carlyle,
and forced to meet him again. I prefer to suffer, and, if
need be, die, alone and unknown.”</p>
<p>“If you will trust yourself to me, and to a faithful female
nurse whom I can secure, I promise you, upon my honor
as a gentleman, that I will allow no one else to see you,
living or dead. My dear madam, I beg you to reconsider,
and remain where I can watch over, and perhaps preserve
your life. I dreaded this. You are feverish now.”</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_434"></a>434</span></div>
<p>Wearily she swept her hand across her forehead, and a
dreary smile flitted over her wan features.</p>
<p>“My life is a worthless, melancholy thing, useless to
others, and a crushing burden to me; and I might as well lay
it down here as elsewhere. I accept your promise, Dr.
Clingman, and hope you will obtain a room in the quiet
and secluded portion of the building. If I should be so
fortunate as to die, do not forget the memorandum in this
purse. I leave my body in your care, my soul in the hands
of Him who alone can give it rest.”</p>

</div>
<p>“Miss Dexter, have you succeeded in seeing Mrs. Gerome
since her return?”</p>
<p>“No, sir; she obstinately refuses to admit me, though I
have called twice at the house. Yesterday I received a letter
in answer to several that I have addressed to her, all of which
she returned unopened. Since you have already learned so
much of our melancholy history, why should I hesitate to
acquaint you with the contents of her letter? You know
the object of her journey north, and I will read you the
result.”</p>
<p>The governess drew a letter from her pocket, and Dr.
Grey leaned his face on his hand and listened.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sig3">“<span class="smcap">Solitude</span>, <i>May 10th, 18—</i>.</p>
<p>“<i>Edith</i>,—No lingering vestige of affection, no remorseful
tenderness, prompted that mission from which I have recently
returned, and only the savage scourgings of implacable duty
could have driven me, like a galley-slave, to my hated task.
The victim of a horrible and disfiguring disease which so
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_435"></a>435</span>
completely changed his countenance that his own mother
would scarcely have recognized him,—and the tenant of a
charity hospital in the town of ——, I found that man who
has proved the Upas of your life and of mine. During his
delirium I watched and nursed him—not lovingly (how could
I?) but faithfully, kindly, pityingly. When all danger was
safely passed, and his clouded intellect began to clear itself,
I left him in careful hands, and provided an ample amount
for his comfortable maintenance in coming years. I spared
him the humiliation of recognizing in his nurse his injured
and despised wife; and, as night after night I watched beside
the pitiable wreck of a once handsome, fascinating, and
idolized man, I fully and freely forgave Maurice Carlyle
all the wrongs that so completely stranded my life. To-day
he is well, and probably happy, while he finds himself possessed
of means by which to gratify his extravagant tastes;
but how long his naturally fine constitution can hold at
bay the legion of ills that hunt like hungry wolves along
the track of reckless dissipation, God only knows.</p>
<p>“For some natures it is exceedingly difficult to forgive,—to
forget, impossible; and while my husband’s abject wretchedness
and degradation disarmed the hate that has for so
many years rankled in my heart, I could never again look
willingly upon his face. Edith, you and I have nothing
in common but miserable memories, which, I beg you to believe,
are sufficiently vivid, without the torturing adjunct
of your countenance; therefore, pardon me if I decline to
receive your visits, and return the letters that are quite
as welcome and cheering to my eyes as the little shoes and
garments of the long-buried dead to the mother, who would
fain look no more upon the harrowing relics. I do not
wish to be harsh, but I must be honest, and our intercourse
can never be renewed in this world.</p>
<p>“In bygone days, when I loved you so fondly and trusted
you so fully, it was my intention to share my fortune with
you; and, since I find that you have not forfeited my confidence
in the purity of your purposes, such is still my wish.
I enclose a draft on my banker, which I hope you will deem
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_436"></a>436</span>
sufficient to enable you to abandon the arduous profession
in which you have worn out your life. If I can feel assured
that I have been instrumental in contributing to the peace
and ease of the years that may yet be in store for you, it will
serve as one honeyed drop to sweeten the dregs of the cup
of woe I am draining. Edith, do not refuse the only aid
I can offer you in your loneliness; and accept the earnest
assurance that I shall be grateful for the privilege of promoting
your comfort. Affection and trust I have not, and
a few paltry thousands are all I am now able to bestow. By
the love you once professed, and in the name of that compassion
you should feel for me, I beg of you, despise not
the gift; and let the consciousness that I have saved you
from toil and fatigue quiet the soul and ease the heart of
a lonely woman, who has shaken hands with every earthly
hope. I have done my duty, my conscience is calm and contented,
and I sit wearily on the stormy shore of time, waiting
for the tide that will drift into eternity the desolate, proud
soul of</p>
<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">Vashti Carlyle.</span>”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Tears rolled over the governess’ cheeks, and, refolding the
letter, she said, sorrowfully,—</p>
<p>“My poor, heart-broken Vashti! She has resumed the
name which old Elsie gave her because it was her mother’s;
and how mournfully appropriate it has proved. I could
be happy if permitted to spend the residue of my days with
her; but she decrees otherwise, and I have no alternative but
submission to her imperious will.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey did not lift his face where the shadow of a
great, voiceless grief hung heavily, and his low tone indexed
deep and painful emotion, when he answered,—</p>
<p>“I sincerely deplore her unfortunate decision, for isolation
only augments the ills from which she suffers. Many
months have elapsed since I saw her last, but Robert Maclean
told me to-day that she was sadly changed in appearance,
and seemed in feeble health. She did not tell you that
she had been dangerously ill with varioloid, contracted while
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_437"></a>437</span>
nursing her husband. Although not in the least marked or
disfigured, the attack must have seriously impaired her
constitution, if all that Robert tells me be true. Since her
return, one month ago, she has not left her room.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, exert your influence in my behalf, and prevail
upon her to admit me.”</p>
<p>“Miss Dexter, you ascribe to me powers of persuasion
which, unfortunately, I do not possess; and Mrs. Carlyle’s
decree is beyond the reach of human agency. To the few
who are earnestly interested in her welfare, there remains
but one avenue of aid and comfort,—faithful, fervent prayer.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you are not aware of the exalted estimate she
places on your character, nor of the value she attaches to
your opinions. Of all living beings, she told me she reverenced
and trusted you most; and you, at least, would not
be denied access to her presence.”</p>
<p>She could not see the tremor on his usually firm lips, nor
the pallor that overspread his face, and when he spoke his
grave voice did not betray the tumult in his aching heart.</p>
<p>“I am no longer a visitor at ‘Solitude,’ and shall not see
its mistress unless she requires my professional aid. While
I am very deeply interested in her happiness, I could never
consent to intrude upon her seclusion.”</p>
<p>“I know my days are numbered, and after a little while
I shall sleep well under the ancient cedars that shade the
head-stones of my father and mother; but I could die more
cheerfully, more joyfully, if Evelyn would only be comforted,
and accept some human friendship.”</p>
<p>“For some weeks you have seemed so much better that I
hoped warm weather would quite relieve and invigorate you.
Spend next winter in Cuba or Mexico, and it will probably
add many months, possibly years, to your life.”</p>
<p>She smiled, and shook her head.</p>
<p>“This beautiful springtime has temporarily baffled the
disease, but for me there can be no restoration. Day by
day I feel the ebbing of strength and energy, and the approach
of my deliverer, death; but I realize also, what the
Centaur uttered to Melampus, ‘I decline unto my last days
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_438"></a>438</span>
calm as the setting of the constellations; but I feel myself
perishing and passing quickly away, like a snow-wreath floating
on the stream.’”</p>
<p>As he looked at the thin, pure face where May sunshine
streamed warm and bright, and marked the perfect peace
that brooded over the changed features, Dr. Grey was reminded
of the lines that might have been written for her,
so fully were they suited to her case,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“I saw that one who lost her love in pain,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Who trod on thorns, who drank the loathsome cup;<br>
The lost in night, in day was found again;<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>The fallen was lifted up.<br>
They stood together in the blessed noon,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>They sang together through the length of days;<br>
Each loving face bent sunwards, like a moon<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>New-lit with love and praise.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“My friend, the shadows are passing swiftly from your
life, and, in the mild radiance of its close, you can well afford
to forget the storms that clouded its dawn.”</p>
<p>“Forget? No, Dr. Grey, I neither endeavor nor desire
to forget the sorrows that first taught me the emptiness of
earthly things, the futility of human schemes,—that snapped
the frail reed of flesh to which I clung, and gave me, instead,
the blessed support, the immovable arm of an everlasting
God. Ah! that woman was deeply versed in the heart-lore
of her own sex, who wrote,—</p>

<p class="cg">‘When I remember something which I had,<br>

When I remember this, I mourn,—but yet<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>My happier days are not the days when I forget.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“If Mrs. Carlyle possessed a tithe of your faith and philosophy,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_439"></a>439</span>
how serene, how tranquilly useful her future years
might prove.”</p>
<p>“In God’s own good time her trials will be sanctified to
her eternal peace, and she will one day glide from grief to
glory, for she can claim the promise of our Lord, ‘The pure
in heart shall see God.’ No purer heart than Vashti Carlyle’s
throbs this side of the throne where seraphim and cherubim
hover.”</p>
<p>In the brief silence that succeeded, the governess observed
the unusually grave and melancholy expression of her companion’s
countenance, and asked, timidly,—</p>
<p>“Has anything occurred recently to distress or annoy you?
You look depressed.”</p>
<p>“I feel inexpressibly anxious about Salome, concerning
whose fate I can learn nothing that is comforting. In
reply to my letter, urging him to make every effort to ascertain
her locality and condition, Professor V—— writes, that
he is now a confirmed invalid, confined to his room, and unable
to conduct the search for his missing pupil. She left
Palermo on a small vessel bound for Monaco, and her farewell
note stated that all attempts to discover her retreat
would prove futile, as she was resolved to preserve her incognito,
and wished her friends in America to remain in
ignorance of her mode of life. Professor V—— surmises
that she is in Paris, but gives no good reason for the conjecture,
except that she possibly sought the best medical
advice for the treatment of her throat and recovery of her
voice. His last letter, received yesterday, informed me that
one of Salome’s most devoted admirers, a Bostonian of immense
wealth, was so deeply grieved by her inexplicable disappearance
that he was diligently searching for her in Leghorn
and Monaco. She left Palermo alone, and with a comparatively
empty purse.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, are you aware of the suspicions which Muriel
has long entertained with reference to Mr. Granville’s admiration
of Salome, and the efforts of the latter to encourage his
attentions?”</p>
<p>“I have very cogent reasons for believing that however
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_440"></a>440</span>
amenable to censure Mr. Granville doubtless is, Muriel’s
distrust of Salome is totally unjust. If she were capable
of the despicable course my ward is disposed to impute to
her, I should cease to feel any interest in her career or fate;
but I cherish the conviction that she would scorn to be
guilty of conduct so ignoble. Her defects of character I
shall neither deny nor attempt to palliate, but I trust her true
womanly heart as I trust my own manly honor; and a stern
sense of justice to the absent constrains me to vindicate her
from Muriel’s hasty and unfounded aspersions. So strong
is my faith in Salome’s conscientiousness, so earnest my
friendship for her, that since the receipt of Professor V——’s
letter I have determined to go immediately to Europe, and
if possible discover her retreat. My sister’s adopted child
must not and shall not suffer and struggle among strangers,
while I live to aid and protect her.”</p>
<p>Miss Dexter rose and laid her thin, feverish hand on his
arm, while embarrassment made her voice tremble slightly,—</p>
<p>“I am rejoiced to learn your decision, and God grant
you speedy success in your quest. Do not deem me presumptuous
or impertinent if, prompted by a sincere desire to see
you happy, I venture to say, that he who lightly values the
pure, tender, devoted love of such a woman as Salome Owen,—tramples
on treasures that would make his life affluent
and blessed—that neither gold can purchase nor royalty compel.
Under your guidance, moulded by your influence, she
would become a noble woman,—of whom any man might
justly be proud.”</p>
<p>Fearful that she had already incurred his displeasure, and
unwilling to meet his eye, she turned quickly and made her
escape through the open door.</p>
<p>In the bright glow of that lovely spring day, the calm face
of Ulpian Grey seemed scarcely older than on the afternoon
when he came to make the farm his home; and though paler,
and ciphered over by the leaden finger of anxiety, it indexed
little of the long, fierce strife, that conscience had waged
with heart.</p>
<p>Lighter and more impulsive natures expend themselves
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_441"></a>441</span>
in spasmodic and violent ebullitions, but the great deep of
this man’s serene character had never stirred, until the one
mighty love of his life had lashed it into a tempest that
tossed his hopes like sea-froth, and finally engulfed the only
rosy dream of wedded happiness that had ever flushed his
quiet, solitary, sedate existence.</p>
<p>Having kept his heart in holy subjection to the law of
Christ, he did not quail and surrender when the great temptation
rose, bearing the banner of insurrection; but sternly
and dauntlessly fronted the shock, and kept inviolate the
citadel, garrisoned by an invincible and consecrated will.</p>
<p>The yearning tenderness of his strong, tranquil soul, had
enfolded Mrs. Carlyle, drawing her more and more into
the penetralia of his affection; but from the hour in which
he learned her history he had torn away the clinging tendrils
of love,—had endeavored to expel her from his heart, and
to stifle its wail for the lost idol.</p>
<p>Week after week, month after month, he had driven every
day within sight of the blue smoke that curled above the
trees at “Solitude,” but never even for an instant checked
his horse to gaze longingly towards the Eden whence he had
voluntarily exiled himself.</p>
<p>There were hours when his heart ached for the sight of
that white face he had loved so madly, and the sound of the
mournfully sweet voice,—and his hand trembled at the
recollection of the soft, cold, snowy fingers, that once
thrilled his palms; but he treated these utterances of his
heart as mercilessly as the hunter who cheers his dogs in
the chase where the death-cry of the victim rings above bark
and halloo.</p>
<p>No wall of division, no sea of separation, would have proved
so effectual, so insurmountable, as his own firm resolve that
his earthly path should never cross that of one whom God’s
statutes had set apart until death annulled the decree. In
this torturing ordeal he was strengthened by the conviction
that he alone suffered for his folly,—that Mrs. Carlyle
was a stranger to feelings that robbed him of sleep, and
clouded his days,—that the heaving tide of his devoted love
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_442"></a>442</span>
had broken against her frozen heart as idly as the surges of
the sea that die in foam upon the dreary, mysterious ruins
of the Serapeon at Pozzuoli.</p>
<p>In the silent watches of the night, as he pondered the
brief, beautiful vision that had so completely fascinated
him, he reverently thanked God that the woman he loved
had never reciprocated his affection, and was not sitting in
the ashes of desolation, mourning his absence. Striving
to interest himself more and more in Stanley and Jessie,
who had become inordinately fond of him, his thoughts
continually reverted to Salome, and that subtle sympathy
which springs from the “fellow-being,” that makes us “wondrous
kind” to those whose pangs are fierce as ours, began
faintly and shyly, but surely, to assert itself. A shadowy,
intangible self-reproach brooded like a phantom over his
generous heart, when, amidst the uncertainty that seemed
to overhang the orphan’s fate, he remembered the numberless
manifestations of almost idolatrous affection which he
had coldly repulsed.</p>
<p>In the earnest interest that day by day deepened in the
absent girl, there was no pitiable vanity, no inflated self-love,
but a stern realization of the anguish and humiliation
that must now be her portion, and a magnanimous
eagerness to endeavor to cheer a heart whose severest woes
had sprung from his indifference.</p>
<p>More than a year had elapsed, and no letter had ever
reached him,—not even a message in her two brief epistles
to Stanley, and Dr. Grey missed the bright, perverse element
that no longer thwarted him at every turn.</p>
<p>He longed to see the proud, girlish face, with its flashing
eyes, and red lips, and the haughty toss of the large, handsome
head; and the angry tones of her voice would have been
welcome sounds in the house where she had so long tyrannized.
To-day, as Ulpian Grey sat in his own little sitting-room,
his eyes were fixed on a copy of Rembrandt’s <i>Nicholas
Tulp</i>, which hung over the mantelpiece; but the mysteries
of anatomy no longer riveted his attention, and his thoughts
were busy with memories of a fond though wayward girl,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_443"></a>443</span>
whom his indifference had driven to foreign lands,—to unknown
and fearful perils.</p>
<p>Through the windows stole the breath of Salome’s violets,
and the sweet, spicy odor of the Belgian honeysuckle that
she had planted and twined around the mossy columns that
supported the gallery; and with a sigh he closed his eyes, shut
out the anatomy of flesh, and began the dissection of emotions.</p>
<p>Could Salome’s radiant face brighten his home, and win his
heart from its devouring regret? Would it be possible for
him to give her the place whence he had ejected Mrs. Carlyle?
Could he ever persuade himself to call that fair, passionate
young thing, that capricious, obstinate, maliciously perverse
girl,—his wife?</p>
<p>Involuntarily he frowned, for while pity pleaded for the
refugee from home and happiness, the man’s honest nature
scouted all shams, and he acknowledged to himself that
he could never feel the need of her lips or hands,—could
never insult her womanhood, or degrade his own nature, by
folding to his heart one whose touch possessed no magnetism,
whose presence exerted no spell over his home.</p>
<p>Salome, his friend, his adopted sister, he wished to discover,
to claim, and restore to the household; but Salome,
his wife,—was a monstrous imaginary incubus that appalled
and repelled him.</p>
<p>The difficulties that presented themselves at the outset of
his search would have discouraged a less resolute temperament,
but it was part of his wise philosophy, that—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“We overstate the ills of life. We walk upon<br>
The shadow of hills across a level thrown,<br>
And pant like climbers.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As a pitying older brother, he thought of Salome’s many
foibles,—of her noble intentions and ignoble executions,—of
her few feeble triumphs, her numerous egregious failures
in the line of duty; and loving Christian charity pleaded
eloquently for her, whispering to his generous soul, “We
know the ships that come with streaming pennons into the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_444"></a>444</span>
immortal ports; but we know little of the ships that have
taken fire on the way thither,—that have gone down at sea.”</p>
<p>What pure friendship could accomplish he would not withhold,
and life at the farm was not so attractive now that he
felt regret at the prospect of temporary absence.</p>
<p>The disappointment that had so rudely smitten to the
earth the one precious hope born of his acquaintance with
“Solitude,” had no power to embitter his nature,—to drape
the world in drab, or to shroud the future with gloom; and
though his noble face was sadder and paler, Christian faith
and resignation rang blessed chimes of peace in heart and
soul, and made his life a hallowed labor of love for the
needy and grief-stricken. To-day, as he sat alone at the south
window, he could overlook the fields of “Grassmere,” where
the rich promise of golden harvest “filled in all beauty and
fulness the emerald cup of the hills,” and the waving grain
rippled in light and shade like the billows of some distant
sunset sea. Basking in the balmy sunshine, and contemplating
his approaching departure for Europe, a sudden longing
seized him to look once more on the face of Vashti
Carlyle, before he bade farewell to his home.</p>
<p>She was in feeble health, and might not survive his absence,
and, moreover, what harm could result from one final
visit to “Solitude,”—from a few parting words to its desolate
mistress? She had sent a message through Robert, that
she would be glad to see Dr. Grey whenever he could find
leisure to call, and now hungry heart and soul cried out
savagely,—</p>
<p>“Why not? Why not?”</p>
<p>His heavy brows knitted a little, and his mouth grew rigid
as iron, but after some moments the lips relaxed, and with
a sad, patient smile, he repeated those stirring words of
Richter to Herman,—“Suffer like a man the Alp-pressure
of fate. Trust yourself upon the broad, shining wings of
your <i>faith</i>, and make them bear you over the Dead Sea, so
as not to fall spiritually dead within.”</p>
<p>“No, no, Ulpian Grey,—keep yourself ‘unspotted from
the world.’ Strangle that one temptation which borrows
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_445"></a>445</span>
the garments of an angel of light and mercy, and dogs you,
sleeping and waking. I will see her no more till death snaps
her fetters, and I can meet her in the presence of God, who
alone can know what separation costs me. May He grant
her strength to bear her lonely lot, and give me grace to be
patient even unto the end, bringing no reproach on the
sacred faith I profess.”</p>
<p>It was the final struggle between love and duty, and though
the vanquished heart wailed piteously, exultant conscience,
like Jupiter of old, triumphantly applauded, “Evan, evoe!”</p>

<p>“Wanted!—Information of Salome Owen, who will confer
a favor on her friends, and secure a handsome legacy by
calling at No. — ——.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, for six months this advertisement has appeared
every morning in two of the most popular journals in
Paris, and as it has elicited no clew to her whereabouts, I
am reluctantly compelled to believe that she is no longer
in France.”</p>
<p><ins title="Removed quote">Mr.</ins> Granville refolded the newspaper, and busied himself
in filling and lighting his meerschaum.</p>
<p>“By whom was that notice inserted?”</p>
<p>“By M. de Baillu, the agent and banker of Mr. Minge
of Boston, who was warmly and sincerely attached to your
<i>protégée</i>, and earnestly endeavored to marry her. When she
left Palermo, Mr. Minge came to this city and solicited my
aid in discovering her retreat.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, but why did he apply to you?”</p>
<p>“Simply because he knew that I was an old acquaintance,
and he had seen me with her, when she first came from
America.”</p>
<p>“How did you ascertain her presence in Paris?”</p>
<p>“Accidentally; one night, at the opera, whither she accompanied
Professor V——, I recognized her, and of course
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_446"></a>446</span>
made myself known. To what shall I ascribe the honor of
this rigid cross-questioning?”</p>
<p>“To reasons which I shall very freely give you. But
first, permit me to beg that you will resume your narrative
at the point where I interrupted you. I wish to learn all
that can be told concerning Mr. Minge.”</p>
<p>“He was an elderly man of ordinary appearance, but extraordinary
fortune, and seemed completely fascinated by Salome’s
beauty. He offered a large reward to the police for
any clew that would enable him to discover her, and finally
found the physician whom she had consulted with reference
to some disease of the throat, which occasioned the loss of
her voice. He had prescribed for her several times, but
knew nothing of her lodging-place, as she always called at
his office; and finally, without assigning any reason, her
visits ceased. Mr. Minge redoubled his exertions, and at
last found her in one of the hospitals connected with a convent.
The Sisters of Charity informed him that one bleak
day when the rain was falling drearily, they chanced to see
a woman stagger and drop on the pavement before their
door, and, hurrying to her assistance, discovered that she
had swooned from exhaustion. A bundle of unfinished needlework
was hidden under her shawl, and they soon ascertained
that she was delirious from some low typhus fever that had
utterly prostrated her. For several weeks she was dangerously
ill, and was just able to sit up when Mr. Minge discovered
her. He told me that it was distressing and painful
beyond expression to witness her humiliation, her wounded
pride, her defiant rejection of his renewed offer of marriage.
One day he took his sister Constance and a minister of the
gospel to the hospital, and implored Salome to become his
wife, then and there. He said she wept bitterly, and thanked
him, thanked his sister also, but solemnly assured him she
could never marry any one,—she would sooner starve in
the—”</p>
<p><ins title="Removed quote">Dr.</ins> Grey raised his hand, signalling for silence, and for
some moments he leaned his forehead against the chair
directly in front of him.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_447"></a>447</span></div>
<p>Mr. Granville cleared his throat several times, and loosened
his neck-tie, which seemed to impede his breathing.</p>
<p>“Shall I go on? There is little more to tell.”</p>
<p>“If you please, Granville.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Minge would not abandon the hope of finally persuading
her to accept his hand, but next day when he called
to inquire about her health, and to request the sisters to
watch her movements, and prevent her escape, he was shocked
to learn that she had disappeared the previous night, leaving
a few lines written in pencil on a handkerchief, in which
she had wrapped her superb suit of hair. They were addressed
to the Sisters of Charity, and briefly expressed her
gratitude for their kindness in providing for her wants, while
she assured them that as soon as possible she would return
and compensate them for their services in her behalf. Meantime,
knowing the high price of hair, she had carefully cut
off her own, which was unusually long and thick, and tendered
it in part payment. When she was taken into the building,
her nurse found concealed in her dress a very elegant watch,
bearing her name in diamond letters, and she requested that
the sisters would hold it in pawn, until she was able to
redeem it. During her illness, it had been locked up, and
they supposed she left it, fearing that an application for
it would arouse suspicions of her intended flight. Mr. Minge
bought the hair and handkerchief, and, after a liberal remuneration
for their care of the invalid, he took charge of the
watch, and left his address to be given her when she called
for her property. That her mind had become seriously
impaired, there can be little doubt, since nothing but insanity
can explain her refusal to accept one of the handsomest
estates in America. Unfortunately, a few days subsequent
to her departure from the hospital, Mr. Minge was taken
very violently ill with pneumonia, and died. Conscious of
his condition, he prepared a codicil to his will, and bequeathed
to Salome twenty-five thousand dollars, and an
elegant house and lot in New York City. He exacted from
his sister a solemn promise that she would leave no means
untried to ferret out the wanderer, to whom he was so devotedly
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_448"></a>448</span>
attached; and, should all efforts fail, at the expiration
of five years the legacy should revert to the hospital
which had sheltered her in the hour of her destitution. The
watch he left with his sister Constance; the hair, he ordered
buried with him. Three months have elapsed, and no tidings
have reached Miss Minge, who remains in Paris for the purpose
of complying with her brother’s dying request.”</p>
<p>“My poor, perverse Salome! To what desperate extremities
has she been reduced by her unfortunate wilfulness.
Gerard, will you tell me frankly your own conjecture concerning
her fate?”</p>
<p>“If alive, I believe she has left Europe.”</p>
<p>“Upon what do you base your supposition?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Minge was convinced that her attachment to some
one in America was the insurmountable barrier to his success
as a suitor; and, if so, she probably returned to her
native land. Dr. Grey, I will speak candidly to you of a
matter which has doubtless given you some disquiet. Muriel
informs me that you have no confidence in the sincerity of
my attachment to her, and that upon that fact is founded
your refusal to allow the consummation of our engagement,
so long as she continues your ward. I confess I am not
free from censure, but, while I have acted weakly, I am not
devoid of principle. Sir, I was strangely and powerfully attracted
to Salome Owen, and she exerted a species of fascination
over me which I scarcely endeavored to resist. In an
evil hour, infatuated by her face and her marvellous voice,
I was wild enough to offer her my hand, and resolved to ask
Muriel to release me. Dr. Grey, even at my own expense,
I wish to exonerate Salome, who never for an instant, by
word or look, encouraged my madness. She repulsed my
advances, refused every attention, and when I rashly uttered
words, which, I admit, were treasonable to Muriel, she almost
overwhelmed me with her fiery contempt and indignation,—threatening
to acquaint Muriel with my inconstancy,
and appealing to my honor as a gentleman to keep inviolate
my betrothal vows. Dr. Grey, if my heart temporarily wandered
from its allegiance to your ward, it was not Salome’s
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_449"></a>449</span>
fault, for in every respect her conduct towards me was that
of a noble, unselfish woman, who scorned to gratify her vanity
at the expense of another’s happiness. She shamed me out
of my folly, and her stern honesty and nobility saved me
from a brief and humiliating career of dishonorable duplicity.
Whether living or dead, I owe this tribute to the pure
character of Salome Owen.”</p>
<p>“Thank Heaven! I had faith in her. I believed her too
generous to stoop to a flirtation with the lover of her friend;
and, deplorable as was your own weakness, I am rejoiced,
Gerard, to find that you have conquered it. Tell Muriel
all that you have confided to me, and in her hands we will
leave the decision.”</p>
<p>“Do you intend to prosecute the search which has proved
so fruitless?”</p>
<p>“I do. She has not returned to America,—she is here
somewhere; and, living or dead, I must and will find her.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey seemed lost in perplexing thought for some time,
then drew a sheet of paper before him, and wrote, “Ulpian
Grey wishes to see Salome Owen, in order to communicate
some facts which will induce her return to her family; and
he hopes she will call immediately at No. Rue ——.”</p>
<p>“Gerard, please be so good as to have this inserted in all
the leading journals in the city; and give me the address
of Mr. Minge’s agent.”</p>
<p>At the expiration of a month, spent in the most diligent
yet unsuccessful efforts to obtain some information of the
wanderer, Dr. Grey began to feel discouraged,—to yield to
melancholy forebodings that an untimely death had ended
her struggles and suffering.</p>
<p>Once, while pacing the walks in the Champs-Elysées, he
caught a glimpse of a face that recalled Salome’s, and started
eagerly forward; but it proved that of a Parisian <i>bonne</i>, who
was romping with her juvenile charge.</p>
<p>Again, one afternoon, as he came out of the Church of St.
Sulpice, his heart bounded at sight of a woman who leaned
against the railing, and watched the play of the fountain.
When he approached her and peered eagerly into her countenance,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_450"></a>450</span>
blue eyes and yellow curls mocked his hopes. One
morning, while he walked slowly along the <i>Rue du Faubourg
St. Honoré</i>, his attention was attracted by the glitter of
pretty baubles in the <i>Maison de la Pensée</i>, and he entered
the establishment to purchase something for Jessie.</p>
<p>While waiting for his parcel, a woman came out of a rear
apartment and passed into the street, and, almost snatching
his package from the counter, he followed.</p>
<p>A few yards in advance was a graceful but thin figure,
clad in a violet-colored muslin, with a rather dingy silk
scarf wound around her shoulders. A straw hat, with a
wreath of faded pink roses, drooped over her face, and streamers
of black lace hung behind, while over the whole she had
thrown a thin gray veil.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey had not seen a feature, but the <i>pose</i> of the shoulders,
the haughty poise of the head, the quick, nervous, elastic
step, and, above all, the peculiar, free, childish swinging of
the left arm, made his despondent heart throb with renewed
hope.</p>
<p>Keeping sufficiently near not to lose sight of her, he walked
on and on, down cross streets, up narrow alleys, towards a
quarter of the city with which he was unacquainted. The
woman never looked back, rarely turned her head, even to
glance at those who passed her, and only once she paused
before a flower-stall, and seemed to price a bunch of carnations,
which she smelled, laid down again, and then hurried
on.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey quickly paid for the cluster, and hastened after
her.</p>
<p>In turning a corner, she dropped a small parcel that she
had carried under her scarf, and as she stooped to pick it up,
her veil floated off. She caught it ere it reached the ground,
and when she raised her hands to spread it over her hat, the
loose open sleeves of her dress slipped back, and there, on
the left arm, was a long, zigzag scar, like a serpentine bracelet.</p>
<p>With great difficulty Dr. Grey stifled a cry of joy, and
waited until she had gained some yards in advance.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_451"></a>451</span></div>
<p>The woman was so absorbed in reverie that she did not
notice the steady tramp of her pursuer, but as the number
of persons on the street gradually diminished, he prudently
fell back, fearing lest her suspicion should be excited.</p>
<p>At a sudden bend in the crooked alley which she rapidly
threaded, he lost sight of her, and, running a few yards, he
turned the angle just in time to see the flutter of her dress
and scarf, as she disappeared through a postern, that opened
in a crumbling brick wall.</p>
<p>Above the gate a battered tin sign swung in the wind, and
dim letters, almost effaced by elemental warfare, announced,
“<i>Adèle Aubin, Blanchisseuse</i>.”</p>
<p>Dr. Grey passed through the postern, and found himself in
a narrow, dark court, near a tall, dingy, dilapidated house,
where a girl ten years of age sat playing with two ragged, untidy
children.</p>
<p>It was a dreary, comfortless, uninviting place, and a greenish
slime overspread the lower portions of the wall, and
coated the uneven pavement.</p>
<p>From the girl, who chatted with genuine French volubility
and freedom, Dr. Grey learned that her father was an attaché
of a barber-shop, and her mother a washer and renovater
of laces and embroideries. The latter was absent, and, in
answer to his inquiries, the child informed him that an
upper room in this cheerless building was occupied by a
young female lodger, who held no intercourse with its other
inmates.</p>
<p>Placing a five-franc piece in her hand, the visitor asked the
name of the lodger, but the girl replied that she was known
to them only as “<i>La Dentellière</i>,” and lived quite alone in
the right-hand room at the top of the third flight of stairs.</p>
<p>The parley had already occupied twenty minutes, when Dr.
Grey cut it short by mounting the narrow, winding steps.
The atmosphere was close, and redolent of the fumes of dishes
not so popular in America as in France, and he saw that the
different doors of this old tenement were rented to lodgers who
cooked, ate, and slept in the same apartment. At the top of
the last dim flight of steps, Dr. Grey paused, almost out of
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_452"></a>452</span>
breath; and found himself on a narrow landing-place, fronting
two attic rooms. The one on the right was closed, but
as he softly took the bolt in his hand and turned it, there
floated through the key-hole the low subdued sound of a
sweet voice, humming “<i>Infelice</i>.”</p>
<p>It was not the deep, rich, melting voice, that had arrested
his drive when first he heard it on the beach, but a plaintive,
thrilling echo, full of pathos, yet lacking power; like the notes
of birds when moulting-season ends, and the warblers essay
their old strains. Cautiously he opened the door wide enough
to permit him to observe what passed within.</p>
<p>The room was large, low, and irregularly shaped, with
neither fire-place nor stove, and only one dormer window
opening to the south, and upon a wide waste of tiled roofs
and smoking chimneys. The floor was bare, except a strip
of faded carpet stretched in front of a small single bedstead;
and the additional furniture consisted of two chairs, a tall
table where hung a mirror, and a washstand that held beside
bowl and pitcher a candlestick and china cup. On the
table were several books, a plate and knife, and a partially
opened package disclosed a loaf of bread, some cheese, and an
apple.</p>
<p>In front of the window a piece of plank had been rudely
fastened, and here stood two wooden boxes containing a few
violets, mignonette, and one very luxuriant rose-geranium.</p>
<p>The faded blue cambric curtain was twisted into a knot,
and as it was now nearly noon, the sun shone in and made
a patch of gold on the stained and dusky floor.</p>
<p>On the bed lay the straw hat, garlanded with roses that had
lost their primitive tints, and before the window in a low
chair sat the lonely lodger.</p>
<p>On her knees rested a cushion, across which was stretched
a parchment pattern bristling with pins, and with bobbins
she was swiftly knitting a piece of gossamer lace, by throwing
the fine threads around the pins.</p>
<p>Over the floor floated her delicate lilac dress, and the sleeves
were looped back to escape the forest of pins.</p>
<p>Dr. Grey had only a three-quarter view of the face that
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_453"></a>453</span>
bent over the cushion, and though it was sadly altered in
every lineament,—was whiter and thinner than he had ever
seen it,—yet it was impossible to mistake the emaciated
features of Salome Owen.</p>
<p>The large, handsome head, had been shorn of its crown of
glossy braids that once encircled it like a jet tiara, and the
short locks clustered with childlike grace and beauty around
the gleaming white brow and temples.</p>
<p>There was not a vestige of color in the whilom scarlet
mouth, whose thin lines were now scarcely perceptible; and,
in the finer oval of her cheeks, and along the polished chin,
the purplish veins showed their delicate tracery. The hands
were waxen and almost transparent, and the figure was wasted
beyond the boundaries of symmetry.</p>
<p>In the knot of ribbon that fastened her narrow linen collar,
she had arranged a sprig of mignonette, that now dropped
upon the cushion as she bent over it. She paused, brushed it
off, and for a few seconds her beautiful hazel eyes were fixed
on the blue sky that bordered her window.</p>
<p>The whole expression of her countenance had changed, and
the passionate defiance of other days had given place to a sad,
patient hopelessness, touching indeed, when seen on her proud
features. Slowly she threw her bobbins, and a fragment of
“<i>Infelice</i>” seemed to drift across her trembling lips, that
showed some lines of bitterness in their time-chiselling.</p>
<p>As Dr. Grey watched her, tears which he could not restrain
trickled down his face, and he was starting forward, when she
said, as if communing with her own desolate soul,—</p>
<p>“I wonder if I am growing superstitious. Last night I
dreamed incessantly of Jessie and home, and to-day I cannot
help thinking that something has happened there. Home!
When people no longer have a home, how hard it is to forget
that blessed home which sheltered them in the early years.
Homeless! that is the dreariest word that human misery ever
conjectured or human language clothed. Never mind, Salome
Owen, when God snatched your voice from you, He became
responsible; and your claims are like the ravens and sparrows,
and He must provide. After all, it matters little where
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_454"></a>454</span>
we are housed here in the clay, and Hobbs was astute when he
selected for the epitaph on his tombstone, ‘This is the true
philosopher’s stone.’ Home! Ah, if I sadly missed my
heart’s home, here in the flesh, I shall surely find it up yonder
in the blessed land of blue.”</p>
<p>A tear glided down her cheek, glistened an instant on her
chin, and fell on her pattern. She brushed it away, and
smiled sorrowfully,—</p>
<p>“It is ill-omened to sprinkle bridal lace with tears. Some
day this fine web will droop around a bride’s white shoulders
and after a time it may serve to deck the cold limbs of some
dead child. If I could only have my shroud now, I would not
make lace a <i>desideratum</i>; serge or sackcloth would be welcome.
Patience,—</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>She partially rose in her chair, and took from the table a
volume of poems. After some search, she found the desired
passage, and, rocking herself to and fro, she read it aloud in
a low, measured tone,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“O dreary life! we cry, ‘O dreary life!’<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_455"></a>455</span></div>
<p>The book slipped from her fingers and fell upon the floor,
and with a sob the girl bowed her head in her hands.</p>
<p>Quickly the intruder glided unseen into the room, and stood
at the back of her chair.</p>
<p>He knew she was praying, and almost <ins title="Was breathessly">breathlessly</ins> waited
several minutes.</p>
<p>At last she raised her face, and while tears trembled on
her lashes, she said meekly,—</p>
<p>“I ought not to complain and repine. I will be patient
and trust God; for I can afford to suffer all through time,
provided I may spend eternity with Christ and Dr. Grey.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Salome! Thank God, we shall be separated neither
in time nor in eternity! Dear wanderer, come back to your
brother!”</p>
<p>He stepped before her, and involuntarily held out his arms.</p>
<p>She neither screamed nor fainted, but sprang to her feet,
and a rapture that beggars all description irradiated her
worn, weary, pallid face.</p>
<p>“Is it really you? Oh! a thousand times I have dreamed
that I saw you,—stood by you; but when I tried to touch
you, there was nothing but empty air! Oh, Dr. Grey!—my
Dr. Grey! Am I only dreaming, here in the sunshine, or is
it you bodily? Did you care for me a <i>little</i>? Did you come
to find <i>me</i>?”</p>
<p>She grasped his arm, swept her hands up and down his
sleeve, and then he saw her reel, and shut her eyes, and shudder.</p>
<p>“My poor child, I came to Paris solely to hunt for my
wayward Salome, and, thank God! I have found her.”</p>
<p>He put his arm around her, and placed her head against
his shoulder.</p>
<p>Ah, how his generous heart ached, as he noted the hungry
delight with which her splendid eyes lingered on his features,
and the convulsive tenacity with which she clung to him,
trembling with excess of joy that brought back carmine to her
wasted lips and carnation bloom to her blanched cheeks.</p>
<p>He heard her whispering, and knew it was a prayer of
thanksgiving for the blessing of his presence.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_456"></a>456</span></div>
<p>But very soon a change came over her sparkling, happy face,
like an inky cloud across a noon sky, and he felt a shiver stealing
through her form.</p>
<p>“Let me go! You said once, that when I came to Europe
to enter on my professional career, you wished never to touch
my hands again,—you would consider them polluted.”</p>
<p>“Dear Salome, I recant all those harsh, unjust words,
which were uttered when I was not fully aware of the latent
strength of your character. Since then, I have learned much
from Professor V——, and from Gerard Granville, that assures
me my noble friend is all I could desire her,—that she
has grandly conquered her faults, and is worthy of the admiration,
the perfect confidence, the earnest affection, which
her adopted brother offers her. Your pure, true heart makes
pure hands, and as such I reverently salute them.”</p>
<p>He took her hands, raised and kissed them respectfully,
tenderly.</p>
<p>She hid her burning face on his bosom, and there was a
short pause.</p>
<p>“Salome, sit down and let me talk to you of home,—your
home. Have you no questions to ask about your pet sister
and brother?”</p>
<p>He attempted to release himself, but she clung to him, and
clasping her arms around his neck, said in a strained, husky
tone,—</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, did you bring your—your wife to Paris?”</p>
<p>“I have no wife.”</p>
<p>She uttered a thrilling cry of delight, threw her head back,
and gazed steadily into his clear, calm, blue eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, sir, they told me you had married Mrs. Gerome.”</p>
<p>He placed her in the chair, and kneeling down beside her,
took her quivering face in his palms and touched her forehead
softly with his lips.</p>
<p>“The only woman I ever wished to make my wife is bound
for life to a worthless husband. Salome, I loved her before I
knew this fact; and, since I learned (soon after your departure)
that she was separated from the man whom she had
wedded, I have not seen her, although she still resides at
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_457"></a>457</span>
‘Solitude.’ Salome, I shall never marry, and I ask you now
to come back to Jessie and Stanley, who will soon require
your care and guidance, for it is my intention to return to
the position in the U.S. naval service, which only Janet’s
feeble health induced me to resign. God bless you, dear child!
I wish you were indeed my own sister, for I am growing very
proud of my brave, honest friend,—my patient lace-weaver.”</p>
<p>The girl’s head sank lower and lower until it touched her
knees, and sobs rendered her words scarcely audible.</p>
<p>“If you deem me worthy to be called your friend, it is because
of your example, your influence. Oh, Dr. Grey,—but
for you,—but for my hope of meeting you in the kingdom
of Christ, I shudder to think what I might have been! Under
all circumstances I have been guided by what I imagined
would have been your wishes,—your advice; and my reward is
rich indeed! Your confidence, your approbation! Earth
holds no recompense half so precious.”</p>
<p>“Thank God! my prayers have been abundantly answered,
my highest hopes of your future fully realized. Henceforth,
let us with renewed energy labor faithfully in the vast, whitening
fields of Him who declares, ‘The harvest is plentiful, but
the laborers are few.’”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>“SAD CASE OF MANIA A POTU.”</h3>
</div>
<p>“Watchman McDonough reports that late last night, he
picked up, on the sidewalk, the insensible body of Maurice
Carlyle, who showed some signs of returning animation after
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_458"></a>458</span>
his removal to Station House No. ——. A physician was
called in, and every effort made to save the unfortunate victim
of intemperance; but medical skill was inadequate to arrest
the work of many years of excess, and before daylight the
wretched man expired in dreadful convulsions. Coroner
Boutwell held an inquest on the body, and the verdict rendered
was ‘Death from <i>mania a potu</i>.’ Mr. Carlyle was well
known in this city, where for many years he was an ornament
to society, and a general favorite in the fashionable and
mercantile circle in which he moved. Of numbers who were
once the recipients of his bounty and hospitality, none offered
succor in the hour of adversity, and among all his former
friends none were found to cheer or pity in the last ordeal to
which flesh is subjected. The melancholy fate of Maurice
Carlyle furnishes another illustration of the mournful truth
that the wages of intemperance are destitution and desertion.”</p>
<p>Such was the startling announcement, which, under the
head of “Police Report,” Dr. Grey read and re-read in a
prominent New York paper that had accidentally remained
for some days unopened on his desk, and was dated nearly
a month previous. Locking the door of his office, he sat
down to collect his bewildered thoughts, and to quiet the tumult
in his throbbing heart.</p>
<p>During the two years that had drearily worn away since
his last interview with Mrs. Carlyle, he had sternly forbidden
his mind to dwell on its brief dream of happiness, and by
a life of unusually active benevolence endeavored to forget
the one episode which alone had power to disquiet and sadden
him.</p>
<p>He had philosophically schooled himself to the calm, unmurmuring
acceptance of his lonely destiny, and looked forward
to a life solitary yet not unhappy, although uncheered
by the love and companionship which every man indulges the
instinctive hope will sooner or later crown his existence.</p>
<p>Now heart and conscience, so long at deadly feud, suddenly
signalled a truce, clasped hands, embraced cordially. How
radiant the world looked,—with what wondrous glory the
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_459"></a>459</span>
future had in the twinkling of an eye robed itself. The
woman he had loved was stainless and free, and how could
she long resist the pleadings of his famished heart?</p>
<p>He would win her from cynicism and isolation, would melt
her frozen nature in the genial atmosphere of his pure and
constant affection, and interweave her aimless, sombre life
with the busy, silvery web of his own.</p>
<p>After forty years, God would grant him home, and wife,
and hearthstone peace.</p>
<p>What a flush and sparkle stole to this grave man’s olive
cheek, and calm, deep blue eyes!</p>
<p>Ah! how hungrily he longed for the touch of her hand, the
sight of her face; and, snatching his hat, he put the paper in
his pocket, and hurried towards “Solitude.”</p>
<p>In the holy hush of that hazy autumnal afternoon, nature—<i>Magna
Mater</i>,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“The altar-curtains of whose hills<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Are sunset’s purple air,”<br>
“Who dips in the dim light of setting suns<br>
The spacious skirts of that vast robe of hers<br>
That widens ever in the wondrous west,”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>seemed slumbering and dreaming away the day.</p>
<p>The forests were gaudy in their painted shrouds of scarlet
and yellow leaves, and long, feathery flakes of purple bloom
nodded over crimson berries, emerald mosses, and golden-hearted
asters.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks previous, Dr. Grey had driven along that
road, and, while the echo of harvest <ins title="Was hmyns">hymns</ins> rang on the hay-scented
air, had asked himself how men and women could
become so completely absorbed in temporal things, ignoring
the solemn and indisputable fact of the brevity of human life
and the restricted dominion of man,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Whose part in all the pomp that fills<br>
The circuit of the summer hills<br>
Is, that his grave is green.”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_460"></a>460</span></div>
<p>But to-day all sober-hued reflections were exorcised by the
rapturous <i>Jubilate</i> that hope was singing through the sunlit
chambers of his happy heart; and when he entered the grounds
of “Solitude” they seemed bathed in that soft glamour, that
witching “light that never was on sea or land.”</p>
<p>As he sprang from his buggy and opened the little gate
leading into the <i>parterre</i>, Robert came slowly forward, bearing
a basket filled with a portion of the crimson apples that
flushed the orchard, just beyond the low hedge.</p>
<p>“You could not have chosen a better time to come, Dr.
Grey; and if I were allowed to have my way you would have
been here last night. Were you sent for at last, or was it a
lucky chance that brought you?”</p>
<p>“Merely an accident, as I received no summons. Robert,
how is your mistress?”</p>
<p>“God only knows, sir; I am sure I never can tell how she
really is. She has not seemed well since she took that journey
to the North, and for two weeks past she appears to have been
slipping down by inches into her grave. She neither eats nor
sleeps, and for the last three nights has not lain down,—so
old Ruth, the housekeeper, tells me. Yesterday I begged my
mistress to let me go for you, but she smiled that awful freezing
smile that strikes to the very marrow of my bones, worse
than December sleet,—and raised her finger so: and said, ‘At
your peril, Robert. Mind your orchard, man, and I will take
care of myself. I want neither doctors nor nurses, and only
desire that you, and Ruth, and Anna, will attend to your
respective duties and let me be quiet. All will soon be well
with me.’ I killed a partridge, had it nicely broiled, and carried
it to her; and she thanked me, and made a pretence of
eating the wing, just to please me; but when the waiter was
taken away to the kitchen, I found all the bird on the plate.
This morning, just before daylight, I heard her playing a
wild, mournful thing on the piano, that sounded like a dirge
or a wail; and Ruth says when she went into the parlor to
open the blinds, she found her praying, and thinks she was
on her knees for an hour. Please God! sometimes I wish she
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_461"></a>461</span>
was in heaven with my mother, for she will never see any
peace in this life.”</p>
<p>“What seems to be the disease?”</p>
<p>“Heart-ache.”</p>
<p>“You should have come and told me this long ago.”</p>
<p>“And pray to what purpose, Dr. Grey? She vowed she
would allow no human being to cross her threshold, except
the servants, and I would sooner undertake to curl a steel, or
make ringlets out of a pair of tongs, than bend her will when
once she takes a stand. Humph! My mistress is no willow
wand, and is about as easily moved as the church-steeple, or
the stone-tower of the lighthouse.”</p>
<p>“Has she recently received letters that contained tidings
which excited or distressed her?”</p>
<p>“A letter came last week, but I know nothing of its contents.
You need not go into the house if you wish to find her,
for about an hour and a half ago I saw her come out into the
grounds, and she never goes in till the lamps are lighted.”</p>
<p>An anxious look clouded for an instant Dr. Grey’s countenance,
but undaunted hope sang on of the hours of hallowed
communion that the future held, while in her invalid condition
he assumed the care and guardianship of his beloved;
and, turning into the lawn, he eagerly searched the winding
walks for some trace of her, some flutter of her garments,
some faint, subtle odor of orange-flowers or tube-roses.</p>
<p>Here and there clusters of purple, pink, and orange crysanthemums
flecked the lawn with color; and a flower-stand,
covered with china jars that held geraniums, seemed almost a
pyramid of flame, from the profusion of scarlet blooms.</p>
<p>The sun had gone down behind a waving line of low hills,
where,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Thinned to amber, rimmed with silver,<br>
<span class="indent2"> </span>Clouds in the distance dwell,<br>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_462"></a>462</span></div>
<p>Still as crystal was the sapphire sea that mirrored that
quiet, sapphire sky, and not a murmur, not a ripple, stirred
the evening air or the yellow sands that stretched for miles
along the winding coast.</p>
<p>When Dr. Grey had partially crossed the lawn, he glanced
towards the marble temple that gleamed against the dark
background of deodars, and saw a woman sitting on the steps
of the tomb. Softly he approached and entered the mausoleum
by an arch on the opposite side, but, notwithstanding
his cautious tread, he startled a white pigeon that had perched
on the altar, where fresh violets, heliotrope, and snowy sprigs
of nutmeg-geranium were leaning over the <ins title="Was scallopped">scalloped</ins> edge of
the Venetian glasses, and distilling perfume in their delicate
chalices.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlyle had brought her floral tribute to the sepulchral
urn, and, having carefully arranged her daily Arkja,
had seated herself on the steps to rest.</p>
<p>From the two sentinel poplars that guarded the front,
golden leaves were sifting down on the marble floor, and
three or four had drifted upon the lap of the quiet figure,
while one, bright and rich as autumn gilding could make it,
rested like a crown on the silver waves that covered her head.</p>
<p>Down the shining steps trailed the folds of the white merino
robe, and around her shoulders was wrapped the blue crape
shawl, while a cluster of violets seemed to have slipped from
her fingers, and strewed themselves at random on her dress.</p>
<p>Softly Dr. Grey drew near, and his voice was tremulously
tender, as he said,—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Carlyle, no barrier divides us now.”</p>
<p>She did not speak, or turn her queenly head, and he laid
his hand caressingly on the glistening gray hair.</p>
<p>“My darling, my first and only love—my brave, beautiful
‘Agla,’ may I not tell you, at last, what conscience once forbade
my uttering?”</p>
<p>As motionless and silent as the sculptured poppies above
her, she took no notice of his passionate pleading, and
he sprang down one step directly in front of her.</p>
<p>The white face was turned to the sea, and the large, wide,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_463"></a>463</span>
wonderfully lovely yet mournful gray eyes were gazing fixedly
across the waste of water, at a filmy cloud as fine as lace, that
like a silver netting caught the full October moon which was
lifting itself in the pearly east.</p>
<p>The long black lashes did not droop, nor the steady eyes
waver, and with a horrible foreboding Dr. Grey seized her
hands. They were rigid and icy. He stooped, caught her to
his bosom, and pressed his lips to hers, but they were colder
than the marble column against which she leaned; for, one
hour before, Vashti Carlyle had fronted her God.</p>
<p>Alone in the autumn evening, sitting there with the golden
poplar leaves drifting over her, the desolate woman had held
her last communion with the watching ocean that hushed its
murmuring, to see her die; and, laying down the galling
burden of her sunless, dreary life, she had joyfully and <ins title="Was serenly">serenely</ins>
“put on immortality” in that everlasting rest, where “there
was no more sea, no more death, neither shall there be any
more pain, for the former things are passed away.”</p>
<p>Ah! beautiful and holy was—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>
<p>Since that October day when Ulpian Grey sat on the steps
of the tomb, holding in his arms the beautiful white form,
whom in life God had denied him the privilege of touching,
six months had drifted slowly; yet time had not softened the
blow, that, while almost crushing his tender, unselfish heart,
had no power to shake the faith which was so securely anchored
in Christ.</p>
<p>Among the papers found in Mrs. Carlyle’s desk was one containing
the request that Dr. Grey would superintend the erection
of a handsome monument over the remains of her husband,
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_464"></a>464</span>
whenever and wherever he chanced to die; and her will
provided that her fortune should be appropriated as the
nucleus of a relief fund for indigent painters.</p>
<p>Her own pictures, to which she had carefully affixed in
delicate violet ciphers the name “Agla,” she directed placed
on exhibition in a New York gallery, and ultimately sold for
the benefit of the orphans of artists. To Robert she bequeathed
a sum sufficient to maintain him in ease and comfort;
and to Dr. Grey her escritoire, piano, books, and the sapphire
ring she had always worn.</p>
<p>The latter was found in the silver casket, and had been
folded in a sheet of paper containing these words,—</p>
<p>“According to the teachings of the Buddhists, ‘the sapphire
produces equanimity and peace of mind, as well as
affording protection against envy and treachery. It produces
also prayer and reconciliation with the Godhead, and brings
more peace than any other gem of necromancy; <i>but he who
would wear it must lead a pure and holy life</i>.’ Finding my
sapphire asp mockingly inefficacious in its traditional talismanic
powers, I conclude that my melancholy career has been
a violation of the stipulated condition, and therefore bequeath
it to the only human being whom I deem worthy to wear it
with any hope of success.”</p>
<p>While awaiting orders from the naval department, Dr. Grey
purchased “Solitude,” whither he removed, with Muriel and
Miss Dexter, and temporarily established himself, until the
arrival of Mr. Granville.</p>
<p>Immediately after her return from Europe, Salome invested
a portion of Mr. Minge’s legacy in the site of the old mill
that had fallen to ruin. Here she built a small but tasteful
cottage <i>orné</i> on the spot where her father had died, and here,
with Jessie and Stanley, she proposed to spend her winters;
while Mark and Joel were placed at the “Grassmere Farm,”
a mile distant, and entrusted with its management until the
younger children should attain their majority.</p>
<p>Too proud to accept the home which Dr. Grey had tendered
her, Salome was earnestly endeavoring to imitate the noble
example of self-abnegation that lifted him so far above all
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_465"></a>465</span>
others whom she had ever known; and the most precious hope
of her life was to reach that exalted excellence which alone
could compel his admiration and respect.</p>
<p>From the day of Mrs. Carlyle’s death, the orphan had been
a comparatively happy woman, for jealousy could not invade
or desecrate the grave and its harmless sleeper; and Salome
fervently thanked God, that, since she was denied the blessing
of Dr. Grey’s love, at least she had been spared the torture
of seeing him the fond husband of another.</p>
<p>Time had deepened, but refined, purified, and consecrated
her unconquerable affection for the only man who had ever
commanded her reverence, and whose quiet influence had so
happily remoulded her wayward, fiery nature.</p>
<p>There were seasons when the old element of innate perversity
re-asserted itself, but the steady reproving gaze of his
clear, true eyes, or the warning touch of his hand on her head,
had sufficed to still the rising storm.</p>
<p>Conscientiously the passionate, exacting woman was striving
to bring her heart and life into subjection to the law,—into
conformity with the precepts of Christ; and though she
was impulsive, proud Salome still,—the glaring blemishes in
her character were gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>One bright balmy spring morning previous to the day appointed
for Muriel’s marriage, and for her guardian’s departure
for the fleet in Asiatic waters, where he had been assigned
to duty, Dr. Grey drove up the avenue of elms and
maples that led to Salome’s pretty villa; and as he ascended
the steps, Jessie sprang into his arms, and almost smothered
him with caresses.</p>
<p>“Oh, doctor! something so wonderful has happened,—you
never could guess, and I am as happy as a bee in a woodbine.
Sister will tell you.”</p>
<p>“Where is she?”</p>
<p>“In the parlor, waiting for you.”</p>
<p>The child ran off to join Stanley, who was trying a new
pony in the yard, and Dr. Grey went into the cool fragrant
room, which was fitted up with more taste than in earlier
years he would have ascribed to its owner.</p>
<div><span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_466"></a>466</span></div>
<p>Salome sat before the open piano, and at his entrance raised
her face, which had been bowed almost to the ivory keys.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Dr. Grey. I am glad you have come to
rejoice with me, and I was just thanking God for the unexpected
restoration of my voice. Once when it seemed so necessary
to <ins title="Changed period to comma">me.</ins> He suddenly took it from me; and now, when
it is a mere luxury to own it, He as unexpectedly gives it to
me once more. Verily,—strange as it may appear, my voice
is really better than when Professor V—— pronounced it
the first contralto in Europe.”</p>
<p>She had risen to greet him, and as he retained her hand in
his, she stood close to him, looking earnestly into his face.</p>
<p>There were tears hanging like tremulous dewdrops on the
long jet under-lashes,—and the bright red in her polished
cheeks, and the crimson curves of her parted lips made a picture
pleasant to contemplate.</p>
<p>“My dear child, I do indeed cordially congratulate you.
God saw that your voice might possibly prove a snare and a
curse, by ministering to false pride and exaggerated vanity,
and in mercy and wisdom He temporarily deprived you of an
instrument that threatened you with danger. Now that you
are stronger, more prudent, and patient, He trusts you again
with one of the choicest blessings that can be conferred on a
woman. You have deserved to recover it, and I joyfully unite
my thanks with yours. Let me hear your voice once more.”</p>
<p>Trembling with excess of happiness, she sat down and sang
feelingly, eloquently, her favorite “<i>O mon Fernand</i>;” and,
as he listened, Dr. Grey looked almost wonderingly at the
beautiful flashing face, that had never seemed half so radiant
before. There was marvellous witchery in her rich round flexible
tones, that wound into the holy-of-holies of the man’s
great heart, and elevated his thoughts above the dross and
dust of earth.</p>
<p>When she ended, he placed his soft palm tenderly on her
head, and smoothed the glossy hair.</p>
<p>“I thank you inexpressibly. Sometimes when sad memories
oppress me, how I shall long to have you charm them
away by that magical spell that bears my thoughts from this
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_467"></a>467</span>
world to the next. There are some songs which you must
learn for my sake.”</p>
<p>Ah! at that moment, as she stood there robed in a soft
stainless white muslin, with a cluster of double pomegranate
flowers glowing in her silky hair, the girl was very lovely,
very attractive, so full of youthful grace, so winning in her
beautiful enthusiasm,—yet Ulpian Grey’s heart did not wander
for an instant from one who slept dreamlessly under the
sculptured urn on the marble altar of the mausoleum.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">“Why are the dead not dead? Who can undo<br>
What time hath done? Who can win back the wind?<br>
Beckon lost music from a broken lute?<br>
Renew the redness of a last year’s rose?<br>
Or dig the sunken sunset from the deep?”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>“Dr. Grey, if my voice can chase away one vexing thought,
one wearying care or melancholy memory, I shall feel that
I have additional reason to thank God for the precious gift.”</p>
<p>“I have not seen you look so happy for three years. Indeed,
my little sister, you have much for which to be grateful,
and in the midst of your blessings try to recollect those grand
words of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, ‘The soul is a God in
exile.’ My child, look to it that your expatriation ends with
the shores of time, for—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="cg">‘Yea, this is life; make this forenoon sublime,<br>
This afternoon a psalm, this night a prayer,<br>
And time is conquered, and thy crown is won.’”</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>For some seconds Salome did not speak, for the shadow on
his countenance fell upon her heart, and looking reverently
up at him, she thought of Richter’s mournful <i>dictum</i>,—“Great
souls attract sorrows, as mountains tempests.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Grey, want of patience is the cause of half my difficulties
and defeats, and plunges me continually into the
slough of distrust and rebellious questioning. I find it so hard
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_468"></a>468</span>
to stand still, and let God do his will, and work in his own
way.”</p>
<p>“My dear Salome, patience is only practical faith, and
the want of it causes two-thirds of the world’s woes. I often
find it necessary to humble my own pride, and tame my restless
spirit by recurring to the last words of Schiller, ‘Calmer
and calmer! many difficult things are growing plain and clear
to me. Let us be patient.’ Child, sing me one song more, and
then come out and show me where you propose to place those
grape-arbors we spoke of yesterday. This is the last opportunity
I shall have to direct your workmen.”</p>
<p>An hour later Salome fastened a sprig of Grand Duke jasmine
in the button-hole of his coat,—shook hands with him
for the day, and though she smiled in recognition of his
final bow as he drove down the avenue, her thoughts were
busy with the dreaded separation that awaited her on the
morrow and, while her lips were mute, the cry of her heart
was,—</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="center cg"><span class="dotspoem">...</span> “O Beloved, it is plain</p>
<p class="cg">I am not of thy worth, nor for thy place.<br>
And yet because I love thee, I obtain<br>
From that same love this vindicating grace,<br>
To live on still in love,—and yet in vain,—<br>
To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy <ins title="Added quote">face.”</ins></p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Dr. Grey spent the remainder of the day in visiting his
patients, and as he rode from cottage to hovel, bidding adieu
to those whose lives had so often been committed to his professional
guardianship, he was received with tearful eyes, and
trembling hands; and numerous benedictions were invoked
upon his head.</p>
<p>Silver threads were beginning to weave an aureola in his
chestnut hair, and the smooth white forehead showed incipient
furrows, but the deep blue eyes were as tranquil and
trusting as of yore, and full of tenderer light for the few he
loved, for all in suffering and bereavement.</p>
<p>With a sublime and increasing faith in the overruling wisdom
and mercy of God, he patiently and hopefully bore his
<span class="pagenum pncolor"><a id="page_469"></a>469</span>
loneliness and grievous loss,—comforting himself with the assurance
that, “the evening of life brings with it its lamp;”
and looking eagle-eyed across the storm-drenched plain of the
present to the gleaming jasper walls of the Eternal Beyond.</p>

<div>
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.
</div><div>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div id="project-gutenberg-license">START: FULL LICENSE</div>

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
