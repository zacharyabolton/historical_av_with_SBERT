<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This brief story of a gigantic event, and General
Longstreet’s part therein was arranged for publication
in book form in the fall of 1903, before his death,
which occurred January 2, 1904. It is the carefully
sifted story of the records and contemporaneous witnesses,
and for clearness I have here and there introduced
General Longstreet’s personal version of some
of the disputed points. But the reader will perceive
that at last it is the <i>story of the records</i>.</p>
<p>For my undertaking I drew liberally from General
Longstreet’s memoirs of the war, “Manassas to Appomattox;”
from his stores of knowledge in the military
art, and his treasure-house of memories of the
Titanic encounter on the field of Gettysburg. The war-pictures
included herein are also from the above-mentioned
volume. And I am gratefully indebted to Captain
Leslie J. Perry, formerly of the War Records
Office, Washington City, for valuable assistance.</p>
<p>An appendix, added since General Longstreet’s
death, includes a small selection from the thousands of
tributes from every quarter of the republic.</p>
<p>One of the last of the brilliant generals of the Civil
War, whose valor and skill in the command of great
armies, is to-day the common glory of the restored
Union, has contributed an introduction. No survivor
of the great struggle has a better right to speak of
Gettysburg than General Daniel E. Sickles. In this
connection the following letter is appreciatively reproduced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="p2 sigright smaller">

“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, September 19, 1902.<br>
</p>
<p class="in0">
“<span class="smcap">General D. E. Sickles</span>,<br>
<span class="in4">“Gettysburg, Pennsylvania:</span>
</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear General Sickles</span>,​—​My plan and desire was to
meet you at Gettysburg on the interesting ceremony attending
the unveiling of the Slocum monument; but to-day I find myself
in no condition to keep the promise made you when last we were
together. I am quite disabled from a severe hurt in one of my
feet, so that I am unable to stand more than a minute or two
at a time. Please express my sincere regrets to the noble Army
of the Potomac, and accept them, especially, for yourself.</p>
<p>“On that field you made your mark that will place you prominently
before the world as one of the leading figures of the most
important battle of the Civil War. As a Northern veteran
once remarked to me, ‘General Sickles can well afford to leave
a leg on that field.’</p>
<p>“I believe it is now conceded that the advanced position at the
Peach-Orchard, taken by your corps and under your orders
saved that battle-field to the Union cause. It was the sorest and
saddest reflection of my life for many years; but, to-day, I
can say, with sincerest emotion, that it was and is the best that
could have come to us all, North and South; and I hope that the
nation, reunited, may always enjoy the honor and glory brought
to it by the grand work.</p>
<p>“Please offer my kindest salutations to your governor and
your fellow-comrades of the Army of the Potomac.</p>
<div class="sig-container"><div class="sig">
<p class="in0">
<span class="in4">“Always yours sincerely,</span><br>
(Signed) <span class="in4">“<span class="smcap">James Longstreet</span>,</span><br>
<span class="in4">“<i>Lieutenant-General Confederate Army</i>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div></div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Early in December advance chapters were given to
the press for January 3; by strangely pathetic coincidence
that being the date on which public announcement
was made of General Longstreet’s death.</p>
<p>This hour does not clamor for the charity of silence,
but for the white light of truth which I reverently
undertake to throw upon the deeds of the commander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
who, from Manassas to Appomattox, was the strong
right arm of the Confederate States Army.</p>
<p>I was writing for love of him whose dear name and
fame had been attacked; to place before his fading
vision enduring appreciation of his valiant deeds as a
soldier and high qualities as a gentleman. Providence
decreed otherwise. While the opening chapters were
running into type, the Great Captain on High called
him hence, where he can at last have his wrongs on
earth forever righted.</p>
<p>The warrior sleeps serenely to-day, undisturbed by
all earthly contentions, the peace of God upon him.
And I bring to his tomb this little leaf fragrant with
my love, bedewed with my tears, heavy-weighted with
my woe and desolation.</p>

<h2 title="INTRODUCTION" id="toc17">INTRODUCTION<br>
<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">By Major-General D. E. Sickles, U.S.A.</span></span></h2>
<p>I am glad to write an introduction to a memoir of
Lieutenant-General Longstreet.</p>
<p>If it be thought strange that I should write a preface
to a memoir of a conspicuous adversary, I reply that
the Civil War is only a memory, its asperities are forgotten,
both armies were American, old army friendships
have been renewed and new army friendships have
been formed among the combatants, the truth of history
is dear to all of us, and the amenities of chivalrous manhood
are cherished alike by the North and the South,
when justice to either is involved. Longstreet’s splendid
record as a soldier needs neither apologies nor eulogium.
And if I venture, further along in this introduction, to
defend him from unfair criticism, it is because my personal
knowledge of the battle of July 2, 1863, qualifies
me to testify in his behalf. It was the fortune of my
corps to meet Longstreet on many great fields. It is
now my privilege to offer a tribute to his memory. As
Colonel Damas says in “The Lady of Lyons,” after
his duel with Melnotte, “It’s astonishing how much I
like a man after I’ve fought with him.”</p>
<p>Often adversaries on the field of battle, we became
good friends after peace was restored. He supported
President Grant and his successors in their wise policy
of restoration. Longstreet’s example was the rainbow
of reconciliation that foreshadowed real peace between
the North and South. He drew the fire of the irreconcilable
South. His statesmanlike forecast blazed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
path of progress and prosperity for his people, impoverished
by war and discouraged by adversity. He
was the first of the illustrious Southern war leaders to
accept the result of the great conflict as final. He
folded up forever the Confederate flag he had followed
with supreme devotion, and thenceforth saluted the
Stars and Stripes of the Union with unfaltering
homage. He was the trusted servant of the republic in
peace, as he had been its relentless foe in war. The
friends of the Union became his friends, the enemies of
the Union his enemies.</p>
<p>I trust I may be pardoned for relating an incident
that reveals the sunny side of Longstreet’s genial nature.
When I visited Georgia, in March, 1892, I was
touched by a call from the General, who came from
Gainesville to Atlanta to welcome me to his State. On
St. Patrick’s Day we supped together as guests of the
Irish Societies of Atlanta, at their banquet. We entered
the hall arm in arm, about nine o’clock in the evening,
and were received by some three hundred gentlemen,
with the wildest and loudest “rebel yell” I had
ever heard. When I rose to respond to a toast in honor
of the Empire State of the North, Longstreet stood
also and leaned with one arm on my shoulder, the better
to hear what I had to say, and this was a signal for
another outburst. I concluded my remarks by <span class="locked">proposing,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Health and long life to my old adversary, Lieutenant-General
Longstreet,”</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="in0">assuring the audience that, although the General did not
often make speeches, he would sing the “Star-Spangled
Banner.” This was, indeed, a risky promise, as I had
never heard the General sing. I was greatly relieved
by his exclamation:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
“Yes, I will sing it!”</p>
<p>And he did sing the song admirably, the company
joining with much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>As the hour was late, and we had enjoyed quite a
number of potations of hot Irish whiskey punch, we
decided to go to our lodgings long before the end of
the revel, which appeared likely to last until daybreak.
When we descended to the street we were unable to
find a carriage, but Longstreet proposed to be my
guide; and, although the streets were dark and the walk
a long one, we reached my hotel in fairly good form.
Not wishing to be outdone in courtesy, I <span class="locked">said,​—​</span></p>
<p>“Longstreet, the streets of Atlanta are very dark
and it is very late, and you are somewhat deaf and
rather infirm; now I must escort you to your head-quarters.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Longstreet; “come on and we’ll
have another handshake over the bloody chasm.”</p>
<p>When we arrived at his stopping-place and were
about to separate, as I supposed, he turned to me and
<span class="locked">said,​—​</span></p>
<p>“Sickles, the streets of Atlanta are very dark and
you are lame, and a stranger here, and do not know
the way back to your hotel; I must escort you home.”</p>
<p>“Come along, Longstreet,” was my answer.</p>
<p>On our way to the hotel, I said to <span class="locked">him,​—​</span></p>
<p>“Old fellow, I hope you are sorry for shooting off
my leg at Gettysburg. I suppose I will have to forgive
you for it some day.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me?” Longstreet exclaimed. “You ought
to thank me for leaving you one leg to stand on, after
the mean way you behaved to me at Gettysburg.”</p>
<p>How often we performed escort duty for each other
on that eventful night I have never been able to recall
with precision; but I am quite sure that I shall never
forget St. Patrick’s Day in 1892, at Atlanta, Georgia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
when Longstreet and I enjoyed the good Irish whiskey
punch at the banquet of the Knights of St. Patrick.</p>
<p>Afterwards Longstreet and I met again, at Gettysburg,
this time as the guests of John Russell Young,
who had invited a number of his literary and journalistic
friends to join us on the old battle-field. We
rode in the same carriage. When I assisted the General
in climbing up the rocky face of Round Top, he turned
to me and <span class="locked">said,​—​</span></p>
<p>“Sickles, you can well afford to help me up here
now, for if you had not kept me away so long from
Round Top on the 2d of July, 1863, the war would
have lasted longer than it did, and might have had a
different ending.”</p>
<p>As he said this, his stern, leonine face softened with a
smile as sweet as a brother’s.</p>
<p>We met in March, 1901, at the reception given to
President McKinley on his second inauguration. In
the midst of the great throng assembled on that occasion
Longstreet and I had quite a reception of our own.
He was accompanied on this occasion by Mrs. Longstreet.
Every one admired the blended courtliness and
gallantry of the veteran hero towards the ladies who
were presented to him and his charming wife.</p>
<p>At the West Point Centennial Longstreet and I sat
together on the dais, near President Roosevelt, the Secretary
of War, Mr. Root, and the commander of the
army, Lieutenant-General Miles. Here among his
fellow-graduates of the Military Academy, he received
a great ovation from the vast audience that filled Cullum
Hall. Again and again he was cheered, when he
turned to me, <span class="locked">exclaiming,​—​</span></p>
<p>“Sickles, what are they all cheering about?”</p>
<p>“They are cheering you, General,” was my reply.</p>
<p>Joy lighted up his countenance, the war was forgotten,
and Longstreet was at home once more at West
Point.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Again we stood upon the same platform, in Washington,
on May 30,​—​Memorial Day,​—​1902. Together
we reviewed, with President Roosevelt, the magnificent
column of Union veterans that marched past the President’s
reviewing-stand. That evening Longstreet
joined me in a visit to a thousand or more soldiers of
the Third Army Corps, assembled in a tent near the
White House. These veterans, with a multitude of
their comrades, had come to Washington to commemorate
another Memorial Day in the Capitol of the
Nation. The welcome given him by this crowd of old
soldiers, who had fought him with all their might again
and again, on many battle-fields, could hardly have been
more cordial if he had found himself in the midst of an
equal number of his own command. His speech to the
men was felicitous, and enthusiastically cheered. In an
eloquent peroration he said, “I hope to live long enough
to see my surviving comrades march side by side with
the Union veterans along Pennsylvania Avenue, and
then I will die happy.” This was the last time I met
Longstreet.</p>
<p>Longstreet was unjustly blamed for not attacking
earlier in the day, on July 2, 1863, at Gettysburg. I
can answer that criticism, as I know more about the
matter than the critics. If he had attacked in the morning,
as it is said he should have done, he would have
encountered Buford’s division of cavalry, five thousand
sabres, on his flank, and my corps would have been in
his front, as it was in the afternoon. In a word, all the
troops that opposed Longstreet in the afternoon, including
the Fifth Army Corps and Caldwell’s division
of the Second Corps, would have been available on the
left flank of the Union army in the morning. Every
regiment and every battery that fired a shot in the
afternoon was on the field in the morning, and would
have resisted an assault in the morning as stubbornly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
as in the afternoon. Moreover, if the assault had been
made in the morning, Law’s strong brigade of Alabamians
could not have assisted in the attack, as they
did not arrive on the field until noon. On the other
hand, if Lee had waited an hour later, I would have
been on Cemetery Ridge, in compliance with General
Meade’s orders, and Longstreet could have marched,
unresisted, from Seminary Ridge to the foot of Round
Top, and might, perhaps, have unlimbered his guns on
the summit.</p>
<p>General Meade’s telegram to Halleck, dated 3 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>,
July 2, does not indicate that Lee was then about to
attack him. At the time that despatch was sent, a
council of corps commanders was assembled at General
Meade’s head-quarters. It was broken up by the sound
of Longstreet’s artillery. The probability is that Longstreet’s
attack held the Union army at Gettysburg. If
Longstreet had waited until a later hour, the Union
army might have been moving towards Pipe Creek, the
position chosen by General Meade on June 30.</p>
<p>The best proof that Lee was not dissatisfied with
Longstreet’s movements on July 2 is the fact that
Longstreet was intrusted with the command of the
column of attack on July 3,​—​Lee’s last hope at Gettysburg.
Of the eleven brigades that assaulted the Union
left centre on July 3, only three of them​—​Pickett’s division​—​belonged
to Longstreet’s corps, the other eight
brigades belonged to Hill’s corps. If Longstreet had
disappointed Lee on July 2, why would Lee, on the
next day, give Longstreet a command of supreme importance,
of which more than two-thirds of the troops
were taken from another corps commander?</p>
<p>Longstreet did not look for success on July 3. He
told General Lee that “the fifteen thousand men who
could make a successful assault over that field had never
been arrayed for battle,” and yet the command was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
given to Longstreet. Why? Because the confidence
of Lee in Longstreet was unshaken; because he regarded
Longstreet as his most capable lieutenant.</p>
<p>Longstreet was never censured for the failure of the
assault on July 3, although General Lee intimates, in
his official report, that it was not made as early in the
day as was expected. Why, then, is Longstreet blamed
by them for the failure on July 2, when no fault was
found by General Lee with Longstreet’s dispositions
on that day? The failure of both assaults must be attributed
to insurmountable obstacles, which no commander
could have overcome with the force at Longstreet’s
disposal,​—​seventeen thousand men on July 2,
and fifteen thousand men on July 3, against thirty
thousand adversaries!</p>
<p>In General Lee’s official report not a word appears
about any delay in Longstreet’s movements on July 2,
although, referring to the assault of July 3, General
Lee says, “General Longstreet’s dispositions were not
completed as early as was expected.” If General Lee
did not hesitate to point out unlooked for delay on
July 3, why was he silent about delay on July 2? His
silence about delay on July 2 implies that there was
none on July 2. <i>Expresio unius exclusio alterius.</i></p>
<p>General Lee says, in his report, referring to July 3,​—​</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Longstreet was delayed by a force occupying the
high, rocky hills on the enemy’s extreme left, from which his
troops could be attacked in reverse as they advanced. His
operations had been embarrassed the day previous by the same
cause, and he now deemed it necessary to defend his flank and
rear with the divisions of Hood and McLaws.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Another embarrassment prevented an earlier attack
on July 2. It was the plan of General Lee to surprise
the left flank of the Union army. General Lee ordered
Captain Johnson, the engineer officer of his staff, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
conduct Longstreet’s column by a route concealed from
the enemy. But the formation and movements of the
attacking column had been discovered by my reconnoisance;
this exposure put an end to any chance of
surprise. Other dispositions became necessary; fresh
orders from head-quarters were asked for; another line
of advance had to be found, less exposed to view. All
this took time. These circumstances were, of course,
known to General Lee; hence he saw no reason to
reproach Longstreet for delay.</p>
<p>The situation on the left flank of the Union army was
entirely changed by my advance to the Emmitsburg
road. Fitzhugh Lee says, “Lee was deceived by it and
gave orders to attack up the Emmitsburg road, partially
enveloping the enemy’s left; there was much
behind Sickles.” The obvious purpose of my advance
was to hold Lee’s force in check until General Meade
could bring his reserves from his right flank, at Rock
Creek, to the Round Tops, on the left. Fortunately
for me, General Lee believed that my line from the
Peach-Orchard north​—​about a division front​—​was all
Longstreet would have to deal with. Longstreet soon
discovered that my left rested beyond Devil’s Den, about
twelve hundred yards easterly from the Emmitsburg
road, and at a right angle to it. Of course, Longstreet
could not push forward to Lee’s objective,​—​the Emmitsburg
road ridge,​—​leaving this force on his flank
and rear, to take him in reverse. An obstinate conflict
followed, which detained Longstreet until the Fifth
Corps, which had been in reserve on the Union right,
moved to the left and got into position on the Round
Tops. Thus it happened that my salient at the Peach-Orchard,
on the Emmitsburg road, was not attacked
until six o’clock, the troops on my line, from the Emmitsburg
road to the Devil’s Den, having held their
positions until that hour. The surprise Lee had planned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
was turned upon himself. The same thing would have
happened if Longstreet had attacked in the morning;
all the troops that resisted Longstreet in the afternoon​—​say
thirty thousand​—​would have opposed him in the
forenoon.</p>
<p>The alignment of the Union forces on the left flank
at 11 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, when Lee gave his preliminary orders to
Longstreet for the attack, was altogether different
from the dispositions made by me at 3 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, when the
attack was begun. At eleven in the morning my command
was on Cemetery Ridge, to the left of Hancock.
At two o’clock in the afternoon, anticipating General
Lee’s attack, I changed front, deploying my left division
(Birney’s) from Plum Run, near the base of
Little Round Top, to the Peach-Orchard, at the intersection
of Millerstown and Emmitsburg roads. My
right division (Humphrey’s) was moved forward to the
Emmitsburg road, its left connecting with Birney at
the Orchard, and its right <i>en echelon</i> with Hancock,
parallel with the Codori House.</p>
<p>Longstreet was ordered to conceal his column of attack,
for which the ground on Lee’s right afforded excellent
opportunities. Lee’s plan was a repetition of
Jackson’s attack on the right flank of the Union army
at Chancellorsville. In the afternoon, however, in view
of the advance of my corps, General Lee was obliged
to form a new plan of battle. As he believed that both
of my flanks rested on the Emmitsburg road, Lee directed
Longstreet to envelop my left at the Peach-Orchard,
and press the attack northward “up the
Emmitsburg road.”</p>
<p>Colonel Fairfax, of Longstreet’s staff, says that Lee
and Longstreet were together at three o’clock, when
the attack began. Lieutenant-General Hill, commanding
the First Corps of Lee’s army, says in his
<span class="locked">report,​—​</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“The corps of General Longstreet (McLaws’s and Hood’s
divisions) was on my right, and in a line very nearly at right
angles to mine. General Longstreet was to attack the left flank
of the enemy, and sweep down his line, and I was ordered to
co-operate with him with such of my brigades from the right
as could join in with his troops in the attack. On the extreme
right, Hood commenced the attack about two o’clock, McLaws
about 5.30 o’clock.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Longstreet was not long in discovering, by his artillery
practice, that my position at the Peach-Orchard
was a salient, and that my left flank really rested twelve
hundred yards eastward, at Plum Run, in the valley
between Little Round Top and the Devil’s Den, concealed
from observation by woods; my line extended to
the high ground along the Emmitsburg road, from
which Lee says, “It was thought our artillery could be
used to advantage in assailing the more elevated ground
beyond.”</p>
<p>General J. B. Hood’s story of his part in the battle
of July 2, taken from a communication addressed to
General Longstreet, which appears in Hood’s “Advance
and Retreat,” pages 57–59, is a clear narrative
of the movements of Longstreet’s assaulting column.
It emphasizes the firm adherence of Longstreet to the
orders of General Lee. Again and again, as Hood
plainly points out, Longstreet refused to listen to
Hood’s appeal for leave to turn Round Top and assail
the Union rear, always replying, “General Lee’s orders
are to attack up the Emmitsburg <span class="locked">road.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_A" id="FNanchor_A">A</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>
<p>These often repeated orders of General Lee to
“attack up the Emmitsburg road” could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
given until near three in the afternoon of July 2, because
before that hour there was no Union line of
battle on the Emmitsburg road. There had been only
a few of my pickets there in the morning, thrown forward
by the First Massachusetts Infantry. It distinctly
appears that Lee rejected Longstreet’s plan to
turn the Federal left on Cemetery Ridge. And Hood
makes it plain enough that Longstreet refused to listen
to Hood’s appeal for permission to turn Round Top,
on the main Federal line, always replying, “No; General
Lee’s orders are to attack up the Emmitsburg
road.” Of course, that plan of battle was not formed
until troops had been placed in positions commanding
that road. This, we have seen, was not done until
towards three in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The only order of battle announced by General Lee
on July 2 of which there is any record was to assail
my position on the Emmitsburg road, turn my left
flank (which he erroneously supposed to rest on the
Peach-Orchard), and sweep the attack “up the Emmitsburg
road.” This was impossible until I occupied
that road, and it was then that Longstreet’s artillery
began its practice on my advanced line.</p>
<p>I am unable to see how any just person can charge
Longstreet with deviation from the orders of General
Lee on July 2. It is true enough that Longstreet had
advised different tactics; but he was a soldier,​—​a West
Pointer,​—​and once he had indicated his own views, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
obeyed the orders of the general commanding,​—​he did
not even exercise the discretion allowed to the chief of
a <i>corps d’armée</i>, which permits him to modify instructions
when an unforeseen emergency imposes fresh
responsibilities, or when an unlooked-for opportunity
offers tempting advantages.</p>
<p>We have seen that many circumstances required
General Lee to modify his plans and orders on July 2
between daybreak, when his first reconnoisance was
made, and three o’clock in the afternoon, when my
advanced position was defined. We have seen that if
a morning attack had been made the column would
have encountered Buford’s strong division of cavalry
on its flank, and that it would have been weakened by
the absence of Law’s brigade of Hood’s division. We
have seen that Longstreet, even in the afternoon, when
Law had come up and Buford had been sent to Westminster,
was still too weak to contend against the reinforcements
sent against him. We have seen that
Lee was present all day on July 2, and that his own
staff-officer led the column of attack. We have seen
that General Lee, in his official report, gives no hint
of dissatisfaction with Longstreet’s conduct of the battle
of July 2, nor does it appear that Longstreet was
ever afterwards criticised by Lee. On the contrary,
Lee points out that the same danger to Longstreet’s
flank, which required the protection of two divisions
on July 3, existed on July 2, when his flank was
unsupported. We have seen that again and again,
when Hood appealed to Longstreet for leave to swing
his column to the right and turn the Round Tops,
Longstreet as often refused, always saying, “No;
General Lee’s orders are to attack up the Emmitsburg
road.” The conclusion is irrefutable, that whilst the
operations were directed with signal ability and sustained
by heroic courage, the failure of both assaults,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
that of July 2 and the other of July 3, must be attributed
to the lack of strength in the columns of attack
on both days, for which the commanding general alone
was responsible.</p>
<p>It was Longstreet’s good fortune to live until he saw
his country hold a high place among the great powers
of the world. He saw the new South advancing in
prosperity, hand in hand with the North, East, and
West. He saw his people in the ranks of our army, in
Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, China, and Panama;
he saw the Union stars and the blue uniform worn by
Fitzhugh Lee, and Butler, and Wheeler. He witnessed
the fulfilment of his prediction,​—​that the hearty reunion
of the North and South would advance the welfare
of both. He lived long enough to rejoice with all
of us in a reunited nation, and to know that his name
was honored wherever the old flag was unfurled. His
fame as a soldier belongs to all Americans.</p>
<p>Farewell, Longstreet! I shall follow you very soon.
May we meet in the happy realm where strife is unknown
and friendship is eternal!</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STORY OF GETTYSBURG</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Back of the day that opened so auspiciously for the Confederate
cause at the first Manassas, and of the four years that followed,
lies Longstreet’s record of a quarter of a century in the Union army,
completing one of the most lustrous pages in the world’s war history.
That page cannot be dimmed or darkened; it rests secure in its own
white splendor, above the touch of detractors.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The detractors of General Longstreet’s military integrity
assert that, being opposed to fighting an offensive
battle at Gettysburg, he was “balky and stubborn”
in executing Lee’s orders; that he disobeyed the commanding
general’s orders to attack at sunrise on the
morning of July 2; that, again ordered to attack with
half the army on the morning of July 3, his culpably
slow attack with only Pickett’s division, supported by
some of Hill’s troops, caused the fatal Confederate defeat
in that encounter.</p>
<p>General Gordon has seen fit, in a recent publication,
to revive this cruel aspersion.</p>
<p>When General Longstreet surrendered his sword at
Appomattox his war record was made up. It stands
unassailable​—​needing no defenders. Back of the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
that opened so auspiciously for the Confederate cause
at the first Manassas, and of the four years that followed,
lies the record of a quarter of a century in the
Union army.</p>
<p>In those times General Longstreet, at Cerro Gordo,
Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec, was aiding to win
the great empire of the West; in subsequent hard Indian
campaigns lighting the fagots of a splendid western
civilization, adding new glory to American arms and, in
the struggles of a nation that fell, a new star of the first
magnitude to the galaxy of American valor, completing
one of the most lustrous pages in the world’s war history.
That page cannot be dimmed or darkened; it
rests secure in its own white splendor, above the touch
of detractors.</p>
<p>General Longstreet has of late years deemed it unnecessary
to make defence of his military integrity, save
such as may be found in his memoirs, “Manassas to
Appomattox,” published nearly ten years since. He
has held that his deeds stand on the impartial pages of
the nation’s records​—​their own defender.</p>
<p>The cold historian of our Civil War of a hundred
years hence will not go for truth to the picturesque
reminiscences of General John B. Gordon, nor to the
pyrotechnics of General Fitzhugh Lee, nor yet to the
somewhat hysterical ravings of Rev. Mr. Pendleton
and scores of other modern essayists who have sought
to fix the failure of Gettysburg upon General Longstreet.
The coming chronicler will cast aside the rubbish
of passion and hate that followed the war, and have
recourse to the nation’s official war records, and in the
cool, calm lights of the letters and reports of the participants,
written at the time, will place the blunder of
Gettysburg where it belongs. Longstreet’s fame has
nothing to fear in that hour.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption1">
<img alt="Signed photograph of Robert E. Lee" class="nopad" height="600" src="images/i_032fp.jpg" width="361" id="img_032"><br>
<div class="caption" id="ebm_caption1">R. E. Lee</div></div>
<p>But for the benefit of the present​—​of the young, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
busy, who have neither time nor inclination to study the
records, and for that sentiment that is increasingly
shaped by the public press,​—​for these and other reasons
it appears fitting that in this hour historical truth should
have a spokesman on the Gettysburg contentions. In
the absence of one more able to speak, this little story
of the truth is written. The writer belongs to a generation
that has come up since the gloom of Appomattox
closed the drama of the great “Lost Cause” of
American history​—​a generation that seeks the truth,
unwarped and undistorted by passion, and can face the
truth.</p>
<p>In the prosecution of my researches for the origin of
the extraordinary calumnies aimed at General Longstreet’s
honor as a soldier, two most significant facts
have continually pressed upon my attention.</p>
<p>First, not one word appears to have been published
openly accusing him of disobedience at Gettysburg
until the man who could forever have silenced all criticism
was in his grave​—​until the knightly soul of Robert
Edward Lee had passed into eternity.</p>
<p>Second, General Longstreet’s operations on the field
of Gettysburg were above the suspicion of reproach
until he came under the political ban in the South, for
meeting in the proper spirit, as he saw it, the requirements
of good citizenship in the observance of his Appomattox
parole, and, after the removal of his political
disabilities, for having accepted office at the hands of a
Republican President who happened to be his old West
Point comrade,​—​Grant.</p>
<p>Then the storm broke. He was heralded as traitor,
deserter of his people, deserter of Democracy, etc. In
the fury of this onslaught originated the cruel slander
that he had disobeyed Lee’s most vital orders, causing
the loss of the Gettysburg battle and the ultimate fall
of the Confederate cause. Most singularly, this strange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
discovery was not made until some years after the battle
and General Lee’s death. Thereafter for two decades
the South was sedulously taught to believe that the Federal
victory was wholly the fortuitous outcome of the
culpable disobedience of General Longstreet.</p>
<p>The sectional complaint that he deserted “Democracy”
is about as relevant and truthful as the assertion
that he lost Gettysburg. He was a West Pointer, a
professional soldier. He had never cast a ballot before
the Civil War; he had no politics. Its passions and
prejudices had no dwelling-place in his mind. The war
was over, and he quietly accepted the result, fraternizing
with all Americans. It was no great crime.</p>
<p>But the peculiar circumstances favored an opportunity
to make Longstreet the long-desired scape-goat for
Gettysburg. There was an ulterior and deeper purpose,
however, than merely besmirching his military
record. Short-sighted partisans seemingly argued that
the disparagement of Longstreet was necessary to save
the military reputation of Lee. But Lee’s great fame
needed no such sacrifice.</p>
<p>The outrageous charges against Longstreet have
been wholly disproved. Much of the partisan rancor
that once pursued him has died out. Many of the more
intelligent Southerners have been long convinced that
he was the victim of a great wrong.</p>
<p>It was unworthy of Major-General John B. Gordon,
once of the army of Northern Virginia, to revive this
dead controversy. He simply reiterates the old charges
in full, produces no evidence in their support, and gratuitously
endorses a false and cruel verdict. His contribution
is of no historical value. It carries inherent
evidence that General Gordon made no critical examination
of the documentary history of Gettysburg. He
assumes to render a verdict on the say-so of others.</p>
<p>Gordon’s unsupported assertions would require no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
attention but for one fact. Both South and North
there is a widespread impression that Gordon was a
conspicuous figure at Gettysburg. This is erroneous.
He was merely a brigade commander there, stationed
five miles from Longstreet. It is not certain that he
personally saw either Lee or Longstreet while the army
was in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In his official report Gordon uses this language regarding
the operations of his own small command at
Gettysburg when the heaviest fighting was going on,
finely showing the scope of his opportunities for observation:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“The movements during the succeeding days of the battle,
July 2 and 3, I do not consider of sufficient importance to
mention.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>It is but just to Gordon, however, to say that in his
subordinate capacity at the head of one of the thirty-seven
brigades of infantry comprising Lee’s army, he
performed excellent service on the first day’s battle.
But in estimating his value as a personal witness, the
foregoing undisputed facts must be taken into consideration.
His testimony is obviously of the hearsay kind.
In fact, as will be observed from his own admission, it
is no more than his own personal conclusions, wholly
deduced from the assertions of others, based on an
assumed state of facts which did not exist.</p>
<p>In his recent publication, “Reminiscences of the Civil
War,” Gordon <span class="locked">says,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“It now seems certain that impartial military critics, after
thorough investigation, will consider the following facts established:</p>
<p>“First, that General Lee distinctly ordered Longstreet to attack
early on the morning of the second day, and if Longstreet
had done so two of the largest corps of Meade’s army would
not have been in the fight; but Longstreet delayed the fight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
until four o’clock in the afternoon, and thus lost his opportunity
of occupying Little Round Top, the key of the position, which
he might have done in the morning without firing a shot or
losing a man.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>It is competent to point out that Longstreet’s orders
from General Lee were “to move around to gain the
Emmitsburg road, on the enemy’s left.” In short, he
was “to attack up the Emmitsburg road,” as all the
authorities agree. He therefore could not well
“occupy” Little Round Top up the Emmitsburg road,
because it was but a fraction less than a mile to the east
of that road. It is as clear as noonday that Lee had no
thought at first, if ever, that Little Round Top was the
“key to the position.” Lee merely contemplated
driving the enemy from some high ground on the Emmitsburg
road from which the “more elevated ground”
of Cemetery Hill in its rear, more than a mile to the
northward of Little Round Top, could be subsequently
assailed.</p>
<p>Lee’s luminous report of the battle, dated July 31,
1863, only four weeks after, has escaped Gordon’s
notice, or has been conveniently ignored by him. It is
found at page 305 <i>et seq.</i>, of Part II., Vol. XXVII.,
of the printed War Records, easily accessible to everybody.
At page 308, Lee’s report:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“ ... In front of General Longstreet the enemy held a position
from which, if he could be driven, it was thought our artillery
could be used to advantage in assailing the more elevated
ground beyond, and thus enable us to reach the crest of the
ridge. That officer was directed to carry this position....
After a severe struggle, Longstreet succeeded in getting possession
of and holding the desired ground.... The battle ceased
at dark.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The “desired ground” captured was that held by
Sickles’s Federal Third Corps,​—​the celebrated peach-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>orchard,
wheat-field, and adjacent high ground, from
which Cemetery Hill was next day assailed by the
Confederate artillery as a prelude to Pickett’s infantry
assault.</p>
<p>It was the “crest of the ridge,” not the Round Top,
that Lee wished to assail. His eye from the first appears
to have been steadily fixed upon the Federal
centre. That is why he ordered the “attack up the Emmitsburg
road.”</p>
<p>Longstreet’s official report is very explicit on this
point. It was written July 27, 1863. On page 358 of
the same book he <span class="locked">says,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“I received instructions from the commanding general to
move, with the portion of my command that was up, around to
gain the Emmitsburg road, on the enemy’s left.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant-General R. H. Anderson, then of Hill’s
corps, also makes this definite statement:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Shortly after the line had been formed, I received notice
that Lieutenant-General Longstreet would occupy the ground
on my right, and that his line would be in a direction nearly at
right angles with mine, and that he would assault the extreme
left of the enemy and drive him towards Gettysburg.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Just here it is pertinent to say that General Longstreet
had the afternoon previous, and again that morning,
suggested to General Lee the more promising plan
of a movement by the Confederate right to interpose
between the Federals and their capital, and thus compel
General Meade to give battle at a disadvantage. On
this point General Longstreet uses the following language
in a newspaper <span class="locked">publication<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_B" id="FNanchor_B">B</a></span> more than a quarter
of a century ago:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“When I overtook General Lee at five o’clock that afternoon
[July 1], he said, to my surprise, that he thought of attacking
General Meade upon the heights the next day. I suggested that
this course seemed to be at variance with the plan of the campaign
that had been agreed upon before leaving Fredericksburg.
He said, ‘If the enemy is there to-morrow, we must attack him.’
I replied: ‘If he is there, it will be because he is anxious that
we should attack him​—​a good reason in my judgment for not
doing so.’ I urged that we should move around by our right
to the left of Meade and put our army between him and Washington,
threatening his left and rear, and thus force him to
attack us in such position as we might select.... I called
his attention to the fact that the country was admirably adapted
for a defensive battle, and that we should surely repulse Meade
with crushing loss if we would take position so as to force him
to attack us, and suggested that even if we carried the heights
in front of us, and drove Meade out, we should be so badly
crippled that we could not reap the fruits of victory; and that
the heights of Gettysburg were in themselves of no more importance
to us than the ground we then occupied, and that the
mere possession of the ground was not worth a hundred men
to us. That Meade’s army, not its position, was our objective.
General Lee was impressed with the idea that by attacking
the Federals he could whip them in detail. I reminded him that
if the Federals were there in the morning it would be proof that
they had their forces well in hand, and that with Pickett in
Chambersburg, and Stuart out of reach, we should be somewhat
in detail. He, however, did not seem to abandon the idea of
attack on the next day. He seemed under a subdued excitement
which occasionally took possession of him when ‘the hunt was
up,’ and threatened his superb equipoise.... When I left
General Lee on the night of the 1st, I believed that he had made
up his mind to attack, but was confident that he had not yet
determined as to when the attack should be made.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>But General Lee persisted in the direct attack “up
the Emmitsburg road.” Hood, deployed on Longstreet’s
extreme right, at once perceived that the true
direction was by flank against the southern slopes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Big Round Top. He delayed the advance to advise
of the discovery he had made. Soon the positive order
came back: “General Lee’s orders are to attack up the
Emmitsburg road.” He still hesitated and repeated
the suggestion. Again it was reiterated: “General
Lee’s orders are to attack up the Emmitsburg road.”
Then the troops moved to the attack. There was no
alternative. Lee’s orders were imperative, and made
after he had personally examined the enemy’s position.
Longstreet was ordered to attack a specific position
“up the Emmitsburg road,” which was <i>not</i> Little
Round Top, as assumed by Gordon. This point is particularly
elaborated because in it lies the “milk in the
cocoanut” of the charges against Longstreet. Without
consulting the records Gordon has merely followed the
lead of some of General Lee’s biographers, notably
Fitzhugh Lee, who asserts that his illustrious uncle “expected
Longstreet to seize Little Round Top on the
2d of July.” The records clearly show that nothing was
farther from General Lee’s thoughts.</p>
<p>After the war it was discovered that a very early
attack on Little Round Top would perhaps have
found it undefended, hence the afterthought that General
Longstreet was ordered to attack at sunrise. But
whatever the hour Longstreet was ordered to attack, it
was most certainly not Little Round Top that was made
his objective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>
<h2 id="toc40">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="subhead">LEE CHANGES PLAN OF CAMPAIGN</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General, I have been a soldier all my life. I have been with
soldiers engaged in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments,
divisions, and armies, and should know as well as any one what
soldiers can do. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever
arrayed for battle can take that position,” pointing to Cemetery
Hill.​—​<span class="smcap">Longstreet to Lee.</span></p></div></blockquote>
<p>General Longstreet’s personal account of this
magnificent battle “up the Emmitsburg road” will not
be out of place here. In the newspaper article previously
quoted from he very graphically describes the
advance of the two divisions of McLaws and Hood, for
when he went into battle it must be understood that even
yet one of his divisions, that of Pickett, was still absent.
He states his total force at thirteen thousand men. An
account of this clash of arms must send a thrill of pride
through every Southern heart:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“At half-past three o’clock the order was given General Hood
to advance upon the enemy, and, hurrying to the head of
McLaws’s division, I moved with his line. Then was fairly commenced
what I do not hesitate to pronounce the best three hours’
fighting ever done by any troops on any battle-field. Directly
in front of us, occupying the peach-orchard, on a piece of
elevated ground that General Lee desired me to take and hold
for his artillery, was the Third Corps of the Federals, commanded
by General Sickles.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption2"><img alt="" height="600" src="images/i_040fp.jpg" width="470" id="img_040"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption2">MAJOR-GENERAL D. E. SICKLES</div></div>
<p>“Prompt to the order the combat opened, followed by artillery
of the other corps, and our artillerists measured up to
the better metal of the enemy by vigilant work....</p>
<p>“In his usual gallant style Hood led his troops through the
rocky fastnesses against the strong lines of his earnest adversary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
and encountered battle that called for all of his power
and skill. The enemy was tenacious of his strong ground; his
skilfully handled batteries swept through the passes between the
rocks; the more deadly fire of infantry concentrated as our
men bore upon the angle of the enemy’s line and stemmed the
fiercest onset until it became necessary to shorten their work
by a desperate charge. This pressing struggle and the cross-fire
of our batteries broke in the salient angle, but the thickening
fire, as the angle was pressed back, hurt Hood’s left and
held him in steady fight. His right brigade was drawn towards
Round Top by the heavy fire pouring from that quarter, Benning’s
brigade was pressed to the thickening line at the angle,
and G. T. Anderson’s was put in support of the battle growing
against Hood’s right.</p>
<p>“I rode to McLaws, found him ready for his opportunity,
and Barksdale chafing in his wait for the order to seize the
battery in his front. Kershaw’s brigade of his right first advanced
and struck near the angle of the enemy’s line where his
forces were gathering strength. After additional caution to
hold his ranks closed, McLaws ordered Barksdale in. With
glorious bearing he sprang to his work, overriding obstacles and
dangers. Without a pause to deliver a shot, he had the battery.
Kershaw, joined by Semmes’s brigade, responded, and Hood’s
men, feeling the impulsion of relief, resumed their bold fight,
and presently the enemy’s line was broken through its length.
But his well-seasoned troops knew how to utilize the advantage
of their ground and put back their dreadful fires from rocks,
depressions, and stone fences, as they went for shelter about
Little Round Top.... The fighting had become tremendous,
and brave men and officers were stricken by hundreds. Posey
and Wilcox dislodged the forces about the Brick House.</p>
<p>“General Sickles was desperately wounded!</p>
<p>“General Willard was dead!</p>
<p>“General Semmes, of McLaws’s division, was mortally
wounded!...</p>
<p>“I had one brigade​—​Wofford’s​—​that had not been engaged
in the hottest battle. To urge the troops to their reserve power
in the precious moments, I rode with Wofford. The rugged
field, the rough plunge of artillery fire, and the piercing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
musket-shots delayed somewhat the march, but Alexander
dashed up with his batteries and gave new spirit to the worn
infantry ranks.... While Meade’s lines were growing my
men were dropping; we had no others to call to their aid,
and the weight against us was too heavy to carry.... Nothing
was heard or felt but the clear ring of the enemy’s fresh
metal as he came against us. No other part of the army had
engaged! My seventeen thousand against the Army of the
Potomac! The sun was down, and with it went down the severe
battle.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Surely these are not the utterances of one who had
been slow, balky, and obstructive on that field. The
ring of these sentences tells no tale of apathy or backwardness
because his advice to pursue a different line
of operations had been ignored by Lee.</p>
<p>General Gordon, continuing, very complacently assumes
that “two of the largest corps of Meade’s army
would not have been in the fight” of the 2d had Longstreet
attacked early in the morning. He refers to the
Union Fifth and Sixth Corps. That statement is correct
only as regards the Sixth Corps, which, it is true,
did not arrive on the field until late in the afternoon.
But it took only a slight part at dark on the 2d, when
the battle was over. Indeed, as it was so slightly engaged,
the hour of its arrival at Gettysburg is unimportant.
The losses of the different corps conclusively
show what part the Sixth, which was the largest in the
army, took in the battle of the 2d of July; as given in
the Rebellion Records:</p>
<p>Killed and wounded: First Corps, 3980; Second
Corps, 3991; Third Corps, 3662; Fifth Corps, 1976;
Sixth Corps, 212; Eleventh Corps, 2353; Twelfth
Corps, 1016.</p>
<p>Its non-participation strongly militates against the
spirit of Gordon’s argument, in that Meade entirely
frustrated Lee’s plans and defeated the Confederate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
army, scarcely using the Sixth Corps, some fifteen thousand
men, at all. This is a significant commentary on
the anti-Longstreet assumption of how easy it was to
win at Gettysburg if only Longstreet had obeyed
orders!</p>
<p>At sunrise on the 2d, the hour at which Longstreet’s
critics would have had this attack delivered, the Federal
Fifth Corps was as near the battle-ground of that day
as Longstreet’s troops. Longstreet’s troops were bivouacked
the night previous at Marsh Creek, four miles
west of Gettysburg. They began to arrive near Lee’s
head-quarters on Seminary Ridge not earlier than 7
<span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> of the 2d, and the last of the column did not get in
until near noon. Then they were still five miles by the
route pursued from the chosen point of attack.</p>
<p>The Union Fifth Corps was bivouacked five miles
east of Gettysburg about the same hour on the 1st that
Longstreet’s tired infantry reached Marsh Creek. At
four o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> of the 2d they marched on Gettysburg,
arriving about the same hour that Longstreet’s troops
were being massed near Lee’s head-quarters, and were
thereupon posted upon the extreme Federal right.</p>
<p>Upon the first manifestation of Confederate movements
on the right and left, we know that the Fifth
Corps was immediately drawn in closer, and about nine
o’clock massed at the bridge over Rock Creek on the
Baltimore pike, ready for developments. Meade
thought Lee intended to attack his right. That Lee
contemplated it is quite certain. Colonel Venable, of
his staff, was sent about sunrise to consult with Lieutenant-General
Ewell upon the feasibility of a general
attack from his front. Lee wanted Ewell’s views as to
the advisability of moving all the available troops
around to that front for such a purpose. Venable and
Ewell rode from point to point to determine if this
should be done. Finally, Venable says, Lee himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
came to Ewell’s lines, and eventually the design for an
attack on the Union right was abandoned.</p>
<p>Where the Fifth Corps was finally massed, it was
only one and a half miles in the rear of General Sickles’s
position. Moreover, it had an almost direct road to
that point. This facility for reinforcing incidentally
illustrates the advantages of the Union position. At
the same hour General Longstreet’s troops were still
massed near the Chambersburg pike, three miles on a
straight line from the point of attack. That is to say,
Longstreet had twice as far to march on an air-line to
strike Sickles “up the Emmitsburg road” as Sykes had
to reinforce the threatened point. But, in fact, Sykes’s
advantage was far greater in point of time, because, by
order of Lee, Longstreet was compelled to move by
back roads and lanes, out of sight of the enemy’s signal
officers on Round Top. His troops actually marched
six or seven miles to reach the point of deployment.</p>
<p>Longstreet eventually attacked about 4 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, and the
Fifth Corps was used very effectively against him.
But no historian who esteems the truth, with the undisputed
records before him, will deny that it could and
would have been used just as effectively at seven or
eight o’clock in the morning. The moment Longstreet’s
movement was detected it was immediately hurried over
to the left and occupied Round Top. If Longstreet
had moved earlier, the Fifth Corps also would have
moved earlier. It could have been on Sickles’s left and
rear as early as seven o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, had it been necessary.
If Ewell and not Longstreet had delivered the general
attack it would have been found in his front.</p>
<p>It is mathematically correct to say that the troops
which met Longstreet on the afternoon of the 2d could
have been brought against him in the morning. The
reports of General Meade, General Sykes, the commander
of the Fifth Corps of Sykes’s brigade, and regimental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
commanders, and various other documentary
history bearing on the subject, are convincing upon this
point.</p>
<p>General Sickles’s advance was made in consequence
of the Confederate threatening, and would have been
sooner or later according as that threatening was made.
The critics ignore this fact.</p>
<p>General Longstreet says on this point:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Meade was with General Sickles discussing the
feasibility of moving the Third Corps back to the line originally
assigned for it; the discussion was cut short by the opening
of the Confederate battle. If that opening had been delayed
thirty or forty minutes, Sickles’s corps would have been
drawn back to the general line, and my first deployment would
have enveloped Little Round Top and carried it before it could
have been strongly manned. The point should have been that
the battle was opened too soon.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>So much for one part of Gordon’s assumption, based
upon other assumptions founded upon an erroneous
presumption, that if Longstreet had taken wings and
flown on an air-line from his bivouac at Marsh Creek to
the Federal left and attacked at sunrise he would have
found no enemy near the Round Tops.</p>
<p>In another equally unwarranted assumption of what
the “impartial” military critic will consider an “established
fact,” Gordon declares:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Secondly, that General Lee ordered Longstreet to attack at
daylight on the morning of the third day, and that the latter
did not attack until two or three o’clock in the afternoon, the
artillery opening at one.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Lee himself mentions no such order. In his final
report, penned six months afterwards, he merely mentions
that the “general plan was unchanged,” and
Longstreet, reinforced, ordered to attack “next morning,”
no definite hour being fixed. It is significant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
however, that in his letter to Jefferson Davis from the
field, dated July 4, Lee uses this language:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Next day (July 3), the third division of General Longstreet’s
corps having come up, a more extensive attack was
made,” etc.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The “third division” was Pickett’s, which did not
arrive from Chambersburg until 9 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> of the 3d. In
the same report, Lee himself states that “Pickett, with
three of his brigades, joined Longstreet the following
morning.” There is no dispute, however, about the hour
of Pickett’s arrival.</p>
<p>So that, as Pickett was selected by Lee to lead the
charge, and as Lee knew exactly where Pickett was, it is
morally impossible that it was fixed for daylight, five
hours before Pickett’s troops were up.</p>
<p>In one place Lee remarks in his report: “The morning
was occupied in <i>necessary</i> preparations, and the
battle recommenced in the afternoon of the 3d.” Time
was not an essential element in the problem of the 3d.
The Federal army was then all up, whereas Pickett’s
Confederate division was still absent. The delay of a
few hours was therefore a distinct gain for the Confederates,
and not prejudicial, as Gordon would have
the world believe.</p>
<p>But Longstreet’s official report is decisive of the
whole question. He <span class="locked">says,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“On the following morning (that is, after the fight of the
2d) our arrangements were made for renewing the attack by my
right, with a view to pass round the hill occupied by the enemy’s
left, and gain it by flank and reverse attack. A few moments
after my orders for the execution of this plan were given, the
commanding general joined me, and ordered a column of attack
to be formed of Pickett’s, Heth’s, and part of Pender’s divisions,
the assault to be made directly at the enemy’s main position, the
Cemetery Hill.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Clearly this shows that Longstreet had no orders for
the morning of July 3. As Longstreet’s report passed
through Lee’s hands, the superior would most certainly
have returned it to the subordinate for correction if
there were errors in it. This he did not do, neither did
Lee indorse upon the document itself any dissent from
its tenor.</p>
<p>As Pickett did not come up until 9 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, and as General
Lee says “the morning was occupied in <i>necessary</i>
preparations,” it was logistically and morally impossible
to make an attack at daylight, and General Longstreet
states that it could not have been delivered sooner than
it was.</p>
<p>Finally, Longstreet emphatically denies that Lee
ordered him to attack at daylight on the 3d. He says
that he had no orders of any kind on that morning until
Lee personally came over to his front and ordered the
Pickett charge. No early attack was possible under the
conditions imposed by Lee to use Pickett’s, Pettigrew’s,
and Pender’s troops, widely separated.</p>
<p>But without any orders from Lee, as is quite apparent,
Longstreet had already given orders for a flank
attack by the southern face of Big Round Top, as an
alternative to directly attacking again the impregnable
heights from which he had been repulsed the night
before. That would have been “simple madness,” to
quote the language of the Confederate General Law.
But such an act of “simple madness” was the only daylight
attack possible from Longstreet’s front on the
morning of the 3d. Lee substituted for the feasible
early attack projected by Longstreet the Pickett movement
straight on Cemetery Heights which it required
hours of preparation to fulminate, and which proved
the most disastrous and destructive in Confederate
annals. It was, in fact, the death-knell of the Southern
republic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
In his published <span class="locked">memoirs,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_C" id="FNanchor_C">C</a></span> page 385, General Longstreet
makes this concise statement in regard to Lee’s
alleged orders for the early morning operations on the
3d: “He [General Lee] did not give or send me orders
for the morning of the third day, nor did he reinforce
me by Pickett’s brigades for morning attack. As his
head-quarters were about four miles from the command,
I did not ride over, but sent, to report the work of the
second day. In the absence of orders, I had scouting
parties out during the night in search of a way by which
we might strike the enemy’s left and push it down
towards his centre. I found a way that gave some
promise of results, and was about to move the command
when he [Lee] rode over after sunrise and gave his
orders.”</p>
<p>But in his paper of 1877, on Gettysburg, herein-before
freely quoted from, General Longstreet goes
more into detail with relation to Lee’s plans and orders
for the morning of the 3d, and more fully discloses the
genesis of the Pickett charge. In this account his own
opposition to a renewal of the attack on Cemetery
Hill is developed and the obvious reasons therefor. As
he is confirmed in nearly every particular by participants
and by the records, his account is here reprinted:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“On the next morning he came to see me, and, fearing that
he was still in his disposition to attack, I tried to anticipate him
by saying, ‘General, I have had my scouts out all night, and I
find that you still have an excellent opportunity to move around
to the right of Meade’s army and manœuvre him into attacking
us.’ He replied, pointing with his fist at Cemetery Hill, ‘The
enemy is there, and I am going to strike him.’ I felt then that
it was my duty to express my convictions. I said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span> ‘General, I
have been a soldier all my life. I have been with soldiers engaged
in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments,
divisions, and armies, and should know as well as any one what
soldiers can do. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men
ever arrayed for battle can take that position,’ pointing to Cemetery
Hill.</p>
<p>“General Lee, in reply to this, ordered me to prepare
Pickett’s division for the attack. I should not have been so
urgent had I not foreseen the hopelessness of the proposed
assault. I felt that I must say a word against the sacrifice of
my men; and then I felt that my record was such that General
Lee would or could not misconstrue my motives. I said no
more, however, but turned away. The most of the morning
was consumed in waiting for Pickett’s men and getting into
position.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>To make the attitude of the superior and his subordinate
more clear in relation to the proposed desperate
throw of General Lee for victory, and to further explain
the foregoing protest of General Longstreet, quotations
from a second paper of the series printed in 1877
are here given, in which he <span class="locked">says,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“In my first article I declared that the invasion of Pennsylvania
was a movement that General Lee and his council agreed
should be defensive in tactics, while of course it was offensive
in strategy; that the campaign was conducted on this plan until
we had left Chambersburg, when, owing to the absence of our
cavalry and our consequent ignorance of the enemy’s whereabouts,
we collided with them unexpectedly, and that General
Lee had lost the matchless equipoise that usually characterized
him, and through excitement and the doubt that enveloped the
enemy’s movements, changed the whole plan of the campaign
and delivered a battle under ominous circumstances.”</p></div></blockquote>

<h2 id="toc50">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="subhead">PICKETT’S CHARGE</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Pickett swept past our artillery in splendid style, and the men
marched steadily and compactly down the slope. As they started up
the ridge over one hundred cannon from the breastworks of the
Federals hurled a rain of canister, grape, and shell down upon
them; still they pressed on until half-way up the slope, when the
crest of the hill was lit with a solid sheet of flame as the masses of
infantry rose and fired. When the smoke cleared away Pickett’s
division was gone. Nearly two-thirds of his men lay dead on the
field.”​—​<span class="smcap">Longstreet on Pickett’s Charge.</span></p></div></blockquote>
<p>General Longstreet’s description of the Pickett
charge itself also throws much light on these old controversies.
It is confirmed in all essential particulars by
General Alexander and others who have written on the
subject since the war, and also by the reports:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“The plan of assault was as follows: Our artillery was to be
massed in a wood from which Pickett was to charge, and it was
to pour a continuous fire upon the cemetery. Under cover of
this fire, and supported by it, Pickett was to charge. General
E. P. Alexander, a brave and gifted officer, being at the head
of the column, and being first in position, and being besides an
officer of unusual promptness, sagacity, and intelligence, was
given charge of the artillery. The arrangements were completed
about one o’clock. General Alexander had arranged that
a battery of seven 11-pound howitzers, with fresh horses and
full caissons, were to charge with Pickett, at the head of his
line, but General Pendleton, from whom the guns had been borrowed,
recalled them just before the charge was made, and thus
deranged this wise plan.</p>
<p>“Never was I so depressed as upon that day. I felt that
my men were to be sacrificed, and that I should have to order
them to make a hopeless charge. I had instructed General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span> Alexander,
being unwilling to trust myself with the entire responsibility,
to carefully observe the effect of the fire upon the enemy,
and when it began to tell to notify Pickett to begin the assault.
I was so much impressed with the hopelessness of the charge
that I wrote the following note to General Alexander:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“‘If the artillery fire does not have the effect to drive off the enemy
or greatly demoralize him, so as to make our efforts pretty certain, I
would prefer that you should not advise General Pickett to make the
charge. I shall rely a great deal on your judgment to determine the
matter, and shall expect you to let Pickett know when the moment offers.’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“To my note the general replied as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“‘I will only be able to judge the effect of our fire upon the enemy
by his return fire, for his infantry is but little exposed to view, and the
smoke will obscure the whole field. If, as I infer from your note, there
is an alternative to this attack, it should be carefully considered before
opening our fire, for it will take all of the artillery ammunition we have
left to test this one thoroughly, and if the result is unfavorable, we will
have none left for another effort, and even if this is entirely successful it
can only be so at a very bloody cost.’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“I still desired to save my men, and felt that if the artillery
did not produce the desired effect I would be justified in holding
Pickett off. I wrote this note to Colonel Walton at exactly
1.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“‘Let the batteries open. Order great precision in firing. If the batteries
at the peach-orchard cannot be used against the point we intend
attacking, let them open on the enemy at Rocky Hill.’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“The cannonading which opened along both lines was grand.
In a few moments a courier brought a note to General Pickett
(who was standing near me) from Alexander, which, after reading,
he handed to me. It was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“‘If you are coming at all you must come at once, or I cannot give
you proper support; but the enemy’s fire has not slackened at all; at
least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself.’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“After I had read the note Pickett said to me, ‘General,
shall I advance?’ My feelings had so overcome me that I would
not speak for fear of betraying my want of confidence to him.
I bowed affirmation and turned to mount my horse. Pickett<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
immediately said, ‘I shall lead my division forward, sir.’ I
spurred my horse to the wood where Alexander was stationed
with artillery. When I reached him he told me of the disappearance
of the seven guns which were to have led the charge
with Pickett, and that his ammunition was so low that he could
not properly support the charge. I at once ordered him to
stop Pickett until the ammunition had been replenished. He
informed me that he had no ammunition with which to replenish.
I then saw that there was no help for it, and that Pickett must
advance under his orders. He swept past our artillery in splendid
style, and the men marched steadily and compactly down
the slope. As they started up the ridge over one hundred
cannon from the breastworks of the Federals hurled a rain of
canister, grape, and shell down upon them; still they pressed
on until half-way up the slope, when the crest of the hill was lit
with a solid sheet of flame as the masses of infantry rose and
fired. When the smoke cleared away Pickett’s division was gone.
Nearly two-thirds of his men lay dead on the field, and the survivors
were sullenly retreating down the hill. Mortal man could
not have stood that fire. In half an hour the contested field was
cleared and the battle of Gettysburg was over.</p>
<p>“When this charge had failed I expected that of course the
enemy would throw himself against our shattered ranks and
try to crush us. I sent my staff-officers to the rear to assist in
rallying the troops, and hurried to our line of batteries as the
only support that I could give them, knowing that my presence
would impress upon every one of them the necessity of holding
the ground to the last extremity. I knew if the army was to be
saved those batteries must check the enemy.”</p></div></blockquote>

<h2 id="toc53">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="subhead">GORDON’S “ESTABLISHED FACTS” AND PENDLETON’S
FULMINATIONS</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>No officer in a position to know anything about the matter confirmed
Pendleton’s statement, while everybody who should have been
aware of such an important order directly contradicted it, as do all
the records.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Continuing on the subject of Longstreet’s alleged
disobedience, Gordon considers the following as another
of the “facts established:”</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Thirdly, that General Lee, according to the testimony of
Colonel Walter Taylor, Colonel C. S. Venable, and General
A. L. Long, who were present when the order was given, ordered
Longstreet to make the attack on the last day with the three
divisions of his own corps and two divisions of A. P. Hill’s corps,
and that instead of doing so Longstreet sent only fourteen
thousand men to assail Meade’s army in the latter’s strong and
heavily intrenched position.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>This is the old story that Longstreet was culpable in
not sending McLaws and Hood to the attack with
Pickett.</p>
<p>But, in fact, Lee’s own utterances show that McLaws
and Hood were not to join in the Pickett attack, but,
on the contrary, were excluded for other vital service by
Lee’s specific directions. It is true this was done upon
Longstreet’s strenuous representations that twenty
thousand Federals were massed behind the Round Top
to swoop down on the Confederate flank if Hood and
McLaws were withdrawn. After viewing the ground
himself Lee acquiesced. The eye-witnesses quoted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Gordon heard only the original order; they evidently
did not know of its necessary modification, after Lee
was made aware by his own personal observations and
by Longstreet’s explanations that it was impossible to
withdraw Hood and McLaws.</p>
<p>The official reports of both Lee and Longstreet are
conclusive on this point, and they substantially agree.
In the paragraph quoted in the preceding chapter,
Longstreet states explicitly that “the commanding
general joined me” (on the far right on the morning of
the 3d) “and ordered a column of attack to be formed
of Pickett’s, Heth’s, and part of Pender’s divisions,”
etc. If this was a misstatement, why did not Lee correct
it before sending the report to the War Department?
He did not; on the contrary, Lee corroborates
Longstreet in these paragraphs of his own official report,
in which he also explains in detail why McLaws
and Hood were not ordered forward with Pickett:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Longstreet was delayed by a force occupying the
high rocky hills on the enemy’s extreme left, from which his
troops could be attacked in reverse as they advanced. His operations
had been embarrassed the day previous by the same cause,
and he now deemed it necessary to defend his flank and rear with
the divisions of Hood and McLaws. He was therefore reinforced
by Heth’s division and two brigades of Pender’s....
General Longstreet ordered forward the column of attack, consisting
of Pickett’s and Heth’s divisions in two lines, Pickett
on the right.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Now, one of Lee’s favorite officers, General Pickett,
had personal supervision of the formation of the attacking
column. General Lee was for a time personally
present while this work was going on, conversing with
Pickett concerning the proper dispositions and making
various suggestions. He therefore knew by personal
observation, before the charge was made, exactly what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
troops were included and what were not. He knew that
the extreme right of Hood’s division was at that
moment fully three miles away, holding a difficult position
in face of an overwhelming force of Federals, and
McLaws almost equally distant.</p>
<p>With these documents before him, how can Gordon
believe it an “established fact” that Lee expected McLaws
and Hood to take part in the Pickett charge?</p>
<p>It is admitted by almost if not quite all authority on
the subject that Pickett’s charge was hopeless. The
addition of McLaws and Hood would not have increased
the chances of success. The Confederates
under Longstreet and R. H. Anderson had tested the
enemy’s position on that front thoroughly in the battle
of the 2d, and with a much larger force, including these
same divisions of McLaws and Hood, who had been
repulsed. There was every reason to believe that the
position was much stronger on the final day than when
Longstreet attacked it on the 2d. The troops of Hood
and McLaws, in view of their enormous losses, were in
no condition to support Pickett effectively, even had
they been free for that purpose. But it has been shown
above by the testimony of both Lee and Longstreet that
they were required to maintain the position they had
won in the desperate struggle of the evening previous
to prevent the twenty-two thousand men of the Union
Fifth and Sixth Corps from falling <i>en masse</i> upon
Pickett’s right flank, or their own flank and rear had
they moved in unison with Pickett.</p>
<p>Having proved from Lee’s own official written utterances
that the three foregoing points set up by Gordon
cannot possibly be accepted as “established facts,” we
now come to his “fourthly,” which is really a summing
up of the whole case against Longstreet,​—​viz., that he
was disobedient, slow, “balky,” and obstructive at Gettysburg.
He <span class="locked">says,​—​</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Fourthly, that the great mistake of the halt on the first day
would have been repaired on the second, and even on the third
day, if Lee’s orders had been vigorously executed, and that
General Lee died believing that he lost Gettysburg at last by
Longstreet’s disobedience of orders.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The first positive utterance holding General Longstreet
responsible for the defeat at Gettysburg, through
failure to obey Lee’s orders, came from Rev. Dr.
William N. Pendleton, an Episcopal clergyman of Virginia,
on the 17th of January, 1873. General Lee had
then been dead more than two years. In view of what
follows it is well to bear in mind these two distinct
dates. There had been some vague hints, particularly
among some of the higher ex-Confederates from
Virginia prior to Pendleton’s categorical story, but
Pendleton was the first person to distinctly formulate
the indictment against Longstreet for disobedience
of orders. In an address delivered in the town of
Lexington, Virginia, on the date mentioned, in behalf
of a memorial church to General Lee, Pendleton
uses this language, referring to the battle of Gettysburg:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“The ground southwest of the town [Gettysburg] was carefully
examined by me after the engagement of July 1.... Its
practicable character was reported to our commanding general.
He informed me that he had <i>ordered Longstreet to attack on
that front at sunrise next morning</i>. And he added to myself:
‘I want you to be out long before sunrise, so as to re-examine
and save time.’ He also desired me to communicate with General
Longstreet, as well as himself. The reconnoissance was accordingly
made as soon as it was light enough on the 2d.... All
this, as it occurred under my personal observation, it is nothing
short of imperative duty that I thus fairly state.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Rev. Dr. Pendleton was a brigadier-general and chief
of artillery on Lee’s staff. He was a graduate of West<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Point, and was the cadet friend of Lee for more than
three years in the Military Academy. After the war
they were closely associated at Lexington, Virginia.
His fulmination had the effect of a bombshell. There
was a hue and cry at once; corroborative evidence of the
easy hearsay sort was forthcoming from various interested
quarters, but most markedly and noisily from the
State of Virginia, as if by preconcert. Pendleton’s fulmination
appeared to have been expected by those who
had previously been pursuing Longstreet. The late
General Jubal A. Early was particularly strenuous in
unreserved endorsement of the Pendleton story. The
Rev. J. William Jones, of Richmond, the self-appointed
conservator of General Lee’s fair fame, also quickly
added his testimony to the reliability of the Rev. Dr.
Pendleton’s discovery and dramatic disclosure. Those
who approved generally fortified Pendleton with additional
statements of their own.</p>
<p>Pendleton’s statement is characteristic of the whole,
but it was for a time the more effective because it was
more definite, in that it purported to recite a positive
statement by Lee of an alleged order to Longstreet. If
Pendleton’s statement falls, the whole falls.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was astounded when Pendleton’s
Lexington story was brought to his attention. He had
previously paid but little attention to indefinite gossip
of a certain coterie that he had been “slow” and even
“obstructive” at Gettysburg, and had never heard before
that he was accused of having disobeyed a positive
order to attack at any given hour. That false accusation
aroused him to action. He categorically denied
Pendleton’s absurd allegations, and at once appealed to
several living members of Lee’s staff and to others in
a position to know the facts, to exonerate him from the
charge of having disobeyed his chief, thereby causing
disaster.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Colonel Walter H. Taylor, a Virginian, and General
Lee’s adjutant-general, promptly responded as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">

“<span class="smcap">Norfolk, Virginia</span>, April 28, 1875.<br>
</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear General</span>,​—​I have received your letter of the 20th
inst. I have not read the article of which you speak, nor have
I ever seen any copy of General Pendleton’s address; indeed,
I have read little or nothing of what has been written since the
war. In the first place, because I could not spare the time, and
in the second, of those of whose writings I have heard I deem
but very few entitled to any attention whatever. I can only
say that I never before heard of ‘the sunrise attack’ you were
to have made as charged by General Pendleton. If such an
order was given you I never knew of it, or it has strangely
escaped my memory. I think it more than probable that if
General Lee had had your troops available the evening previous
to the day of which you speak he would have ordered an early
attack, but this does not touch the point at issue. I regard it as
a great mistake on the part of those who, perhaps because of
political differences, now undertake to criticise and attack your
war record. Such conduct is most ungenerous, and I am sure
meets the disapprobation of all good Confederates with whom
I have had the pleasure of associating in the daily walks of life.</p>

“<span class="smcap">W. H. Taylor</span>.
</p>
<p class="p0">“<span class="smcap">To General Longstreet</span>.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="p2">Two years afterwards Colonel Taylor published an
article strongly criticising General Longstreet’s operations
at Gettysburg, but in that article was this candid
admission:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Indeed, great injustice has been done him [Longstreet] in
the charge that he had orders from the commanding general to
attack the enemy at sunrise on the 2d of July, and that he disobeyed
these orders. This would imply that he was in position
to attack, whereas General Lee but anticipated his early arrival
on the 2d, and based his calculations upon it. I have shown
how he was disappointed, and I need hardly add that the delay
was fatal.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
The fact that Colonel Taylor was himself a somewhat
severe critic of General Longstreet, through a misapprehension
of certain facts and conditions, gives additional
force and value to this statement.</p>
<p>Colonel Charles Marshall, then an aide on Lee’s staff,
who succeeded Long as Military Secretary and subsequently
had charge of all the papers left by General
Lee, wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>

and should have had an earlier reply but for my engagements
preventing me from looking at my papers to find what I could
on the subject. I have no personal recollection of the order to
which you refer. It certainly was not conveyed by me, nor
is there anything in General Lee’s official report to show the
attack on the 2d was expected by him to begin earlier, except
that he notices that there was not proper concert of action on
that day....</p>

<p class="p2">Colonel Charles S. Venable, another of Lee’s aides
and after the war one of his firmest partisans, made the
following detailed statement, which not only refutes
Pendleton’s Lexington story, but bears luminously
upon every other point at issue concerning the alleged
early attack order of the 2d:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">

“<span class="smcap">University of Virginia</span>, May 11, 1875.<br>
</p>
<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">General James Longstreet</span>:</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear General</span>,​—​Your letter of the 25th ultimo, with regard
to General Lee’s battle order on the 1st and 2d of July
at Gettysburg, was duly received. I did not know of any order
for an attack on the enemy at sunrise on the 2d, nor can I believe
any such order was issued by General Lee. About sunrise on the
2d of July I was sent by General Lee to General Ewell to ask<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
him what he thought of the advantages of an attack on the
enemy from his position. (Colonel Marshall had been sent with
a similar order on the night of the 1st.) General Ewell made
me ride with him from point to point of his lines, so as to see
with him the exact position of things. Before he got through
the examination of the enemy’s position General Lee came himself
to General Ewell’s lines. In sending the message to General
Ewell, General Lee was explicit in saying that the question was
whether he should move all the troops around on the right and
attack on that side. I do not think that the errand on which
I was sent by the commanding general is consistent with the
idea of an attack at sunrise by any portion of the army.</p>

<span class="l4">“Yours very truly,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Chas. S. Venable</span>.”<br>
</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="p2">General A. L. Long, a Virginian, was General Lee’s
Military Secretary and aide at Gettysburg. After the
war he wrote a book,​—​“Memoirs of General Lee,”​—​in
which he endeavored to hold Longstreet largely responsible
for the Gettysburg disaster. But in it he made
no assertion that Longstreet had disobeyed an order for
a sunrise attack on the 2d, or at any other specific hour
on that or the next day. He wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear General</span>,​—​Your letter of the 20th ult., referring
to an assertion of General Pendleton’s, made in a lecture delivered
several years ago, which was recently published in the
<i>Southern Historical Society Magazine</i> substantially as follows:
‘That General Lee ordered General Longstreet to attack General
Meade at sunrise on the morning of the 2d of July,’ has
been received. I do not recollect of hearing of an order to
attack at sunrise, or at any other designated hour, pending the
operations at Gettysburg during the first three days of July,
1863....</p>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Yours truly,</span><br>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>
<p class="p2">The foregoing letters, all written by members of
General Lee’s military family, all his close friends and
personal partisans, are worth a careful study. They not
only negative General Pendleton’s “sunrise” story, but
as a whole they go to prove that it was not expected by
Lee, Longstreet, Pendleton, nor any other high officer,
that an early attack was to have been delivered on the
2d of July. Both Generals McLaws and Hood, Longstreet’s
division commanders, made statements disclosing
that they were totally unaware at Gettysburg of any
order for a sunrise attack on that day. No officer in
a position to know anything about the matter confirmed
Pendleton’s statement, while everybody who should
have been aware of such an important order, directly
contradicted it, as do all the records.</p>
<p>The statement of General McLaws appeared in a
narrative of Gettysburg published in a Savannah paper
nearly thirty years ago. Besides its direct bearing on
the Pendleton story, it furnishes valuable information
as to some of the causes of delay encountered by Longstreet’s
troops in their long march from Chambersburg
on the 1st of July:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“On the 30th of June I had been directed to have my division
in readiness to follow General Ewell’s corps. Marching towards
Gettysburg, which it was intimated we would have passed by
ten o’clock the next day (the 1st of July), my division was
accordingly marched from its camp and lined along the road in
the order of march by eight o’clock the 1st of July. When the
troops of Ewell’s corps (it was Johnston’s division in charge
of Ewell’s wagon-trains, which were coming from Carlisle by the
road west of the mountains) had passed the head of my column
I asked General Longstreet’s staff-officer, Major Fairfax, if
my division should follow. He went off to inquire, and returned
with orders for me to wait until Ewell’s wagon-train had passed,
which did not happen until after four o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span></p>
<p>“The train was calculated to be fourteen miles long, when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
took up the line of march and continued marching until I
arrived within three miles of Gettysburg, where my command
camped along a creek. This was far into the night. My division
was leading Longstreet’s corps, and of course the other divisions
came up later. I saw Hood’s division the next morning, and understood
that Pickett had been detached to guard the rear.</p>
<p>“While on the march, at about ten o’clock at night I met
General Longstreet and some of his staff coming from the direction
of Gettysburg and had a few moments’ conversation with
him. He said nothing of having received an order to attack
at daylight the next morning. Here I will state that until
General Pendleton mentioned it about two years ago, when he
was on a lecturing tour, after the death of General Lee, I never
heard it intimated even that any such order had ever been
given.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The following is an extract from a <span class="locked">letter<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_D" id="FNanchor_D">D</a></span> of General
Hood to General Longstreet on the subject of the sunrise
order, which indirectly, though conclusively, shows
there could have been no such order, besides being interesting
and instructive as to other points:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“I arrived with my staff in front of the heights of Gettysburg
shortly after daybreak, as I have already stated, on the
morning of the 2d of July. My division soon commenced filing
into an open field near me, when the troops were allowed to stack
arms and rest until further orders. A short distance in advance
of this point, and during the early part of the same morning,
we were both engaged in company with Generals A. P. Hill and
Lee in observing the position of the Federals. General Lee, with
coat buttoned to the throat, sabre belt around his waist, and
field-glasses pending at his side, walked up and down in the
shade of large trees near us, halting now and then to observe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the enemy. He seemed full of hope, yet at times buried in deep
thought. Colonel Fremantle, of England, was ensconced in
the forks of a tree not far off with glasses in constant use
examining the lofty position of the Federal army.</p>
<p>“General Lee was seemingly anxious that you should attack
that morning. He remarked to me, ‘The enemy is here, and if
we do not whip him he will whip us.’ You thought it better
to await the arrival of Pickett’s division, at that time still in the
rear, in order to make the attack, and you said to me subsequently,
while we were seated together near the trunk of a tree,
‘General Lee is a little nervous this morning. He wishes me
to attack. I do not wish to do so without Pickett. I never like
to go into a battle with one boot off.’”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Another letter, which in a way is still more important
than any of the foregoing, is one from Colonel John W.
Fairfax, a member of General Longstreet’s staff. It
tends to show that the sunrise-order story was conjured
up by Dr. Pendleton and others at Lexington after
Lee’s death; in other words, it is strong circumstantial
confirmation of General Longstreet’s belief in a conspiracy.
Written more than twenty-six years ago, the
manner in which it dovetails with all the foregoing statements
and documents as to the various events involved
is peculiarly significant. Colonel Fairfax is a Virginian
and was always an ardent admirer of General Lee, but
not to the extent of desiring to uphold his fame at the
expense of honor or the ruin of another:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">

“<span class="smcap">Freestone P. O., Prince William County, Virginia.</span><br>
<span class="l4">“November 12, 1877.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear General Longstreet</span>,​—​ ... The winter after
the death of General Lee I was in Lexington, visiting my sons
at the Virginia Military Institute. General Pendleton called
to see me at the hotel. General Custis Lee was in my room when
he came in. After General Lee left, General Pendleton asked
me if General Longstreet was not ordered to attack on the 2d
of July at six o’clock in the morning, and did not attack until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
four in the evening. I told him it was not possible. When he
left me I was under the impression I had convinced him of his
mistaken idea. I told General Pendleton that you and General
Lee were together the greater part of the day up to about three
o’clock or later; that you separated at the mouth of a lane not
long thereafter. You said to me, ‘Those troops will be in
position by the time you get there; tell General Hood to attack.’</p>
<p>“When I gave the order to General Hood he was standing
within a step or two of his line of battle. I asked him to please
delay his attack until I could communicate to General Longstreet
that he can turn the enemy​—​pointing to a gorge in the
mountain, where we would be sheltered from his view and attack
by his cavalry. General Hood slapped me on the knee, and
said, ‘I agree with you; bring General Longstreet to see for
himself. When I reported to you, your answer was, ‘It is
General Lee’s order; the time is up,​—​attack at once.’ I lost
no time in repeating the same to General Hood, and remained
with him to see the attack, which was made instantly. We had
a beautiful view of the enemy’s left from Hood’s position, which
was close up to him. He gave way quickly. General Hood
charged, and I spurred to report to you; found you with hat
in hand, cheering on General McLaws’s division....</p>

“<span class="smcap">John W. Fairfax</span>.”<br>

<p class="p2">General Longstreet’s views at the time of the Gettysburg
operations are conveyed in a personal letter of a
confidential nature, written only twenty days after the
event to his uncle in Georgia, upon being made aware
that there was a sly undercurrent of misrepresentation
of his course current in certain circles of the army:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">

“<span class="smcap">Camp Culpeper Court-House</span>,<br>
<span class="l4">“July 24, 1863.</span><br>
</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Uncle</span>,​—​Your letters of the 13th and 14th were
received on yesterday. As to our late battle I cannot say much.
I have no right to say anything, in fact, but will venture a little
for you alone. If it goes to aunt and cousins it must be under
promise that it will go no farther. The battle was not made as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
I would have made it. My idea was to throw ourselves between
the enemy and Washington, select a strong position, and force
the enemy to attack us. So far as is given to man the ability
to judge, we may say with confidence that we should have destroyed
the Federal army, marched into Washington, and dictated
our terms, or at least held Washington and marched over
as much of Pennsylvania as we cared to, had we drawn the
enemy into attack upon our carefully chosen position in his rear.
General Lee chose the plans adopted, and he is the person appointed
to choose and to order. I consider it a part of my
duty to express my views to the commanding general. If he
approves and adopts them, it is well; if he does not, it is my
duty to adopt his views and to execute his orders as faithfully
as if they were my own. I cannot help but think that great
results would have been obtained had my views been thought
better of, yet I am much inclined to accept the present condition
as for the best. I hope and trust that it is so. Your programme
would all be well enough had it been practicable, and
was duly thought of, too. I fancy that no good ideas upon
that campaign will be mentioned at any time that did not receive
their share of consideration by General Lee. The few things
that he might have overlooked himself were, I believe, suggested
by myself. As we failed, I must take my share of the responsibility.
In fact, I would prefer that all the blame should rest
upon me. As General Lee is our commander, he should have
the support and influence we can give him. If the blame, if
there is any, can be shifted from him to me, I shall help him
and our cause by taking it. I desire, therefore, that all the
responsibility that can be put upon me shall go there and shall
remain there. The truth will be known in time, and I leave that
to show how much of the responsibility of Gettysburg rests on
my shoulders....</p>

<p class="p2">Aside from all this irrefragable personal testimony
of conspicuous participants disproving Pendleton’s
apocryphal story, there is other evidence still more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
conclusive that no sunrise order for attack by Longstreet
was given by Lee, and equally strong that an
early attack on that day was out of the question. The
position of Longstreet’s troops, all still absent from
the field and on the march, forbade an attack by
him at sunrise, or at any other hour much before
noon, at the point designated by Lee. General Lee
was well aware of its impossibility. At sunrise Longstreet’s
infantry was still distant from the field, but
rapidly coming up. One brigade (Law’s) was not
less than twenty miles away at the very hour Pendleton
would have had Longstreet attack. McLaws’s and
Hood’s divisions had encamped at Marsh Creek, four
miles from Gettysburg, at midnight of the 1st, and
did not begin to arrive on Seminary Ridge until more
than three hours after sunrise on the 2d.</p>
<p>The corps artillery did not get up until nine or ten
o’clock, and part of it not until noon or after. Pickett’s
division did not begin its march from the vicinity of
Chambersburg, some thirty miles away, until the 2d.
Pendleton’s report, herein quoted, shows how the artillery
was delayed, and the deterrent effect that delay had
upon Longstreet’s advance after he received the order.
Pendleton himself was the chief of artillery, and largely
responsible for its manœuvres.</p>
<p>After their arrival upon Seminary Ridge, the infantry
of Hood and McLaws was massed in a field
within musket shot of General Lee’s head-quarters, and
there rested until the troops took arms for the march to
the point of attack. From this point of rest near Lee’s
head-quarters to the point of attack, by the circuitous
route selected by Pendleton, was between five and seven
miles.</p>
<p>So that Longstreet’s infantry, the nearest at hand,
had from nine to eleven miles to march to reach the
selected point of attack, the greater part of which march<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
by the back roads and ravines, to avoid the observation
of the enemy, was necessarily slow at best, and made
doubly so by the mistakes of Pendleton’s guides, who
put the troops upon the wrong routes. The artillery,
still back on the Chambersburg road, did not all get up
until noon, causing a further delay of the whole column,
as shown by the Pendleton report. General Law’s
brigade, marching from 3 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, arrived about noon.</p>
<p>After they came up all movements were still several
hours delayed, awaiting Lee’s personal reconnoissances
on the left and right to determine the point of attack.</p>
<p>Colonel Venable says that “about sunrise” he was
sent to General Ewell on the left to inquire if it were
not more feasible to attack in that quarter. While he
was riding from point to point with Ewell, Lee himself
came over to see Ewell in person. Lee did not
return to Longstreet’s front until about nine o’clock.
Meanwhile, his staff-officers, Pendleton, Long, Colonel
Walker, and Captain Johnston, by Lee’s orders, had
been examining the ground to the right. Upon Lee’s
return from the left he rode far to the right and joined
Pendleton.</p>
<p>Not until then was the attack on the enemy’s left by
Longstreet finally decided upon. Longstreet said it
was not earlier than eleven o’clock when he received
his orders to move; from the time consumed by Lee
and his staff it was probably later. The front of the
Confederate army was six miles in extent.</p>
<p>Hence matters on the morning of July 2 were not
awaiting Longstreet’s movements. All that long forenoon
everything was still in the air, depending upon
Lee’s personal examinations and final decisions.</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear from this indecision on the 2d
that Lee could not have arrived at a decision the previous
night, as asserted by Pendleton at Lexington long
after the war.</p>

<p>The hour, the feasibility, and point of attack have
now been thoroughly discussed, mainly from the stand-point
of the official records. As supplementary to the
recitations of the official reports of Lee, Longstreet,
Pendleton, and others quoted on these heads, it seems
desirable to introduce just here General Longstreet’s
version of his operations on July 2, published so long
ago as 1877, only twelve years after Appomattox and
two decades before he knew the tenor of Pendleton’s
report. It was given to the world long before the publication
of the official records by the government, to
which he could therefore have had no access. How
closely he is confirmed in all essential particulars by the
records is marvellous. In this regard it is to be noted
that in all these controversies his statements have always
stood analysis in the light of all the evidence far better
than those of his reckless critics. The following is
useful because it comprehensively sums up from Longstreet’s
stand-point all the movements relating to fixing
the point and time of his attack, the movement and disposition
of his troops, and other incidents:</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Lee never in his life gave me orders to open an
attack at a specific hour. He was perfectly satisfied that when I
had my troops in position and was ordered to attack, no time
was ever lost. On the night of the 1st I left him without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
orders at all. On the morning of the 2d I went to General Lee’s
head-quarters at daylight and renewed my views against making
an attack. He seemed resolved, however, and we discussed the
probable results. We observed the position of the Federals and
got a general idea of the nature of the ground. About sunrise
General Lee sent Colonel Venable, of his staff, to General Ewell’s
head-quarters, ordering him to make a reconnoissance of the
ground in his front, with a view of making the main attack on
his left. A short time afterwards he followed Colonel Venable
in person. He returned at about nine o’clock and informed me
that it would not do to have Ewell open the attack. He finally
determined that I should make the main attack on the extreme
right. It was fully eleven o’clock when General Lee arrived at
this conclusion and ordered the movement. In the mean time,
by General Lee’s authority, Law’s brigade, which had been put
upon picket duty, was ordered to rejoin my command, and upon
my suggestion that it would be better to await its arrival, General
Lee assented. We waited about forty minutes for these
troops and then moved forward. A delay of several hours
occurred in the march of the troops. The cause of this delay
was that we had been ordered by General Lee to proceed cautiously
upon the forward movement so as to avoid being seen
by the enemy. General Lee ordered Captain Johnston, of his
engineer corps, to lead and conduct the head of the column.
My troops therefore moved forward under guidance of a special
officer of General Lee, and with instructions to follow his directions.
I left General Lee only after the line had stretched out
on the march, and rode along with Hood’s division, which was
in the rear. The march was necessarily slow, the conductor frequently
encountering points that exposed the troops to the view
of the signal station on Round Top. At length the column
halted.</p>
<p>“After waiting some time, supposing that it would soon move
forward, I sent to the front to inquire the occasion of the delay.
It was reported that the column was awaiting the movements of
Captain Johnston, who was trying to lead it by some route by
which it could pursue its march without falling under view of
the Federal signal station. Looking up towards Round Top,
I saw that the signal station was in full view, and, as we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
plainly see this station, it was apparent that our heavy columns
were seen from their position and that further efforts to conceal
ourselves would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>“I became very impatient at this delay, and determined to
take upon myself the responsibility of hurrying the troops forward.
I did not order General McLaws forward because, as
the head of the column, he had direct orders from General Lee
to follow the conduct of Colonel Johnston. Therefore I sent
orders to Hood, who was in the rear and not encumbered by these
instructions, to push his division forward by the most direct
route so as to take position on my right. He did so, and thus
broke up the delay. The troops were rapidly thrown into position
and preparations were made for the attack.</p>
<p>“We had learned on the night of the 1st, from some prisoners
captured near Seminary Ridge, that the First, Eleventh, and
Third Corps had arrived by the Emmitsburg road and had
taken position on the heights in front of us, and that reinforcements
had been seen coming by the Baltimore road just after
the fight of the 1st. From an intercepted despatch we learned
that another corps was in camp about four miles from the field.
We had every reason, therefore, to believe that the Federals were
prepared to renew the battle. Our army was stretched in an
elliptical curve, reaching from the front of Round Top around
Seminary Ridge, and enveloping Cemetery Heights on the left;
thus covering a space of four or five miles. The enemy occupied
the high ground in front of us, being massed within a curve of
about two miles, nearly concentric with the curve described by
our forces. His line was about fourteen hundred yards from
ours. Any one will see that the proposition for this inferior
force to assault and drive out the masses of troops upon the
heights was a very problematical one. My orders from General
Lee were ‘to envelop the enemy’s left and begin the attack there,
following up as near as possible the direction of the Emmitsburg
road.’</p>
<p>“My corps occupied our right, with Hood on the extreme
right and McLaws next. Hill’s corps was next to mine, in
front of the Federal centre, and Ewell was on our extreme left.
My corps, with Pickett’s division absent, numbered hardly thirteen
thousand men. I realized that the fight was to be a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
one; but being assured that my flank would be protected by
the brigades of Wilcox, Perry, Wright, Posey, and Mahone,
moving <i>en echelon</i>, and that Ewell was to co-operate by a direct
attack on the enemy’s right, and Hill to threaten his centre and
attack if opportunity offered, and thus prevent reinforcements
from being launched either against myself or Ewell, it seemed
that we might possibly dislodge the great army in front of us.”</p></div></blockquote>

<h2 id="toc71">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="subhead">PENDLETON’S REPORT</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Pendleton’s report will destroy many illusions of Lee’s misguided
friends who are unwittingly doing deadly injury to his military
fame by magnifying the mistakes of Gettysburg and ascribing them
to another.”​—​<span class="smcap">Leslie J. Perry</span>, formerly of the War Records Department.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>There is even more positive proof than has yet been
produced. That Lee gave no such order as described in
Pendleton’s Lexington lecture, or for an “early attack,”
as asserted by Gordon now, is absolutely proved
by an official report of Gettysburg, penned by General
Pendleton himself. That Pendleton was an oral falsifier
of history is established by his own hand, under date
of September 12, 1863, only nine weeks after the battle.</p>
<p>Confident in his own rectitude of purpose and conduct,
and far from being an expert controversialist, for
he was without guile himself, it is not at all singular
that the significance of Pendleton’s report in connection
with the Lexington story should for years have entirely
escaped General Longstreet’s notice. He knew that the
document was printed in its sequence in the Gettysburg
volumes of the War Records, and for certain purposes
had even quoted from it regarding other questions. He
was also fully aware that General Pendleton had long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
been distinguished for the unreliability of his memory.
Nevertheless General Longstreet had never analyzed
the report to the extent of observing that it made ridiculous
the reverend gentleman’s version of 1873.</p>
<p>It is most striking that the extraordinary tenor of
this old Pendletonian exhumation of the War Records
office in Washington should so long have passed entirely
unnoticed by everybody, despite the researches of the
most industrious. It remained for Mr. Leslie J. Perry,
one of the historical experts then in charge of the
government publication of the Union and Confederate
records of the Civil War, to point out some nine years
ago how glaringly the Pendleton report of 1863 stultified
the Pendleton story of 1873.</p>
<p>The immediate result of the exploitation of the Pendleton
report was the elimination of the sunrise story
from the repertory of the anti-Longstreet crusaders.
In the subsequent literature of the subject a decided
change of tone regarding other allegations was soon
perceived, more favorable to Longstreet. General
Longstreet was astounded by this bald disclosure of
his old military associate’s tergiversation, to call it
nothing worse. For a time after the appearance of the
Lexington story, he had charitably presumed that, in an
excess of zeal to protect General Lee’s military fame,
Pendleton might really have harbored in good faith the
belief that his Lexington statements were true. But
after reading the detailed analysis of the Pendleton
report, and carefully studying the report itself, General
Longstreet speedily arrived at the conclusion that he
was the victim of a deliberate conspiracy. It is not
strange that he found it hard to forgive the conspirators,
even after becoming fully aware that the world
was practically convinced that he had been cruelly misrepresented.</p>
<p>Let us see how “fairly” Pendleton stated the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
against General Longstreet in his Lexington lecture.
His official <span class="locked">report<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_E" id="FNanchor_E">E</a></span> of Gettysburg was written only
about sixty days after the battle. It was dated September
12, 1863. It is a detailed report of the operations
of the Confederate artillery in the Pennsylvania
campaign, embodying a minute description of General
Pendleton’s personal movements on that day. That is
its only value to this discussion. The paragraphs having
a bearing upon the time of Longstreet’s attack are as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“From the farthest occupied point on the right and front,
in company with Colonels Long and Walker and Captain Johnston
(engineer), soon <i>after sunrise</i> I surveyed the enemy’s position
towards some estimate of the ground and best mode of
attack. So far as judgment could be formed from such a view,
assault on the enemy’s left by our extreme right might succeed,
should the mountain there offer no insuperable obstacle. The
attack on that side, if practicable, I understood to be the purpose
of the commanding general.</p>
<p>“Returning from this position more to the right and rear,
for the sake of tracing more exactly the mode of approach, I
proceeded some distance along the ravine road noticed the previous
evening, and was made aware of having entered the
enemy’s lines by meeting two armed dismounted cavalrymen.
Apparently surprised, they immediately surrendered, and were
disarmed and sent to the rear.</p>
<p>“Having satisfied myself of the course and character of this
road, I returned to an elevated point on the Fairfield road, which
furnished a very extensive view, and despatched messengers to
General Longstreet and the commanding general. This front
was, after some time, examined by Colonel Smith and Captain
Johnston (engineers), and about midday General Longstreet
arrived and viewed the ground. He desired Colonel Alexander
to obtain the best view he then could of the front. I therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
conducted the colonel to the advanced point of observation previously
visited. Its approach was now more hazardous from
the fire of the enemy’s sharp-shooters, so that special caution
was necessary in making the desired observation. Just then a
sharp contest occurred in the woods to the right and rear of this
forward point. Anderson’s division, Third Corps, had moved
up and was driving the enemy from these woods. These woods
having thus been cleared of the enemy, some view of the ground
beyond them, and much farther to the right than had yet been
examined, seemed practicable. I therefore rode in that direction,
and when about to enter the woods, met the commanding
general <i>en route</i> himself to survey the ground.</p>
<p>“There being here still a good deal of sharp-shooting, the
front had to be examined with caution.... Having noticed
the field and the enemy’s batteries, etc., I returned to General
Longstreet for the purpose of conducting his column to this
point, and supervising, as might be necessary, the disposition
of his artillery. He was advancing by the ravine road (as most
out of view), time having already been lost in attempting
another, which proved objectionable because exposed to observation.
On learning the state of facts ahead, the general halted,
and sent back to hasten his artillery. Members of my staff were
also despatched to remedy, as far as practicable, the delay.
Cabell’s, Alexander’s, and Henry’s battalions at length arrived,
and the whole column moved towards the enemy’s left.... The
enemy opened a furious cannonade, the course of which rendered
necessary a change in the main artillery column. Cabell’s deflected
to the left, while Alexander’s was mainly parked for a
season, somewhat under cover, till it could advance to better purpose....
Soon after, at about 4 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, the general assault was
made.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Here is the whole of Pendleton’s celebrated report,
so far as it bears upon the hour of Longstreet’s attack
on the 2d of July. Nothing is omitted relating to the
preliminary movements of Longstreet’s column of attack,
or that in any manner modifies the tenor of the
parts introduced.</p>

<h2 id="toc75">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="subhead">PENDLETON’S UNRELIABLE MEMORY</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>All the battle worthy the name for the Southern cause at Gettysburg
on the 2d and 3d was made by Longstreet. The whole superstructure
of the contentions against his honor as a soldier is based
solely on the statements since the war, and since Lee’s death, of two
or three obscure individuals. They are easily exploded by the records
of the battles; they are corroborated by none.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>When the Rev. Dr. Pendleton told that dramatic
story to his breathless hearers at Lexington in 1873,
under “pressure of imperative duty,” had he forgotten
the tenor of his official report, made in 1863? The story
as modified by the prior report forms the greatest anticlimax
in all history. Several decisive facts are disclosed
by this unbiassed report.</p>
<p>1. Instead of being dilatory and obstructive, Pendleton
himself establishes that Longstreet was personally
exerting himself to “hasten forward” the very artillery
of which he, Pendleton, was the chief.</p>
<p>2. As late certainly as eleven o’clock, if not noon,
General Lee and his staff-officers were still rambling
all over a front six miles long, yet undetermined either
as to the point or proper route of attack. According
to both Pendleton and Venable, they did not <i>begin</i> this
necessary preliminary survey until “about sunrise,” the
specific hour at which General Lee on the night previous
had already ordered Longstreet to begin his attack,
as asserted by Pendleton at Lexington.</p>
<p>3. Not until Lee and Pendleton had devoted the entire
forenoon to the examination of the ground, did
Pendleton go to conduct Longstreet to the point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
attack thereupon decided upon. Evidently Longstreet
was not delaying action; he was awaiting their motions.</p>
<p>The following general conclusions upon the state
of facts disclosed by Pendleton’s remarkable report are
therefore inevitable and unavoidable.</p>
<p>1. At sunrise of the 2d, General Lee himself did not
know where to attack. He did not know as late as ten
or eleven o’clock. His mind was not fully made up
until after he came back from Ewell’s front (about nine
o’clock, according to all authorities), and had made the
final examination on the right. General Longstreet
says he received his orders to move about eleven o’clock,
and this corresponds with Pendleton’s report. But if
anything, it was later, rather than earlier.</p>
<p>2. These painstaking, time-consuming reconnoissances
of the commanding general and his staff-officers,
the journey of Colonel Venable to Ewell, three miles to
the left, and Lee’s later visit to Ewell, together with
the unavoidable absence of General Longstreet’s troops
until late in the morning, prove absolutely that Lee
issued no order for Longstreet to attack at any specific
hour on July 2.</p>
<p>3. Longstreet’s preliminary movements from start
to finish were under the personal supervision of Lee’s
confidential staff-officer, Pendleton, and the subordinate
staff-officers. So Longstreet has positively stated,
so has General McLaws, and both are confirmed by
Pendleton’s report. The staff guide caused a loss of
three hours by putting the head of McLaws’s column
upon a wrong road. This compelled Longstreet to
“hasten matters” by assuming personal direction of the
movement, and pushing Hood’s division rapidly to the
front past McLaws.</p>
<p>4. Pendleton’s official utterances make it an “established
fact” that General Longstreet made his tremendous
and successful attack on July 2 at the earliest moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
possible after receiving Lee’s orders to advance,
under the conditions imposed by Lee,​—​viz., to be conducted
to the point of attack by Pendleton himself and
the other staff-officers.</p>
<p>Thus the misapprehensions respecting Longstreet’s
great part at Gettysburg were cleared away, and a better
general understanding of what actually occurred
was obtained from the Rev. Mr. Pendleton’s report of
September 12, 1863. Few military students now hold
that Longstreet was in the remotest degree culpable for
Lee’s defeat. On the contrary, most of them severely
criticise Lee’s operations from start to finish, particularly
the hopeless assaults he persisted in making, and
for the lack of concert. It is held generally now that
the dreadful result fully justified Longstreet’s protests
against attacking the Federals in that position, and that
his suggestion of a turning movement was far more
promising of success.</p>
<p>In all the circumstances it is not only entirely improbable,
but the developed facts of the battle make it
impossible that “General Lee died believing that he lost
Gettysburg at last by Longstreet’s disobedience of
orders.” Longstreet disobeyed no orders at Gettysburg,
and Lee was well aware of the fact. General
Gordon has simply reiterated the claque set up after
Lee’s death by his fond admirers to shift the responsibility
of defeat from his shoulders upon Longstreet.
It was necessary to the success of that folly to make the
world believe Lee always quietly held that view, and
only imparted it in the strictest confidence to close
friends like the ex-army chaplain, Rev. J. William
Jones, and the Rev. William N. Pendleton.</p>
<p>The evidence is totally insufficient. Its gauzy character
is fully exposed by the Pendleton report. But
apocryphal after-war evidence of this kind was the only
reliance of the conspirators. It is absolutely certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
that there is no evidence of any such belief in any of
Lee’s official utterances during the progress of the war,
nor a hint of it in his private correspondence then or
afterwards, so far as has been produced. The whole
superstructure of the contention is based solely on the
statements since the war, and since Lee’s death, of two
or three obscure individuals. Pendleton’s Lexington
yarn is an example. They are easily exploded by the
records of the battle; they are corroborated by none.
All the battle worthy the name for the Southern cause
at Gettysburg on the 2d and 3d was made by Longstreet.</p>
<p>Another evidence of the falsehoods concerning Longstreet’s
disobedience and Lee’s alleged belief is found
in the relations of the two men. Their personal friendship
continued after Gettysburg as it was before. It
was of the closest and most cordial description. General
Lee always manifested the highest regard for
General Longstreet, and continued to manifest undiminished
confidence in his military capacity, fighting
qualities, and subordination. There is no manifestation
of a withdrawal of that confidence after Gettysburg.
I here cite a few illustrations of their relations after
Gettysburg. Just after his corps was ordered to reinforce
Bragg before Chattanooga, Longstreet wrote
Lee from Richmond, where he had temporarily stopped
on his journey to the new field:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“If I did not think our move a necessary one, my regrets at
leaving you would be distressing to me.... Our affections for
you are stronger, if it is possible for them to be stronger, than
our admiration for you.”</p></div></blockquote>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption4"><img alt="" height="331" src="images/i_078fp.jpg" width="600" id="img_078"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption4">RETREAT FROM GETTYSBURG. ACCIDENT DURING THE NIGHT-CROSSING OF THE POTOMAC ON A PONTOON BRIDGE</div></div>
<p>After the battle of Chickamauga Lee wrote to Longstreet:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“... My whole heart and soul have been with you and your
brave corps in your late battle.... Finish the work before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
you, my dear General, <i>and return to me. I want you badly,
and you cannot get back too soon.</i>”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>These letters, printed in the official records, were
written less than ninety days after the battle of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>“I want you badly” does not indicate that Longstreet
had ever failed General Lee. They are significant
words, so soon after the event wherein Longstreet,
by mere obstinacy and obduracy, had defeated his
chief’s plans, if we may believe Gordon, Pendleton, and
Jones. After the forlorn campaign in East Tennessee
against overwhelming numbers, when General Longstreet
was on his way back to the Army of Northern
Virginia with his troops to aid in repelling Grant, Lee’s
adjutant-general wrote him as follows at Gordonsville
or Orange Court-House:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">

“<span class="smcap">Head-quarters Army of Northern Virginia</span>,<br>
<span class="l4">“April 26, 1864.</span><br>

and have consulted the General about reviewing your command.
He directs me to say that he has written to the President
to know if he can visit and review the army this week, and until
his reply is received, the General cannot say when he can visit
you. He is anxious to see you, and it will give him much
pleasure to meet you and your corps once more. He hopes soon
to be able to do this, and I will give you due notice when he can
come. I really am beside myself, General, with joy of having
you back. It is like the reunion of a family.</p>

</p>
<p class="p0">“To <span class="smcap">General Longstreet</span>.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="p1">After the war was over and the Southern cause lost,
there are warm letters from General Lee, written before
Longstreet had accepted appointment at the hands
of a Republican President. A few months after the
surrender General Lee wrote:</p>

I start it again in pursuit of you, though
you did not tell me how to address you.
I have almost forgotten what it contained,

&amp; of the object that I have in view so that
you may give me all the information in your

I have got the true story, as my only object is
to disseminate the truth. I am very sorry to
hear that your records were destroyed too, but I
hope Sorrel &amp; Latrobe will be able to supply you

<p class="p1">“If you become as good a merchant as you were a
soldier I shall be content. No one will then excel you,
and no one can wish you more success and more happiness
than I. My interest and affection for you will
never cease, and my prayers are always offered for your
prosperity.” Strange words from the commander to
the subordinate whose disobedience at Gettysburg, according
to Rev. Dr. Pendleton and others, led the way
to Appomattox.</p>
<p>While General Longstreet held General Lee to be
a great strategist, he thought him to be less able as an
offensive battle tactician. Those views are shared by
many other military officers, who have of late given
free expression to them. The Gettysburg controversies,
followed by such criticisms, led to the belief that Longstreet
was the open enemy of Lee’s fame, and lost no
opportunity to maliciously decry his military ability.
But this is a mistake. General Longstreet’s intimate
friends know that he has always born for General Lee
the most profound love and respect, both as a man and
as a commander. His views of Lee’s military capacity
are discriminating and just, and they are probably correct.
Longstreet saw things military with a practical
eye. A fine professional soldier himself, who had taken
hard knocks on many great fields, he clearly discerned
General Lee’s incomparable attributes as a commander,
and was never loath to praise them. He also knew Lee’s
weaknesses, and has sometimes spoken of them, but
never in malice or contemptuously. Those who read
his utterances in that sense are very narrow indeed. He
has never, like the mass of Southerners, looked upon
Lee as infallible, yet in one particular Longstreet has
held him to be one of the very greatest of commanders.</p>
<p>As an example of General Longstreet’s estimate of
Lee’s professional place in history, one of his interviews
when on a visit to the Antietam battle-field, published<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
a few years ago, is quoted: “General Lee, as a rule,
did not underestimate his opponents or the fighting
qualities of the Federal troops. But after Chancellorsville
he came to have unlimited confidence in his own
army, and undoubtedly exaggerated its capacity to
overcome obstacles, to march, to fight, to bear up under
deprivations and exhaustion. It was a dangerous confidence.
I think every officer who served under him
will unhesitatingly agree with me on this point.”</p>
<p>In answer to a question as to which he regarded as
Lee’s best battle: “Well, perhaps the second battle of
Manassas was, all things considered, the best tactical
battle General Lee ever fought. The grand strategy
of the campaign was also fine, and seems to have completely
deceived General Pope. Indeed, Pope failed
to comprehend Lee’s purpose from start to finish.
Pope was outgeneralled and outclassed by Lee, and
through improper dispositions his fine army was out-fought.
Still, it will not do to underrate Pope; he was
an enterprising soldier and a fighter.”</p>
<p>General Longstreet, in the interview at Antietam,
summed up Lee’s characteristics as a commander in the
following succinct manner: “General Lee was a large-minded
man, of great and profound learning in the
science of war. In all strategical movements he handled
a great army with comprehensive ability and signal
success. His campaigns against McClellan and Pope
fully illustrate his capacity. On the defensive General
Lee was absolutely perfect. Reconciled to the single
purpose of defence, he was invincible. But of the art
of war, more particularly that of giving offensive battle,
I do not think General Lee was a master. In science
and military learning he was greatly the superior of
General Grant, or any other commander on either side.
But in the art of war I have no doubt that Grant and
several other officers were his equals. In the field his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
characteristic fault was headlong combativeness. His
impatience to strike, once in the presence of the enemy,
whatever the disparity of forces or relative conditions,
I consider the one weakness of General Lee’s military
character. This trait of aggressiveness led him to take
too many chances​—​into dangerous situations. At Gettysburg,
all the vast interests at stake and the improbability
of success would not deter him. In the immediate
presence of the enemy General Lee’s mind, at all other
times calm and clear, became excited. The same may
be said of most other highly educated, theoretical
soldiers. General Lee had the absolute confidence of
his own troops, and the most unquestioning support
of his subordinates. He was wholesomely feared by
the Federal rank and file, who undoubtedly considered
him the easy superior of their own generals. These
were tremendous advantages.”</p>
<p>It is very difficult to detect malice or hatred in these
calm and dispassionate conclusions.</p>
<p>It is most probable that General Longstreet would
have never written or uttered one word concerning
Gettysburg had it not been for the attempt of wordy
soldiers to specifically fix upon him the whole burden
of that battle, their rashness carrying them so far as
to lead them to put false orders in the mouth of the
great captain, and charge Longstreet with having
broken them. To disprove these untrue assertions, and
to give the world the truth concerning the battle, then
became what General Longstreet considered an imperative
duty. He has always regretted deeply that this
discussion was not opened before the death of General
Lee. If the charges so vehemently urged had been preferred
or even suggested in Lee’s lifetime, Longstreet
does not believe they would have needed any reply from
him. General Lee would have answered them himself
and set history right.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
But after all, Longstreet does not fear the verdict of
history on Gettysburg. He holds that time sets all
things right. Error lives but a day​—​truth is eternal.</p>

<span class="subhead">GENERAL LONGSTREET’S AMERICANISM</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“The strongest laws are those established by the sword. The
ideas that divided political parties before the war​—​upon the rights
of the States​—​were thoroughly discussed by our wisest statesmen,
and eventually appealed to the arbitrament of the sword. The
decision was in favor of the North, so that her construction becomes
the law, and should be so accepted.”​—​<span class="smcap">General Longstreet</span> in
“From Manassas to Appomattox.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>It seems advisable here to introduce General Longstreet’s
personal version of the animus of the after-the-war
criticism of his operations on the field of Gettysburg,
taken from his war history, “From Manassas to
Appomattox:”</p>
<p>“As the whole animus of the latter-day adverse criticisms
upon, and uncritical assertions in regard to, the
commander of the First Corps of the Army of Northern
Virginia had its origin in this matter of politics, a brief
review of the circumstances is in order.</p>
<p>“As will be readily recalled by my older readers (while
for the younger it is a matter of history), President
Johnson, after the war, adopted a reconstruction policy
of his own, and some of the States were reorganized
under it with Democratic governors and legislatures,
and all would have followed. But Congress, being
largely Republican, was not satisfied, and enacted that
the States could not be accepted unless they provided
in their new constitutions for <i>negro suffrage</i>. In case
they would not, the State governments should be removed
and the States placed in the hands of general
officers of the army as military governors, who should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
see that the States were reorganized and restored to the
Union under the laws.</p>
<p>“Under the severe ordeal one of the city papers of
New Orleans called upon the generals of Confederate
service to advise the people of the course that they
should pursue,​—​naming the officers. I thought it better
policy to hold the States, as they were organized,
under the President’s policy, shape their constitutions
as directed by Congress, and have the States not yet
reorganized follow the same course. My letter upon
the subject was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">
“‘<span class="smcap">New Orleans, La.</span>, June 3, 1867.<br>
</p>
<p class="in0">“‘<span class="smcap">J. M. G. Parker, Esq.</span>:</p>
<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,​—​Your esteemed favor of the 15th ultimo was
duly received.</p>
<p>“‘I was much pleased to have the opportunity to hear Senator
Wilson, and was agreeably surprised to meet such fairness and
frankness from a politician whom I had been taught to believe
harsh in his feelings towards the people of the South.</p>
<p>“‘I have considered your suggestion to wisely unite in efforts
to restore Louisiana to her former position in the Union,
“through the party now in power.” My letter of the 6th of
April, to which you refer, clearly indicates a desire for practical
reconstruction and reconciliation. There is only one route
left open, which practical men cannot fail to see.</p>
<p>“‘The serious difficulty arises from want of that wisdom so
important for the great work in hand. Still, I will be happy to
work in any harness that promises relief to our discomfited
people and harmony to the nation, whether bearing the mantle
of Mr. Davis or Mr. Sumner.</p>
<p>“‘It is fair to assume that the strongest laws are those established
by the sword. The ideas that divided political parties
before the war​—​upon the rights of the States​—​were thoroughly
discussed by our wisest statesmen, and eventually appealed
to the arbitrament of the sword. The decision was in
favor of the North, so that her construction becomes the law,
and should be so accepted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
“‘The military bill and amendments are the only peace-offerings
they have for us, and should be accepted as the starting-point
for future issues.</p>
<p>“‘Like others of the South not previously connected with
politics, I naturally acquiesced in the ways of Democracy, but,
so far as I can judge, there is nothing tangible in them, beyond
the issues that were put to test in the war and there lost.
As there is nothing left to take hold of except prejudice, which
cannot be worked for good for any one, it seems proper and
right that we should seek some standing which may encourage
hope for the future.</p>
<p>“‘If I appreciate the issues of Democracy at this moment,
they are the enfranchisement of the negro and the rights of
Congress in the premises, but the acts have been passed, are
parts of the laws of the land, and no power but Congress can
remove them.</p>
<p>“‘Besides, if we now accept the doctrine that the States only
can legislate on suffrage, we will fix the negro vote upon us,
for he is now a suffragan, and his vote, with the vote that will
go with him, will hold to his rights, while, by recognizing the
acts of Congress, we may, after a fair trial, if negro suffrage
proves a mistake, appeal and have Congress correct the error.
It will accord better with wise policy to insist that the negro
shall vote in the Northern as well as the Southern States.</p>
<p>“‘If every one will meet the crisis with proper appreciation
of our condition and obligations, the sun will rise to-morrow
on a happy people. Our fields will again begin to yield their
increase, our railways and water will teem with abundant commerce,
our towns and cities will resound with the tumult of
trade, and we will be reinvigorated by the blessings of Almighty
God.</p>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“‘Very respectfully yours,</span><br>
“‘<span class="smcap">James Longstreet</span>.’<br>
</p></div></blockquote>
<p>“I might have added that not less forceful than the
grounds I gave were the obligations under which we
were placed by the terms of our paroles,​—​‘To respect
the laws of Congress,’​—​but the letter was enough.</p>
<p>“The afternoon of the day upon which my letter was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
published the paper that had called for advice published
a column of editorial calling me traitor! deserter of
my friends! and accusing me of joining the enemy!
but did not publish a line of the letter upon which it
based the charges! Other papers of the Democracy
took up the garbled representation of this journal and
spread it broadcast, not even giving the letter upon
which they based their evil attacks upon me.</p>
<p>“Up to that time the First Corps, in all of its parts, in
all of its history, was above reproach. I was in successful
business in New Orleans as cotton factor, with a
salary from an insurance company of five thousand
dollars per year.</p>
<p>“The day after the announcement old comrades
passed me on the streets without speaking. Business
began to grow dull. General Hood (the only one of
my old comrades who occasionally visited me) thought
that he could save the insurance business, and in a few
weeks I found myself at leisure.</p>
<p>“Two years after that period, on March 4, 1869, General
Grant was inaugurated President of the United
States, and in the bigness of his generous heart called
me to Washington. Before I found opportunity to see
him he sent my name to the Senate for confirmation as
surveyor of customs at New Orleans. I was duly confirmed,
and held the office until 1873, when I resigned.
Since that time I have lived in New Orleans, Louisiana,
and in Gainesville, Georgia, surrounded by a few of
my old friends, and in occasional appreciative touch
with others, South and North.”</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p>Mr. Valiant summoned. His will. His last words.</p>
<p>Then, said he, “I am going to my Father’s.... My sword I
give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage
and skill to him that can get it.” ... And as he went down deeper,
he said, “Grave, where is thy victory?”</p>
<p>So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the
other side.​—​<span class="smcap">Bunyan’s</span> “Pilgrim’s Progress.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The personal letters and official reports of Robert E.
Lee, reproduced in this work, clearly established that
from Gettysburg to Appomattox Longstreet continued
to be Lee’s most trusted Lieutenant; their mutual
affection and admiration had no diminution.</p>
<p>The official reports of Lee and Pendleton herein
given make it clear as noonday that Longstreet disobeyed
no orders of his chief at Gettysburg, and was
at no time “slow” or “obstructive” on that great field.</p>
<p>The man who, under the weight of official evidence
massed in this little story, can still raise his voice to
assert that “Longstreet was slow and balky” at Gettysburg,
takes direct issue with the official reports of
Robert E. Lee and the Rev. Mr. Pendleton, and his
becomes a quarrel with the war records.</p>
<p>Longstreet had unhesitatingly thrown up his commission
in the old army and joined the Southern cause
at the very outset. He was a chief participant in the
first and last great scenes of the drama in Virginia. He
had copiously shed his blood for the South. The sum of
General Longstreet’s offending <span class="locked">was,​—​</span></p>
<p>1. When the war was over he placed himself on the
high plane of American citizenship, where all patriots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
now stand. He accepted office at the hands of a Republican
President (pardonable offence in this good
day); these were crimes which the temper of the South
could not condone some forty years ago.</p>
<p>2. He had protested against wrecking the Confederate
cause on the rocks of Cemetery Hill. In sheer self-defence
he was compelled to recapitulate in plainest
terms General Lee’s tactical mistakes and their fatal
consequences. To many that was a crime never to be
forgiven. Yet at the time and on the spot General Lee
was morally brave enough to place the blame where it
belonged,​—​on his own shoulders. Lee never sought a
scape-goat for the mistakes of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>This is the story, short enough for the busy; clear
and straight enough for the young. It is the story of
sentiment as well as reverence and admiration, growing
up from childhood, of him who led the forlorn hope at
Gettysburg.</p>
<p>But behind the sentiment is the unassailable truth.
It is undeniably the story of the records, of the events
exactly as they occurred. It is fully corroborated by
all the probabilities; in no part disputed by one. It is
the story told by General Longstreet himself, and nobody
familiar with his open character and candid manner
of discussing its various phases can doubt for one
instant that he tells the details of Gettysburg exactly
as they occurred, in so far as his personal part was concerned.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption6"><img alt="" height="600" src="images/i_090fp.jpg" width="419" id="img_090"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption6">GENERAL LONGSTREET IN 1901</div></div>
<p>Of him I would say, as his sun slants towards the
west and the evening hours draw near, that his unmatched
courage to meet the enemies of the peace
time outshines the valor of the fields whereon his blood
was shed so copiously in the cause of his country. I
would tell him that his detractors are not the South;
they are not the Democratic party; they represent nobody
and nothing but the blindness of passion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
desires not light. I would tell him that the great, loyal
South loves him to-day as in the old days when he
sacrificed on her altars a career in the army of the
nation; when the thunder of his guns was heard around
the world and the earth shook beneath the tread of his
soldiers.</p>
<p>And as he journeys down to the Valley of Silence,
the true sentiment of the generous South that he loves
so well is voiced by Hon. John Temple Graves, in the
Atlanta, Georgia, <i>News</i>:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“As there walks ‘thoughtful on the silent, solemn shore of
that vast ocean he must sail so soon,’ one of the last of the great
figures that moved colossal upon the tragic stage of the Civil
War,​—​Longstreet, the grim and tenacious, the bulldog of war
whose grip never relaxed, whose guns never ceased to thunder,​—​as
the eye grows dim that blazed like lightning over so many
stormy fields, let the noble woman who bears his name read to
her heroic soldier the message that the South of the present, the
not ignoble offspring of the past, compasses the couch of Longstreet
with love, and covers his fading years with unfading
admiration and unforgetting tenderness.”</p>

<h2> <span class="larger">LONGSTREET THE MAN</span></h2>
<h2 id="toc93">HIS BOYHOOD DAYS</h2>
<p>The original plan of this little work was to publish
only the short story of Gettysburg which was written
while General Longstreet lived. My friends have insisted
that the generous public, although it has received
the prospectus of the work with such warm appreciation,
will be disappointed if I discuss only the one event of
his most eventful life. And so have been added the
paper on the Mexican War and chapters on his famous
campaigns of the Civil War.</p>
<p>They have insisted further that I must speak of
Longstreet the man. I have replied that I could not.
My heart is sore. I cannot forget that he poured out
his heroic blood in defence of the Southern people, and
when there was not a flag left for him to fight for many
of them turned against him and persecuted him with
a bitterness that saddened his last years. They undertook
to rob him of the glories of his many peerless campaigns;
to convict him of treason to his cause on the
field of battle. And when he lay dead, forty years after
his world-famous victories, perhaps from an opening
of the old wound received at the Wilderness, a Chapter
of the Daughters of the Confederacy of the State beneath
whose sod rests his valiant dust, refused to send
flowers to his grave, because, they said, he disobeyed
orders at Gettysburg. And a Southern Camp of the
Sons of Confederate Veterans refused, for the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
alleged reason, to send a message of sympathy to his
family. If I should now undertake to write about him
I might speak of such things as these with bitterness;
and I must not so speak, because I am a Southern
woman, and the Southern people​—​my people​—​must
forever be to me as they were to him, “dear as the ruddy
drops about his heart.”</p>
<p>I must not write about him until I can write bravely,
sweetly, cheerfully, and in this hour it is, perhaps, more
than my human nature can do. And I cannot take the
public into my confidence about the man I loved. The
subject is too sacred. But my friends demand at least
one page on the man as I knew him, that the South at
last​—​the dear South that I love with all my heart​—​may
know him and love him as I did.</p>
<p>And so I undertake to string together disjointedly a
few incidents of a life that was lived upon high levels,
brave and blameless, and that the days give back to me
a glorified memory, coupled with a great thankfulness
that I had a small part in it.</p>
<p>From my childhood he had been the fine embodiment
of my ideals of chivalry and courage. The sorrows of
his later years aroused all the tender pity of my heart.
His wounds and sufferings enveloped him with poetic
interest. He was fighting the battles of my country
before I was born. The blood of my ancestors had dyed
the brilliant fields whereon he led. He was ever the hero
of my young dreams; and throughout a long and checkered
career always to me a figure of matchless splendor
and gallantry.</p>
<p>His life was set to serious work. His father died
before he was old enough to understand the meaning of
a father’s care. He had but little schooling before he
went to West Point as cadet of the Military Academy.
From West Point he went into service in the Mexican
War, and was in every battle, save one, of the war that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
gave to us an empire in wealth and territory; winning
promotions for gallantry on the field. After the Mexican
War he saw long service on the Western frontier.
He entered the Civil War of 1861–65, and the greatest
Confederate victories of that greatest war of civilized
times are inscribed upon his battle-flags. The glories
of Manassas, Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, Chickamauga,
the East Tennessee campaigns, the Wilderness,
the campaigns about Richmond, and the last desperate
struggles on the way to Appomattox, gather about his
name.</p>
<p>After the Civil War came the most trying period of
his life,​—​the dark days of reconstruction, the fierce dissensions
between the sections, and between those holding
different views in the same section, the hot feeling
and prejudices of the time, the struggle to repair the
ruined fortunes of war. When he was finally gathered
to his fathers, at the ripe old age of eighty-three,
he was still in harness, holding the position under
the government of United States Commissioner of
Railroads.</p>
<p>This busy, exciting, and strenuous life was calculated
to develop in him the qualities of the soldier, the man
of affairs, the blood and iron of nature rather than her
gentler qualities. Nevertheless, his heart was as tender
as a woman’s, the sentiment and romance of his being
never ceased to be exerted, and he exhibited to the last
a tenderness of feeling and thoughtfulness regarding
others which were in singular and beautiful contrast to
the main currents of his life. This, I think, will appear
without any special effort to show it as this sketch goes
on.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was born in Edgefield District,
South Carolina, January 8, 1821. His early years were
spent in the country. His father was a planter. Natural
to him was all the vigor and fire of that heroic section,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and still there was in him a coolness, conservatism,
and iron will tempered by justice and fair judgment
embracing the best of his Dutch ancestry. His ancestors
on this side of the water were chiefly the Dents,
Marshalls, and Randolphs, of Virginia. On the maternal
side, his grandfather, Marshall Dent, traced his
line back to the Conqueror. His mother was Mary
Ann Dent, of the family that furnished the lady who
became famous as the wife of the soldier-President,
Grant. His father was James Longstreet. His
grandfather on his father’s side was William Longstreet.</p>
<p>It is interesting here to note that this William Longstreet
was the inventor of the steamboat. He discovered
the principle in a series of experiments about the kitchen
and the mills, and after much care and trouble he was
able to apply the principle. He made a rather pudgy
steamboat, rigged it up with all necessary equipment,
and successfully ran it for some miles up and down the
Savannah River. He did not have the means to develop
it to such extent as to demonstrate to the world its
possibilities. Fully appreciating the importance of
the invention, he appealed to Governor Telfair, the then
governor of Georgia, for aid. Very naturally, the aid
was refused him, for that was a day of scepticism regarding
new-fangled things. He was made sport of
by the people around, and called “Billy Boy,” the
dreamer, and made the subject of doggerel poetry. As
an authentic part of the story, I give here the letter
which he wrote to Governor Telfair, which is still preserved
in the State archives of Georgia:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">

“<span class="smcap">Augusta, Georgia</span>, September 26, 1790.<br>
</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,​—​I make no doubt but you have often heard of my
steamboat, and as often heard it laughed at, but in this I have
only shared the fate of other projectors, for it has uniformly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
been the custom of every country to ridicule the greatest inventions
until they had proved their utility. In not reducing my
scheme to active use it has been unfortunate for me, I confess,
and perhaps the people in general; but, until very lately, I
did not think that artists or material could be had in the place
sufficient. However, necessity, that grand mother of invention,
has furnished me with an idea of perfecting my plan almost
entirely of wooden material, and by such workmen as may be had
here; and, from a thorough confidence of its success, I have
presumed to ask your assistance and patronage. Should it
succeed agreeably to my expectations, I hope I shall discover
that sense of duty which such favors always merit; and should
it not succeed, your reward must lay with other unlucky adventures.</p>
<p>“For me to mention all of the advantages arising from such
a machine would be tedious, and, indeed, quite unnecessary.
Therefore I have taken the liberty to state, in this plain and
humble manner, my wish and opinion, which I hope you will
excuse, and I shall remain, either with or without your approbation,</p>
<p class="sigright b0">
<span class="l1">“Your Excellency’s most obedient and humble servant,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Wm. Longstreet.</span><br>
</p>
<p class="p0">“<span class="smcap">Governor Telfair.</span>”</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="p1">Some time afterwards Robert Fulton took up and
developed the idea. At first he, too, was laughed at and
discredited fully as much as was William Longstreet;
but he finally succeeded in enlisting the patronage of
Gouverneur Morris, a rich New Yorker, and the success
of the steamboat, with all its tremendous meaning to
civilization, was the result.</p>
<p>His father having died when he was but twelve years
old, General Longstreet’s mother moved shortly afterwards
to Augusta, Georgia, where she resided a few
years, after which she moved to Alabama. The education
of young Longstreet was then intrusted to his uncle,
Judge A. B. Longstreet, for many years president of
Emory College, at Oxford, Georgia, and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
most illustrious presidents of that famous old college.
Judge Longstreet was noted as lawyer, judge, educator,
and writer. He is a very poorly read Georgian, a rather
poorly read Southerner, who has not enjoyed and talked
to his friends about that book of wonderful naturalness,
humor, and human philosophy, “Georgia Scenes.” The
author of this book was Judge A. B. Longstreet. In
later years its authorship has been often erroneously
credited to General Longstreet.</p>
<p>Entirely immersed in his college duties, Judge Longstreet
had but little time to give to his youthful nephew.
Of those early days, it is only known that the boy was
not much of a student; that the massive old oaks of
Oxford appealed to him more than the school-room;
that fishing in the streams around and chasing rabbits
over the fields formed his dearest enjoyment. In his
habits and feeling he was then and always near to nature.
The flash of the lightning in mid-heaven interested
him more than the Voltaic sparks of the lecture-room.
He was mischievous, full of fun and frolic, but
beneath all that he was almost from babyhood planning
for a larger career in the outside world and longing to
be a soldier and fight his country’s battles. The books
that he loved most told of Alexander and Cæsar, of
Napoleon and his marshals, of George Washington
and the Revolution. He wanted to do things, not to
study about them.</p>
<p>He received his West Point appointment through a
relative in Alabama, who was a member of Congress.
The appointment came naturally from Alabama, because
his mother was living there. He went to West
Point at the age of sixteen. This was one of the proudest
days of his life; it was the beginning of the fulfilment
of his dreams; he had not an idea that any human
agency could turn him from the soldier course in which
he was directed, or could delay him for an instant. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
yet, while he was in New York City arranging for the
change from the cars to the Hudson River boat, he was
approached by two little boys of guileless appearance,
who told him that their father had recently died away
down in South Carolina, that they had no money, that
their mother had no money, that they just must get to
their dead father, and wouldn’t he help them out. With
a tenderness of heart characteristic of him then and
always, he was about to open to them his purse and
take the chances of never reaching West Point, when
a policeman who had observed the performance approached
and prevented the innocent embryo soldier
from being fleeced by the youthful bunco steerers of the
city.</p>
<p>Arriving at West Point, he proudly went to the hotel
to register and take a room, and was much chagrined
upon being told by the proprietor that they didn’t “take
in kids.” He was directed to the cadets’ quarters, and
his first humiliation there was the further discovery that
instead of being waited on as a dignified soldier should
be by half a dozen servants, he had to keep his own room,
make his own bed, black his own boots.</p>
<p>His thoughts of war had been associated with fierce
fighting, the killing of many enemies, the capturing of
many prisoners. His preconceived idea of a prisoner
was gained while a small boy in Alabama. He had
heard that a prisoner was down at the station, and ran
there full of expectancy to see what a “prisoner” was
like. He discovered a big buck negro, black as midnight,
large as two ordinary men, with countenance
ferocious. His first West Point assignment which gave
promise of the heroic was to guard a “prisoner.” He
was given a gun for the purpose. The figure of the
Alabama darky came to his mind, and he wondered if
the gun were big enough to kill him in case that should
be necessary. Examining it, he discovered, alas! that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
it was not even loaded. Sent to guard a terrible prisoner
with an unloaded gun! When he got to the place
of service he was relieved, surprised, and equally disgusted
by the discovery that the prisoner was a fellow-student
who had broken the rules​—​a poor little weakly,
cadaverous fellow, whom he could pick up and throw
into the Hudson without half trying.</p>
<p>As a West Point cadet, so far as the drilling, the field
practice, the athletics, all the out-door work was concerned,
he sustained himself well. He was very large,
very strong, well proportioned. He had dark-brown
hair, blue eyes, features that might have served for a
Grecian model. He was six feet two inches tall, of
soldierly bearing, and was voted the handsomest cadet
at West Point. As a student of books, however, he
was not a success. They seemed to contain so much that
did not properly belong to the life of a soldier that he
could not become interested enough in them to learn
them. In his third year he failed in mechanics, and did
not “rise” until given a second trial. In scholarship,
he always ranked much closer to the foot than to the
head of his class. He was just a little better student
than his friend, U. S. Grant, which was poor praise,
indeed. But their after careers told a different story.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc100">LIFE-LONG FRIENDSHIP OF GRANT
AND LONGSTREET</h2>
<p>I may be pardoned for digressing here to speak of
the strong school-boy friendship which began at West
Point between Grant and Longstreet and lasted
throughout their lives. Grant was of the class after
Longstreet, but somehow their silent serious natures
were in spontaneous accord, and they became fast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
friends from their first meeting. That one was from
the West and one from the South made no difference,
just as later it made no difference in their feeling of
personal affection that one led the army of the Union
and the other the army of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>After their graduation at West Point they were both
stationed at Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis. The
Dent family lived near by; Longstreet was a cousin.
And he was particularly fond of his cousin Julia Dent!
He took his friend Grant out to see her, and the result
of the introduction was their marriage five years later.
There was such a contrast between her tall cousin James
and her short admirer, Ulysses, that her friends often
joked her about “the little lieutenant with the big epaulettes.”</p>
<p>Grant and Longstreet went through the Mexican
War together, and their boyhood friendship was indissolubly
cemented by the associations of camp life on the
Mexican border. Longstreet went in as a lieutenant
and came out as a major. General Worth apologized,
giving Longstreet’s youth as an excuse for not recommending
him for higher promotion. Promotions in the
army in those days were not so rapid as at the present
time.</p>
<p>The first meeting of Grant and Longstreet during
the Civil War was not a personal meeting; it was when
they were leading opposing forces at the battle of the
Wilderness. It is known to all students of our Civil
War history that the Confederate forces led by Longstreet
were getting all the better of it at the Wilderness
and that the Union forces under Grant were being
driven back, when Longstreet was shot down and carried
from the field. He was <i>leading</i> his men, after
his custom,​—​he never followed, never told them to go,
but always bade them come. He was at this crucial
point at the battle of the Wilderness far in advance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
of his men​—​so far in advance that they mistook him for
the enemy and fired upon him. Shot through the shoulder
and the throat, wounded nigh unto death, he was
taken from the field. With this calamity discovered, the
Confederates held up in their swift advance. The impression
rapidly spread that Longstreet was killed. The
surgeons and attendants who were bearing him to the
rear called out to the soldiers and asked that the cry be
sent down the lines: “Longstreet is not killed, he is only
wounded.” The men who had seen him fall cried out,
“They are fooling us; he is dead.” General Longstreet
has said that he heard both cries; he knew he was
not dead, but did not know how soon he might be; he had
just strength enough left to lift his hat. For this purpose
he exerted that strength, and waved his hat to his
men that they might see that he still lived. But the
genius of the battle of the Wilderness borne to the rear,
even the ever dauntless Confederates could not follow
up the advantage they had won.</p>
<p>The next meeting of these two personal friends and
opposing generals was at Appomattox. In the beginning
of that momentous conference General Lee called
General Longstreet to him and asked him, in case honorable
terms of surrender should not be offered, and in
the ensuing developments it should be necessary for the
Confederates to fight their way out, if he would stand
by him. Longstreet replied that he would fight and die
fighting.</p>
<p>General Longstreet often spoke of the details of the
capitulation at Appomattox. He said that when he
went into the conference-room, in the McLean residence,
as one of the Confederate Commissioners, he was compelled
to pass through the room occupied by General
Grant as his head-quarters. He felt curious to know
how General Grant would receive him. He had loved
Grant as one of his closest boyhood friends, but times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
were much changed. Grant was victor, he was vanquished.
He was therefore prepared to observe the
rigid demeanor of those between whom ceremony only
forces recognition. But immediately he entered the
room Grant rose, approached him with a greater show
of demonstration than ever in the olden days, and
slapped him on the shoulder, exclaiming, “Well, Old
Pete, can’t we get back to the good old days by playing
a game of brag?” At West Point the nickname among
the boys for General Longstreet was “Old Pete.” No
one ever knew why, any more than they know why
this or that college president is designated Peleg or
Squeers.</p>
<p>It has often been related by General Longstreet and
by others that General Lee went into the Appomattox
conference dressed in full uniform, and making withal
the best appearance that this most noble soldier in his
dire defeat could make. General Grant, on the contrary,
had not dressed up for the occasion. He wore
his old fighting uniform, mud bespattered, evidencing
no acquaintance even with a dusting-brush. The important
part of that meeting, the splendid bearing of
the conquered Confederates, the modest demeanor of
the Union victors, and, above all, the noble generosity
of Grant in refusing to accept the sword of Lee and in
giving the fairest terms possible under the existing conditions,​—​these
are known to all who have read United
States history. When General Lee rode back to his
head-quarters from this fateful conference, his half-starved,
ragged, worn-out, worshipful followers saluted
him from both sides of the road. Overcome with emotion,
he dared not look directly into their faces. He
held his hat in his hand and fixed his eyes straight between
his horse’s ears. The parting at Appomattox
between Lee and his officers was most kindly, affectionate,
and touching in every instance. But when General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Longstreet approached, General Lee threw his arms
about him, and, locked in each other’s embrace, the two
wept with a bitterness of regret that ordinary mortals
can never understand.</p>
<p>Soon after the war General Longstreet visited Washington
and was invited to be the guest of a Union officer.
He protested against accepting the invitation, saying
that it was too soon after the fighting. But the insistence
was so cordial as to leave no excuse for refusal.
Once under an officer’s roof, it became his pleasant duty
to pay his respects to the commanding general, who was,
of course, General Grant. Grant received him with all
his old-time cordiality, and invited him to take supper at
his house that evening, saying quickly, as enforcement
of the invitation, that his wife would be anxious to see
him. The evening was pleasantly spent, and upon
taking his leave, General Grant walked to the gate with
General Longstreet, where he said, “Now that it is all
over, would you not like to have pardon?” General
Longstreet replied, with a touch of Southern fire, that
he was unaware of having done anything in need of pardon.
General Grant replied that he had perhaps used
the wrong word, as he was more of a soldier than a linguist;
that he meant to ask if General Longstreet would
like to have amnesty. General Longstreet answered
that he was back in the Union, meant to live in the
Union, was ready at that moment to fight for the Union,
and would be happy if his old friend could place him in
the way of restored citizenship. General Grant requested
him to come again to his office the following
morning, and said that in the mean time he would see
the President and Secretary of War in General Longstreet’s
behalf. In the morning he gave General Longstreet
a letter to President Johnson full of warm interest
and broad-mindedness characteristic of Grant, which is
here reproduced:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="sigright smaller">
<span class="l2">“<span class="smcap">Head-quarters Armies of the United States,</span></span><br>
<span>Washington, D. C.</span>, November 7, 1865.<br>
</p>
<p class="in0 b0">
“<span class="smcap">His Excellency, A. Johnson</span>,<br>
<span class="in4">“President:</span><br>
</p>
<p>“Knowing that General Longstreet, late of the army which
was in rebellion against the authority of the United States, is in
the city, and presuming that he intends asking executive clemency
before leaving, I beg to say a word in his favor.</p>
<p>“General Longstreet comes under the third, fifth, and eighth
exceptions made in your proclamation of the 29th of May, 1865.
I believe I can safely say that there is nowhere among the exceptions
a more honorable class of men than those embraced in
the fifth and eighth of these, nor a class that will more faithfully
observe any obligation which they may impose upon themselves.
General Longstreet, in my opinion, stands high among this class.
I have known him well for more than twenty-six years, first as
cadet at West Point and afterwards as an officer of the army.
For five years from my graduation we served together, a portion
of the time in the same regiment. I speak of him, therefore, from
actual personal acquaintance.</p>
<p>“In the late rebellion, I think, not one single charge was ever
brought against General Longstreet for persecution of prisoners
of war or of persons for their political opinions. If such charges
were ever made, I never heard them. I have no hesitation, therefore,
in recommending General Longstreet to your Excellency
for pardon. I will further state that my opinion of him is such
that I shall feel it as a personal favor to myself if this pardon is
granted.</p>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</span><br>
<span class="l2">“<span class="smcap">U. S. Grant</span>,</span><br>
“<i>Lieutenant-General</i>.”<br>
</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Armed with this letter, General Longstreet sought
President Johnson. In the interview that followed the
presentation of the letter the President was nervous, ill
at ease, and somewhat resentful. He would not decide
to grant the request, and he would not positively refuse.
Finally, he asked General Longstreet to call again the
following morning. At this next meeting he was still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
non-committal, and at length closed the interview by
saying, “There are three men this Union will never forgive.
They have given it too much trouble. They are
Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and James Longstreet.”
General Longstreet said, “Those who are forgiven
much, love much, Mr. President.” Johnson answered,
“You have high authority for that statement,
General, but you cannot have amnesty.” It was shortly
afterwards granted by act of Congress, General Longstreet’s
name being added to a list of prominent Confederate
officers by the especial request of Grant.</p>
<p>These incidents in the associations of Grant and
Longstreet come in naturally in a paper of this kind.
I always think of them together,​—​as chums at West
Point; as comrades in the West and on the fields of
Mexico; as opposing forces in the mightiest war the
world has witnessed; and after that war was ended, as
good friends again in the stronger nation.</p>
<p>President Johnson, who had started out with the plan
of being generous to the South, and for some unknown
reason departed from that policy, conceived the idea of
having arrested and thrown into prison and tried for
treason a number of the high officers of the Confederacy.
He called for a Cabinet meeting to get an endorsement
of this plan, and sent for General Grant to attend the
meeting. He forcibly presented his reasons for the procedure,
and asked for the opinions of those present.
After much discussion there was general acquiescence
by the Cabinet. “The silent man of destiny” was the
last member of the conference to open his lips. He said,
“I will resign my commission in the army before I will,
as commanding general, sign a warrant for the arrest
of any of these Confederate officers as long as
they observe the honorable terms of surrender made
to me.”</p>
<p>It would be easy to write a book about a statement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
like that, but the book when written would not be as good
as the unadorned statement.</p>
<p>The illustrious Union general’s noble generosity to the
conquered South is an old tale. But it is so beautiful
that it bears repetition, and I love to repeat it. I have
digressed from the main line of this paper to pay to
General Longstreet’s boyhood friend the modest tribute
of my admiration. From early childhood I reverenced
Grant. I always regarded him as the greatest
man, the greatest general, the greatest hero on the
Union side. I have now a life-size steel-engraving of
him that I secured when a girl. This was long before I
knew much of that side of his life which has since most
appealed to me. My admiration of him has been in
every way strengthened by the stories General Longstreet
told me of him, particularly the stories showing
his generosity to his foes and his many private and official
kindnesses to the widows and orphans of Confederate
officers and privates. Of these stories I give one
typical of many: When Grant was President, a widow
of a Confederate officer applied for a post-office in a
small Southern town. Hearing nothing of her application,
she came to Washington to press it. She was
unable to move the authorities at the Post-Office Department,
and was about to go home in despair, when
a friend suggested that it might be worth while for her
to see the President. With much effort she summoned
courage and appeared at the White House. The
President received her in a most friendly manner, and
after hearing her story took her application and wrote
a brief but strong endorsement on the back of it. She
hurried in triumph to the Post-Office Department. The
official to whom she presented the application frowned
and pondered over it for some time, and then wrote
under the President’s endorsement: “This being a
fourth-class office, the President does not have the appointing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
power.” The application was handed back to
her, and she went away in deep distress, and was again
preparing to return home, when another friend told her
by all means to take the paper back to the President so
that he might see how his endorsement had been received.
She did so. The President wrote under the last endorsement:
“While the President does not have the appointing
power in this office, he has the appointment of the
Postmaster-General,” and, summoning his secretary,
directed him to accompany the lady to the Department
and in person deliver her application to the Postmaster-General.
It is needless to add that she received the
commission before leaving the office.</p>
<p>While on a tour through the West in 1899, General
Longstreet was entertained in San Diego, California,
at a dinner at the home of U. S. Grant, Jr. After
dinner he requested the company to stand while he
proposed a toast. We expected, perhaps, some pleasantry
or gallant compliment to the hostess. He said:
“Thirty-odd years ago I first met General Grant in
the Civil War at the Wilderness, and there received
the wound that paralyzed my right arm. During the
fiercest warfare this nation has seen, General Grant
was the strongest obstacle that stood between me
and my people and the consummation of the dearest
hopes that they then cherished. Now, in this day of
peace and union, with not a cloud upon the sky of a reunited
country, in the presence of General Grant’s descendants,
under the roof of his namesake son, I want
to drink this toast to the memory of Grant, revered alike
by the brave men who fought with him and the equally
brave men who fought him.”</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>
<h2 id="toc109">HIS FIRST ROMANCE</h2>
<p>Fifty years before the pleasant day in San Diego,
fresh from the fields of his honors and victories in Mexico,
young Major Longstreet had come home to wed
the daughter of his old brigade commander, Colonel
John Garland. She was Marie Louise Garland, a very
charming woman, and so small of figure as to be in
striking contrast to her husband of six feet two. They
were engaged for some time before the breaking out of
the Mexican War. With a lofty deference, which he
bravely overcame in later life, he had never kissed his
fiancée. In setting out for the Mexican War, he said
that he thought, inasmuch as he might get killed and
never see her again, it might not be improper, under all
the sad circumstances, to kiss her. They had ten children,
five of whom died in infancy. A word as to the living
five. A son born in Virginia during the war was named
Robert Lee, after the Southern Commander. This son
served in the recent Spanish-American War, and was,
by happy fortune, a member of the staff of General
Fitzhugh Lee. He is now in the government service
at Washington City. Another son, named James,
after his father, was born in Virginia not long after the
surrender. At the time, General Longstreet wrote to
an absent relative: “This is my Union son, but he has
a yell like the rebel yell when trying to reach the breastworks.
I have named him James, after myself, and I
know he will always be as good a Union man as I am
going to be hereafter.” This son likewise saw volunteer
service in the Spanish-American War. He afterwards
received a commission in the regular army, and is now
serving in the Philippines in the Thirteenth Cavalry.
This Union officer son is a strong Democrat; his brother
in Washington is an equally strong Republican. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
General always taught that political alignment should
be based upon conviction alone. His oldest son, John,
an architect, lives in Atlanta, the youngest son, Randolph,
a farmer, lives on the home place at Gainesville;
the only daughter is Mrs. Whelchel, of Gainesville,
Georgia. There are five grandchildren.</p>
<p>General Longstreet said that he started out in his married
life with the purpose of preserving military discipline
in the family,​—​managing the family as he would
manage soldiers on the field. He soon found that this
would not work, and turned over the chief control of his
home to his wife.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was a great admirer of ladies,
and has often said that he never saw enough of them,
never knew as many as he wanted to know. Into his
soldier life few ladies had come. When he got into
civil life he wondered where all the ladies came from.
After the Civil War he was much petted and kissed
by the ladies of the South, as was the custom with the
old heroes of the war. He submitted to it with something
more than willingness, particularly from the
younger and prettier girls. He always had for woman
in the abstract the tenderest love and reverence. He
considered her the human temple of all loveliness. He
preserved to the end of his long life the romance and
sentiment which, having but half a chance to develop in
his youth, had continued to develop in his later years.
The home was ever to him the holy of holies.</p>
<p>Last summer, at Chicago, he met the daughter of his
first sweetheart, and told her, with beautiful <i>naïveté,</i>
that her mother had been his sweetheart before going to
West Point; that he had meant to marry her when he
got back, though he had not told her so; and on returning,
to his disgust, he found her married to another
fellow.</p>
<p>After the Mexican War General Longstreet served<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
extensively in the Indian campaigns out West. He
considered it his duty and made it his delight, as do all
good soldiers, to go willingly where he was sent. When
choice was allowed him he went where the service was
hardest. He did not ask to dine nicely nor to sleep
warm. A storm cloud was not too rough a covering for
him. He did not seek Olympian sunshine. He could
gladly make the Rocky Mountains his bed, and the war-whoop
of the Indian seeking to disturb the peace of his
country was music to his ears. The highest word that
he knew was duty. His country he loved above all
things else. He served in the United States army for
almost a quarter of a century, nearly always west of the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>When the Civil War broke out he was paymaster at
Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the rank of major.
The country had for years been in comparative peace,
and he had given up the cherished idea of military
glory and high promotion. Where did his duty lie in
this hour? He had loyally served in the Union army
for nearly twenty-five years and through the war that
gave to the nation a rich empire. His State and his
people were now going to fight the Union. The Union
officers with whom he was serving and the Union soldiers
whom he had commanded, pleaded with him to stay
with the Union; their wives and daughters entreated
him and wept over him; the power of vast association
appealed wonderfully to him; but he thought that duty
called him to the service of the South, and no earthly
power could keep him from that service. He sent in
his resignation, and set out at once for Richmond. His
relatives and friends along the way, only taking time
to speak to him as he passed, hastened him on to Richmond.
It was a gala journey that he made through the
Southern country. The music of Southern songs was
borne upon every breeze. The wildest enthusiasm electrified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
town and hamlet; from the open doors of every
farm-house came salutations cheering the passengers
on to Richmond. He was not allowed to pay for entertainment
at any Southern hotel. Everything was free
for those who were going to join “Jeff. Davis for Dixie
and for Southern rights.”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc112">HEROIC CITIZEN OF THE RECONSTRUCTION
PERIOD</h2>
<p>Longstreet entered the Confederate service as brigadier-general,
and reported for duty to General Beauregard
at the first Manassas. After the baptism of fire
at Antietam, in 1862, Longstreet was made lieutenant-general,
next in rank to Lee. This rank he retained to
the end of the war, ranking even Stonewall Jackson.
This fact is especially mentioned, because the last generation
of the South have often confused the rank
secured by their fathers in the war with the paper ranks
given by the Confederacy when the war was over and
that government, heroic in its ruins, had nothing else
to give.</p>
<p>I have heard it said by many Union officers that Longstreet’s
corps, the First Corps, was the terror of the
Union army. I have heard it said that Longstreet was
the only officer in the Confederate army whom Grant
and Lincoln wholesomely feared. He was Lee’s right
arm in very truth. The morning of the battle of the
Wilderness, while President Lincoln was at the War
Department, some one asked him, “What is the best
thing that can happen to the Union to-day?” He answered,
“To kill Longstreet.” It nearly happened, but
by the bullets of Longstreet’s own men, because in so
gallantly leading them he went too far in front.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
After the fall of the curtain at Appomattox General
Longstreet went to New Orleans and engaged in the
cotton and insurance business. He developed in business
the splendid ability that marked him as a soldier.
He was making ten thousand dollars a year at the time
the celebrated difference of opinion came up as to the
course the South should pursue in the rehabilitation of
the war-wasted land. It was then that he wrote the famous
political letter of 1867 that turned the South
against him and made it practically impossible for
him to do business in that section of the country. The
idea that this letter was written to secure political preferment
from the powers in authority is perfectly absurd.
He was making more in business, and would have
made still more and more as the years went on, than he
could make then or ever afterwards in politics. Besides,
to me, and to any one who ever knew the real man, the
idea of his changing his convictions a hair’s breadth for
any sort of gain is too far-fetched for serious discussion.
The very head and front of his offending consisted in
his belief that it was better for the South to accept the
situation then presented; better for the high-class men
of the South to hold the offices than to have the negroes
and scallawags hold them; better for the South to keep
faith with its Appomattox parole, which promised obedience
to constituted authority. It was a few years
after this letter that President Grant appointed him
Surveyor of the Port at New Orleans. He never asked
for this appointment, and was not consulted about it.
President Grant, in the generosity of his heart, voluntarily
sent his name to the Senate, and the first news
General Longstreet had of it came through the press.</p>
<p>General Longstreet never affiliated with the controlling
element of the Republican party in the South. He
believed in a white man’s Republican party in the South,
and therefore was never in favor with the dominant
Republican party in that section that believed differently.
The political appointments that came to him
came because of his high character and his record of substantial
achievement, and in spite of the opposition of
miscellaneous competitive place-seekers. He led a political
movement that has had no following in the Southern
section. It would seemingly have been easy for him to
have acquiesced in the methods of the Republican machinery
in the Southern States which would naturally
have made him the head and front of the Southern Republican
party. It would have seemed easier in an
earlier day for him to have gone with the Democracy,
which would have made him the political idol of the
South, as he had been its military idol. Is is so much
easier to be a demagogue than it is to be a man. It
requires no unusual moral caliber to take a seat on the
band-wagon and go with the crowd. Conscience compelled
James Longstreet to oppose politically, for their
own good, as he saw it, his Southern fellow-countrymen.
He announced his convictions and stood by them. He
never profited, as we measure material benefits; he lost.
The qualities he exhibited in these crucial periods of his
life differentiated the man from the time-server and
place-seeker.</p>
<p>One who loved him and was close to him in life said,
regretfully, not long ago, in speaking of him, that he
never did anything after Appomattox that “turned out
for his own good.” I felt a sudden tightening about
my heart at this criticism. Perhaps as we view worldly
honors and earthly goods the things he did after Appomattox
did not “turn out for his own good.” But to
me he has always been a figure of more sublime courage
in the gathering storms of ’67 and the years that followed
than on any of the brilliant fields of the Civil
War. And I love best to think of him, not as the warrior
leading his legions to victory, but as the grand citizen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
after the war was ended, nobly dedicating himself
to the rehabilitation of his broken people, offering
a brave man’s homage to the flag of the established
government, and standing steadfast in all the passions,
prejudices, and persecutions of that unhappy period.
It was the love and honor and soul of the man crystallized
into a being of wonderful majesty, immovable as
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>“There be things, O sons of what has deserved birthright
in the land of freedom, the ‘good of which’ and
‘the use of which’ are beyond all calculation of earthly
goods and worldly uses​—​things that cannot be bought
with a price and do not die with death;” these, gathering
strength and beauty in James Longstreet’s character,
through the four terrible years of warfare, assumed
colossal proportions in the dark reconstruction era.
And when the story of his life has finally been told,
in all its grandeur, the finer fame will settle not about
the valorous soldier, but about Longstreet, the patriot-citizen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc115">THE CHRISTIAN PATRIOT LOVED THE
SOUTH TO THE LAST</h2>
<p>When General Longstreet quit fighting, he quit
fighting for good. He considered that the South was
back in the Union to stay. There is no doubt in the
minds of many with whom I have talked that General
Longstreet’s conciliatory course, because of its effect in
holding thousands obedient to the laws of the government,
prevented the confiscation of much property in
the South immediately after the war, and greatly alleviated
the trials of that distressing period. The local
ostracism of that day and subsequently cut General
Longstreet deeply. He loved the South with all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
tenderness of one who was willing to die for it. In all
the quiet hours that he discussed the misrepresentations
of the Southern people, the resentment they bore him,
the criticisms and slanders that had been hurled at him,
I never heard him utter a word against them or give
expression to a note of bitterness. But I think towards
the last, exhausted by much suffering, he had a pitiful
yearning for complete reconciliation with all his people.
Not many months before he died an officer of the Northern
armies was calling on him at his hotel in Washington,
and in discussing the Civil War and subsequent
events, and General Longstreet’s part therein, said,
“The Southern people have not appreciated you since
the war, General, but when you are dead they will build
monuments to you.” General Longstreet said nothing,
but his eyes slowly filled. While he bore unjust criticism
in silence, he was visibly moved by any evidence of
affection from the Southern people.</p>
<p>I recall two very beautiful press tributes that appeared
last summer while he was lying desperately ill at
his home in Gainesville, Georgia; one was from the pen
of Hon. John Temple Graves, in the Atlanta, Georgia,
<i>News</i>; the other by Mrs. W. H. Felton, an old-time
friend, in the Atlanta <i>Journal</i>. Mr. Graves, a representative
of the splendid new South, spoke of the new
generations as worthy descendants of the heroic days,
and the place General Longstreet would always hold
in their hearts; and Mrs. Felton, one of the important
figures of the old South, told of the undying love for
him of the soldiers of the Confederacy, and of the place
he had worthily won in the affections of all the people;
she wanted to speak these words to him for the comfort
they would give him; and because he had nobly earned
the right to hear them, and ten thousand times more
from the people whose battles he had fought. When
he seemed out of immediate danger, and strong enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
to understand, I read these tributes to him, and he wept
like a child.</p>
<p>The forbearance of the man and his generous feeling
towards those who used him harshly finally became
a wonder, and is to-day a joy for me to remember. I
will here give an instance or two touchingly illustrative
of this side of his character. General Wade Hampton,
as stoical as ever a Roman was, felt very bitterly
against General Longstreet because of his Republican
politics. He expressed his feelings freely both in public
and private, and was embittered to the extent that
he refused to speak to General Longstreet. When
General Longstreet succeeded him as United States
Commissioner of Railroads, he would not come to the
office to turn it over to his successor. General Longstreet
went to the office, took the oath alone, and endeavored
as best he could to make himself acquainted
with the duties of the position. When he came home
that evening and told me, with evident surprise, that
General Hampton was still bitter against him, I asked,
rather in the hope of getting a reply in criticism of
General Hampton, “What sort of a soldier was General
Hampton, since he seems so intractable in civil
life?” General Longstreet replied, without a moment’s
hesitation: “There was not a finer, braver, more gallant
officer in the Confederate service than Wade
Hampton.” And when General Hampton died, I think
the most splendid tribute paid him came from the pen
of General Longstreet.</p>
<p>Years ago there were political differences between
General Longstreet and Judge Emory Speer, now of
the Federal Bench of Georgia, then a member of
Congress from the old Eighth District of Georgia.
General Longstreet felt that he had been wronged.
The summer before his death we were at Mt. Airy,
Georgia, for a short time. One day I saw Judge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Speer in the hotel where we were stopping, and asked
General Longstreet how he was going to receive him
if Judge Speer should come to speak to him, in view
of their past differences. The General replied, “As I
would receive any other distinguished American. And
as for our past differences, that has been a long time
ago, and I have forgotten what it was all about.”</p>
<p>General John B. Gordon, during recent years, did
General Longstreet injustice. I know he caused him
much pain. At a time when General Longstreet was
suffering horribly,​—​one eye had already been destroyed
by the dreadful disease; he had long been deaf and
paralyzed from war service; the wound in his throat
was giving him severest pain,​—​at this sad time General
Gordon revived the old, threadbare story that he had
disobeyed orders at Gettysburg. But when a reporter
from one of the New York dailies called to interview
him about General Gordon and his charges, he refused
to say one word. It was then that I said, “If you will
not reply to General Gordon, I will. And in the future,
so long as I shall live, whenever your war record is attacked,
I will make answer.” And so it happened that
the little story of Gettysburg was written while General
Longstreet was nearing the grave. During these last,
sorrowful days he had heard that General Gordon was
not in good health, and he asked me, with touching concern,
about his condition. I expected to tell General
Gordon of these occurrences, but I never saw him again.
The Reaper gathered him in, ten days after General
Longstreet answered the call.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was a most devout churchman.
In early life he was an Episcopalian, and he regularly
attended that church in New Orleans until the political
differences developed between himself and his friends.
After that he noticed that even his church associates
avoided him. They would not sit in the same pew with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
him. Cut to the quick by such treatment, he began to
wonder if there was any church broad enough to withstand
differences caused by political and sectional feeling.
He discovered that the Roman Catholic priests
extended him the treatment he longed for. He began
to attend that church, and has said that its atmosphere
from the first appealed to him as the church of the
sorrow-laden of earth. He was converted under the
ministration of Father Ryan. After accepting the
faith of the Catholic Church he followed it with beautiful
devotion. He regarded it as the compensation sent
him by the Almighty for doing his duty as he saw
it. He clung to it as the best consolation there was in
life. He went to his duties as devoutly as any priest of
the church, and was on his knees night and morning,
with the simple, loving faith of a little child.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc119">WORSHIPPED BY THE SOLDIERS OF
THE CONFEDERACY</h2>
<p>The political estrangements between General Longstreet
and many of the leaders of the South never extended
to the soldiers who did any large amount of
fighting for the South. There was a Confederate reunion
in Atlanta in 1898. A camp of Confederate Veterans,
of Augusta, Georgia, made up of his old command,
sent General Longstreet a special request to come
down from his home in Gainesville, and to wear his old
uniform. He replied that his uniform had been destroyed
years ago in the fire which burned his home and
practically everything else he had, but that he would
gladly go down with what was left of himself​—​that
his old trunk of a body was the only relic of the Confederacy
remaining to him. They then secured his
measure and had a new Confederate uniform made for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
him to represent the old as nearly as possible. During
all his stay at that reunion the old soldiers flocked about
him with a devotion that Napoleon would have envied.
They went wild over him. When he went to the dining-room
at the hotel, the doors had to be closed so that he
could take his meals without interruption. One evening,
in the Kimball, his old “boys” surged about him
by the thousands for hours, eager to touch his hand,
to touch his garments, to look into his face, and the
tears streamed down his cheeks. Just before that, one
day, outraged at some unkindness that had come from
the South, I had said to General Longstreet, “The
Southern people are no longer my people. I have no
home and no country.” In the midst of the splendid
demonstration at the reunion of 1898, when the thousands
who had followed his colors stood with uncovered
heads in his honored presence, I said to him, “This is
the South that I love, because it loves you; it is the
magnificent, generous, loyal South that I love with
every impulse of my heart; these are my people.”</p>
<p>I think he never forgot the Confederate reunion in
Atlanta in 1898. His old soldiers came to his room in
a continuous stream. One afternoon, when he was
asleep, utterly worn out, a one-legged, one-armed veteran,
poorly clad, looking poorly fed, came to his room.
I told him of the General’s exhausted condition​—​that
he needed the rest, and I was really afraid to disturb
him. Then he said, “Won’t you let me go in and look
at my old commander, asleep. I haven’t seen him since
Appomattox. I came all the way from Texas to see
him, and I may never see him again.” Without a word
I opened the door, and as the worn veteran looked upon
his old chieftain we both cried. In the midst of it General
Longstreet wakened and called the veteran to him.
They embraced like brothers and wept together.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Spanish-American War General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Longstreet received hundreds of letters from his old
soldiers in every part of the country, asking for the
privilege of seeing service with him under the flag of the
Union. One of them wrote: “If this country is going
to have another war, I want to be in it, and I want
to follow my old commander.” General Longstreet answered
that he was seventy-eight, deaf, and paralyzed;
that he had two sons he would send to fight for him, but
that if his country needed his services, his sword was at
its command.</p>
<p>As Commissioner of Railroads, General Longstreet
made a tour of the West in 1899. He was received with
beautiful consideration everywhere, but the welcome
which touched him most was that of his old soldiers
who greeted him in every State. It was marvellous to
see how the veterans of a war that was over forty years
ago had scattered through the West, and it certainly
seemed that every one there had heard that General
Longstreet was coming, and came to the nearest station
to see him. With them were many Union veterans who
gave him an equally cordial greeting.</p>
<p>I will digress here to say that General Longstreet
could never stand on a foot of Northern soil where he
was not received with every manifestation of earthly
honor and esteem by the Union veterans and their descendants,
and this touched him as nothing else in the
world could have done. I wish to offer the humble tribute
of my love to the chivalrous section that is to-day so
close to my heart; the honors they paid General Longstreet,
their tributes to him, did not end with the grave.
Two weeks after the prospectus of this little volume
had been sent out, the first edition had been bought,
long before it was ready for delivery, by the Grand
Army of the Republic, and the orders were accompanied
by testimonials to General Longstreet as soldier
and patriot that would make a memorial volume of rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
value, and a brief selection, at least, I hope to give in
future editions.</p>
<p>At one place, on his Western tour in 1899, it became
necessary for him to telegraph to an official of the Rock
Island road to ask if he would “pass” his car. It happened
that this official had been a Union officer who had
received hard blows from Longstreet on many bloody
fields. He replied that in the old days that tried the
courage of men he was much more anxious to “pass”
Longstreet than to meet him; that now he was going
to insist on meeting him first, and afterwards he would
“pass” anything the General wanted him to “pass.”</p>
<p>Next to the pleasure of meeting his old friends on
this Western tour, General Longstreet most enjoyed
the wonderful development of the country that had
taken place since he was chasing wild Indians across its
wide plains. The smiling farms that greeted him, the
magnificent cities, the marvellously fertile irrigated sections
that he had last beheld as deserts, the net-work of
competing railroads which had taken the place of the
trail and the half-worked wagon-roads, the evidences
everywhere of a magnificent country built up by progressive
people,​—​all these, with all the suggestiveness
attaching to them, appealed with mighty force to his
heart and to his mental appreciation. The picture of
industrial growth is a beautiful and impressive one.
It is a story in itself that needs only a suggestion to
make it as large a part of this as it should make.</p>
<p>Genuine Americanism, a love of his country in every
sentiment that concerns it and every line of development
affecting it, formed a very large and attractive
phase of General Longstreet’s character. And so, from
every stand-point he enjoyed this Western trip to the
full.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>
<h2 id="toc123">HIS COUNTRY HOME IN PICTURESQUE
NORTH GEORGIA</h2>
<p>Next to the smoke of battle in the cause of his country,
he loved nature in her gentlest and most quiet
moods. He was fond of the forest and farm. He
owned a small farm near Gainesville, Georgia, which
was one of the delights of his life. Here he set out an
orchard and a vineyard on a scale somewhat extensive,
in which he found much pleasure. It is a hilly, uneven
country, this rugged Piedmont section of north
Georgia, noted for its red clay, its rocks, its mighty
trees, the wild honeysuckles that carpet its woods, and
the purity of the air that sweeps over it and the water
that gushes in abundance from its depths. General
Longstreet made his little farm in this picturesque section
as productive and attractive as he could. It was
mostly hills, and had to be terraced extensively to keep
it from washing away. He had it terraced with much
care, and laid off something after the manner of a
battle-field. Thereupon the people around jokingly
called it “Gettysburg.”</p>
<p>Here he had built and lived in a splendid home of the
old colonial style of architecture, such as has long been
popular in the South. The house was richly furnished.
He had one of the finest libraries in the South, and had
collected interesting and valuable souvenirs, and furnishings
from all over the world. His residence was
situated on a lordly eminence; beyond, the everlasting
mountains stretched in unbroken length; in the valley
between, the placid waters of the mountain streams
wound lazily to the sea. The location was most beautiful,
and has often been called “Inspiration Point.”
Amid these romantic surroundings General Longstreet
dispensed a hospitality characteristic of the most splendid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
days of the old South. He often laughingly said
that his house became a rendezvous for old Confederates
who were hastily going West, and needed a “little aid.”
They never knocked in vain at his door. He has said
that a favorite tale of theirs was that they “had just
killed a Yankee, and had to go West hurriedly;” thinking,
of course, that this plea would strike a sympathetic
chord.</p>
<p>Some twenty years ago General Longstreet’s home
and everything it contained, save the people, vanished
in flames. After that he lived in one of the out-houses,
a small frame cottage such as any carpenter might build
and any countryman might own.</p>
<p>Some years ago Hamlin Garland visited Gainesville
for the purpose of calling on General Longstreet. After
talking with him Mr. Garland wrote a very interesting
article about him. He especially marvelled that he
should find so great a man, so colossal a character, living
in such modest fashion, seemingly almost forgotten by
all sections of the country in whose destiny he had played
so important a part. He said he found a world-famous
general pruning grape-vines on a red hill-side of the
picturesque mountain region of Georgia. He was delighted
with his versatility, his information, and, most
of all, with his glowing love of country and his broad
ideas of the future greatness of America.</p>
<p>When the imposing house stood and when he afterwards
occupied the cottage, his home was still the
boasted “show-place” of Gainesville. He was Gainesville’s
grand historic character, her first gentleman, and
her best-loved citizen. Whatever resentment towards
him because of political views may have been felt in
other parts of the country where men were striving to be
at the head of state processions, in his little home city
there was never a break in the loving and proud esteem
in which he was held by his home people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Here life remained interesting to him to the last. His
heart was ever young; when he died he was eighty-three
years young. Only a day or two before he was taken
away he was planning things that were to take place
years in the future. Blindness, deafness, paralysis, the
decay of physical faculties, failed to move his dauntless
courage or quell his splendid determination.</p>
<p>General Longstreet’s last days were spent in revising
his memoirs of the Civil War, as were Grant’s in writing
his. The two colossal characters passed away suffering
the excruciating pains of the same dread disease,​—​cancer,​—​both
disdaining death, heroic to the end.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Spanish-American War General
Longstreet was invited by the New York <i>Herald</i> to
contribute to its columns a paper on the subject of the
threatened trouble with Spain.</p>
<p>The closing paragraph of that paper comes across
the years a prophecy and prayer for all mankind:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“As the evening hours draw near, the bugle calls of the eternal
years sound clearer to my understanding than when drowned in
the hiss of musketry and the roar of cannon. By memory of
battle-fields and prophecy of coming events, I declare the hope
that the present generation may witness the disbandment of
standing armies, the reign of natural justice, the ushering in of
the brotherhood of man. If I could recall one hour of my distant
but glorious command, I would say, on the eve of battle with a
foreign foe, “Little children, love one another.”</p></div></blockquote>

<h2 title="LONGSTREET ON THE FIELDS OF MEXICO"> <span class="larger">LONGSTREET ON THE

<h2 id="toc127">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="subhead">THE WINNING OF OUR WESTERN EMPIRE</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Mexico will always be a land of romance. Her ruins are yet
fragrant with memories of the mighty plans of Louis Napoleon.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>After an absence of fifty years, General Longstreet
revisited Mexico in the eventful summer of 1898, leisurely
passing over some of the scenes of his early military
experiences. Half a century had stolen away, yet
architecturally he found Mexico but little changed.
Few of the old landmarks were effaced. Modern ideas
and inventions have been encouraged and do prevail in
our sister republic, but the dream-like strangeness of
its civilization is still all-pervading. Mexico is not unlike
Egypt in some respects. Everywhere is the poetry
of a past age. Egypt has its sphinx and the pyramids
to illustrate a mysterious past; in Mexico we find the
temples of the Aztecs and the monuments of their cruel
conquerors. The Montezumas have left the impress of
their race and civilization on every hand. To the northern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
visitor Mexico will always be the land of the Aztecs,
worshippers of the sun.</p>
<p>To me the battle-fields of 1846–47 were of supreme
interest. They are to most Americans doubtless the
chief magnet of attraction. But the eye of an active
participant in those glorious achievements of American
arms sees more as it sweeps over the valley of Mexico
than is comprehensible to the unprofessional casual observer.
It was my great privilege​—​to-day a cherished
memory​—​to go over the fields that stretch away from
Chapultepec with a war-worn soldier who fifty years
earlier had there learned his first lessons in real warfare.</p>
<p>Mexico will always be a land of romance. Her civilization
stands apart. Her ruins are yet fragrant with
memories of the mighty plans of Louis Napoleon.
From the ill-fated Maximilian empire to our own war
with Mexico seems but a step back, and yet between
the steps great history has been written.</p>
<p>Excepting Vera Cruz and Cerro Gordo, the scene
of all the leading events of General Scott’s campaign
lie almost within cannon-shot of the Mexican capital.</p>
<p>The four battles of Contreras, Churubusco, Molino
del Rey, and Chapultepec, which decided the fate of
the war, occurred within a period of four weeks and
within a radius of a dozen miles. The Mexican General
Valencia was disastrously routed at Contreras August
19, 1847, and Churubusco was fought and won by the
Americans next day. Then there was a short truce between
the two belligerents, and terms of peace were
proposed by an American plenipotentiary. These not
proving satisfactory, hostilities were resumed. Scott
moved with energy. On September 8 the battle of Molino
del Rey occurred, the Americans winning, but at
heavy sacrifice in killed and wounded. The successful
assault on Chapultepec hill was made on the 13th, five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
days later, and on the morning of the 14th Scott’s
splendid little army entered the Mexican capital and
hoisted its flag over the public buildings. The belligerents
engaged in these affairs were comparatively small
and the losses on both sides very severe. The Mexicans
fought well, but were execrably led. With the fall of
Mexico Scott had conquered a nation with an army
fewer in numbers than the single corps Longstreet commanded
at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Scott’s army, for the most part, was composed of
veteran troops,​—​regulars, with a considerable contingent
of fine and well-officered volunteers. Most of
them were already battle-seasoned, having participated
in General Taylor’s initiatory campaign of 1846 on the
Rio Grande, where they had signally defeated the Mexicans
at Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, and Monterey.
Taylor’s crowning victory at Buena Vista, February
23, 1847, did not occur until after Scott had drafted
away the best part of his regulars for the march on
Mexico.</p>
<p>Among them were the Fourth and Eighth Infantry
regiments. Lieutenant Longstreet had served in both,​—​in
the Fourth as brevet second lieutenant after graduating
from the Military Academy in 1842, up to 1845,
when he was promoted and transferred to the Eighth,
and he was lucky enough to be with the latter in the
action at Palo Alto, May 8, 1846, at Resaca de la Palma
next day, and in the siege and capture of Monterey,
September 21 to 23, of the same year. It was on these
fields that most of the young fellows who afterwards
became conspicuous in the Union and Confederate
armies flashed their maiden swords.</p>
<p>In the Fourth, among Longstreet’s earlier official
and social intimates at Jefferson Barracks and Camp
Salubrity, were Captain George A. McCall, Lieutenants
Augur, Grant, Alex. Hays, and David A. Russell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
all afterwards distinguished Union generals. Captain
McCall was then forty-three years old, and was graduated
from West Point in 1822, just twenty years ahead
of Longstreet’s class.</p>
<p>The subsequent Civil War produced some singular
anticlimaxes to these old Mexican War friendships. It
so happened, for instance, that sixteen years afterwards,
at the battle of Glendale before Richmond, Longstreet’s
Confederate division was pitted against McCall’s
smaller Union division, and the Confederates had
the best of it. About dusk, after the heavy fighting
was over, McCall and his staff accidentally rode into
the Forty-seventh Virginia. Curiously enough, the
Union general alone was captured and brought to
Longstreet’s head-quarters.</p>
<p>Having for a time been a brevet second lieutenant
under McCall in the old Fourth Infantry, and really
commiserating his personal mishap, General Longstreet
cordially advanced, offering his hand and proffering
such hospitality as was permissible in the untoward
circumstances. But, deeply chagrined by his defeat
and capture, McCall sullenly repelled Longstreet’s
friendly advances. It only remained for the Union
general to be sent back to Richmond in charge of a
staff-officer and guard. It was the last meeting between
the old captain and his former lieutenant, and,
strangely, was McCall’s last appearance in battle,
though he was exchanged in a few weeks. He somehow
fell into disfavor with the Washington authorities,
resigned in March, 1863, and died on a farm near
Westchester, Pennsylvania, in 1868. McCall was a
fine soldier of the old school. Grant was also a second
lieutenant with McCall in the Fourth, and liked him
very much.</p>
<p>Alex. Hays and Longstreet had been associated in
both regiments. Like Longstreet, Hays was promoted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and transferred from the Fourth to the Eighth, though
upward of a year subsequently. Grant never left the
Fourth until he resigned as captain, about seven years
after the Mexican War. Hays and Grant had been
friends at West Point, though not classmates, and very
chummy afterwards while subs. in the old Fourth Infantry.
The official personnel of General Taylor’s
army, scant three thousand men, was so small that they
were almost like a family. Everybody knew everybody
else.</p>
<p>Hays was detached from the Eighth when Scott advanced
into the valley of Mexico, but was engaged in
several severe affairs in defence of convoys of supplies
to the front, and also at Heamantle and Sequaltiplan.
After that war was over he resigned, but in 1861 immediately
sought service again, and soon rose to the command
of a Union division. His division contributed
materially to the repulse of Longstreet’s attack at
Gettysburg on July 3. But poor Hays was killed in
front of Longstreet’s lines at the Wilderness in 1864,
the first battle in Virginia after his old comrade, Grant,
had assumed command of the Union armies. Such was
the fortune of war of the civil struggle.</p>
<p>The Eighth Infantry furnished from its Mexican
War contingent few conspicuous leaders to either side
in the subsequent Civil War. The regiment was compelled
to surrender to the local authorities of Texas
early in 1861, and were detained at the South many
months. Only a few of its old officers then remained.
All those of Southern proclivities had already withdrawn.
Longstreet left the Eighth in 1858, ten years
after peace with Mexico, having been promoted to
major and paymaster. By detention as prisoners of
war the Union soldiers of the Eighth were deprived
of the early promotion which fell to the lot of most
regulars.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Out of all the officers of the two regiments engaged
in Mexico, only seven, it appears, espoused the Southern
cause, and of these but three attained to any considerable
rank in the Confederate armies,​—​Longstreet,
Pickett, and Cadmus E. Wilcox. Pickett was a magnificent
soldier, one of the most daring in the Confederate
army.</p>
<p>In the two campaigns of Taylor and Scott the Fourth
and Eighth lost no fewer than twelve officers killed
and fatally wounded, and eighteen others seriously
wounded, a very heavy percentage. This alone proves
that the Americans had no walkover. Every foot of the
ground was bravely contested by the Mexicans.</p>
<p>To continue this digression a little farther, it may be
said that the genesis of the two Mexican campaigns is
not well understood. Winfield Scott was and had long
been the commanding general of the United States
army, and entitled as such, aside from his military renown,
to the Mexican command. But Scott, a Southern
Whig, was ambitious to be President. The Democratic
administration of Polk was quite naturally chary of
giving Scott an opportunity to win public applause
through a victorious military campaign. Scott had
early submitted a plan of operations, with request for
permission to lead an American army into Mexico. But
Zachary Taylor, then only a colonel and brevet brigadier,
was chosen for the purpose, to the discomfiture of
Scott and his coterie. Of course, the general-in-chief
chafed because he had thus designedly been over-slaughed
by a junior.</p>
<p>The administration overreached itself. Taylor’s
small victories in northern Mexico in the Spring of 1846
were so greatly magnified by the press of the States
that he at once became the hero of the hour. Soon he
was the open candidate of the Whig party for the
Presidency; for Taylor, like Scott, was a Southern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Whig. Polk and his advisers were now between the
devil and the deep sea. To beat back and neutralize
the rising Taylor tide they precipitately turned to Scott.
His original plan for bringing Mexico to terms <i>via</i>
Vera Cruz was adopted, and he assigned to the command,
with fulsome assurances of ample and continued
support, which were never fulfilled.</p>
<p>Scott was thereupon given <i>carte blanche</i> to withdraw
such force of regulars from Taylor as he deemed necessary
to the successful prosecution of his proposed invasion,
and meanwhile Taylor, with some five thousand
volunteers and a slight leaven of regular troops, was to
remain on the defensive. Then something happened.
Taylor did not choose to remain stock still, but advanced.
A few weeks after the depletion of his army,
which began in January, 1847, and before Scott had
landed at Vera Cruz with his raw volunteers, Taylor
worsted Santa Anna at Buena Vista. He not only signally
defeated the foreign enemy, but completed the
rout of the Democratic administration at Washington,
and the next year was nominated by the Whigs and
elected President hands down, wholly on the strength
of his military achievements. Scott, nominated in 1852,
was disastrously beaten by the Democratic candidate,
Franklin Pierce, one of his inconspicuous civilian brigadiers
in Mexico. It must have been a galling blow to
the old General’s pride. His defeat was the death-blow
of the Whig party.</p>

<h2 id="toc134">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="subhead">PECULIARITIES OF SCOTT AND TAYLOR</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>As we gazed down from Chapultepec’s heights, on that fragrant
day of 1898, across the beautiful valley of Mexico, the war of fifty
years agone seemed but yesterday to him who on those fields had
added a new star of the first magnitude to the galaxy of American
valor.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Since those old days General Longstreet often speculated
on the result if Taylor and Scott had been required
to handle the armies of Lee and Grant and meet the
conditions which confronted the great Union and Confederate
leaders at the crucial periods of their campaigns.
He concluded that both would have maintained
their high reputations at the head of much larger bodies
of troops than they marshalled in Mexico, even though
confronted by abler opponents than Santa Anna, supported
by stronger and better-disciplined armies than
the half-starved, ill-appointed levies he brought against
them at Buena Vista and Cerro Gordo. At all events,
the young fellows of 1846–47 to a man believed Taylor
and Scott adequately equipped to successfully meet any
military emergency.</p>
<p>They were extraordinary characters. Both were
practised officers dating back to the war of 1812, though
neither was a West Point graduate. Scott on the
Canadian frontier had commanded against considerable
bodies of disciplined British troops in pitched battle,
and came off with increased reputation. He had then
visited Europe and observed the continental armies.
He was well educated; had studied for the bar, but by
preference took up the military profession, of which he
was a diligent student. Scott was thoroughly up in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
literature of war. To a cultivated mind he added a
colossal person and a fine presence.</p>
<p>General Scott’s chief fault was an overweening personal
vanity which often took the form of mere pedantry,
not unseldom bringing him into personal ridicule.
Insufferably pompous, he invariably maintained a vast,
unbending dignity, both of manner and speech, whether
oral or written. The subalterns of the army looked
upon him with absolute awe. Many a brevetted cadet
would readily have chosen to go against a Mexican intrenchment
rather than into the commanding general’s
presence. He brooked no familiarity from high or low.
While he sometimes indulged in a sort of elephantine
affability, he was naturally dictatorial towards all subordinates,
though always within the limits of decency.
Scott’s was not at all the overbearing insolence of the
coward. He always rode in full uniform, with all the
insignia of his rank visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Such a queer combination of bigness and littleness,
learning, practical ability, and whimsicality formed a
character sure to create enemies, and it must be said
that Scott had plenty of them, both in and out of the
army. By them he was derisively dubbed “Old Fuss
and Feathers.” Notwithstanding his weakness, the
General was physically and morally a very brave man.
He was cool and deliberate in forming his military
plans, and once determined upon they were prosecuted
with unhesitating energy and precision. Above all he
was an honest man. Undoubtedly General Scott possessed
a comprehensive military mind.</p>
<p>Equally cool and careful in planning, equally energetic
in execution, and equally brave, honest, and true,
in other respects Taylor was an entirely different type
of man. Personally he was the antipodes of the handsome
giant, Scott, being only of middle stature. His
complexion was swarthy and his face rugged and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
homely, but with a kindly expression. Unlike Scott
again, Taylor’s schooling had been limited, yet without
any affectation of style he wrote clearly and vigorously.
From the age of one year he had lived the life of a Kentucky
frontier farmer boy up to his entry into the army
as a lieutenant in 1808.</p>
<p>Taylor’s military experience, confined wholly to the
Western border in 1812, was limited to outpost affairs
with Indians and the few squads of British soldiers and
borderers who supported them. As an officer he had
never met so much as a full company of disciplined soldiers
until Palo Alto. Taylor never wore his uniform,
or almost never. He dressed in rough clothes no better
than those worn by the common soldier. He was often
seen riding without his staff or other attendant, seeing
things with his own eyes. He was frank and somewhat
rough, but kindly in speech. While he was not without
proper dignity, he talked and acted straight to the mark
without much consideration for appearances. He
treated his subordinates with easy consideration, and
was often seen joking and laughing with mere subalterns.
He was given the sobriquet of “Old Rough
and Ready” by the army, in which he was dearly loved
by all. It was a title which rang through the country
in the political campaign of 1848. He not only inspired
universal good will, rough and uncultivated as
he was, but confidence. Such were the two Mexican
commanders.</p>
<p>As we gazed down from Chapultepec’s heights, on
that fragrant day of 1898, across the beautiful valley
of Mexico, the war of fifty years agone seemed but
yesterday to him who on those fields had added a new
star of the first magnitude to the galaxy of American
valor. Memories of the glorious past rushed through
his mind. Here Grant and Lee had taken their first
lessons in practical warfare on a considerable scale.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Here had been won not only Texas, but the vast domain
away to the Pacific. Since then what social, industrial,
and political revolutions had he not witnessed. From
the Mississippi had spread out a great republic, reaching
from ocean to ocean. He had seen the Southern
Confederacy rise and fall, and colossal history, along
the way from Chapultepec to Manila, written in the
blood of the nation’s strong men. And Mexico has not
been behind in the mighty changes that have swept over
the continent since her bitter humiliation in 1847. She
has advanced by heroic strides, especially under the wise
leadership of Diaz.</p>
<p>But after all it was not wholly the great events of
half a century that crowded upon General Longstreet’s
memory at this interesting juncture. Curiously
enough, his mind persisted in fixing itself upon minor
incidents,​—​social and personal relations,​—​on the comrades
who had here and elsewhere laid down their lives
in the service, on others who had risen to distinction or
dropped out of the running. The “boys” of ’46 and
’47 again crowded upon him. It could hardly be otherwise,
for they were a band of brothers then. When
General Taylor’s little Army of Observation was collected
in western Louisiana, the whole regular establishment
of the United States consisted of no more than
12,139 officers and men. The Army of Occupation
which was concentrated at Corpus Christi, Texas, in the
fall of 1845, numbered only three thousand men.</p>
<p>The days of Corpus Christi still formed a vivid picture
in General Longstreet’s mind. The oldest officers present​—​even
General Taylor himself​—​had never seen so
large a body of the regular army together. Adjoining
the camp were extensive level prairies, admirably
adapted to military manœuvres. Many of the officers
had not taken part in even a battalion drill since leaving
West Point, and with most of them evolutions of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
line had only been read in tactics. So widely had the
troops been scattered, and in such small detachments,
to meet the requirements of the country’s extensive
frontiers, that there were colonels who had never seen
their entire regiments.</p>
<p>This concentration afforded opportunity for practical
professional instruction and discipline which was appreciated
and availed of. But with this preparatory
work there were amusements, and lasting friendships
were formed; perhaps a few equally lasting enmities.
Game and fish abounded. There were no settlements;
the country was absolutely wild. Within a few hours’
ride of the camps were wild turkeys in flocks of twenty
to forty; deer and antelope were numerous, and not
far afield were vast droves of wild mustangs. Wolves
and coyotes were everywhere, and occasionally a Mexican
lion (cougar) was found. Many of the young officers
became expert hunters. Muzzle-loading shot-guns
were used mainly; there were no breech-loaders in those
days. The camp tables fairly groaned with game
dishes; wild turkey and venison finally so palled upon
many of the soldiers as actually to become distasteful,
and the old reliable beef and pork of the commissariat
was resorted to in preference.</p>
<p>Wild horses were lassoed and brought into camp by
Mexicans and tame Indians, and sold to the Americans
for two or three dollars a head. An extra good animal
would sometimes bring twelve dollars, which was the
tip-top price. A good many were purchased by the
quartermaster for the use of the army, and proved very
serviceable. These animals looked something like the
Norman breed; they had heavy manes and tails, and
were much more powerful than the plains ponies
farther north of a later date. They foraged for themselves
and flourished where the American horse would
deteriorate and soon die.</p>

<h2 id="toc139">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="subhead">UNPRETENTIOUS LIEUTENANT GRANT</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>It was not until Grant came East during the Civil War that
Longstreet began fully to appreciate his military ability. Grant’s
successes at Donelson, Shiloh, and Vicksburg were but vaguely
understood in the Army of Northern Virginia, where they were
mainly ascribed to bad generalship on the Confederate side, and
some blundering good luck on Grant’s part.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Grant, of the Fourth, had acquired
great reputation at the Military Academy as an expert
horseman. He was always the show rider upon great
occasions. He greatly added to this reputation at Corpus
Christi. He was regimental quartermaster, and had
much to do with these horses. He bought several of
the better class for his own use. While riding one and
leading the others to water one day, just before the
army moved to the Rio Grande, his colored servant
lost the whole bunch, or perhaps sold them for his own
account. He claimed that, throwing him off, they
jerked loose and stampeded away. There was a joke
among the boys that, upon being told of the incident,
General Taylor humorously remarked, “Yes, I understand
Mr. Grant lost five or six dollars’ worth of horses
recently,” satirically referring to their extraordinary
cheapness. Grant declined to buy more horses for his
private use. Soon after, the army advanced to the Rio
Grande, and foot officers had no use for horses.</p>
<p>The unpretentious Grant was soon famous throughout
the army as a “bronco buster,” in the sense the
term is now familiarly used. He would unhesitatingly
mount and soon bring to terms the most vicious of wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
horses. On horseback he was a very centaur. In no
other manner could an animal unhorse Grant than by
lying down and rolling over. A large group of interested
officers one day had opportunity to observe his
success in dealing with an unbroken horse. An Indian
had brought to camp a splendid specimen which had
struck Grant’s fancy, and for which he paid the record
price of twelve dollars. It seemed to prance on springs
of steel; its beautiful head was carried on high, and
the noble eyes shot sparks of fire. While two grooms
held it by lariats from either side, Grant blindfolded the
stallion. Then the regulation accoutrements of Spanish
saddle and heavy-bitted bridle were adjusted, and
Grant mounted, his heels armed with an enormous pair
of Mexican spurs.</p>
<p>Thus blindfolded, the beautiful animal had stood
stock still, trembling like an aspen. The instant his
eyes were uncovered he sprang forward like a shot.
Grant held his seat firmly. Then the horse began to
“buck,”​—​that is, to jump high into the air, at the same
moment suddenly crooking his back upward with intent
to throw off his burden. This was repeated time after
time, of course without dislodging Grant, who was up
to that sort of thing. The proceeding was greeted by
the by-standers with shouts of laughter and yells of
“Hang on, Grant,” “Don’t let him down you, old
boy,” etc. The animal presently tired of this work, and
at the proper juncture the cool-headed rider vigorously
applied the spurs, at the same time loosening the rein,
when the stallion plunged straight forward at a breakneck
pace through the chaparral and cacti of the plain.
The soldiers watched them until they disappeared, and
the uninitiated wondered if they should ever see Grant
alive again. Two hours later they returned at a slow
walk, both exhausted, the horse’s head down and his
sides wet with sweat and foam. He was conquered, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
was thereafter as docile as any well-trained American
horse.</p>
<p>When not on duty, Grant’s chief amusement at Corpus
Christi was horseback riding. He was no sportsman,
and only occasionally played “brag” for small
stakes. Longstreet’s classmate, Lieutenant Benjamin,
of the Fourth Artillery, came in one day with a story
about Grant’s one attempt at gunning for turkeys.
The two, on a short leave with other officers, had made
a journey on horseback to Austin late in the fall of
1845, accompanying a train of supplies. Returning,
the party was reduced to three,​—​Benjamin, Grant, and
Lieutenant Augur, afterwards major-general in the
Union army. Augur fell sick and was left at Goliad,
to be picked up by a train following. At Goliad Grant
and Benjamin went out to shoot turkeys. Benjamin
was a good shot and soon returned to camp with several
fine birds. He found Grant already in, but without
any game. The latter said that a large flock of turkeys
had taken flight in twos and threes from branches of the
pecan-trees overhead, some of them calmly looking at
him several moments before taking wing. He had
watched them with much interest until the last turkey
had disappeared. Then it suddenly occurred to him
that he had come out to shoot turkeys. “I concluded,
Benjamin, from this circumstance,” explained Grant,
with much chagrin, “that I was not cut out for a sportsman,
so I returned to the house, confident you would
bring in plenty of birds.” This explanation was offered
with the utmost simplicity, and Benjamin repeated it
with much unction. Poor Benjamin did not live to see
the heights of fame reached by the little lieutenant who
did not know enough to shoot wild turkeys in 1845. He
was killed at the storming of the city of Mexico, September
13, 1847.</p>
<p>These anecdotes of a distinguished man naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
find place in a potpourri paper of this kind, but their
special purpose is to show Grant’s personal characteristics,
and in some sort the estimate placed upon him
by his comrades of sixty years ago. But in those days
the young fellows of the army fooled away no time in
estimating upon the intellectual capacity of even the
most promising associate. Grant was just simply an
unobtrusive, every-day second lieutenant, without special
promise or remarkable traits. It must be said that
no one looked upon him then as the coming great man
of the greatest war of civilized times. Rather quiet,
seldom seeking crowds, Grant nevertheless enjoyed his
friends, and among them was both a voluble and interesting
talker. The alleged taciturnity of the later time
was assumed to shut off busybodies​—​it was only judicious
reticence. He was quickly known as a very brave
and enterprising soldier in action, and, in fact, distinguished
himself under both Taylor and Scott. He and
Longstreet were intimate friends from 1839 through
the seven years ending with the Mexican War, and
often met in friendliest relations after the Civil War.
Grant never forgot a friend in need.</p>
<p>It was not until Grant came East during the Civil
War that Longstreet began to fully appreciate his military
ability. Grant’s successes at Donelson, Shiloh,
and Vicksburg were but vaguely understood in the
Army of Northern Virginia, where they were mainly
ascribed to bad generalship on the Confederate side, and
some blundering good luck on Grant’s part. But after
the war was over and access was had to the inside history
of those events, Longstreet soon perceived that
the Vicksburg campaign was one of the greatest in
military history, and that Pemberton’s destruction was
almost wholly due to Grant’s bold conception of the
military requirements to fulfil the expectations of his
government.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Longstreet had been near by when Grant attacked
and defeated Bragg at Chattanooga, and also thought
that victory was largely due to overwhelming numbers
and Bragg’s incapacity to perceive the impending
storm. Longstreet wrote to General Lee from East
Tennessee, some time in the winter of 1863–64, that
he need have no fear of Grant, then presumptively
booked for the Army of the Potomac; that he was overestimated,
largely from his prestige acquired against
inferior commanders, etc. But in the very beginning
of the Wilderness campaign in 1864 the commander of
the First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia saw
a power displayed in manœuvring the Army of the
Potomac which the Confederates had never met before.
There is no doubt that General Lee himself appreciated
that he had a new and puzzling force to deal with. At
the Wilderness Lee assumed the offensive the moment
Grant crossed the Rapidan, essaying the same tactics
that had been practised upon Hooker at Chancellorsville,
but he failed. The Confederates withstood Grant
in the Wilderness, but it was the last time General Lee
attempted a general offensive. This was somewhat due
to his inferior numbers and waning morale, but it was
mainly because of Grant’s presence. The year before,
after what was practically a drawn battle at Chancellorsville,
Hooker, with double Lee’s force, withdrew
across the river. He had between twenty-five thousand
and thirty thousand men who had scarcely fired a gun
in battle. Grant, with fewer men than Hooker, fought
a larger Confederate army at the Wilderness. It, too,
was no more than a drawn battle, yet Grant had no
thought of recrossing the river to recuperate. He
moved forward and immediately put General Lee on
the defensive.</p>
<p>General Lee at last realized that the Confederacy’s
only hope was defensive battle, and his fame as a General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
will rest wholly on that campaign. If he had persisted
in the tactics employed against Hooker and Pope
and McClellan, his army would have been destroyed in
ten days after the Wilderness. Grant really had the
Army of Northern Virginia on the go on the morning
of the 6th of May; it was saved from utter rout only
by the timely arrival of the First Corps, which rolled
back Hancock’s victorious lines upon the Brock road
and beyond.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc144">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="subhead">PLEASANT INCIDENTS OF CAMP LIFE AT CORPUS CHRISTI</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>The reunion at Corpus Christi made a deep impression upon the
fledglings of the service. The long encampment there formed a
green spot in the memory of the little army that bore our colors
in triumph to the city of Mexico.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Among General Longstreet’s pleasant memories of
camp life at Corpus Christi was a rude theatre erected
by a joint stock company of the young officers, who
acted in the plays produced on its boards, taking both
male and female parts. Many roaring comedies were
billed, and cheered the garrison from time to time. The
enlisted men were of course permitted to pay the entrance
fee and see the best that was going. General
Worth was always a delighted auditor, General Taylor
occasionally honored the entertainments with his presence,
and General Twiggs rarely. After exhausting
the field of comedy and having already reimbursed
themselves for all outlays, the officers concluded to
enter the more expensive and difficult field of tragedy.
The first play chosen was the Moor of Venice. Lieutenant
Porter, brother of Admiral Porter, was assigned
the part of Othello, whilst Lieutenant Longstreet was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
nominated for Desdemona; but upon inspection the
manager protested that six feet dignified in crinoline
would not answer even for a tragic heroine. So Longstreet
was discarded and Grant substituted. Finally,
after a rehearsal or two, Grant, too, had to give way
under protests of Porter that male tragediennes could
not give the proper sentiment to the play. Then the
officers “chipped in” and sent to New Orleans for a
real actress, and thereafter all went well. The play was
pulled off eventually with as much <i>éclat</i> as followed
General Taylor’s first victory a few months later on the
Rio Grande.</p>
<p>A volume could be filled with incidents of those
sunny days on the Mexican Gulf, the incipient stage
of the first campaign in real war for the young officers.
They gave little heed of the morrow. Their pay
was small, but their requirements were on even a less
scale. There was a good deal of drilling, but otherwise
their duties were far from onerous. A large proportion
of the cadets Longstreet had known at West Point
from 1838 to 1842 were there congregated, and old
associations were renewed. Of course, all these officers
were not intimates, but nearly all were personal acquaintances
on the most friendly footing. Every one
brought his share to the common aggregate of interest
and pleasure.</p>
<p>Among the officers there collected who afterwards
became prominent in the Union and Confederate armies,
in addition to those already mentioned, were William
J. Hardee, Thomas Jordan, John C. Pemberton,
Braxton Bragg, Earl Van Dorn, Samuel G. French,
Richard H. Anderson, Robert S. Garnett, Barnard E.
Bee, Bushrod R. Johnson, Abram C. Myers, Lafayette
McLaws, and E. Kirby Smith, of the Confederate service;
and J. K. F. Mansfield, George G. Meade, Don
Carlos Buell, George H. Thomas, N. J. T. Dana,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Charles F. Smith, Joseph J. Reynolds, John F. Reynolds,
Abner Doubleday, Alfred Pleasanton, Thomas
J. Wood, Seth Williams, and George Sykes, distinguished
Union generals in the Civil War. There were
many others too numerous to mention. Longstreet
afterwards met many of these officers as mortal foes
on the field of battle. He served with others in the
Confederate armies, and others served under him. McLaws
and Pickett were long fighting division commanders
in his corps.</p>
<p>Robert E. Lee, George B. McClellan, G. T. Beauregard,
and Joseph E. Johnston were not with Taylor,
and they and others, notably E. R. S. Canby, Isaac I.
Stevens, and John G. Foster, did not join the army
until Scott’s campaign opened in 1847, though it appears
that Lee was with General Wool’s column in the
movement towards Chihuahua. They were among the
great names of the subsequent Civil War. Jefferson
Davis, colonel of the Mississippi Rifles, joined Taylor
after Scott had withdrawn the regulars, but in time to
turn the tide of battle at Buena Vista. Altogether it
was a brilliant roster. They were all graduates of the
Military Academy. Of all the officers collected at Corpus
Christi, it is doubtful if there is to-day a score of
survivors. A large number were killed in action. A
far greater number died of disease in the Mexican or
Civil War campaigns.</p>
<p>Besides the long list of West Pointers, there were at
Corpus Christi many regulars appointed from civil life,
meritorious officers who afterwards made their mark.
One of these was Lawrence P. Graham, a Virginian,
already a captain in the Second Dragoons. He was
some six years Longstreet’s senior. After Mexico
Graham stuck to the old army, rose to the colonelcy of
the Fourth Cavalry in 1864, and was a Union brigadier
of volunteers. He had been in the army nearly ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
years when the Mexican War broke out. He still survives
at the green old age of eighty-eight, a retired colonel
since 1870, thirty-three years. He has been carried
on the rolls of the United States army nearly sixty-seven
years. That is one of the rewards for having
been lucky enough to espouse the winning side in 1861.
But self-interest had little to do with the choice of sides;
conscience pointed the way in that hour of passion.</p>
<p>The reunion at Corpus Christi made a deep impression
upon the fledglings of the service. The long encampment
there formed a green spot in the memory
of the little army that bore our colors in triumph to
the city of Mexico. Those who have left memoirs of
their military careers have to a man dwelt largely upon
the various interesting, though generally unimportant,
incidents of this delightful episode. March, 1846,
brought the hour of their ending; on the 9th the bugles
of the line sounded the assembly, and in obedience to
instructions from Washington General Taylor put his
army in motion by easy stages for the line of the Rio
Grande River. That movement immediately produced
a result which the government had long secretly desired,​—​war.
Negotiations for the amicable possession of
Texas and the territory to the Pacific had failed.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this paper to write the history
of the Mexican War, but a few of its salient features
may be recounted perhaps with profit.</p>
<p>Under the Texas treaty of annexation and the act
admitting Texas into the American Union the United
States claimed all the territory down to the Rio Grande
and westward to the border of New Mexico. Mexico,
on her part, denied that Texas was a free agent, although
President Santa Anna, captured by the Texans
the next day after the battle of San Jacinto in 1836,
while in durance had consented to a treaty which acknowledged
Texan independence. Texas had adopted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
a constitution and set up an independent government.
Mexico repudiated Santa Anna’s agreement, but nevertheless
had subsequently never been able to conquer the
lost territory. The entrance of the American troops into
Texas was therefore by Mexico considered a <i>casus belli</i>,
and her troops, under General Arista, crossed the river
and began aggressive war upon the United States detachments
as soon as they reached the vicinity.</p>
<p>The Mexican General Torrejon captured a detachment
of United States dragoons April 25, including
Captains Thornton and Hardee and Lieutenant Kane,
besides killing Lieutenant George J. Mason and sixteen
men. Mason was a classmate of Longstreet.
Thornton, Hardee, and Kane were well treated, and
soon after exchanged. Small bands of Mexicans committed
other depredations. Shortly after the unfortunate
incident above recited, Lieutenant Theodoric
Porter and a small party were fired upon from an
ambuscade in the chaparral, and Porter and one soldier
killed. Porter had been one of the theatrical stars at
Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>The march to Point Isabel, the siege of Fort Brown
by General Ampudia, and the stirring affairs at Palo
Alto and Resaca soon followed. The spirit of <i>camaraderie</i>
and patriotic zeal which animated the Army
of Occupation was vividly illustrated when Captain
Charles May was ordered by Taylor, at Resaca de la
Palma, to charge a Mexican battery. As May drew up
his own and Graham’s squadrons for the work, Lieutenant
Randolph Ridgely, of Ringgold’s artillery,
called out, “Hold on, Charlie, till I draw their fire,”
and he “turned loose” with his six guns upon the enemy.
The return fire was prompt, but Ridgely’s wise purpose
was accomplished. Then the invincible heroism with
which May rushed forward at the head of a handful
of the Second Dragoons signalized the qualities which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
unerringly foreshadowed the result of that war. The
opposing battery was secured in the twinkling of an eye,
and the Mexican General La Vega captured amid his
guns. May’s gallant exploit was the theme of the army.
May, Ridgely, and Longstreet were close friends, of
the trio Longstreet being youngest in years and service.
Ridgely was killed at Monterey that fall. May lived
until 1864, having resigned in 1861. He took no part
in the Civil War. The first successes of the Mexican
War were easy and decisive. The real hardships began
with the march over the sterile wastes towards Monterey.
Monterey was equally as decisive, but it was
found to be a much harder nut to crack, and here the
American losses were very heavy. The general effect
of Taylor’s operations, in conjunction with Wolf’s campaign
and the overland march of General Kearny to
California, was demoralizing to the Mexicans.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc149">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="subhead">INTO THE INTERIOR OF MEXICO</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>In after-years Lee’s admirers claimed that much of Scott’s glory
on the fields of Mexico was due to Lee’s military ability. Scott
gave him great praise.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>When it was learned that two divisions of Taylor’s
army had been ordered to the coast, there was much
speculation at the front as to the meaning of the movement.
The younger contingent immediately jumped
to the conclusion that the war was over, and that
Twiggs’s and Patterson’s troops were ordered home.
This proved not to be the case, but the army was not
much disappointed to learn that another campaign
farther south was projected. There was some friction
between Taylor and Scott over the withdrawal of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
regulars. Some of Scott’s letters to Taylor miscarried,
and Scott, pressed for time, was compelled to order the
troops he wanted down to the coast without Taylor’s
knowledge, the latter at times being far in the interior.
When Taylor learned that his best troops had been ordered
away without an hour’s previous notice, the old
general was naturally very much incensed. He was
afterwards somewhat mollified when he received Scott’s
delayed correspondence, and saw that his chief had endeavored
to reach him in the proper spirit. Scott was the
senior, and of course it was for him to order; besides,
Scott himself had orders from the President to withdraw
the troops. Taylor, however, made, both to Scott and the
Secretary of War, a sharp protest against the manner
of carrying out the design. Doubtless Taylor felt sore
upon learning that the administration intended leaving
him upon the defensive, without means to continue his
victorious advance. Buena Vista, a few weeks later,
probably melted the old fellow’s rancor into sardonic
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Once started, the troops rapidly retrograded to the
Rio Grande. The weather was fairly cool, and the
marches made from twenty to twenty-eight miles per
day. One rather warm day, while the troops were on
this move, a burnt district was passed over, and the heat
and flying smoke and ashes choked the tired men and
officers. When the column camped, it was upon a beautiful
mountain stream, into which all rushed for a bath.
First Lieutenant Sydney Smith, of the Fourth, one of
the first to start for the water, while passing through
the timber which fringed the stream, was attacked by
peccaries, a species of wild pig common in Mexico. They
are not very large, but travel in droves, and are very
fierce. They treed Smith upon a low-hanging limb
barely out of reach of his excited pursuers. The limb
was very slender for his weight, and as he swung to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
ground, the maddened peccaries reared upon their hind
feet and snapped savagely at Smith’s pendent feet and
legs. The woods were now full of the officers and men
going to the stream, and a party soon relieved Smith
from his precarious perch. Smith was a brave fellow.
He was the next year wounded at Molino del Rey, and
within a week after killed at the attack on Belen Gate.</p>
<p>There was a considerable delay at the mouth of the
river, awaiting transports. The point of assemblage of
the troops from New Orleans, Mobile, and Taylor’s army
was Lobos Island, some three hundred miles south of the
Rio Grande’s mouth. The march began January 9,
1847, but it was not until about February 12 that the
first of the regulars sailed from the Rio Grande to
Lobos Island. Scott had expected the concentration at
Lobos to have been completed three weeks earlier. The
fault was in the transport service.</p>
<p>The fleet did not leave Lobos Island until March 2.
A week later a landing was effected near Vera Cruz,
and on the 10th the first guns of the new campaign
were heard,​—​shots from the castle of San Juan de
Ulloa at Worth’s troops encamped upon the sand-hills.
The investment of the city was speedily completed and
siege operations begun. The army heard of Taylor’s
remarkable victory at Buena Vista on the 15th of
March. It took away their breath to learn that Santa
Anna had marched a great army against Taylor after
they had left, and had been defeated. It explained why
there had been so little opposition to the landing of the
American forces. Vera Cruz surrendered on the 29th.</p>
<p>Then the march into the interior of Mexico began,
led by Twiggs’s division. The first objective point was
Jalapa. Scott’s design was to get upon the mountain
plateau before the yellow-fever season approached on
the coast. It was deadly in that region. The precision
with which Scott’s plans were carried forward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
and their uniform success, made a profound impression
upon the army. His reputation was very high before
he had struck the first blow, but after Vera Cruz no
one of that army doubted that he would soon enter the
Mexican capital. The army’s morale was high from
the outset; it was small, consequently but little bothered
with the impedimenta which make the movements of a
large army so slow and oftentimes tortuous. It
marched rapidly, and Scott sent it square at the mark
every time occasion offered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was great delay in the advance to
the valley of Mexico. Operations were very energetic
in the beginning. The battle of Cerro Gordo occurred
on the 18th of April, where a complete and technically
brilliant victory was won. It was here Santa Anna,
already returned from his ill-fated movement against
Taylor, undertook to defend the passage of the mountains
against Scott’s advance. After careful reconnoissances,
the American general turned his position,
attacked his flank, and after a short fight broke up his
army in utter rout, very nearly cutting off and capturing
the whole. As it was, the Americans captured
about four thousand prisoners, forty-three cannon, and
three thousand five hundred small-arms. All this was
done with a force of less than nine thousand Americans
against some twelve thousand Mexicans strongly fortified.</p>
<p>This extraordinary victory opened the road to the
valley. Thus within twenty days Scott had effected a
landing, captured Vera Cruz, signally defeated the
enemy in pitched battle, and taken the road into the
heart of Mexico. Jalapa was entered on the 20th. At
Jalapa seven regiments of volunteers were discharged,
and the American force was too greatly reduced to
attack the capital. The enforcements promised did
not arrive. The advance, however, was pushed on to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Puebla, a city then of some seventy thousand inhabitants,
which was occupied by Worth on the 15th of May;
Lieutenant Longstreet was with the division occupying
Puebla. Here there was a long wait of weeks for the
required forces to attack the capital, now less than three
marches away. From Jalapa Scott set out for the
front on May 23, arriving at Puebla on the 28th. Many
of the higher officers rode out to meet and give the
General a proper reception, and he entered the city in
considerable state. “El Generalissimo! El Generalissimo!”
was shouted by the citizens as the general-in-chief
rode through the streets to his head-quarters. The
army welcomed him with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It was at the siege of Vera Cruz and the operations
at Cerro Gordo that the engineer officers, R. E. Lee,
G. B. McClellan, I. I. Stevens, G. T. Beauregard, and
others, began to attract the notice of the line. Taylor
had made little use of engineers in northern Mexico.
He largely depended upon his own practised military
eye to determine positions, either for the offensive or
defensive. Scott’s methods were entirely different.
He depended more upon reconnoissances led by his
staff engineers, and their reports of situations, approaches,
etc. He saw largely through the eyes of these
officers, and his fine strategy was based on their information.
Hence under Scott the engineer officers soon
began to fill a large space in the eyes of the army. They
became familiar figures.</p>
<p>Longstreet’s personal acquaintanceship with Lee
began in this campaign. He was graduated from the
Academy, No. 2 of the class of 1829, nine years before
Longstreet entered it. Lee was already a captain of
engineers when Longstreet entered as a cadet in 1838.
He was past forty when the American forces landed before
Vera Cruz. So in years he was much older, as in
rank and prestige he was away above the line subalterns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of that campaign, many of whom subsequently served
under him and against him in 1861–65. He evinced
great admiration, even reverence, for Scott’s generalship.
In after-years his admirers claimed that much of
Scott’s glory was due to Lee’s military ability. Scott
gave him great praise. But while Lee was much respected
in the army, it is due to say that nobody then
ascribed the victories of American arms to him. Besides
which, Colonel Joseph G. Totten was Scott’s chief-engineer,
and Lee had another superior present in the person
of Major J. L. Smith. The army thought General
Scott entitled to the full credit of leadership in the campaign
of 1847.</p>
<p>About August 14 sufficient reinforcements had arrived
to warrant another forward movement. Scott had
now about ten thousand men, with more coming on from
the coast. His army was composed of four divisions,
commanded by Generals Twiggs, Worth, Pillow, and
Quitman, the two latter volunteer major-generals. The
army began its final advance on the 8th of August,
1847. It had been idle nearly three months, awaiting
the action of the government. It was General Longstreet’s
opinion that with five thousand more men
Scott could have followed Santa Anna straight into
Mexico from Cerro Gordo. Owing to dilatoriness in
raising troops at home, his active force at Puebla was at
one time reduced to five thousand men. The three
months’ halt gave the demoralized enemy time to recover
courage and recruit their numbers.</p>
<p>The American advance from Puebla to the valley of
Mexico was over the Rio Frio Mountain. The pass is
over eleven thousand feet above the ocean. It was
easily susceptible of successful defence, but the experience
of the Mexicans at Cerro Gordo probably led their
generals to conclude that Scott’s strategy was irresistible
in a mountain region. At any rate there was no resistance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and after a toilsome climb of three days in the
mountains, the Americans debouched into the beautiful
valley without firing a shot.</p>
<p>This valley is one of the most singular of natural features.
It is simply a basin in the mountains without any
visible outlet. In seasons of heavy rainfall and snowfall
on the stupendous mountains which surround it,
the small lakes in this basin overflow, and sometimes inundate
the capital itself. It is only in recent years that
a channel, or tunnel, has been cut to drain off the superfluous
water in time of need. At some time in the past
the basin was probably a lake. There must have been
some unknown subterranean outlet which originally
drained it down and afterwards prevented it refilling.
Before the artificial drain was made, however, there
were indubitable signs that the lakes were much smaller
than in the beginning of the sixteenth century when
Cortés conquered the Aztec capital. The bed of this
valley is seven thousand feet above the sea level. There
are five shallow lakes in the basin. The capital is located
on the west side of Lake Tezcuco. It contained about
two hundred thousand people in 1847.</p>
<p>The army entered the valley from the east, at first
aiming to pass between Lakes Chalco and Tezcuco, but
the fortified hill of El Penyon and other obstructions
made that approach very difficult, if not impossible, and
after the engineers had examined the ground, Scott
concluded to pass around to the southward of Lake
Chalco and Xochimilco. The movement was inaugurated
on the 15th of August, four days after entering
the valley. On the 17th, the border of Lake Xochimilco
was skirted, and that night Worth bivouacked in San
Augustin, the Tlalpan of Cortés, on the road approaching
the capital from the south and west of the lakes. It
became for the time the depot and base of the army.
These preliminary movements consumed a week’s time.</p>

<h2 id="toc156">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="subhead">FROM CONTRERAS TO CHAPULTEPEC</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>While rushing up the heights of Chapultepec with the regimental
flag in his hands, Longstreet was severely wounded by a musket-ball
through the thigh. After Longstreet fell, George E. Pickett
carried the old Eighth’s flag to the works on the hill and to the top
of the castle.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>On the 18th the brilliant action of Contreras was
fought. Here Scott outmanœuvred the enemy completely,
employing again the Cerro Gordo tactics, and
striking him in flank and rear. The routed Mexicans
fled back to the fortified lines about Churubusco. Many
prisoners were captured at Contreras. The attack was
pressed against the position of Churubusco on the 19th
and 20th, resulting in the severest battle of the war, except
perhaps Buena Vista. Longstreet’s regiment, the
Eighth Infantry, of which he was adjutant, here distinguished
itself, aiding in the capture of many prisoners
and some guns. At one crucial point Longstreet had
the proud honor to carry forward the regimental colors
mentioned in Worth’s despatches. After the surrender
some of the prisoners attempted to escape by a rush, and
many of them did get away. Others were shot down
and some were recaptured. A company of Americans
who had deserted the year before from Taylor’s army
and joined the Mexicans were here captured in a body.
Their resistance had caused severe loss to the American
army. They were tried for desertion, found guilty and
a score or so of them shot to death.</p>
<p>Scott won Churubusco with less than nine thousand
men. The routed enemy fled into the city and to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
fortified hill of Chapultepec, and were followed pell
mell by the American cavalry. It was in this charge
that Phil Kearny lost his arm. He was afterwards
killed at Chantilly, in Pope’s campaign of 1862, a
Union major-general. The Americans could certainly
have entered the city that day on the heels of the flying
foe, but Scott thought it wisest to hold back and not disperse
the Mexican government, to give the American
peace commissioner, Mr. Trist, an opportunity to propose
terms. An armistice followed, but the Mexican
government declined the basis of peace proposed.</p>
<p>The Americans were in possession of the whole country
practically; at least there was nothing left to successfully
oppose their occupation of its territory to the
farthest limits. Yet after these victories, they proposed
to take only Texas, New Mexico, and California, and to
pay for them a large sum of money. Texas was counted
our own before the war began. The terms of our government
were so liberal that the Mexicans probably suspected
that there was alarm for the result of future
operations. Perhaps they judged the terms would be
no worse after another trial of arms. And they were
not.</p>
<p>Molino del Rey and Chapultepec followed on September
8 and 13 respectively. At the first affair the
Americans lost seven hundred and eighty-seven men in
the two hours of severe fighting, but won a complete
victory, as usual. The fight was made by Worth’s
division, and Longstreet’s regiment was engaged, of
course. Thus far he had got through without a scratch.</p>
<p>Scott’s army, at the outset not over-large for the contract
he had undertaken, was now very much reduced,
but its morale was still fine. It was a critical question to
determine the point of attack on the city. On the 11th
there was a council of nearly all the generals and engineer
officers at Piedad. Major Smith, Captain Lee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
and Lieutenants Tower and Stevens, of the engineers,
reported in favor of attacking the San Antonio or
southern gate. Generals Quitman, Shields, Pierce, and
Cadwalader concurred. General Scott, on the contrary,
favored the Chapultepec route, and General Twiggs
supported the general-in-chief. Alone of the engineers,
Lieutenant Beauregard favored the Chapultepec route.
After hearing Beauregard’s reasons, General Pierce
changed his opinion. At the conclusion of the conference
General Scott said, “We will attack Chapultepec
and then the western gate.”</p>
<p>“The Hill of the Grasshopper,” Chapultepec, is an
isolated mound rising one hundred and fifty to two hundred
feet above the valley. Nearly precipitous in some
parts, it slopes off gradually to the westward. Heavy
batteries frowned from its salient positions, sweeping
the approaches from all directions. To the southward
the ground was marshy. The position was regarded by
both belligerents as the key to the capital.</p>
<p>The American batteries opened fire upon Chapultepec
on the 12th, causing great destruction and killing
and wounding many of its defenders. The Mexican
leader, Santa Anna, a very brave fellow with only one
leg, was under this heavy fire for a time, taking observations
of its effect. On the 13th this fire was resumed,
followed by an assault of infantry. The volunteers of
Quitman and Pillow, led by picked storming parties,
made the assault on two fronts. The hill was carried
with a rush after Scott gave the signal of attack. Pillow
calling for reinforcements, Longstreet’s brigade was
ordered forward by General Worth, and he went into
the enemy’s works on the hill with the others.</p>
<p>Longstreet did not quite reach the works, for while
rushing up the hill with the regimental flag in his hands
he was severely wounded by a musket-ball through the
thigh. The castle, all the enemy’s guns, and many prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
were captured. General Scott rode to the summit
soon after and surveyed the work of his gallant army.
It was well done. General Worth chased the fleeing
enemy to the city’s gates. After Longstreet fell
George E. Pickett carried the flag to the works on the
hill, and to the top of the castle. The old Eighth’s flag
was hoisted from the staff which but a month before
flaunted the Mexican banner.</p>
<p>This was the last action in the valley. There was
some fighting at the gates, and desultory firing from
the houses as the American troops pushed in, but the
city fell without much loss after Chapultepec. The
Mexicans evacuated the capital that night, and General
Scott entered the next day. The Mexican War was
practically over. In a few months a treaty was made
giving the United States about what was demanded by
Mr. Trist after Churubusco in August, the United
States salving up Mexico’s wounded pride with fifteen
million dollars.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc159">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="subhead">LONGSTREET’S HONEYMOON</span></h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>After reaching home from Mexico, Longstreet soon regained his
strength. He then wrote to Colonel John Garland, of Virginia,
his old brigade commander, asking for his youngest daughter.
Colonel Garland promptly replied, “Yes, with all my heart.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>With several wounded comrades Longstreet was assigned
quarters with the Escandons, a kind-hearted, refined
Mexican family. They could not conceal their
deep chagrin at the defeat of their army, and were
doubtless mortified by the enforced presence of the
wounded Americans. Nevertheless they insisted that
those officers confined to their beds should be supplied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
from their own table. Delicacies without stint were
sent. The days of confinement were greatly brightened
by their delicate attentions. On the 1st of December
the accomplished surgeons, Satterlee and DeLeon,
thought that Longstreet was strong enough to travel,
and announced that he was to be ordered out of the
country on sick-leave.</p>
<p>With others he left Mexico on December 9. A few
days later he sailed from Vera Cruz with a large number
of sick and wounded, among whom was Brigadier-General
Pierce, who was very popular in the army.
After reaching home Longstreet soon regained his
strength. He then wrote to Colonel John Garland, of
Virginia, his late brigade commander, asking for his
youngest daughter. Colonel Garland promptly replied,
“Yes, with all my heart.” He had won fame in
Mexico and returned home on leave a month before
Longstreet was well enough to travel, and was then
with his family. The young lady and her soldier sweetheart
already had a pretty good understanding on the
subject, and her answer was equally flattering. On the
8th of March, 1848, the marriage occurred at Lynchburg.
After a brief honeymoon orders were received
from the War Department detailing Longstreet for
recruiting service, with station at Poughkeepsie, New
York. Before autumn of that year nearly all the troops
in Mexico were withdrawn, and the Eighth, Longstreet’s
old regiment, was ordered to Jefferson Barracks, St.
Louis, where he had been stationed before the war, then
a brevet second lieutenant in the Fourth.</p>
<p>After fifty years General Longstreet found that
many of the physical details of the battle terrain in the
valley of Mexico differed quite materially from the
memory conveyed by his younger eyes in the heat of
action. There was no real change in fixed landmarks,
but the depressions were not so deep, nor the impregnable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
hills the Americans attacked so high, as they appeared
when the Mexicans were defending them with
sword, musket, and cannon. In instants of supreme
danger it is very difficult for the soldier or subordinate
officer to see things exactly as they are on a battle-field.
His eye and mind are inevitably and anxiously concentrated
on the enemy or the battery that is dealing death
and destruction round about.</p>

<h2 title="GREAT BATTLES BEFORE AND AFTER GETTYSBURG"> <span class="larger">GREAT BATTLES BEFORE
AND AFTER GETTYSBURG</span><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_G" id="FNanchor_G">G</a></h2>
<h2 id="toc163">THE FIRST MANASSAS</h2>
<p>The armies that prepared for the first grand conflict
of the Civil War were commanded by West Point graduates,
both of the Class of 1838,​—​Beauregard and
McDowell. The latter had been assigned to the command
of the Federal forces at Washington, south of
the Potomac, in the latter part of May, 1861. The
former had assumed command of the Confederates at
Manassas Junction about the 1st of June. To him,
Brigadier-General Longstreet reported for duty.</p>
<p>McDowell marched on the afternoon of the 16th of
July at the head of an army of five divisions of infantry,
supplemented by nine batteries of the regular
service, one of volunteers, besides two guns operating
separately, and seven companies of regular cavalry. In
his infantry columns were eight companies of regulars
and a battalion of marines,​—​an aggregate of thirty-five
thousand men.</p>
<p>Beauregard stood behind Bull Run with seven brigades,
including Holmes, who joined on the 19th,
twenty-nine guns, and fourteen hundred cavalry,​—​an
aggregate of twenty-one thousand nine hundred men,
all volunteers. To this should be added, for the battle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
of the 21st, reinforcements aggregating eight thousand
five hundred men, under General Johnston, making the
sum of the aggregate thirty thousand four hundred
men.</p>
<p>The line behind Bull Run was the best between Washington
and the Rapidan for strategy, tactics, and army
supplies.</p>
<p>General Longstreet always believed that by vigorous
and concentrated work the Confederates, after the battle
of the first Manassas, might have followed McDowell’s
fleeing columns into Washington, and held the capital.
But this is not a part of my story.</p>
<p>On the eve of the battle the Confederates had occasional
glimpses behind the lines about Washington,
through parties who managed to evade the eyes of
guards and sentinels, which told of McDowell’s work
since May, and heard on the 10th of July that he was
ready to march. Most of the Confederates knew him
and of his attainments, as well as those of Beauregard,
to the credit of the latter, and on that point they were
satisfied. But the backing of an organized government,
and an army led by the foremost American war-chief,​—​that
consummate strategist, tactician, and organizer,
General Scott,​—​together with the splendid equipment
of the field batteries and the presence of the force of
regulars of infantry, gave serious apprehension.</p>
<p>A gentleman who was a boy in Washington during
the Civil War, said not long ago, in speaking of the
first Manassas, that he would never forget the impression
made upon his youthful mind by McDowell’s army
in moving towards Manassas Junction. Their arms
glistened in the sunshine; the new uniforms added to
the splendid bearing of the ranks; the horses were garlanded
with flowers; the silken folds of regimental
flags, lifted caressingly by the breezes of mid-summer,
made an ocean of color above the noble columns. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
was an inspiring sight; every flag in the capital was a
beckoning call to arms in the nation’s defence. McDowell’s
army seemed setting out for some festal occasion,
and gayly moved to the sound of music and song.
But oh, what a different sight after Manassas, when his
weary and routed columns straggled back to Washington,
before the victorious Confederates. Their gala day
had been of short duration.</p>
<p>On the 16th of July the Confederates learned that
the advance of McDowell’s army was under definite
orders for next day. Longstreet’s brigade was at once
ordered into position at Blackburn’s Ford, and all others
were ordered on the alert.</p>
<p>At eight o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> on the 18th McDowell’s army
concentrated about Centerville, his immediate objective
being Manassas Junction. His orders to General Tyler,
commanding the advance division, were to look well to
the roads on the direct route to Manassas Junction and
<i>via</i> the Stone Bridge, to impress an advance upon the
former, but to have care not to bring on a general engagement.</p>
<p>Under the instructions, as General Tyler construed
them, he followed the Confederates to the heights of
Centerville, overlooking the valley of Bull Run, with a
squadron of cavalry and two companies of infantry.
From the heights to the Run, a mile away, the field was
open, and partially disclosed the Confederate position
on his right. On the left the view was limited by a
sparse growth of spreading pines.</p>
<p>The enemy was far beyond the range of Confederate
guns, his position commanding as well as his metal, so
Longstreet ordered the guns withdrawn to a place of
safety, till a fair opportunity was offered them. The
guns were limbered and off before a shot reached them.
Artillery practice of thirty minutes was followed by
an advance of infantry. The march was quite up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the bluff overlooking the ford, when both sides opened
fire.</p>
<p>The first pouring-down volleys were most startling
to the new troops. Part of Longstreet’s line broke and
started at a run. To stop the alarm he rode with sabre
in hand for the leading files, determined to give them
all that was in the sword and his horse’s heels, or stop
the break. They seemed to see as much danger in their
rear as in front, and soon turned and marched back
to their places, to the evident surprise of the enemy.
Heavy firing was renewed in ten or fifteen minutes,
when the Federals retired. After about twenty minutes
a second advance was made to the top of the bluff, when
another rousing fusilade followed, and continued about
as long as the first, with like result. Longstreet reinforced
the front line with part of his reserve, and,
thinking to follow up his next success, called for one
of the regiments of the reserve brigade.</p>
<p>The combat lasted about an hour, when the Federals
withdrew to their ground about Centerville, to the delight
of the Confederates, who felt themselves christened
veterans; their artillery being particularly proud
of the combat against the famed batteries of the United
States regulars.</p>
<p>General McDowell’s order for the battle on the 21st
of July was issued on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<p>Beauregard’s order for battle, approved by General
Johnston, was issued at five <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> on the 21st.</p>
<p>The orders for marching were only preliminary, coupled
with the condition that the troops were to be held
ready to move, but to wait for special order for action.
The brigade at Blackburn’s Ford had been reinforced
by the Fifth North Carolina and Twenty-fourth Virginia
Regiments, under Lieutenant Jones and Colonel
Kemper. Longstreet crossed the Run under the five
o’clock order, adjusted the regiments to position for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
favorable action, and gave instructions for their movements
on the opening of the battle.</p>
<p>This first clash of arms tested the fighting qualities
of the Confederates; but the soil was Virginia, and for
them it was to be death or victory.</p>
<p>The close of the battle of the 21st found the Federals
beaten and fleeing towards the shelter of their
capital. They had fought stubbornly. McDowell made
a gallant effort to recover his lost power, riding with
his troops and urging them to brave effort. Although
his renewed efforts were heroic, his men seemed to have
given confidence over to despair when fight was abandoned
and flight ensued. Over the contested field of
the first battle of the war, Longstreet had borne the
victorious banners of the South.</p>

<h2 id="toc167">WILLIAMSBURG</h2>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Longstreet’s clear head and brave heart left no apology
for interference at Williamsburg.”​—​<span class="smcap">Joseph E. Johnston.</span></p></div></blockquote>
<p>This battle was fairly fought and dearly won by the
Confederacy, May 5, 1862. General Joseph E. Johnston
was chief in command and General Longstreet had
the active direction of the battle.</p>
<p>In his official report upon the battle, General Johnston
<span class="locked">said,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“The action gradually increased in magnitude until about
three o’clock, when General Longstreet, commanding the rear,
requested that a part of Major-General Hill’s troops might be
sent to his aid. Upon this I rode upon the field, but found
myself compelled to be a spectator, for General Longstreet’s
clear head and brave heart left no apology for interference.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The battle was fought by Sickles’s Federal Third
Corps, that heroically contested every inch of the
ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
It was at the close of the battle that General Hancock
distinguished himself by holding his position in
and about the forts with five regiments and two batteries
against the assault of the Fifth North Carolina
and Twenty-fourth Virginia Regiments, and it was on
this field that he won the title of “The Superb,” given
to him by McClellan in his report.</p>
<p>The object of the battle on the part of the Confederates
was to gain time to haul their trains to places of
safety. The effect besides was to call two of the Federal
divisions from their flanking move to support the
battle, thereby greatly crippling their expedition.</p>
<p>General McClellan was at Yorktown during most of
the day to see several of the divisions of his army aboard
the transports for his proposed flanking and rear move
up York River. Upon receiving advice that the Williamsburg
engagement was serious and unsatisfactory,
he hastened to the battle with the divisions of Sedgwick
and Richardson, which he had expected to send up the
river.</p>
<p>There were about nine thousand Confederates and
twelve thousand Union troops engaged. The Confederate
casualties were 1565; the Federal casualties, 2288.
Johnston had anticipated McClellan’s move up the York
River, and considered it very important to cripple or
break it up. Therein he used the divisions of Longstreet,
Magruder, D. R. Jones, McLaws, G. W. Smith,
and D. H. Hill.</p>
<p>There was a tremendous downpour of rain the night
before the battle, flooding thoroughfares, by-ways,
woodlands, and fields so that many of the Confederate
trains were unable next day to move out of the bogs that
were developed during the night.</p>
<p>General Hooker’s division of the Third Corps, on the
Federal side, came to the open on the Hampton road,
and engaged by regiments,​—​the First Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
on the left, the Second New Hampshire on the right.
After the advance of his infantry in the slashes, General
Hooker, with the Eleventh Massachusetts and
Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania, cleared the way for communication
with the troops on the Yorktown road and
ordered Webber’s six-gun battery into action. As it
burst from the woods through which it had come, the
Confederate infantry and every gun in reach opened
upon it a fire so destructive that it was unmanned before
it came into practice. New Federal troops immediately
came to the rescue, and the guns reopened fire. Osborn’s
and Bramhall’s batteries joined in, and the two poured
an unceasing fire into the Confederate troops about the
fort and redoubts. The Fifth New Jersey Regiment
was added to the battery guard, and the Sixth, Seventh,
and Eighth were deployed on the left in the woodland.
The brigades of R. H. Anderson, Wilcox, Pryor, A. P.
Hill, and Pickett were taking care of the Confederate
side.</p>
<p>General Longstreet, hearing the swelling noise of
battle, rode to the front and ordered Colston’s brigade
and the batteries of Deering and Stribling to follow,
as well as Stuart’s horse artillery under Pelham.</p>
<p>It soon became evident that the fight was for the day.
D. H. Hill was asked to return with the balance of his
division. Hooker was bracing the fight on his left.
He directed Emory to reconnoitre on his extreme left.
Grover was called to reinforce the fighting in the edge
of the woods. Several New York regiments came into
the action, but the Confederates nevertheless continued
to gain ground until they got short of ammunition.
While holding their line, some of the regiments retired
a little to fill their cartridge-boxes from those of the
fallen enemy and their fallen comrades. This move was
misconstrued into an order to withdraw, and the Confederate
line fell back, but the mistake was soon discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
and the lost ground regained. The Eleventh Massachusetts,
Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania, and Second New
Hampshire came into the action. On the Confederate
side, Colston’s brigade, the Florida regiment, and the
Mississippi battalion came to the rescue, and General
Anderson, who was in immediate charge, grouped his
forces, made a concentrated move upon the Federal batteries,
cleared them of the gunners, and captured four
of Webber’s guns and forty horses. General Stuart
rode up about this time, decided that the Federals were
in retreat, and insisted upon a charge and pursuit. He
was, however, convinced that Federal reinforcements
were coming up and that the break was only of their
front line. About three o’clock Kearny’s division came
to the Federal aid.</p>
<p>Before the reinforcements arrived for Hooker’s relief,
Anderson had established his advanced line of skirmishers
so as to cover with their fire Webber’s guns that
were abandoned. The Federal reinforcing column
drove back his advance lines; then he reinforced and
recovered his ground. Then he met General Peck, the
leader of the last reinforcing brigade, who put in his
last regiment, the Ninety-eighth Pennsylvania; but the
night was approaching, both armies were exhausted, and
little further aggressive work was done.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc170">FRAYSER’S FARM</h2>
<p>Stonewall Jackson was in the Shenandoah Valley
and the rest of the Confederate troops were east and
north of Richmond. In front General McClellan’s
army was encamped, a hundred thousand strong, about
the Chickahominy River preparing for a regular siege of
the Confederate capital. His army was unassailable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
from the front, and he had a small force at Mechanicsville
and a much larger force farther back at Beaver
Dam Creek.</p>
<p>A Confederate conference was called. Longstreet
suggested that Jackson be called down from the Valley
to the rear of the Federal right, in order to turn the
position behind Beaver Dam, and that the rest of the
Confederate forces who were to engage in the attack
cross the Chickahominy and get ready for action. General
Lee then sent General J. E. B. Stuart on his famous
ride around McClellan. He made a favorable report of
the situation. Upon further conference, the 26th was
selected as the day for moving upon the Federal position
at Beaver Dam. There was some spirited fighting
between the two armies, but the advance of Jackson,
which had been some time delayed, made the Federals
abandon their position at Beaver Dam. They were
closely followed, and were again encountered at Gaines
Mill, where battle followed.</p>
<p>Longstreet came up with reserve forces, and was preparing
to support Hill, when he was ordered by General
Lee to make a demonstration against the Federal left.
He threw in three brigades, and for a time the battle
raged with great fierceness. General Jackson could not
reach the point of attack, and General Lee ordered
Longstreet to throw in all the force he could. The position
in front of him was very strong. An open field
led to a difficult ravine beyond Powhite Creek. From
there the ground made a steep ascent, and was covered
with trees, slashed timber, and hastily made rifle-trenches.
General Whiting came up with two brigades
of Jackson’s men. Longstreet’s column of attack then
was the brigades of R. H. Anderson and Pickett and
the divisions of Law, Hood, and Whiting. They attacked
and defeated the Federals on their left and captured
many thousand stands of arms, fifty-two pieces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
of artillery, a large quantity of supplies, and many
prisoners, among them General Reynolds, who afterwards
fell at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>On the 29th General Lee ascertained that McClellan
was marching towards the James, and decided to intercept
his forces in the neighborhood of Charles City
Cross-Roads. Longstreet was to march to a point below
Frayser’s Farm with General A. P. Hill. Holmes
was to take up position below on the New Market road;
Jackson was to pursue the Federal rear; Huger to attend
to the Federal right flank. Thus the Federal rear
was to be enveloped and a part of McClellan’s army destroyed.
Longstreet found himself in due time in front
of General McCall with a division of ten thousand Federals
near Frayser’s Farm. Finally artillery firing was
heard, which was taken for the expected signal for the
beginning of battle, and Longstreet’s batteries replied
as the signal that he was ready. While the order was
going around to the batteries, President Davis and General
Lee, with their staff and followers, were with Longstreet
in a little open field near the firing lines, but not
in sight of the Federals.</p>
<p>The Federal batteries opened up spitefully. They
did not know of the distinguished Confederates near by,
yet a battery had by chance their exact range and distance,
and poured a terrific fire in their midst. The
second or third shell killed two or three horses and
wounded several men. The little party speedily retired
to safer quarters. Longstreet sent Colonel Micah Jenkins
to silence the Federal battery with his long-range
rifles. He charged the battery, and that brought on
a general fight between Longstreet’s division and the
troops in front. The Federal lines were broken and a
number of batteries taken. At points during the day
McCall several times regained his lost position. He
was finally pushed back. At length McCall’s division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
was driven off and fresh troops came to the Federal
relief. Ten thousand men of A. P. Hill’s division, held
in reserve, were now brought into action.</p>
<p>About dark General McCall, while looking up a fragment
of his division, ran into Longstreet’s arms and
was taken prisoner. General Lee was there at the time.
Longstreet had served with McCall in the old Fourth
Infantry, and offered his hand as McCall dismounted.
The Federal general did not regard this as an occasion
for renewing old friendships, and he was promptly
offered an escort of Longstreet’s staff to take him to
Richmond.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc173">MARCH AGAINST POPE AND THE
SECOND MANASSAS</h2>
<p>Even as early as 1862 the Union army had been using
balloons to examine the position of the Confederates,
and even that early, the scanty resources of the Confederates
made the use of balloons a luxury that could
not be afforded. While gazing enviously upon the
handsome balloons of the Federals floating serenely at
a distance that their guns could not reach, a Confederate
genius suggested that all the silk dresses in the Confederacy
be got together and made into balloons. This
was done, and soon a great patch-work ship of many
and varied hues was ready for use. There was no gas
except in Richmond, and so the silk-dress balloon had
to be inflated there, tied to an engine, and carried to
where it was to be sent up. One day it was on a steamer
down the James River, when the tide went out and left
the vessel and balloon on a sand-bar. The Federals
gathered it in, and with it the last silk dress in the Confederacy.
General Longstreet used to say, laughingly,
that this was the meanest trick of the war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
When General Pope came down into Virginia as
Federal commander-in-chief, with the double purpose
of drawing McClellan away from Westover and checking
the advance of the new enemy approaching from
Washington, General Lee sent Stonewall Jackson to
Gordonsville and ordered General Longstreet to remain
near Richmond to engage McClellan if he should
attempt an advance on that city. On the 9th of August,
1862, Jackson encountered the Federals near Cedar
Mountain and repulsed them at what is known as the
battle of Cedar Run. About five o’clock in the afternoon
of this fight the Federals, by a well-executed move,
were pressing the Confederates back, when the opportune
approach of two brigades converted seeming defeat
into victory. The Federals were more numerous
than the Confederates, and Jackson deemed it unwise
to follow in pursuit, so the Confederates retired behind
the Rapidan to await the arrival of General Lee with
other forces.</p>
<p>General Lee then began preparations for a vigorous
campaign against General Pope. On the 13th of August
Longstreet’s corps was ordered to Gordonsville,
and General Lee accompanied it there. General Jackson’s
troops were near by. The Rapidan River was to
the north. Farther on at Culpeper Court-House was
the army of Pope, and the Rappahannock River was
beyond them. Clark’s Mountain, rising several hundred
feet above the surrounding hills, was a little in advance
of Longstreet’s position. The Federal situation was
observed from the summit of this mountain.</p>
<p>The flags of Pope’s army were in full view above
the tops of the trees around Culpeper Court-House.
General Lee was very anxious to give battle as soon as
possible, but operations were in some way delayed until
General Pope captured a despatch from Lee to Stewart
containing information of the contemplated advance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Pope then withdrew to a stronger position behind
the Rappahannock River. Longstreet approached
the Rappahannock at Kelly’s Ford, and Jackson approached
higher up at Beverly Ford, near the Orange
and Alexandria bridge. They found Pope in an almost
unassailable position, with heavy reinforcements summoned
to his aid.</p>
<p>The Confederate idea was to force a passage and
make the attack before reinforcements could reach
Pope. Some sharp marching to this end was done by
Longstreet and Jackson. On the 23d Longstreet had
a spirited artillery combat at Beverly Ford with a
Federal force. The Federals had the superior position,
the better guns; the Confederates had more guns, and
fought with accustomed persistence. Before night the
Federals withdrew. Incidentally, they set fire to a
number of farm-houses in the locality. Henry W.
Grady, afterwards a distinguished Georgian, who was
a small boy during the war, frequently said that one of
the worst things about the Union forces was the carelessness
with which they handled fire.</p>
<p>Pope was meanwhile on the alert, and Lee found it
impracticable to attack him in his stronghold behind the
Rappahannock. Lee then decided to change his plan
of operations by sending Jackson off on a long march
to the rear of the Federal army while keeping Longstreet
with thirty thousand men in front to receive any
attack that might be made. Jackson crossed the Rappahannock
at Hinson’s Hill, four miles above Waterloo
Bridge, and that night encamped at Salem. The next
day he passed through Thoroughfare Gap, moved on
by Gainesville, and when the sun next set he was in the
rear of Pope’s army and between it and Washington.
The sudden appearance of his army gave much terror
to the Federals in the vicinity; when he arrived at Bristoe
Station just before night the Federal guard at that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
point sought safer quarters, and two trains of cars
coming from towards Warrenton were captured. Jackson
sent a force forward seven miles and captured Manassas
Junction. He left a force at Bristoe Station and
proceeded himself to the Junction. During the afternoon
the Federals attacked the Confederates at Bristoe
Station in such force as to make it appear that Pope had
discovered the situation and was moving upon Jackson
with his entire army. The Confederates then hastened
away from Bristoe Station and the Federals halted
there. Jackson’s forces then moved over to a position
north of the turnpike leading from Warrenton to Alexandria,
and there awaited results.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 28th King’s division attacked
Jackson, but was repulsed. That same evening Longstreet
arrived at Thoroughfare Gap. During the time
of Jackson’s march he had been engaging Pope’s army
at different points along the Rappahannock, to impress
them with the idea that he was attempting to force a
passage in front and with the hope of preventing his
discovery of Jackson’s movement. Pope was not deceived,
however, but turned his army to meet Jackson’s
daring and unexpected move. Longstreet decided to
follow at once. To force a passage of the river, much
swollen by recent rains, seemed impossible, and so he
took the route by which Jackson had gone. Finding
that Thoroughfare Gap was unoccupied, he went into
bivouac on the west side of the mountain and sent a
brigade under Anderson to occupy the pass.</p>
<p>As the Confederates approached from one side, Ricketts’s
division of Federals approached from the other
and took possession of the east side. Thoroughfare
Gap is a rough pass in the Bull Run Mountains, in some
places not more than a hundred yards wide. A swift
stream rushes through it, and the mountains rise on
both sides several hundred feet above. On the north<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the face of the Gap is almost perpendicular; the south
face is less precipitous, but is covered with tangled
mountain ivy and projecting boulders; the position,
occupied by a small force, was unassailable. The interposition
of Ricketts’s division at this mountain pass
showed a disposition to hold Longstreet back while overwhelming
Jackson. This necessitated prompt and vigorous
measures by Longstreet. Three miles north was
Hopewell Gap, and it was necessary to get possession
of this in advance of the Federals to provide for a flank
movement while forcing the way by foot-paths over the
mountain heights of Thoroughfare Gap. During the
night Longstreet sent Wilcox with three brigades to
Hopewell Gap, while he sent Hood and his forces by a
trail over the mountain at Thoroughfare.</p>
<p>To the great delight of the Confederates, in the
morning it was discovered that Ricketts had given up
the east side of the Gap and was going towards Manassas
Junction. Longstreet’s corps then went along unimpeded.
Hearing the artillery combat around Gainesville,
they quickened their steps. As the fire became
more spirited their movements became more rapid.
Passing through Gainesville, they filed to the left down
the turnpike, and soon came in sight of the Federal
troops held at bay by Jackson. They were on the left
and rear of the Federals; the artillery was ordered up
for action, but the advance was discovered, and the
Federals withdrew from attack and retired behind
Groveton on defensive ground. The battalion of Washington
Artillery was thrown forward to a favorable
position on Jackson’s right, and Longstreet’s general
line was deployed so as to extend it to the right some
distance beyond the Manassas Gap Railroad.</p>
<p>The two great armies were now face to face, both in
good positions, each anxious to find a point for an entering
wedge into the stronghold of the adversary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
What troubled the Confederates was the unknown number
of Federals at Manassas Junction. Each side
watched the movements of the other until the day was
far spent. Orders were given for a Confederate advance
under the cover of night until the main position
of the enemy could be more carefully examined by the
earliest light of the next day. It so happened that a
similar order was issued at the same time by the Federals,
and the result was a spirited engagement, which
was a surprise to both sides. Longstreet’s corps was,
however, successful, so far, at least, as to capture a piece
of artillery and make reconnoissance before midnight.
The next day Longstreet did not deem an attack wise,
and the Confederate forces were ordered back to their
original positions. Then each side was apprehensive
that the other was going to get away.</p>
<p>Pope telegraphed to Washington that Longstreet was
in full retreat and he was preparing to follow; while
Longstreet, thinking Pope was trying to escape, was
arranging to move to the left across Bull Run, so as to
get over on the Little River pike and between Pope and
Washington. Just before nine o’clock that day (the
30th) Pope’s artillery began to play a little, and some
of his infantry was seen in motion. Longstreet construed
this as a display to cover his movements to the
rear. Later a large division of Pope’s army began an
attack on the left along the whole of Jackson’s line.
Pope evidently supposed that Longstreet was gone, and
intended to crush Jackson with a terrific onslaught.
Longstreet was meanwhile looking for a place to get
in. Riding along the front of his line, he could plainly
see the Federals as they rushed in heavy masses against
Jackson’s obstinate ranks. It was a splendidly organized
attack.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption7"><img alt="" height="340" src="images/i_178fp.jpg" width="600" id="img_178"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption7">DEFEAT OF THE FEDERAL TROOPS BY LONGSTREET’S CORPS, SECOND MANASSAS.</div></div>
<p>Longstreet received a request from Jackson for reinforcements,
and about the same time an order from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
General Lee to the same effect. Longstreet quickly ordered
out three batteries. Lieutenant Chapman’s Dixie
Battery of four guns was the first to report, and was
placed in position to rake the Federal ranks. In a moment
a heavy fire of shot and shell was poured into the
thick columns of the Federals, and in ten minutes their
stubborn masses began to waver. For a moment there
was chaos; then there was order, and they reformed to
renew the attack. Meanwhile, Longstreet’s other eight
pieces had begun deadly work. The Federal ranks
broke again and again, only to be reformed with dogged
determination.</p>
<p>A third time the Longstreet batteries tore the Federals
to pieces, and as they fell back under this terrible
fire Longstreet’s troops leaped forward with the famous
rebel yell. They pressed onward until, at ten o’clock
at night, they had the field. Pope was across Bull Run
and the victorious Confederates lay down to sleep on
the battle-ground, while around them thousands of
friend and foe slept the last sleep together.</p>
<p>The next morning the Federals were in a strong position
at Centerville. Longstreet sent a brigade across
Bull Run under General Pryor to occupy a point near
Centerville. General Lee ordered Jackson to cross Bull
Run near Sudley’s and turn the position of the Federals
occupying Centerville. On the next day (September 1)
Longstreet followed, but the Federals discovered the
move, abandoned Centerville, and started towards
Washington. On that evening a part of the Federal
force at Ox Hill encountered Jackson and gave him a
sharp fight. Longstreet went to Jackson’s rescue.</p>
<p>With the coming darkness it was difficult to distinguish
between the scattered ranks of the opposing armies.
General Philip Kearny, a magnificent Federal officer,
rode hastily up looking for the broken lines of his command.
At first he did not know that he was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Confederate line, and the Confederates did not notice
that he was a Federal. He began quietly to inquire
about some command, and was soon recognized. He
was called upon to surrender, but instead of doing so
he wheeled his horse, pressed spurs to his sides, lay flat
on the animal’s neck, and dashed away like the wind.
A dozen shots rang out, and in less time than it takes
to tell the story the heroic Kearny fell dead. He had
been in the army all his life; the Confederate generals
who had formerly been in the Union army knew him;
Longstreet loved him well; General A. P. Hill, who
was standing by, said, sorrowfully, “Poor Kearny! he
deserved a better death than this.” The next day his
body was sent over the lines with a flag of truce and a
note from General Lee referring tenderly to the manner
in which he had met his death. The Federal forces
which had been fighting the Ox Hill battle proved to be
the rear guard covering the retreat of the Federals into
Washington.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc180">THE INVASION OF MARYLAND AND
THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM</h2>
<p>General Longstreet always thought that the division
of the Confederate army after they moved into
Maryland proved their downfall. This, however, is not
a part of my story.</p>
<p>At this time General Pope had been relieved and
General McClellan restored to the command of the
Union army. With ninety thousand troops, he marched
towards Antietam to avenge the second Manassas.</p>
<p>General D. H. Hill was at South Mountain with five
thousand men; Longstreet’s First Corps was at Hagerstown,
thirteen miles farther on; General Lee was
with him, and on the night of the 13th of September,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
1862, information was received that McClellan was at
the foot of South Mountain with his great army. It
was decided to withdraw the forces of Longstreet and
Hill from their respective positions and unite at Sharpsburg,
which afforded a strong defensive position. On
the afternoon of the 15th of September the commands
of Longstreet and Hill crossed the Antietam Creek and
took position in front of Sharpsburg, Longstreet on the
right and Hill on the left. They soon found their weak
point was on the left at the famous Dunkard Church.
Hood, with two brigades, was put to guard that point.
That night, after the fall of Harper’s Ferry, General
Lee ordered Stonewall Jackson to come to Sharpsburg
as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>On the forenoon of the 15th the blue uniforms of
the Federals appeared among the trees that crowned the
heights on the eastern bank of the Antietam. Their
numbers increased in proportions distressing to their
opponents, who were shattered by repeated battles, tired
by long marches, and fed most meagrely. On the 16th
Jackson arrived and took position on Longstreet’s left.
Before night the Federals attacked, but were driven
back. Hood was ordered to replenish his ammunition
during the night and resume his position on Longstreet’s
right in the morning. General Jackson’s forces were
extended to the left, and reached well back towards the
Potomac, where most of the Confederate cavalry was.
General Robert Toombs was placed as guard on the
bridge at Longstreet’s right.</p>
<p>On the Federal side General Hooker, who had been
driven back in the afternoon, was reinforced by the
corps of Sumner and Mansfield; Sykes’s division was
also drawn into position for battle; Burnside was over
against Longstreet’s right threatening the passage of
the Antietam. On the morning of the 17th the Federals
were in good position and in good condition. Back of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
McClellan’s line was a high ridge, upon which he had
a signal-station overlooking every point of the field.
D. R. Jones’s brigades of Longstreet’s command deployed
on the right of the Sharpsburg pike, while
Hood’s brigades awaited orders; D. H. Hill was on
the left towards the Hagerstown-Sharpsburg pike;
Jackson extended out from Hill’s left towards the Potomac.</p>
<p>The battle opened heavily with attacks by Hooker,
Mansfield, and Sumner against Longstreet’s left centre,
which consisted of Jackson’s right and D. H. Hill’s
left. So persistent were the attacks that Longstreet
sent Hood to support the Confederate centre. The
Confederates were forced back somewhat; McClellan’s
forces continued the attacks; the line swayed forward
and back like a rope exposed to rushing currents; a
weak point would be driven back and then the Confederate
fragments would be collected and the lost ground
recovered; the battle ebbed and flowed with fearful
slaughter on both sides. The Federals came forward
with wonderful courage, and the Confederates heroically
held their ground, while they were mown down like
grass.</p>
<p>How Lee’s ragged army withstood McClellan’s
troops no one will ever be able to tell. Hood’s ammunition
gave out; he retired for a fresh supply; the Federals
continued to come up in great masses. At one
point, under the crest of a hill occupying a position that
from four to six brigades should have held, there were
only the stranded troops of Cooke’s regiment of North
Carolina Infantry, who were without a cartridge. As
Longstreet rode along the line of his staff, he saw two
pieces of Washington Artillery (Miller’s battery), but
there were not enough men to handle them. The gunners
had all been killed or wounded​—​and this was the
Confederate centre. Longstreet held the horses of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
staff-officers, put them to man the guns, and calmly surveyed
the situation. He saw that if the Federals broke
through the line at that point the Confederate army
would be cut in two and probably destroyed. Cooke
sent him word that his ammunition was entirely out.
Longstreet replied that he must hold his position as long
as he had a man left. Cooke responded that he would
show his colors as long as there was left a man alive to
hold them up. The two guns were rapidly loaded with
canister by the staff-officers, and they rattled leaden hail
into the Federals as they came up over the crest of the
hill. That little battery, with superhuman energy, had
to hold thousands of Federals at bay, or the whole battle
would be lost.</p>
<p>The Confederates sought to make the Federals believe
that many batteries were before them. As they
came up, they would see the colors of Cooke’s North
Carolina regiment waving as placidly as if the whole
of Lee’s army were back of them, while a shower of
canister came from the two lonely guns. General Chilton,
General Lee’s chief of staff, made his way to Longstreet
and asked, “Where are the troops you are holding
your line with?” Longstreet pointed to his two
pieces and to Cooke’s regiment, and replied, “There
they are; but that regiment hasn’t a cartridge.” Chilton,
dumb with astonishment, rode back to tell the story
to General Lee. Then an enfilade fire from General
D. H. Hill’s line ploughed the ground across the Federal
front and kept them back; meanwhile, R. H.
Anderson and General Hood came to the support of
this fearfully pushed Confederate centre. In a little
while another Federal assault was made against D. H.
Hill and extending far to the Confederate left, where
McLaws and Walker were supporting Jackson. In
this fearful combat the lines swung back and forth,
the Federals attacking with invincible motion and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Confederates holding their positions with irresistible
force.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, General Lee was over towards the right,
where Burnside was making the attack. General
Toombs, assigned as guard at that point, had only four
hundred weary and footsore soldiers to meet the Federal
Ninth Corps, which pressed the brave little band
slowly back. The delay that Toombs caused, however,
saved that part of the battle, for at the last moment
A. P. Hill came in to reinforce him and D. H. Hill
discovered a place for a battery and lost no time in opening
it. Thus the Confederates drove the Federals back,
and when night settled down the army of Lee was still
in possession of the field. But it was a victory that was
not a victory, for thousands of Confederates were dead
on the field and gallant commands had been torn into
fragments. Nearly one-fourth of the troops who went
into the battle were killed or wounded. This day has
been well called the bloodiest day of the Civil War.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was fond of telling how during
the battle he and General Lee were riding along his
line and D. H. Hill’s when they started up a hill
to make a reconnoissance. Lee and Longstreet dismounted,
but Hill remained on his horse. General
Longstreet said to Hill, “If you insist on riding up
there and drawing the fire, give us time to get out of
the line of the fire when they open up anew.” While
they were all standing there viewing with their glasses
the Federal movements, Longstreet noticed a puff of
white smoke from a Federal cannon. He called to
Hill, “That shot is for you.” The gunner was a mile
away, but the cannon-shot took off the front legs of
Hill’s horse. The horse’s head was so low and his croup
so high that Hill was in a very ludicrous position. With
one foot in the stirrup he made several efforts to get
the other leg over the croup, but failed. Lee and Longstreet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
yelled at him to dismount from the other end of
the horse, and so he got down. He had a third horse
shot under him before the close of the battle. General
Longstreet said that that shot at Hill was the second
best shot he ever saw. The best was at Yorktown, where
a Federal officer came out in front of the Confederate
line, sat down to a little platting table, and began to
make a map. A Confederate officer carefully sighted
a cannon, touched it off, and dropped a shell into the lap
of the man at the little table a mile or more away.</p>
<p>After the battle closed, parties from both sides, by
mutual consent, went in search of fallen comrades.</p>
<p>After riding along the lines, giving instructions for
the night and morning, General Longstreet rode for
general head-quarters to make report, but was delayed
somewhat, finding wounded men hidden away under
stone walls and in fence-corners, not yet looked after,
and afterwards in assisting a family whose home had
been fired by a shell, so that all the other officers had
arrived, made their reports, and were lounging about
on the sod when General Longstreet rode up. General
Lee walked up as he dismounted, threw his hands upon
his shoulders, and hailed him with, “Here is my old war-horse
at last!”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc185">FREDERICKSBURG</h2>
<p>When General Lee learned that General McClellan
had been succeeded by General Burnside, he expressed
regret at having to part with McClellan, because, he
said, “We always understood each other so well. I
fear they may continue to make these changes till they
find some one whom I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>The Federal army was encamped around Warrenton,
Virginia, and was divided into three grand divisions,
under Generals Sumner, Hooker, and Franklin. Lee’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
army was on the opposite side of the Rappahannock
River, divided into two corps, the First commanded by
General Longstreet and the Second by General Thomas
J. (Stonewall) Jackson. At that time the Confederate
army extended from Culpeper Court-House, where
the First Corps was stationed, across the Blue Ridge,
down the Valley of Virginia, to Winchester, where Jackson
was encamped with the Second Corps. Information
was received about the 19th of November that Sumner
with his grand division of more than thirty thousand
men was moving towards Fredericksburg. Two of
General Longstreet’s divisions were ordered down to
meet him. After a forced march they arrived on the
hills around Fredericksburg about three o’clock on the
afternoon of the 21st (November, 1862). Sumner had
already arrived, and was encamped on Stafford Heights
overlooking the town from the Federal side.</p>
<p>About the 26th it became evident that Fredericksburg
would be the scene of a battle, and Longstreet advised
the people who were still in town to leave. A previous
threat from the Federal forces that they might have to
shell the town had already forced many to leave. Distressed
women, little children, aged and helpless men,
many of them destitute and with nowhere to go, trudged
away as best they could. Soon the remainder of Longstreet’s
corps came up from Culpeper Court-House,
and it was then known that all the Army of the Potomac
was in motion for the prospective scene of battle, when
Jackson was drawn down from the Blue Ridge. In a
short time the Army of Northern Virginia was face to
face with the Army of the Potomac. On the Confederate
side nearest the Rappahannock was Taylor’s Hill,
and South of it Marye’s Hill; next, Telegraph Hill, the
highest Confederate elevation, afterwards known as
Lee’s Hill, because General Lee was there during the
battle. Longstreet’s head-quarters in the field were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
there. Next was a declination through which Deep Run
Creek passed on to the Rappahannock, and next was
Hamilton’s Crossing, upon which Stonewall Jackson
massed thirty thousand men. Upon these hills the Confederates
prepared to receive Burnside whenever he
might choose to cross the Rappahannock.</p>
<p>The Federals occupied the noted Stafford Heights
beyond the river, and here they carefully matured their
plans of advance and attack. General Hunt, chief of
artillery, skilfully posted one hundred and forty-seven
guns to cover the bottoms upon which the infantry was
to form for the attack, and at the same time play upon
the Confederate batteries. Franklin and Hooker had
joined Sumner, and the Federal army were one hundred
and sixteen thousand strong. The Federals had been
seen along the banks of the river investigating the best
places to cross. President Lincoln had been down with
General Halleck, who had suggested that a crossing
be made at Hoop-Pole Ferry, about twenty-eight or
thirty miles below Fredericksburg. The Confederates
discovered this movement, and it was then abandoned.
There were sixty-five thousand Confederates well located
upon the various hills on the other side of the
river. Anderson, McLaws, Ransom, Hood, A. P. and
D. H. Hill, Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson, and the
great Robert E. Lee himself were all there.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th of December, 1862, an
hour or so before daybreak, the slumbering Confederates
were awakened by a cannon thundering on the
heights of Marye’s Hill. It was recognized as the signal
of the Washington Artillery, and it told that the
Federal troops were preparing to cross the Rappahannock
and give battle. The Federals came down to the
river and began to build their bridges, when Barksdale
and his heroic Mississippians opened fire, which forced
them to retire. The Federals then turned their whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
artillery force on Fredericksburg, demolishing the
houses with a cyclone of fire. The only offence of the
little town was that it was situated where the battle
raged. The little band of Mississippians kept up their
work, and like so many angry hornets stung the whole
Army of the Potomac into frenzy. Longstreet ordered
Barksdale to withdraw, and the Federals then constructed
their pontoons without molestation, and the
next day Sumner’s grand division passed over into Fredericksburg;
General Franklin’s grand division passed
over on pontoon bridges lower down and massed on the
level bottoms opposite Hamilton’s Crossing, in front of
Stonewall Jackson’s corps. Opposite Fredericksburg
the formation along the river bank was such that the
Federals were concealed in their approaches, and they
thereby succeeded in getting over and concealing the
grand division of Sumner and a part of Hooker’s grand
division in Fredericksburg, and so disposing of Franklin
in the open plain below as to give out the impression
that the great force was there to oppose Jackson.</p>
<p>Before daylight of the eventful 13th Longstreet rode
to the right of his line, held by Hood’s division, which
was in hearing of the Federals who were marching their
troops to the attack on Jackson. Longstreet ordered
Hood, in case Jackson’s line should be broken, to wheel
around to his right and strike in on the attacking bodies,
while he ordered Pickett with his division to join in the
flank movement. He told them at the same time that he
himself would be attacked near his left centre, that he
would be personally at that point, and that his position
was so well defended that he would not need their troops.
He returned to Lee’s Hill soon after sunrise.</p>
<p>There was a thick fog that morning, and the preparations
of the Federals were concealed thereby. The Confederates
grimly awaited the onslaught. About ten
o’clock the sun burst through the fog and revealed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
mighty panorama in the valley below. Franklin’s forty
thousand men, reinforced by two divisions of Hooker’s
grand division, were in front of Jackson’s thirty thousand.
The flags of the Federals fluttered gayly, their
polished arms shone brightly, and the beautiful uniforms
of the buoyant troops gave a holiday air to the
scene. A splendid array it was. Awaiting their approach
was Jackson’s ragged infantry, and beyond was
Stuart’s battered cavalry. The majority of the Federal
troops were in Fredericksburg almost in reach of the
Confederate guns. There was some lively firing between
a part of Franklin’s command and a part of
Stuart’s Horse Artillery under Major John Pelham.
Franklin advanced rapidly towards Jackson; silently
Jackson awaited his approach until within good range,
and then opened with a terrific fire, which threw the
Federals into some confusion. The Federals again
massed and advanced, and pressed through a gap in
Jackson’s line. Then they came upon Gregg’s brigade,
and a severe encounter ensued in which Gregg was mortally
wounded. The concentration of the divisions of
Taliaferro and Early against this attack drove the Federals
back.</p>
<p>On the Confederate side near the town was a stone
wall, shoulder high. Behind this stone wall Longstreet
had placed General T. R. R. Cobb’s brigade and a portion
of the brigade of General Kershaw,​—​about two
thousand five hundred men in all. To reach Longstreet’s
weakest point the Federals had to pass directly
over this wall.</p>
<p>Just before noon Longstreet sent orders to all his
batteries to open fire as a diversion in favor of Jackson.
This fire began at once to develop work for Longstreet.
The Federal troops swarmed out of Fredericksburg and
came in double-quick towards Cobb’s wall. From the
moment of their appearance fearful carnage began.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
The Confederate artillery from the front, right, and
left tore through their ranks, but the Federals pressed
forward with almost invincible determination. Thus
they marched upon the stone fence behind which Cobb’s
brigade was quietly waiting. When the Federals came
within its reach they were swept from the field like chaff
before the wind. A vast number went pell-mell into
an old railroad cut to escape fire from the right and
front. A battery on Lee’s Hill saw this, and turned its
fire into the entire length of the cut, and wrought frightful
destruction. Though thus repulsed and scattered
in its first attempt to drive the Confederates from
Marye’s Hill, the determined Federal army quickly
formed again and filed out of Fredericksburg to another
charge. Again they were forced to retire before
the well-directed guns of Cobb’s brigade and the fire of
the artillery on the heights.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption8"><img alt="" height="346" src="images/i_190fp.jpg" width="600" id="img_190"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption8">THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG, FROM THE BATTERY ON LEE’S HILL.</div></div>
<p>Still again they formed and advanced, and again they
were driven off. By this time they had difficulty in
walking over the dead bodies of their comrades. So
persistent were they in their continuing advances that
General Lee, who at the time was with Longstreet on
Lee’s Hill, became uneasy and said that he feared the
Federals would break through his line. To this Longstreet
replied, “General, if you put every man now on
the other side of the Potomac on that field to approach
me over the same line, and give me plenty of ammunition,
I will kill them all before they reach my line. Look
to your right; you are in some danger there, but not on
my line.” As a precaution, General Kershaw was ordered
with the remainder of his brigade down to the
stone wall to carry ammunition to Cobb and to reinforce
him if necessary. Kershaw arrived just in time to succeed
Cobb, who was falling from a Federal bullet, to
die in a few minutes from loss of blood. A fifth time
the Federals formed, charged, and were repulsed, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
likewise a sixth time, when they were again driven back,
and night came to end the dreadful carnage. The Federals
then withdrew, leaving the field literally piled up
with the bodies of their dead. The Confederate musketry
alone killed and wounded at least five thousand,
while the artillery brought the number of those killed
and wounded at the foot of Marye’s Hill to over seven
thousand.</p>
<p>During the night a Federal strayed beyond his line,
was taken up by Longstreet’s troops, and on his person
was found a memorandum of General Burnside’s
arrangements and an order for the renewal of the battle
next day. Upon receiving this information General
Lee gave immediate orders for a line of rifle-pits on the
top of Marye’s Hill for General Ransom, who had been
held somewhat in reserve, and for other guns to be
placed on Taylor’s Hill. The Confederates were up
before daylight on the morrow, anxious to receive General
Burnside again. The Federal troops, however, had
left the field. It was at first thought that the memorandum
was intended as a ruse of war, but it was afterwards
learned that General Burnside expected to resume
attack, but gave it up when he became fully aware
of the fate of his soldiers at the foot of Marye’s Hill.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc191">CHICKAMAUGA</h2>
<p>This battle marked the only great Confederate victory
won in the West, and was one of the bloodiest
battles of the war. Indeed, the contest for the bloodiest
day in this great war is, I believe, between Antietam and
Chickamauga. Official reports show that on both sides
the casualties embrace the enormous proportion of
thirty-three per cent. of the troops actually engaged.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
On the Union side there were over a score of regiments
in which the losses in this single fight exceeded 49.4
per cent. The “Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava,”
immortalized by Tennyson, did not suffer by ten
per cent. as much as did thirty of the Union regiments
at Chickamauga; and a number of Confederate regiments
suffered even more than their Federal opponents.</p>
<p>Longstreet’s command in less than two hours lost
nearly forty-four per cent. of its strength. Of the
troops that received their splendid assaults, Steedman’s
and Brannan’s commands lost respectively forty-nine
and thirty-eight per cent. in less than four hours. The
loss of single regiments showed a much heavier percentage.
For instance, the Tenth Tennessee Regiment
lost sixty-eight per cent.; the Fifth Georgia, 61.1; the
Second Tennessee, 60.2; the Sixteenth Alabama, 58.6;
a great number of them more than fifty per cent.</p>
<p>The total Confederate losses were about 18,000 men;
the total Federal losses, about 17,000. Viewed from the
stand-point of both sides, Chickamauga was the fifth
greatest battle of the war, being exceeded only by Gettysburg,
Spottsylvania, the Wilderness, and Chancellorsville.
But each of these battles were of a much
longer time. The total Confederates engaged in the
battle were 59,242; the total Federals, 60,867. The battle
was fought on the 20th of September, 1863.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption9"><img alt="" height="341" src="images/i_192fp.jpg" width="600" id="img_192"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption9">BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA. CONFEDERATES FLANKING THE UNION FORCES.</div></div>
<p>The movements of both sides were too complex to be
followed here. During a very hot part of the battle,
General Hood, on the Confederate side, was fearfully
wounded; General Benning, of his “Rock Brigade,”
lost his own horse, and thought that General Hood was
killed and that everything was gone to smash. He cut
a horse loose from a captured gun, grabbed a rope trace
as a riding whip, mounted, and rode to meet General
Longstreet and report. He had lost his hat in the mêlée,
and everything was in terrible shape. He <span class="locked">reported,​—​</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Hood killed, my horse killed, my brigade torn to
pieces, and I haven’t a single man left.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>General Longstreet smiled, and quietly asked him if
he did not think he could find <i>one</i> man. Quieted by the
tone of the question, he began to look for his men, found
quite a number of them, and quickly joined the fighting
forces at the front, where he discovered that the Confederates
had carried the first line, that Johnson’s division
was in the breach and pushing on, with Hindman
spreading battle to the enemy’s limits, Stuart’s division
holding bravely on, and the brigades of Kershaw and
Humphreys coming along to help restore the battle to
good organization.</p>
<p>About one o’clock in the day lunch was ordered spread
for a number of the officers. General Longstreet meanwhile
rode with General Buckner and the staffs to view
the changed conditions of the battle. He could see but
little of the enemy’s line, and only knew it by the occasional
exchange of fire between the skirmishers. Suddenly
the party discovered that they had passed the
Confederate line and were within the fire of the Federal
sharp-shooters, who were concealed behind the trees and
under the brush. They came back in more than double-quick.
General Longstreet ordered General Buckner
to establish a twelve-gun battery on the right and enfilade
the Federal works. Then he rode away to enjoy a
sumptuous spread of Nassau bacon and Georgia sweet
potatoes. They were not accustomed to potatoes of any
kind in Virginia, and the Georgia variety was a peculiar
luxury. While the lunch was in its first stages a fragment
of shell came tearing through the woods, passed
through a book in the hands of a courier who sat his
horse hard by reading, and struck down the chief of
ordnance, Colonel T. P. Manning. Friends sprang forward
to look for the wound and give relief. Manning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
had just taken an unusually large bite of sweet potato,
and was about suffocating thereby. He was supposed
to be gasping for his last breath when General Longstreet
suggested that he be relieved of the potato and
given a chance to breathe. This done, he soon revived,
and was ready to be taken to the hospital, and in a few
days he was again ready for either a Federal shell or a
Georgia potato.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of the battle were many and varied,
but finally the Federal forces quit the field and the different
wings of the Confederate army came together
and greeted each other with loud huzzas. The Army of
the Tennessee was ready to celebrate its first grand victory,
in spite of the great losses sustained. The twilight
dews hung heavy over the trees, as if to hush the voice
of victory in the presence of death, but nevertheless, the
two lines, which neared as they advanced, united their
shouts in increasing volume, not as the cannon’s violent
noise, but as one great burst of harmony that seemed
almost to lift from their rooted depths the great forest
trees. Before greetings and congratulations upon the
success had passed it was night, and the mild beams of
the quartering moon were more suggestive of Venus
than of Mars, as Longstreet rested in the white light
of the one great triumph of Confederate arms in the
West.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc194">IN EAST TENNESSEE</h2>
<p>About the 1st of November, 1863, it was determined
at Confederate head-quarters that Longstreet should
be ordered into East Tennessee against General Burnside’s
army.</p>
<p>On the 22d of October General Grant joined the
army, and it was known that General Sherman was
marching to join him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
On the 20th of October General Burnside reported
by letter to General Grant an army of twenty-two thousand
three hundred men, with ninety-odd guns, but his
returns for November gave a force of twenty-five thousand
two hundred and ninety, and over one hundred
guns. Eight thousand of his men were on service north
of Knoxville and about Cumberland Gap.</p>
<p>To march, capture, and disperse this formidable force,
fortified at points, Longstreet had about fifteen thousand
men, after deducting camp guards and foraging
parties. Marching and fighting had been his almost
daily occupation from the middle of January, 1863,
when he left Fredericksburg to move down to Suffolk,
Virginia, until the 16th of December, when he found
bleak winter again breaking upon him, away from
friends, and dependent upon his own efforts for food
and clothing for his ragged and hungry Confederates.</p>
<p>It is not in the purview of this paper to more than
briefly refer to Longstreet’s work in East Tennessee in
the bitter winter of 1863–64. He has said that Washington’s
men at Valley Forge did not suffer more than
his command on the hard campaigns of that severe winter.
Much of the time half-clad and shoeless, the snow-covered
ground bore the bloody imprint of their naked
feet. They were compelled to dig holes in the frozen
ground, which were thawed out by fires to furnish their
usual couch. They had nothing to eat but parched corn.
But the brave fellows never lost heart. They undertook
to make a joke of their dire straits. As General Longstreet
rode out among them, they would call cheerily to
know if they might not have a little fodder to eat with
their corn.</p>
<p>It is now generally conceded that no more valorous
service was rendered the Confederate cause during the
four years’ fighting than Longstreet’s work in East
Tennessee, cut off from supplies, improperly supported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
by his government, and sent with an inadequate force
to attack Burnside in his stronghold.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grant, a few years before her death, in discussing
the events of those campaigns, said to me that General
Grant had come to Nashville to spend Christmas
with her. She had scarcely given him greeting when a
hurried message came from Knoxville,​—​“Longstreet
is coming!” He was much perturbed at having to
forego his Christmas with his family and return immediately
to his works about Knoxville. In parting she
said to him, “Now, Ulysses, you know that you are not
going to hurt Longstreet.” Grant quickly replied, “I
will if I can get him; he is in bad company.”</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption10"><img alt="" height="342" src="images/i_196fp.jpg" width="600" id="img_196"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption10">THE ASSAULT ON FORT SANDERS, KNOXVILLE.</div></div>
<p>To “get” Longstreet or to drive him out of Tennessee
came to be the chief concern of Grant and his government.
General Halleck was much concerned about
the Confederate army in East Tennessee, the only strategic
field then held by Southern troops. It was inconveniently
near Kentucky and the Ohio River. President
Lincoln and his War Secretary added their anxiety to
Halleck’s on account of its politico-strategic bearing.
General Halleck urged his views upon General Grant,
and despatched General Foster that it was of first importance
to “drive Longstreet out of Tennessee and
keep him out.” General Grant ordered: “Drive Longstreet
to the farthest point east that you can.” It was
easier to issue that order than to execute it. And Grant
reported to the authorities:</p>
<p>“If Longstreet is not driven out of the valley entirely,
and the road destroyed east of Abingdon, I do
not think it unlikely that the last great battle of the
war will be fought in East Tennessee. Reports of deserters
and citizens show the army of Bragg to be too
much demoralized and reduced by desertions to do anything
this winter. I will get everything in order here
in a few days and go to Nashville and Louisville, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
if there is still a chance of doing anything against Longstreet,
to the scene of operations there. I am deeply
interested in moving the enemy beyond Saltville this
winter, so as to be able to select my own campaign in
the spring, instead of having the enemy dictate it to
me.”</p>
<p>About the middle of December orders were given the
Confederate army, which was on the west bank of the
Holston River, to cross and march for the railroad,
only a few miles away.</p>
<p>The transfer of the army to the east bank of the river
was executed by diligent work and the use of such flatboats
and other means of crossing as could be collected
and constructed. They were over by the 20th, and before
Christmas were in camps along the railroad near
Morristown. Blankets and clothes were scarce, shoes
more so. But to the hungry Confederates the beautiful
country in which they found themselves seemed a land
of milk and honey. The French Broad River and the
Holston are confluent at Knoxville. The country between
and beyond them contains as fine farming-lands
and has as delightful climate as can be found. Stock
and grain were on all farms. Wheat and oats had been
thoughtfully hidden away by the Federals, but the fields
were full of maize, still standing. The country around
the French Broad had hardly been touched by the foragers.
The Confederate wagons immediately on entering
the fields were loaded to overflowing. Pumpkins
were on the ground in places like apples under a tree.
Cattle, sheep, and swine, poultry, vegetables, maple
sugar, and honey were all abundant for immediate wants
of the troops.</p>
<p>When the Federals found that the Confederates had
moved to the east bank, their cavalry followed to that
side. They were almost as much in want of the beautiful
foraging lands as the Confederates, but there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
little left for them. With the plenitude of provisions
for the time, and many things which seemed luxuries,
the Confederates were not altogether happy. Tattered
garments, blankets, and shoes (the latter going, many
gone) opened ways, on all sides, for piercing winter
blasts. There were some hand-looms in the country,
from which there was occasionally picked up a piece of
cloth, and here and there other comforts were received,
some from kind and some from unwilling hands, which
nevertheless could spare them. For shoes the men were
compelled to resort to the raw hides of beef cattle as
temporary protection from the frozen ground. Then
soldiers were discovered who could tan the hides of
beeves, some who could make shoes, some who could
make shoe-pegs, some who could make shoe-lasts; so it
came about, through the varied industries of Longstreet’s
men, that the hides passed rapidly from the
beeves to the feet of the soldiers. Thus the soldier’s life
was made, for a time, passably pleasant in the infantry
and artillery. Meanwhile, the Confederate cavalry
were looking at the Federals, and the Federals were
looking at them, both frequently burning powder between
their lines.</p>
<p>General Sturgis had been assigned to the cavalry of
the other side, to relieve General Shackelford, and he
seemed to think that the dead of winter was the time
for cavalry work; and the Confederate General Martin’s
orders were to have the enemy under his eye at all
hours. Both were vigilant, active, and persevering.</p>
<p>About December 20 a raid was made by General
Averill from West Virginia upon a supply depot of
General Sam Jones’s department, at Salem, which was
partially successful, when General Grant, under the impression
that the stores were for East Tennessee, wired
General Foster, “This will give you great advantage.”
And General Foster despatched General Parke, commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
his troops in the field, December 26, “Longstreet
will feel a little timid now, and will bear a little
pushing.”</p>
<p>General Grant made a visit to Knoxville about New
Year’s, and remained until the 7th. He found General
Foster in the condition of the Confederates,​—​not properly
supplied with clothing, especially in want of shoes.
So he authorized a wait for clothing, then in transit and
looked for in a week; and that little delay was a great
lift for the Confederates.</p>
<p>Before leaving General Foster, General Grant ordered
him, on receipt of clothing, to advance and
“drive Longstreet at least beyond Bull’s Gap and Red
Bridge.” And to prepare for that advance, he ordered
the Ninth and Twenty-third Corps to Mossy Creek, the
Fourth Corps to Strawberry Plains, and the cavalry to
Dandridge.</p>
<p>The Union army​—​equipped​—​marched on the 14th
and 15th of January. The bitter freeze of two weeks
had made the rough angles of mud as firm and sharp
as so many freshly quarried rocks, and the bare feet of
the Confederates on this march left bloody marks along
the roads.</p>
<p>General Sturgis rode in advance of the army, and
occupied Dandridge by Elliott’s, Wolford’s, and Garrard’s
divisions of cavalry and Mott’s brigade of infantry.
The Fourth and Twenty-ninth Corps followed the
cavalry, leaving the Ninth Corps to guard at Strawberry
Plains.</p>
<p>General Martin gave prompt notice that the march
was at Dandridge and in full force. Dandridge is on
the right bank of the French Broad River, about thirty
miles from Knoxville. Its topographical features are
bold and inviting of military work. Its other striking
characteristic was the interesting character of its citizens.
The Confederates​—​a unit in heart and spirit​—​<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>were
prepared to do their share towards making an effective
battle, and the plans were so laid.</p>
<p>At the time ordered for his advance General Foster
was suffering from an old wound, and General Parke
became commander of the troops in the field. The latter
delayed at Strawberry Plains in arranging that part
of his command, and General Sheridan, marching with
the advance, became commander, until superseded by
the corps commander, General Gordon Granger.</p>
<p>The Confederate plans were laid before the army was
all up. Their skirmish line was made stronger, and relieved
the cavalry of their dismounted service. A narrow,
unused road, practicable for artillery, was found
that opened a way for the Confederates to reach the
enemy’s rearward line of march. Sharp-shooters were
organized and ordered forward by it, to be followed by
our infantry columns. It was thought better to move
the infantry alone, as the ringing of the iron axles of
the guns might give notice of the Confederate purpose;
the artillery to be called as the Confederate sharp-shooters
approached the junction of the roads. The
head of the turning force encountered a picket-guard,
some of whom escaped without firing. General Granger
decided to retire, and was in time to leave the crossroads
behind him, his rear guard passing the point of
intersection before the Confederate advance party
reached it about midnight.</p>
<p>The weather moderated before night, and after dark
a mild, gentle rain began to fall.</p>
<p>When Longstreet rode into Dandridge in the gray
of the morning the ground was thawing and hardly firm
enough to bear the weight of his horse. When the
cavalry came at sunrise the last crust of ice had melted,
letting the animals down to their fetlocks in heavy limestone
soil. The mud and want of a bridge to cross the
Holston made pursuit by the heavy Confederate columns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
useless. The cavalry was ordered on, and the
troops at Morristown, on the Strawberry Plains road,
were ordered to try that route, but the latter proved to
be too heavy for progress with artillery.</p>
<p>While General Longstreet rode through the streets
of Dandridge, giving directions for such pursuit of the
fleeing Federals as could be made, a lady came out upon
the sidewalk and invited him into her parlors. When
the orders for pursuit were completed, he dismounted,
and with some members of his staff walked in. After
the compliments of the season were passed, the Confederates
were asked to be seated, and the lady told,
with evident great enjoyment, of General Granger
during the night before. She had never heard a person
swear about another as General Granger did about General
Longstreet. Some of the officers proposed to stop
and make a battle, but General Granger swore, and
said, “It’s no use to stop and fight Longstreet. You
can’t whip him. It don’t make any difference whether
he has one man or a hundred thousand.” Presently she
brought out a flask that General Granger had forgotten,
and presented it to General Longstreet. It had
about two horizontal fingers left in it. Though not left
with compliments, it was accepted. Although the
weather had moderated, it was very wet and nasty, and
as General Longstreet had taken his coffee at three
o’clock, it was resolved to call it noon and divide the
spoils. Colonel Fairfax, who knew how to enjoy good
things, thought the occasion called for a sentiment, and
offered, “General Granger​—​may his shadow never
grow less.”</p>
<p>The cavalry found the road and its side-ways so cut
up that the pursuit was reduced to a labored walk. The
previous hard service and exposure had so reduced the
animals that they were not in trim for real effective cavalry
service. They found some crippled battery forges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
and a little of other plunder, but the enemy passed the
Holston and broke his bridges behind him, and Longstreet’s
men returned to their huts and winter homes.</p>
<p>To seek some of the fruits of his advantage at
Dandridge, the roads being a little firmer, General
Longstreet ordered his leading division, under General
Jenkins, on the 21st, to proceed to march towards
Strawberry Plains, and the Richmond authorities were
asked to send a pontoon bridge, tools of construction,
and to hurry forward such shoes as they could send.</p>
<p>On the 24th, as the official records show, General
Grant sent word to General Halleck of Longstreet’s
return towards Knoxville; that he had ordered General
Foster to give battle, if necessary, and that he would
send General Thomas with additional troops to insure
that Longstreet would be driven from the State. He
also directed General Thomas to go in person and take
command, and said, “I want Longstreet routed and
pursued beyond the limits of Tennessee.” And he ordered
General Foster to put his cavalry on a raid from
Cumberland Gap to cut in upon Longstreet’s rear.</p>
<p>On the 6th of February General Grant reported from
<span class="locked">Nashville,​—​</span></p>

How General Grant abandoned the move against
Longstreet, while Longstreet kept Schofield bottled up
all through that trying winter in his works about Knoxville,
is old history.</p>
<p>The Confederate government finally abandoned the
plan of occupying East Tennessee, and on the 7th of
April Longstreet was ordered, with the part of his command
that had originally served with the Army of
Northern Virginia, to join General Lee on the Rapidan.</p>
<p>I have gone thus far into the East Tennessee campaigns
for the pleasure it gives me to reproduce the
following resolutions passed by the Confederate Congress
during General Longstreet’s arduous work in the
winter of 1863–64:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“No. 42. Joint Resolutions of Thanks to Lieutenant-General
Longstreet and the officers and men of his command.</p>
<p>“<i>Resolved by the Congress of the Confederate States of
America</i>, That the thanks of the Congress are due, and hereby
cordially tendered, to Lieutenant-General James Longstreet and
the officers and men of his command, for their patriotic services
and brilliant achievements in the present war, sharing as they
have the arduous fatigues and privations of many campaigns in
Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Tennessee, and
participating in nearly every great battle fought in those States,
the commanding general ever displaying great ability, skill, and
prudence in command, and the officers and men the most heroic
bravery, fortitude, and energy, in every duty they have been
called upon to perform.</p>
<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the President be requested to transmit a copy
of the foregoing resolutions to Lieutenant-General Longstreet
for publication to his command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>
<h2 id="toc205">THE WILDERNESS</h2>
<p>The Wilderness is a forest land about fifteen miles
square, lying between and equidistant from Orange
Court-House and Fredericksburg. It is broken occasionally
by small farms and abandoned clearings, and
two roads,​—​the Orange Plank Road and the turnpike,
which are cut at right angles by the Germania road,​—​in
general course nearly parallel, open ways through it
between Fredericksburg and the Court-House. The
Germania Ford road joins the Brock road, the strategic
line of the military zone, and crosses the turnpike at
Wilderness Tavern and the plank road about two miles
south of that point.</p>
<p>General Grant was making his head-quarters near the
Army of the Potomac, in Culpeper County, Virginia,
commanded by Major-General George G. Meade. The
aggregate of the Federal command was about one hundred
and thirty thousand men.</p>
<p>The Army of Northern Virginia was on the west side
of the Rapidan River. Its total number at the beginning
of the campaign was then put by Colonel Taylor,
chief of staff, at about sixty-four thousand.</p>
<p>However, the numerical strength of the armies did
not decide the merits of the campaign. The commanders
on both sides had chosen their ground after
mature deliberation. They knew of each other’s numbers
and resources, and made their plans accordingly.
A number of their respective leaders had known each
other personally for more than twenty years. They had
the undivided support and confidence of their governments
and their armies. General Lee was as always the
trusted leader of the Confederates; General Grant by
his three years’ service in the West had become known
as an all-round soldier seldom if ever surpassed. General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Longstreet, who thought most highly of General
Grant from every stand-point, always said that the biggest
part of him was his heart.</p>
<p>In this case General Grant had no fixed plan of
campaign except to avoid the strong defensive line
occupied by General Lee, and to draw him out to
open battle.</p>
<p>General Lee’s orders were against a general engagement
until the Federal forces should attack, but in the
midst of varied manœuvrings the battle was begun in
half a dozen quarters before either commanding general
had expected it. Hancock advanced before sunrise
ready for battle, just as Longstreet’s command, which
had come up from Mechanicsville, reported to General
Lee. Longstreet’s line was formed along the right and
left of the plank road, Kershaw on the right, Field on
the left. Hancock’s musketry was doing considerable
damage to the forces in front, and as Longstreet’s lines
were forming the men broke files to give free passage
for their comrades to the rear. The advancing fire was
getting brisk, but not a shot was fired in return by Longstreet’s
troops until the divisions were ready. Three of
Field’s brigades were formed in the line of the left, and
three of Kershaw’s on the right. The advance of the
six brigades was ordered, and Hancock’s lines, thinned
by their previous fighting and weaker than the fresh
men now coming against them, were checked and pushed
back to their intrenched lines. Then the fighting became
steady and firm.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption11"><img alt="" height="339" src="images/i_206fp.jpg" width="600" id="img_206"><br><div class="caption" id="ebm_caption11">THE WOUNDING OF GENERAL LONGSTREET AT THE WILDERNESS, MAY 6, 1864.</div></div>
<p>Finally Hancock’s line began to break. As they retreated
and the Confederates advanced, a fire was
started in the dry leaves and began to spread. The
Confederate forces, in spite of the fire, moved on. As
the battle waged, General Wadsworth, who was gallantly
leading a division of the Federal forces, fell
mortally wounded, and there was then a general break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
in the Union line. Jenkins’s brigade was conspicuous
among the Confederates in pursuit. Jenkins exclaimed
to those around him, “I am happy; I have felt despair
of the cause for some months, but am relieved, and feel
assured that we will put the enemy back across the Rapidan
before night.” A few minutes later he fell mortally
wounded. In the general mêlée Longstreet was leading
in advance of his troops, and in the midst of close firing
was shot by his own men. This caused the Confederate
lines to slow up in their advance. Orders were given
General Field by Longstreet to push on before the
enemy could have time to rally, but in the midst of the
general confusion, General Lee ordered the broken lines
to be reformed, and the advantage already gained was
not followed up.</p>
<p>General Field, in his subsequent account of the day,
<span class="locked">said,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“I was at Longstreet’s side in a moment, and in answer to
my anxious inquiry as to his condition, he replied that he would
be looked after by others, and directed me to take command of
the corps and push on. Though at this moment he could not
have known the extent or character of his wounds (that they
were severe was apparent), he seemed to forget himself in the
absorbing interest of the movement he was making.</p>
<p>“Had our advance not been suspended by this disaster, I have
always believed that Grant would have been driven across the
Rapidan before night; but General Lee was present, and
ordered that our line, which was nearly a right angle, should
first be straightened out. The difficulty of manœuvring through
the brush made this a tedious operation, so that when we did
advance with large reinforcements from Ewell’s Corps placed
under my orders, the enemy was found awaiting us behind new
breastworks, thoroughly prepared.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>In a letter touching this subject to General Longstreet,
Colonel Fairfax <span class="locked">said,​—​</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“On reaching the line of troops you were taken off the horse
and propped against a tree. You blew the bloody foam from
your mouth and said, ‘Tell General Field to take command, and
move forward with the whole force and gain the Brock road,’
but meantime hours were lost.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>A Northern <span class="locked">historian<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_H" id="FNanchor_H">H</a></span> said, on the same <span class="locked">point,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“It seemed indeed that irretrievable disaster was upon us; but
in the very torrent and tempest of the attack it suddenly ceased
and all was still. What could cause this surcease of effort at
the very height of success was then wholly unknown to us.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Some years after, General Hancock said to General
<span class="locked">Longstreet,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“You rolled me up like a wet blanket, and it was some hours
before I could reorganize the battle.”</p></div></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc208">THE CURTAIN FALLS AT APPOMATTOX</h2>
<p>In discussing the war, General Longstreet always
dwelt with peculiar tenderness on the last days that culminated
with the surrender at Appomattox. His mental
belief for two years before the surrender was that from
the very nature of the situation the Union forces would
in all probability finally triumph, but his brave heart
never knew how to give up the fight, and the surrender
was at last agreed upon while he was still protesting
against it.</p>
<p>The incident is well known of a number of the leading
Confederate generals, who, having decided that further
resistance was useless, went to General Lee and suggested
surrender upon the best terms that could be had
as the wisest thing to do. General Longstreet declined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
to join with them. General Pendleton was spokesman
for the party. His account of the conference is thus
related by General A. L. Long in his Memoirs of Lee:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Lee was lying on the ground. No others heard
the conversation between him and myself. He received my communication
with the reply, ‘Oh, no; I trust that it has not
come to that,’ and added, ‘General, we have yet too many bold
men to think of laying down our arms. The enemy do not
fight with spirit, while our boys do. Besides, if I were to say
a word to the Federal commander, he would regard it as such
a confession of weakness as to make it the condition of demanding
an unconditional surrender, a proposal to which I will
never listen.... I have never believed we could, against the
gigantic combination for our subjugation, make good, in the
long run, our independence, unless some foreign power should,
directly or indirectly, assist us.... But such considerations
really make with me no difference. We had, I am satisfied, sacred
principles to maintain, and rights to defend, for which we were
in duty bound to do our best, even if we perished in the endeavor.’</p>
<p>“Such were, as nearly as I can recall them, the exact words
of General Lee on that most pitiful occasion. You see in them
the soul of the man. Where his conscience dictated and his
judgment decided, there his heart was.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>No words of eulogy show up so clearly the characters
of Lee and likewise of Grant as their own direct words
and deeds. On the evening of April 7, 1865, General
Grant wrote General Lee as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“The results of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness
of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern
Virginia in this struggle. I feel that it is so, and regard
it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any
further effusion of blood by asking of you the surrender of
that portion of the Confederate army known as the Army of
Northern Virginia.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
General Longstreet was with General Lee when he
received this note. It was handed to General Longstreet
without a word. After reading it General Longstreet
handed it back, saying, “Not yet.” General Lee
replied to General Grant that same evening:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“I have received your note of this day. Though not entertaining
the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further
resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I
reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and
therefore, before considering your proposition, ask the terms
you will offer on condition of its surrender.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>While this correspondence was pending, both armies,
under the respective directions of Grant and of Lee,
continued their preparations for battle as if there was
no thought of cessation. The next day, April 8, General
Grant wrote General Lee as follows:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Your note of last evening, in reply to mine of the same date
asking the conditions on which I will accept surrender of the
Army of Northern Virginia, is just received. In reply I would
say that, peace being my great desire, there is but one condition
I would insist upon,​—​namely, that the men and officers
surrendered shall be disqualified for taking up arms again
against the United States government until properly exchanged.
I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet any officers
you might name for the same purpose, at any point agreeable
to you, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon
which the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia will be
received.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>To this General Lee replied, under the same date:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“I received at a late hour your note of to-day. In mine of
yesterday I did not intend to propose the surrender of the Army
of Northern Virginia, but to ask the terms of your proposition.
To be frank, I do not think the emergency has arisen to call
for the surrender of this army, but as the restoration to peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
should be the sole object of all, I desired to know whether your
proposals would lead to that end. I cannot, therefore, meet you
with a view to the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia;
but as far as your proposal may affect the Confederate States
forces under my command and tend to the restoration of peace,
I should be pleased to meet you at ten <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> to-morrow on the
old stage road to Richmond, between the picket-lines of the two
armies.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>That night General Lee spread his couch about a hundred
feet from the saddle and blanket that were General
Longstreet’s pillow for the night, and it is not
probable that either had a more comfortable bed than
the other. Of the early hours of the next day, the last
day of active existence of the Army of Northern Virginia,
Colonel Venable, of General Lee’s staff, has
written a touching account, which is published in General
Long’s “Memoirs of General Lee.” When further
resistance seemed useless, he quoted General Lee as <span class="locked">saying,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Then there is nothing left me but to go and see General
Grant, and I would rather die a thousand deaths.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Many were the wild words of passionate grief spoken
by the officers around him. Said one, “Oh, General,
what would history say of the surrender of the army in
the field?” According to Colonel Venable, General Lee
replied, “Yes, I know they will say hard things of us;
they will not understand how we are overwhelmed with
numbers. But that is not the question; the question is,
Is it right to surrender this army? If it is right, then
I will take all the responsibility.”</p>
<p>Presently General Lee called General Longstreet to
ride forward with him. He said that the advance columns
stood against a very formidable force which he
could not break through, while General Meade was at
Longstreet’s rear ready to call for all the work that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
rear guard could do. He added that it did not seem
possible for him to make further successful resistance.
General Longstreet asked if the sacrifice of his army
could benefit the cause in other quarters. He thought
not. Then, said Longstreet, “The situation speaks for
itself.” Several other leading generals were consulted,
and all of them held the same view.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Federal forces appeared plainly to be
preparing for attack. The Confederates continued
work on their lines of defence. General Longstreet
ordered parts of the rear guard forward to support the
advance forces, and directed General E. P. Alexander
to establish them with part of his batteries in the best
position for support or rallying line in case the front
lines were forced back.</p>
<p>Thus the last line of battle formed in the Army of
Northern Virginia was by the invincible First Corps,
twice conqueror of empire!</p>

<p>In talking over the delicate situation, General Lee
told General Longstreet that he feared his refusal to
meet General Grant’s proposition might cause him to
demand harsh terms. General Longstreet assured him
that he knew General Grant well enough to be certain
that the best terms possible would be given​—​even such
terms as he himself would be willing to give a gallant
foe under similar circumstances. How true this estimate
proved all the world now knows.</p>

<h2 id="toc214">JAMES LONGSTREET</h2>
<p>James Longstreet was born in Edgefield District, South
Carolina, January 8, 1821, son of James and Mary Ann (Dent)
Longstreet, and a descendant of the Longstreets and Randolphs
of New Jersey and the Dents and Marshalls of Maryland and
Virginia. Richard Longstreet, progenitor of the name in
America, settled in Monmouth County, New Jersey.</p>
<p>James Longstreet, subject of this sketch, removed with his
parents to Alabama in 1831, from which State he received his
appointment to West Point, and was graduated from the United
States Military Academy in 1842. He was promoted in the
army as brevet second lieutenant of the Fourth Infantry, July
1, 1842, and served in garrison at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri,
1842–44; on frontier duty at Natchitoches, Louisiana, 1844–45;
was promoted second lieutenant of the Eighth Infantry,
March 4, 1845; was in military occupation of Texas, 1845–46,
and served in the war with Mexico, 1846–47. He participated
in the battle of Palo Alto; May 8, 1846; the battle of
Resaca de la Palma, May 9, 1846; was promoted first lieutenant
Eighth Infantry, February 23, 1847, and participated in the
siege of Vera Cruz, March 9–29, 1847; the battle of Cerro
Gordo, April 17 and 18, 1847; the capture of San Antonio
and the battle of Churubusco, August 20, 1847; the battle of
Molino del Rey, September 8, 1847; the storming of Chepultepec,
September 13, 1847, where he was severely wounded in
the assault on the fortified convent. He was brevetted captain,
August 20, 1847, “for gallant and meritorious conduct in the
battles of Churubusco and Contreras,” and major, September 8,
1847, “for gallant and meritorious conduct at the battle of
Molino del Rey.” He served as adjutant of the Eighth Infantry,
1847–49; was in garrison at Jefferson Barracks, 1848–49;
and served on frontier duty in Texas in 1849. He was
chief of Commissariat of the Department of Texas, 1849–51,
and served on scouting duty in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico,
1851–61. He was promoted captain, December 7, 1852, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
major of staff and paymaster July 19, 1858. He resigned his
commission in 1861 and was appointed brigadier-general in the
Confederate States army, and commanded a brigade at Blackburn’s
Ford, Virginia, from July 18 to and including July 21,
1861. He was promoted major-general and commanded the
rear guard of Joseph E. Johnston’s army during the retreat
from Yorktown, Virginia. He commanded the Confederate
forces in the field, composed of his own and part of D. H.
Hill’s division and Stuart’s cavalry brigade, at the battle of
Williamsburg, May 5, 1862; commanded the right wing of
Johnston’s army at Seven Pines, May 31 and June 1, 1862; his
own and A. P. Hill’s division, in the Seven Days’ Battle before
Richmond; and commanded the right wing of Lee’s army of
Northern Virginia in the second battle of Bull Run, August 29
and 30, 1862; and in the Maryland campaign, September,
1862; the First Corps (Confederate left) at the battle of
Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862. He was on duty south of
the James River in April, 1863, and was ordered to rejoin
General Lee at Chancellorsville, Virginia, but Lee, without
awaiting his return made precipitate battle May 2 to 4, 1863.
He commanded the right wing of the Army of Northern Virginia
at Gettysburg July 1 to 3, 1863. He served under
General Bragg in the Army of the Tennessee, and commanded
the left wing of that army, composed of Hindman’s division,
Polk’s corps, Buckner’s corps, and two divisions and artillery
of Longstreet’s corps, at the battle of Chickamauga, September
19 and 20, 1863. He was sent with part of his corps and
Wheeler’s cavalry against Burnside’s army in East Tennessee,
in November, with orders to recover possession of that part of
the State. He drove Burnside back into his works around
Knoxville, and held him there under siege from November 17
to December 4, 1863, when Sherman approached with twenty
thousand of Grant’s army, near Chattanooga, for relief of the
besieged army. Bragg ordered precipitate attack of the fortifications,
but they were too strong to be carried by assault.
Just then orders came from President Davis for Longstreet to
return to Bragg’s army in distress at Chattanooga. Longstreet
held his army in possession of East Tennessee, keeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
the Federal forces close about their works, until January, 1864,
when he was ordered to withdraw towards General Lee’s army
in Virginia, and he participated in the battle of the Wilderness,
May 5 and 6, 1864, when he commanded the two divisions of the
First Corps forming the right of Lee’s army, and was severely
wounded. After convalescing he participated in all the engagements
of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1864. He
commanded the First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia
from the date of its organization until surrendered by General
Lee at Appomattox Court-House, Virginia, April 9, 1865. He
was called the hardest fighter in the Confederate army, and the
fairest military critics of the century have estimated his military
genius as second to no commander in the Confederate
States service.</p>
<p>He removed to New Orleans and engaged in commerce immediately
after the surrender. He was Surveyor of Customs
of the Port of New Orleans, 1869; Supervisor of Internal
Revenue, 1878; Postmaster at Gainesville, Georgia, 1879, and
was appointed by President Hayes United States Minister to
Turkey, serving 1880. He was United States Marshal of the
Northern District of Georgia, in 1881, and was appointed
United States Commissioner of Railroads by President McKinley
in October, 1897, serving until the date of his death in 1904.</p>
<p>On the 8th day of March, 1848, at Lynchburg, Virginia, he
was married to Marie Louise Garland, daughter of General John
Garland, U.S.A., of a noted Virginia family, hero of two wars.
Mrs. Longstreet died at Gainesville, Georgia, December 29,
1889.</p>
<p>On the fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Molino del Rey,
September 8, 1897, at the Executive Mansion in Atlanta,
Georgia, he was married to Helen Dortch, daughter of the late
Colonel James S. Dortch, a brilliant Georgia lawyer, of a distinguished
North Carolina family.</p>
<p>General Longstreet died at Gainesville, Georgia, January 2,
1904, and was buried at Alta Vista Cemetery, that place, with
military honors, January 6.</p>

<h2 id="toc217">THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES</h2>
<h3>(<i>A. S. Hardy, in the Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia.</i>)</h3>
<p class="sigright smaller">
<span class="smcap">Gainesville, Georgia</span>, January 6, 1904.<br>
</p>
<p>The funeral of General James Longstreet, which was held at
eleven o’clock to-day at the county court-house, was the most
impressive ceremonial ever held in Gainesville. Several thousand
people gathered in and around the court-house, and when
the guards threw open the doors to the public just preceding the
service, which occurred in the main court-room instead of in the
rotunda as originally intended, there was a great crush, though
every endeavor was made to handle the vast throng with every
possible ease. Only a few minutes were consumed in filling
every available seat, and outside there appeared to be absolutely
no diminution in the size of the crowd.</p>
<p>A few moments before twelve o’clock, the active pall-bearers
bore the casket up the stairway from the rotunda, where it had
lain in state from two o’clock yesterday, and placed it in position
just in front of the judge’s rostrum. It was banked in a
profusion of exquisite floral offerings, many of which came from
out-of-town Confederate camps, other organizations, and from
personal friends. Across the head and foot were thrown a Confederate
and a United States flag, and standing near was the
handsome silk flag of the Candler Horse Guards.</p>
<p>If any should doubt that the people among whom the General
lived did not love him and revere his memory, this doubt would
have been dispelled to-day if they had seen the demonstration
over his casket as the last sad rites were being said. Not a
business house in town was open, everything in the city closing
tight their doors from the beginning of the funeral until after
the body was placed to rest in Alta Vista Cemetery. From
every quarter the people came and upon every lip there was
praise of the immortal deeds of the great Confederate commander.</p>
<p>As the body was being placed in position, Bishop Keiley,
Father Schadewell, of Albany, and Father Gunn, of Sacred
Heart Church, Atlanta, emerged from the judge’s private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
chambers on the left and were escorted to a position in front of
the casket. The burial service of the Roman Catholic Church
was conducted by the Right Rev. Bishop Keiley, of Savannah;
Father Schadewell, of Albany, and Dr. Gunn, of the Sacred
Heart Church, of Atlanta. Father Schadewell read the liturgical
Latin service, then gave the same in English. Some of the
beautiful prayers are given elsewhere.</p>
<p>After reading the service and the blessing of the remains
the right reverend bishop, who himself had served as a soldier
from 1860 to 1864 in the Confederate army under Longstreet,
spoke as follows:</p>
<p>“Had it pleased God that the cause which met defeat at Appomattox
eight and thirty years ago had been crowned with
that success for which both its justice and the singular devotedness
of its defenders had given us right and warrant to
hope, a far different scene had been witnessed here to-day. It
might have been that Federal as well as State authorities had
met to pay a merited tribute to this dead hero, who valiantly
sustained on many a bloody field the imperishable principles of
the right of self-government.</p>
<p>“Had it pleased God to spare the precious lives of those of
his companions in arms who have passed over the river, then
we had seen the peerless Lee, the brave Johnston, and the dashing
Hampton sharing our grief and mingling their tears with
ours over the remains of the soldier whom Lee loved. Is there
e’en a suggestion of irreverence in the thought which would
people this hall with the dauntless spirits of our dead?</p>
<p>“Having met defeat in an unequal struggle and having
loyally accepted the results of that struggle; having devoted
our time and scanty means to the upbuilding of our loved land;
having been blessed by a merciful God beyond our dreams or
deserts, we lay aside our tasks to-day for awhile to recall the
glories of our past and to tell of the valor of one who fought
and bled for us.</p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">“The foeman need not frown,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i2">They are all powerless now;<br></span>
<span class="i0">We gather here and we lay them down,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And tears and prayers are the only crown<br></span>
<span class="i2">We bring to wreathe each brow.<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>“Having passed the span which Providence ordinarily allots
as the term of human life, General James Longstreet has answered
the roll-call of the great God.</p>
<p>“What a brilliant page in history is filled with his grand
career. Born more than eighty years ago in the neighboring
State of South Carolina, he entered West Point in his seventeenth
year and graduated therefrom in his twenty-first. He
served with marked distinction in the Mexican War and was more
than once complimented for his gallant conduct and merited
and received promotion.</p>
<p>“When the Southern States withdrew from the Union by
reason of attacks on their reserved rights which were guaranteed
by the Constitution, and were forced into the war between the
States, James Longstreet offered his services and sword to the
cause of self-government. No history of the war may be written
which does not bear emblazoned on every page the story of his
deeds. Why need I recount them here? Assuredly no one will
question the gross impropriety of discussing incidents of the
career of Longstreet during the war which have been the subject
of criticism by some.</p>
<p>“We who knew him forty-odd years ago; we who shared
his convictions and in humble ways bore a part in the good
cause; we know what a tower of strength Longstreet was to the
noblest knight who has graced tented field since the peerless
Bayard passed from earth,​—​Robert E. Lee; we feel and know
to-day that neither boundless praise nor fullest words of gratitude
can exaggerate the worth of James Longstreet or pay him
what we owe.</p>
<p>“By what I deem is a peculiarly fortunate coincidence, we
are committing his remains to the tomb on a day when the
Catholic Church commemorates the manifestation of our Saviour
to the Gentiles in the persons of the wise men, who, led by a
star, came from their distant homes to Bethlehem. The Bible
tells us that they found the Child and Mary, His Mother.
God has sent stars which have been beacon-lights on our pathway
through the world, though in their gleaming we have foolishly
failed at times to see the guiding hand of a merciful Providence.
Joy and sorrow, sickness, and even death have been stars which
should have led us nearer and nearer to God.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
“It is my duty as a priest of God to call your attention to
the obvious lesson of this occasion,​—​the vanity of mere earthly
greatness and the certainty of death and the necessity of preparation
for it. James Longstreet was a brave soldier, a gallant
gentleman, but better still​—​a consistent Christian. After the
war between the States he became a member of the Catholic
Church, and to his dying day remained faithful to her teaching
and loyal to her creed.</p>
<p>“Deep down in the heart and breast of every man when
touched by the correcting hand of God there is a longing for
some means of communicating with loved ones who have been
taken from us by death. Oh that we might reach them or tell
them of our love or do something for them!</p>
<p>“In that familiar profession of faith, which comes down to
us even from the days of the immediate followers of the Master,
there is a clause which brings comfort to the afflicted heart of
the sorrowing and answers the longings of the grief-stricken.
It is that solemn profession of our belief in the communion of
saints.</p>
<p>“To the Catholic heart it tells of a golden chain of intercession
longer than the ladder of the patriarch and reaching from
the cold dead clods of earth even to the great throne of God;
a golden chain which links and binds together the children of
God here and above; a brilliant and mystic tie which binds and
unites the blessed ones who now see God in heaven to us who
yet labor and wait in this vale of tears. It tells us of their
interest in our salvation and their prayers in our behalf. But
it brings yet more solace and comfort to aching hearts when it
soothes the grief of those who are in doubt as to the dead who
have had their garments soiled with the warfare of this world
and have left it not prepared to meet that God before whom
scarce the angels are pure; for it tells, too, that even we may
aid by our prayers those who are yet in the communion of saints.</p>
<p>“The last words of Mother Church have been said for James
Longstreet. Softly and tenderly they fall on every Christian
ear, for the children of the Church they have a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>“May his soul rest in peace. Amen.”</p>
<p>This concluded the funeral services and the body was borne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
from the court-house to the hearse by the active pall-bearers.
The procession then formed in the following order: Queen City
Band, Candler Horse Guards, and Governor’s Horse Guards,
honorary escort; hearse with pall-bearers, family and relatives,
Confederate Veterans, Daughters of the Confederacy, mayor
and council and county officers, Brenau College, Children of the
Confederacy, citizens and public generally. The procession
moved up North Bradford Street to Spring Street, out Spring
Street to Grove, down Grove to West Broad, thence Broad to
Alta Vista Cemetery.</p>
<p>Father Schadewell accompanied the remains to the cemetery,
where a short service was held, the crowd baring their heads
when the following prayer was read:</p>
<p>“Almighty and most merciful Father, who knowest the weakness
of our nature, bow down thine ear in pity unto Thy servants
upon whom Thou hast laid the heavy burden of sorrow.
Take away out of their hearts the spirit of rebellion and teach
them to see Thy good and gracious purpose working in all the
trials which Thou dost send upon them. Grant that they may
not languish in fruitless and unavailing grief, nor sorrow as
those who have no hope, but meekly look up to Thee, the God
of all consolation, through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>“Grant, O Lord, that whilst we lament the departure of our
brother, Thy servant, out of the life, we may bear in mind that
we are most certainly to follow him. Give us grace to make
ready for that last hour by a devout and holy life and protect
us against a sudden and unprovided death. Teach us how to
watch and pray that when the summons comes we may go forth
to meet the bridegroom and enter with him into life everlasting,
through Christ our Lord. Amen. Eternal rest grant unto him,
O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him.”</p>
<p>A volley was then fired over the grave of the dead leader by
the Candler Horse Guards and a detachment from the Governor’s
Horse Guards, under command of Colonel A. J. West, and
Captain W. N. Pillow, taps were sounded, and the grave closed
over one of the greatest warriors the world has ever known.</p>

<p class="p2 sigright smaller">
<span class="smcap">Gainesville, Georgia</span>, January 6, 1904.<br>
</p>
<p>Slowly the bells of Gainesville toll a requiem, the last taps
have sounded only to be lost again across the winter-browned
fields of Georgia, but the reveille of awakening still rings out
clear and true that to-day old comrades in arms, citizens, soldiers,
admirers, friends, women of the South, children of a rising generation,
Georgia, and all Dixieland may know that Lieutenant-General
James Longstreet, the “war-horse” of the Confederacy,
has at last again joined his old command.</p>
<p>And the thousands who marched to the little cemetery just as
the sun started on its sleeping journey in the west did not come
to say a last good-by; with uncovered heads they simply said
good-night.</p>
<p>In the court-house which but a few months ago was a converted
hospital for the care of those maimed by a terrible cyclone, the
body of General Longstreet rests beneath the Stars and Bars
of the Confederacy and the Stars and Stripes of the Union.
Old soldiers passed in a never-ending procession with uncovered
heads for one last look upon the face of their commander. Look
if you will behind that curtain of mist before the eyes of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
wearer of a gray uniform and you will see quite another picture.
It is that of his beloved “Old Pete,” as he was known by his
own command, hurrying on to the support of General Jackson
at Manassas. Or his indomitable courage on the retreat from
Gettysburg “leading on and on as strong in the adversity of
defeat as in the success that follows victory.” Or perhaps hurrying
towards the front at the Wilderness, the intrepid leader so
far in the van that he was wounded by his own men. Or at
the last succumbing at Appomattox to the inevitable and with
Lee reaping the reward of honor that belonged to a surrender
that cost more bravery than all of the battles of that blood-drained
period of history.</p>
<p>The sentinels that guard the bier are withdrawn. The body
is carried by loving hands to the court-room above. Here in
the presence of his nearest relatives and friends that taxed not
alone the capacity of the building, but overflowed into an acre
of mourning humanity outside.</p>
<p>Here in the closely crowded hall of justice converted into a
sanctuary by lighted candles and the priestly robes of the
officiating clergy, the services were held. There was no music
save the stifled sob of brave men whose hearts were awakened to
the sacred ties of old-time memories in a way beyond their control.
Bishop Keiley, himself an old soldier of General Longstreet,
and Rev. Fathers Gunn, of Atlanta, and Schadewell, of
Albany, officiated. After the reading of the prayers of the
impressive service of the Roman Catholic Church, Bishop Keiley
in a beautiful eulogy revered again the memory of his old friend
and commander. His address appears in another column, but
the choking of his voice, the closed eyes shutting back the tears
that would come,​—​these things are lost in the reproduction of
printer’s ink and can only remain in the memories of those who
were so privileged as to be present.</p>
<p>The picture was most inspiring. Look, if you will, at the
one-time forest of battle-flags, hewn down and water-logged in
the blood of many victories to a tiny grove of priceless ribbons
that rise and fall with the wavering strength of the old soldiers
who carry them. And in this same sweetly sad procession march
with faltering steps the men who wore the gray and the sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
step of those who, now belonging to a rising generation, wear
the blue of the reunited union.</p>
<p>But perhaps even more inspiring than the uniforms of gray
were the women of the South, Daughters of the Revolution,
school-girls, Daughters of the Confederacy, many of them wives
or widows of old comrades​—​the bravest army of home-defenders,
valor-inspiring soldiers that ever dared not only to die but to let
die all that was highest and dearest in one common cause. Impressive
is the marching of men. But the marching of women​—​it
is different, wonderfully, beautifully different.</p>
<p>What was said may soon be forgotten, but what was seen by
those who gathered at the grave will live forever in the memory
of all those who saw. Above the opening of the last resting-place
of General Longstreet the two flags he loved so well were
again crossed and stacked for the bivouac that knows no waking.
Just as the near relatives and dearest friends were gathered
about the grave, there stepped up an old veteran and delivered
the Stars and Bars as the last, loving message from General
Jenkins, of North Carolina. With this old flag and the Stars
and Stripes, the General was buried.</p>
<p>Then, just as the body was about to be lowered, another
figure bent with the ravages of time and trembling with the emotion
that bespeaks a tender heart and brave courage made his
way to the circle about the grave. His interruption of the
services was beautiful beyond all hope of describing.</p>
<p>“I want,” he said, and he hesitated not as one who has forgotten
some carefully prepared speech, but rather as one whose
heart was getting the better of his attempt at expression, “I
want to bury this jacket, my old gray jacket, with my General.
I’ve got my papers, too, my enlistment papers. They’re all
here, and they’re all clean. I wasn’t an officer, but I belonged
to Longstreet’s command, and I’d rather be a private in the old
corps than, than​—​— Well, I’ve served my time, and the
General, he’s served his time, too. And I reckon I won’t need
my uniform and papers again. But I’d like to leave them with
him for always. They were enlisted under his command, and
as I don’t ever want to be mustered out again, I’d just like to
leave them with him always, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
And as no one minded unless it was in the most beautiful way
possible, the faded gray jacket and the enlistment papers were
lowered with the crossed flags of two republics and many floral
offerings as a last loving tribute to General Longstreet, who,
with the final sounding of taps, again passed for ever and ever
to his waiting commander and his old command.</p>

<h2 id="toc226">TRIBUTES FROM THE PRESS</h2>
<h3>(<i>Washington, D. C., Post.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="center">“His are as noble ashes as rest beneath the sod of any land.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>We think it safe to say that there is something in the suggestion
that these late attacks on General Longstreet’s action
at the battle of Gettysburg have for their inspiration a political
bitterness of more than thirty years’ standing. Certainly, it
is true that up to the close of the Civil War, and, indeed, for
several years afterwards, no one ever heard a question raised
as to his military ability. On the contrary, it was everywhere
conceded, especially by his immediate comrades and associates,
that he stood almost at the top of the list of Confederate warriors,
not only in the matter of professional equipment, but in
that of personal integrity and character. With the exception
of Robert E. Lee, Longstreet was regarded as the very prince
of the fighters, strategists, and great commanders of that heroic
episode. If any one had hinted, even as late as 1869, that there
was the smallest flaw in his fame, either as a soldier or a gentleman,
the author of the intimation would have had enough
quarrels on his hands to last him to his dying day.</p>
<p>Along in the later sixties, however, Longstreet was a resident
of New Orleans. He had engaged in business there, having as
his partner Colonel Owen, another Southern soldier of high
standing and distinguished service. The shadow of reconstruction
was then brooding over the South, and thoughtful men,
who had accepted the result of the war in loyal faith, consulted
together as to the best means of averting its evils, which were
at that time sufficiently defined. Finally, in 1870 or 1871, the
so-called “Unification Movement” was launched. At its head
were numbers of the most prominent and influential men in
Louisiana, and conspicuous among them was Beauregard. The
project was discussed by the newspapers and generally approved
in the more substantial and responsible circles. At last
a meeting was called for the purpose of bringing together the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
best representatives of both races and arranging, if possible, a
course of action which would make for peace and order and
avert the turmoil that afterwards succeeded to the irruption of
the carpet-baggers and the consequent <i>régime</i> of chaos. Before
the appointed day, however, Longstreet’s coadjutors experienced
a change of heart. They abandoned the experiment which they
themselves had devised, and Longstreet was left almost without
countenance or sympathy. With characteristic determination,
he adhered to the policy his judgment and conscience had originally
approved. Of course, it came to nothing, and he, stung
by what he regarded as the desertion of the others, and still
more deeply hurt by criticisms showered on him, often from
the ranks of his quondam associates, went on as he had begun.
Then began the breach which in time widened to animosity,
ostracism, and lifelong alienation. He may have been mistaken.
At least he was courageous and consistent. But we
feel sure it cannot be successfully denied that doubts as to his
military genius were cradled in that unhappy episode.</p>
<p>We have no idea of participating in any controversy over
the details of Gettysburg. That may be left to the survivors
who were in a position to form intelligent opinions. For our
part, we think of Longstreet now as all of his compatriots
thought of him up to 1870​—​that he was one of the finest
figures on the stage of the Civil War; a spectacle of perfect gallantry;
an example of warlike force and splendor. We do not
believe he ever received an order from Lee which he did not
execute with instant energy. We do not believe he failed in
anything, either there or elsewhere, that became a valorous and
brilliant soldier. He is dead now, and cannot answer his accusers,
but nearly forty years have elapsed since he sheathed
his stainless sword in 1865, and, in our calm, dispassionate
opinion, his are as noble ashes as rest beneath the sod of any
land.</p>

<p>Now that James Longstreet is no more, the South should
forgive the estrangement that followed long years of service.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Perhaps he was wiser than we​—​perhaps to-day we are not very
far from the position he took a generation ago. Perhaps his
greatness as a soldier was largely due to the same qualities which
set his people in opposition to him in civil life​—​he had utter
confidence in his own judgment, and he went straight for what
he thought was right regardless of all prudential considerations.</p>
<p>We have accepted the result of the war in good faith​—​let
us accept all that goes with it in our hearts and minds. Others
advised while Longstreet acted​—​once we hated him because he
headed our foes to make us keep order; were the riots against
which Longstreet stood in New Orleans to be repeated in Atlanta,
we know Gordon or Wheeler would head the regulars to restore
peace and order if their counsels were disregarded. The time
makes a difference to the sufferers​—​but not to the historian
through whose glasses we can now afford to look. Longstreet
is dead​—​weave violets and amaranth in his wreath of laurel​—​peace
and honor to his storm-driven soul.</p>

<h3>(<i>Shelby, North Carolina, Aurora.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="center">“Hero of two wars punished for his politics in days of peace.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>A camp of United Confederate Veterans at Wilmington, at
a regular meeting, declined to send resolutions of condolence
and sympathy to the family of General Longstreet on his death.</p>
<p>And yet General Longstreet was a</p>
<p>Hero of two wars.</p>
<p>He was the “War-Horse of the Confederacy.”</p>
<p>He was in the thickest of the fight from Manassas to Appomattox.</p>
<p>He was familiarly known throughout the army as “Old Pete,”
and was considered the hardest fighter in the Confederate service.</p>
<p>He had the unbounded confidence of his troops, and “the
whole army became imbued with new vigor in the presence of
the foe when it became known down the line that ‘Old Pete’
was up.”</p>
<p>Why, then, did not the Wilmington camp pass those resolutions?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Because General Longstreet was a Republican. For this
reason he was</p>
<p>Hated,</p>
<p>Abused,</p>
<p>Slandered.</p>
<p>He was charged with disobeying General Lee’s most vital
orders at Gettysburg, causing the loss of the battle and the
ultimate destruction of the Confederacy.</p>

<h3>(<i>Biblical, North Carolina, Record.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“So long as Lee lived no one attacked Longstreet’s military honor.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>General Longstreet was a great general. He was an able
strategist, a hard fighter, and a faithful soldier. So long as
Lee lived no one charged Longstreet with failure to make the
fanciful sunrise attack on the second day at Gettysburg. But
when Lee had died, this calumny was started, and it was used in
hounding him to the day of his death​—​on that day certain
misguided Daughters of the Confederacy refusing to send
flowers for his bier. Longstreet was the victim of a foul persecution
by a partisan press​—​the like of which we see nowadays
at ever-increasing intervals. They did not approve his ideas,
and they ruined him. He advised the South to accept the
results of the war; his business was taken from him, his friends
were estranged, and his life was made a burden.</p>
<p>His magnificent services deserved better reward. But history
will give him his place; intolerance even now is departing;
and as for Longstreet himself, he stands to-night before the
Judge of all the world.</p>

<h3>(<i>St. Louis Globe-Democrat.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Republicanism does not necessarily involve treason to the South.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>One aspect of General Longstreet’s career from Appomattox
till his death the other day brings out a very unlovely attribute
which was obtrusive in the South during these years. That was
the ostracism to which he was subject because he joined the Republican
party and accepted two or three offices from Republican
Presidents. This antagonism towards him by a large portion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
of the old Confederate element gradually diminished as a
new generation in the South appeared on the scene. Some of
the feeling, however, remained to the close of his days, and
evinced itself in the obituaries of many of the Southern papers.</p>
<p>A few facts are sufficient to expose the absurdity of this
Southern antagonism to Confederates who cast their fortunes
with the Republicans after the Confederacy fell​—​this feeling
that an adherent of the lost cause must cling everlastingly to
the Democratic party through evil and good reports under the
penalty of eternal proscription. In the score of years from
Longstreet’s graduation from West Point to his resignation,
shortly after Sumter’s fall, he was in the army, and a participant
in the wars in Mexico and along the frontier in which the
army was engaged. The probability is that until after Appomattox
he never cast a ballot in his life. Moreover, at the
time of his graduation, many of the South’s most prominent
statesmen​—​Tyler, Brownlow, Toombs, Legare, Bell, Clayton,
Upshur, Henry T. Wise, Botts, Alexander H. Stephens, and
others​—​were Whigs. The Whig, Zachary Taylor, of Louisiana,
carried more Southern States than did his Democratic
antagonist, Cass.</p>
<p>What warrant had the South for proscribing Longstreet,
because he, a soldier who never had any politics in the old days,
joined the Republican party just as soon as he became a civilian
and got a chance to exercise his privileges as a citizen? Mosby,
Mahone, and many other ex-Confederates who had been
civilians before the war, and who, presumably, had taken some
part in politics, also joined the Republican party, though they
did not do this quite so promptly as did Longstreet. When
Foote, of Mississippi, and Orr, of South Carolina, both of whom
had been prominent in Democratic politics before the war, the
latter of whom had been Speaker of the House in part of
Buchanan’s days in the Presidency, and both of whom had been
in the Confederate service, became Republicans soon after the
Confederacy collapsed, their neighbors ought to have grasped
the fact that there must have been something in this party which
appealed to intelligent public-spirited men of all localities, and
that membership in it by a South Carolinian, a Georgian, or a
Louisianian did not necessarily and inevitably involve treason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
either to the South’s interests or to its traditions. Mixed in
with the many shining virtues of the people below Mason and
Dixon’s line, there was, as shown in their attitude for many
years towards Longstreet, one very unattractive trait.</p>
<div class="tbx">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<h3>(<i>Vicksburg, Mississippi, Herald.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“There was no more magnificent display of heroism during the entire
war than at Gettysburg.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>As truly as Warwick was the last of the barons of the feudal
era, was Longstreet the last of the great Confederate commanders.
He rose to prominence in the early engagements of
the war​—​his was a household name as one of the chief hopes of
the cause, when those of all the remaining survivors of like rank
were colonels and brigadiers. At the first Manassas, Williamsburg,
Seven Pines, Seven Days’ fight, the second Manassas,
Sharpsburg, and Fredericksburg he was the chief subordinate
figure except where he divided the honors with Stonewall
Jackson. And after the death of that very Napoleon of
war, until the <i>ultimo suspiro</i> at Appomattox, Longstreet was
Lee’s right hand; or, as our great commander fondly called
him, “my old war-horse.” How highly he was held at head-quarters
and the war department was shown in his being made
the senior lieutenant-general, even over Jackson, after the 1862
test by fire.</p>
<p>At Gettysburg Longstreet was in charge of the fighting line,
of placing the divisions in action, on the second and third days
of that Titanic struggle. Whatever may be said of the result,​—​of
the errors which misinformation and sycophancy have attempted
to make him the scapegoat of,​—​there was no more
magnificent display of heroism during the entire war.</p>
<p>It has not been the Southern fashion of late years to praise,
or even practise justice towards, Longstreet. But now that the
stout warrior is dead and gone to eternal judgment, all should
speak of his virtues, his glorious deeds of arms, without thought
or reference to that sad error of judgment that, no smaller
in its intent and inception than “a man’s hand,” grew to a dark
cloud between Longstreet and his people. This will be appreciated
by survivors of the old First Corps, no good soldier of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
which has ever failed to repeat with pride, “I followed Longstreet.”
As one of that band the editor of the <i>Herald</i> has
always left criticism of our old chief’s politics to others. If
ever the inclination came to us, there rose up two pictures of
the past that forbade,​—​the heroic and inspiring figure of Longstreet
as he rode up to Colonel Humphreys of the Twenty-first
Mississippi, towards the close of that grand “centre rush” of
Barksdale’s brigade that swept Sickles and his Third Corps off
of the “Peach-Orchard Hill,” at Gettysburg, to tell him that
Barksdale was killed and to take command of the brigade; and
Longstreet as he was borne from the front at the Wilderness,
all faint and bloody from what seemed a death wound.</p>
<p>Longstreet is now no more. But there is a thrill in the name
that carries his surviving followers backward forty years​—​recalling
the roar of cannon, the charging column, the “rebel”
yell, the groans of wounded and dying comrades. For,</p>

<p>“Robbed of the laurels won in peerless campaigns.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The death of General Longstreet at his Gainesville home the
other day removes one of the few grand actors of the war
drama of the sixties. He was known as the “old war-horse
of the Confederacy,” and perhaps in point of military ability
he ranked next to the great Lee himself. His soldiers had the
most remarkable confidence in him, and he it was who could inspire
them to deeds of valor unparalleled. At times since there
have been those who have attempted to cast aspersions on his
illustrious name, saying that he disobeyed Lee’s orders at
Gettysburg. A timely article has just been published, and
curiously in the same paper that conveyed the sad intelligence
of his death, from the pen of Mrs. Longstreet, presumably composed
with the aid of the General in his last feeble days, that
answers completely and satisfactorily all charges of stubbornness
or disobedience at that famous battle. It is a pity that so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
great a soldier and military genius should not have been allowed
to have worn the laurels of so many peerless campaigns undisturbed
and without envy. Now that he is dead his memory
should be enshrined in the hearts of a grateful people for whose
cause he did battle, and the remembrance of his illustrious deeds
should be handed down to future generations as those of the
knights of the round table.</p>

<h3>(<i>Thompson, Georgia, Progress.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Would have been court-martialed for disobeying orders at Gettysburg.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>It is passing strange that any one should make such a charge
against General Longstreet, in view of the fact that General
Lee never made any such charge; and any sane man knows
that he would have made the charge had it been true, and no
doubt General Longstreet would have been court-martialed for
such an offence, especially as it is charged that this probably
lost the battle to the Confederates.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was one of the greatest and bravest of the
Confederate generals, and no man should endeavor to dim the
lustre of his brilliant military record or cast reflections upon
his good name as a citizen or doubt his loyalty to the South.
No hero that wore the gray deserves more honor and thanks than
this gallant Southern hero, who, like Lee, Jackson, Johnston,
and a long list of other loyal Southern sons resigned a position
of prominence in the army of the United States and cast his
fortunes with his Southern brethren in defense of Southern
rights, homes, and firesides, and many of whom died for
Southern honor. Sleep on, noble and illustrious soldier and
patriot! Thy good name and record as a soldier is safe from
the attacks of politicians, rivals, and so-called Daughters of the
Confederacy of Savannah!</p>

<h3>(<i>Houston, Texas, Chronicle.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“He was superior to human vanity or ambition.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>It should not be forgotten that when the war began General
Longstreet, like General Lee and many others of the South’s
illustrious leaders, was an officer in the army of the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
States. Had he adhered to the Union, high command awaited
him; the siren voice of ambition whispered to him of a splendid
future of fame and honor and rich reward, while he knew more
doubtful was the issue if he heeded the call of duty and offered
his sword to the South. Yet he did not hesitate. To his mother’s
cry he responded like the faithful son and hero that he was,
and proved superior to human vanity or ambition.</p>
<p>This being true, it is but fair to presume that whatever step
he took afterwards was inspired by the high sense of duty, and
that he took it only after having taken counsel with his conscience
and with due regard for the requirements of patriotism
and honor.</p>
<p>In every position in civil life, many and responsible as they
were, he bore himself with ability, dignity, efficiency, and with
stainless honor; there was never a spot upon his official record,
but the civilian, as was the soldier, was without reproach.</p>
<p>If any man or woman doubts or calls in question the record
of James Longstreet as a soldier, let him or her ask the veteran
Southern soldier who followed him (and there are a number
in Houston) what they think of him, and with one voice they
will say, “He was Lee’s ‘war-horse.’ When we heard Longstreet
was in the lead or in command, or was coming, we knew
that victory would follow the fighting; we trusted him; Lee
trusted him; the army trusted him.”</p>
<p>“Where beyond these voices there is peace,” the old hero is
at rest. Little it recks whether men praise or blame him now​—​“The
peace of God which passeth all understanding” is upon
him, and history will write him down as he was, a brave, able,
faithful soldier, who so loved his native land as to pour out his
heroic blood in its defence. Than this he asks no higher praise.</p>

<p>“Truth will take hold upon the pen of history.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>A great soldier, in the ripeness of years and yet enduring to
the latest breath the pangs of the wounds of four decades ago,
has fallen upon earth’s final sleep.</p>
<p>In the brave days of his earlier soldiership, and then in the
strenuous years of one of the world’s most tragic wars, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
his genius lifted him to the next highest rank of generalship,
General James Longstreet was a conspicuous figure and always
a force to be reckoned with. The finest and justest military
critics of America and Europe have pronounced him a commander
in whom were combined those abilities of initiative,
strategy, and persistent daring that make the historic general
of any age or people.</p>
<p>While to others who were concerned in the great campaigns
and battles of which he was a distinguished factor there may
have appeared in his acts some incidents for criticism, yet to his
immediate officers and men he was ever the ideal soldier and the
peerless commander. But in the presence of his shrouded frame,
in the revived memories of his loyalty and his heroism, and in the
knowledge that the seeming errors of men in pivotal crises are
often the misunderstood interferences of the Supreme Ruler,
judgments cease and reverence, gratitude, and honor form the
threnody at the tomb.</p>
<p>The war record of General Longstreet will always remain a
theme of laudation by the sons of Southerners. For the reward
of it thousands refused to sanction the rebukes his subsequent
career sometimes engendered among his compatriots. Who that
witnessed it can forget the embrace given Longstreet by ex-President
Davis here in Atlanta and the tremendous ovation
that greeted the old hero in his veteran gray uniform as he
joined in the gala-day made in honor of his disfranchised chief?</p>
<p>General Longstreet’s taking of office under President Grant
has been always a misunderstood transaction. It was not a
surrender of his Southern sentiments or an act of disloyalty to
the Southern people. At the time when General Grant, feeling
the impulses of former comradeship, tendered an office and its
emoluments to General Longstreet, whose fortunes were in sore
straits, the old soldier refused to consider acceptance of the
offer until urged to it by his later fellow-soldiers in New Orleans,
including Generals Hood, Beauregard, Harry Hayes, Ogden,
and even Jefferson Davis himself. He accepted it in the belief
that it was his duty to take any occasion for public service that
otherwise would be held in the hands of alien carpet-baggers
and haters of the Southern people. But the occasion was too
soon​—​the passions of the people yet too inflamed. Without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
full knowledge of the inwardness of his conduct the people whom
he loved heaped upon him a penetrating scorn and livid coals
of indignation. He was too brave to complain; too considerate
to expose his advisers, and his heroism was never more chivalrous
than the long patience with which until now he has endured
the misjudgments of his Southern fellow-men.</p>
<p>But these things are naught now to the flown spirit. Hereafter
truth will take hold upon the pen of history and rewrite
much that has been miswritten of this great son of the South.
His stainless integrity, his devotion to the cause of his militant
people, his incomparable bravery in battle, his superb generalship
on campaign, and his later chivalry in the calm conduct of
his citizenship and public service remain as wholesome memories
of a world-acclaimed Southern hero.</p>

<p>The pestiferous pertinacity with which certain women of the
South seize every opportunity to fan the embers of a dying sectional
animosity, and to blazon their adherence to the principles
of the “Lost Cause,” is again illustrated in the refusal of
the Savannah Daughters of the Confederacy to send a wreath
to be laid on General Longstreet’s grave. Next to Robert E.
Lee, Longstreet had the reputation of being the ablest of the
officers who fought on the Southern side in the Great Rebellion.
But at the close of the war, satisfied that the Lost Cause was
lost forever, and that it was useless to attempt to keep alive a
spirit of revenge,​—​heart-won, too, by the splendid generosity
of Grant in his dealings with the defeated army of Lee,​—​he
“accepted the situation;” accepted, too, from the Republican
soldier-president the office of surveyor of the port of New Orleans,
and addressed all his powers to the work of healing the
wounds of war and of reuniting the sections. For this he was
ostracised by the ultra element of Southern irreconcilables​—​an
element made up principally of women and of men who did no
fighting, and which nurses its bitterness with the unsatisfied
spirit of the child who, not having finished his cry yesterday,
inquires to-day, “What was I crying about?” in order that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
may indulge in the luxury of tears once more. The men who
fought under and with Longstreet honor his later loyalty to the
Union as much as they do his steadfast courage and ability under
the “Stars and Bars” in the bloody sixties. The women who
refuse his bier a tribute dishonor only themselves.</p>

<p>“One of the most gallant spirits of the century.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>With the death of General James Longstreet, who was the
first ranking general of the Confederate army, passes one of
the most gallant spirits of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Of all the men who fought with conspicuous valor and prowess
for the Confederate cause, there was none who possessed more
leonine courage or inspired in his men a greater degree of enthusiastic
affection than this chieftain whom Lee dubbed with the
title of “My Old War-Horse” on the battle-field. That remark
of Lee’s was like the touch of an accolade upon his shoulders,
and no subsequent misunderstandings or criticisms have ever
been able to rob him of the place among the chivalrous souls of
the South to which he was elevated by their irreproachable King
Arthur, General Lee.</p>
<p>And, in view of the fact that the most choice and master
military spirits of his age esteemed him to possess tactical
ability and military judgment equal in degree to his undisputed
qualities of persistent bravery, such criticisms as there were are
scarcely worthy of mention and demand no refutation now in
any backward glance at his brilliant career. The South can
point to his record with pride, as his military associates have
ever pointed to the man himself with a quick and affectionate
appreciation. No note of apology should mingle with the
praise and grief of those who look to-day with tear-blurred eyes
upon the soldier’s bier.</p>
<p>And the memory of his actions on the boisterous stage of
battle and of the single-hearted, loyal <i>rôle</i> he played through
all the shifting scenes of that greatest war-drama of the century
should in itself constitute a rebuke to those who have sought
to rebuke him for certain generally misunderstood actions in
his subsequent career. He became an office-holder under General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Grant, a very, very human thing to do. It was a very, very
natural thing that General Grant, who had married the cousin
of the “Old War-Horse,” and who was, besides, actuated by the
spirit of a remembered, youthful comradeship, should give his
friend, comrade, and relative an office when Longstreet was
walking along thorny financial paths. And his acceptance,
urged as he was to accept by his Confederate comrades, was,
under the circumstances, very human and very natural. He
made a good public servant​—​where could Grant have found a
better in those reconstruction days, which were not noted for the
excellence of their public servants? Where could Longstreet
have better served his own people than by taking an office which
might otherwise have been given to men who were still so inflamed
by partisan prejudice as to hate those people? His
motives were of the highest in this acceptance, and his attitude
of silently bearing the remarks of those who criticised him
under a misapprehension stamps his moral courage with the
golden seal of a serene nobility.</p>
<p>He was misjudged, but he happily lived to see most of those
who misjudged him silenced by an exposition of facts which he
was too proud to set forth himself.</p>
<p>The debtor years have rendered back to him the refined coin
of a fixed fame for his life labor. He is dead, and his place​—​a
high one in the world’s history​—​is enduring.</p>

<p>“The bravest of the brave.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The Savannah Daughters of the Confederacy, whose custom
it is to send a laurel wreath for the tomb of deceased Confederates,
refused to send one upon the death of General Longstreet
a few days ago.</p>
<p>The Daughters at Savannah have, we suppose, satisfactorily
to themselves, settled the mooted question of the Gettysburg
controversy, but we do not believe their action will find applause
generally among the ex-Confederate soldiers. Whatever may
have been the fact at Gettysburg, it is beyond dispute that his
actions there did not estrange his loyal soldiers, nor impair the
esteem in which he was held by General Lee. The close of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
war found him in command of the left wing of the army, and
he joined General Lee on the way to Appomattox. In referring
to his death the Richmond <i>Times-Dispatch</i> <span class="locked">says,​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“We recall General Longstreet as one of the bravest of the brave, one
who struck many blows for the Confederacy, and one on whom General
Lee often leaned and whose name is identified with world-famous battles.
These are things we cannot forget, nor do we wish to.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Whatever may be said of the attitude of the South since the
war towards General Longstreet, the fact remains that his
espousal of the Republican cause in politics did most to invite
criticism, and this he always felt was unjust to him.</p>
<p>It seems strange that General John B. Gordon should have so
bitterly attacked General Longstreet, and it is charity to say
that he did it from political reasons, and not by way of challenging
war records.</p>
<p>With his fresh grave denied its laurel wreath at the hands
of the Savannah Daughters, and his lifeless lips beyond reply
to carping critics, it is refreshing to see that the loyal wife, who
walked with him in the evening of life, brings her own wreath
of the roses of love, dewy with her tears, and places it upon
the grave that holds his valiant dust.</p>

<p>“In the military annals of the Anglo-Saxon race there is nothing finer
than his fighting record.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The author of the article on Longstreet, which recently appeared
in the <i>Ledger</i> and which we republish below, has been
a close student of military history, and was personally observant
of great movements in Virginia during the war:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Men of Southern blood who recall the days when the civilized world
was thrilled with the renown of those great Confederate captains, ‘Lee,
Longstreet, and Jackson,’ can scarcely realize that the grave has just
closed over all that is mortal of the stoutest, the steadiest, the most practical,
pushing, resolute, and stolidly unimaginative fighter of that goodly and
immortal group. In the military annals of the Anglo-Saxon race there is
nothing finer than the fighting record of this Old Lion of the South. It
does not need the formal observances of official commemoration to perpetuate
the memory of a man who led the stanch legions of the Confederacy
in victorious fellowship with Jackson and Lee. Tradition alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
will uplift and applaud his name long after monuments have crumbled and
Camps and Chapters have ceased to exist. None knew better than the
great Virginian leader that the neck of the ‘Old War-Horse’ was always
clothed with thunder when the shock of battle came. Lee never dreamed
that Longstreet was faithless.</p>
<p>“Every American who is proud of our common race must deplore
the openly manifest disposition of Southern veterans and sons of veterans
to discredit for all time the great historic soldiers of the South. It needs
not the perspicacity of a Verulam to inform us that the highest virtues
are not visible to the common eye. The disposition to suspect and besmirch
a glorious soldier​—​a man whose leadership immortalized the armies
that he led​—​not only betokens a radical change in popular ideals, but
apparently marks the decadence of that traditional sentiment of chivalry
which is truly ‘the unbought grace of life,’ and that generous martial
spirit which for generations has characterized the great Southern branch
of the Anglo-American race.</p>
<p>“The humblest citizen of this republic has an inalienable interest in the
heroic memories of the South. Let the Dead Lion sleep in peace. Nothing
is alien to the true American heart that in the least degree concerns
the glory of the Old South or the interest of the New. It is precisely this
sentiment that was expressed in the fine chivalry of Grant at Appomattox
and won for that iron conqueror the lasting affection and respect of the
men that he had fought. The heroic Longstreet needs no higher eulogy
than the single phrase, He was the friend of Grant and Lee.”</p></div></blockquote>

<p>“No reproach can be cast upon his bravery and devotion.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The Savannah Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy
has made itself ridiculous by throwing a brick at the dead lion
at Gainesville!</p>
<p>It seems a pity that the enterprising news gatherers in the
Forest City should have given out to the public the silly action
of these young women. Their offence was a resolution “refusing”
to send a wreath to lay upon the grave of General
Longstreet “because he disobeyed orders at Gettysburg.”</p>
<p>The causes for the drawn battle at the critical point in the
history of the struggle of the ’60’s will be debated while time
lasts. So will the causes for the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.
This debate has been and will be participated in by the great
commanders of the world. But no reproach has been, can, or
will be cast upon the bravery or devotion of the famous old
fighter whose courage knew no abatement in the hundreds of
engagements participated in during the trying experiences of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>three wars. Alexander and Cæsar and Napoleon and Grant
and Lee made their mistakes. So did Longstreet. But how does
it seem for a bevy of young women to pounce upon the cold
remains of this battle-scarred veteran and hero lying in state
and attempt to punish him for an alleged mistake made forty
years ago in the midst of the roar and clash of the greatest
battle in history! Their mothers knew better.</p>
<p>We are not surprised that veterans in Savannah feel aggrieved,
as they must feel everywhere that the action is known.</p>
<p>General Gordon believes that Longstreet made a mistake at
Gettysburg, but Lee said, “It is all my fault.” The great
chieftain in command made no charge against his great fighting
arm. Touching this controversy, Colonel McBride, writing to
the Atlanta <i>Constitution</i>, says, “Longstreet, although a prudent
and cautious fighter, was not only always ready to fight,
but he was always anxious and wanted to fight. On the second
day he was not slow, but was simply putting himself in shape
to do the bloodiest fight of the war. At least two-thirds of the
casualties in America’s greatest battle happened in front of
Longstreet’s corps. Reports show this. The records also show
that he only obeyed Lee’s orders to the letter.”</p>
<p>Grant, however, that Longstreet made a costly mistake, there
are times other than those at the grave to discuss them; there
are persons other than young women unborn in those days to
administer rebuke or punishment.</p>
<p>If these young women who sit in judgment at the tomb could
not lay a flower on the new-made grave of an old war-horse of
the Confederacy, it seems as if they might have restrained their
tongues while the muffled drum passing by rolled its last tattoo.</p>

<p>At the age of eighty-three General Longstreet has passed
away​—​a noble character, a good soldier, one of the hardest
fighters of the Civil War. General Longstreet was pretty badly
treated by the people whose battles he fought with so great
courage and capacity. He was no politician​—​just a soldier,
and at the close of the war committed the error of “fraternizing”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
with all his countrymen. He “accepted the situation,”
not wisely, but too early. With a fine and generous unwisdom
he laid away the animosities of the war-time and put himself
at once where all stand now,​—​on the broad, high ground of
American citizenship. No part had he in the provincial conceit
of the thing that has the immodesty to call itself a “Southern
gentleman.” It probably never occurred to him that the qualities
distinguishing a gentleman from a pirate of the Spanish
Main had so narrow a geographical distribution as the term
implies. He paid for his breadth of mind​—​became a kind of
social outlaw and political excommunicant in “the land once
proud of him.” Briefly, his shipmates marooned him. Well,
he has escaped​—​he has “beaten the game,” as, sooner or later,
we all conquer without exertion. After a while Southern capitals
will be adorned with statues of Longstreet and upon his
grave posterity will see “his foemen’s children loose the rose.”</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p>Lee and Longstreet.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The death of General James Longstreet, as was to be expected,
has revived to some extent the controversies which have
raged over certain memorable incidents in his military career.
For the last twenty-five years persistent efforts have been made
to throw on General Longstreet’s shoulders responsibility for
Lee’s defeat at Gettysburg. Not a few Southern writers have
gone so far as to accuse him, if not of insubordination, at least
of culpable inattention to orders given him by the Confederate
commander-in-chief. General John B. Gordon, in his recently
published reminiscences, revived and amplified these charges
against Longstreet, stating explicitly​—​as his own conclusion
and as that of impartial military critics generally​—​that Longstreet’s
blunders had blasted Confederate hopes at Gettysburg,
and that General Lee “died believing he had lost by Longstreet’s
disobedience.” Strangely enough, General Longstreet’s
wife had prepared an elaborate refutation of General Gordon’s
theories, and had arranged for its publication on January 3​—​the
day following General Longstreet’s death.</p>
<p>We do not think that history will sustain the contentions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
General Longstreet’s critics. They are interesting enough as
post-mortem demonstrations of what might have been. But they
ignore actual conditions. They picture a situation which could
have existed only as a military after-thought. General Longstreet
cannot be made a scapegoat for all the sins of hesitation
or omission chargeable to Confederate commanders at Gettysburg.
General Gordon is himself disposed to censure General
Lee for not vigorously attacking the Federal forces in their
new position on the evening of July 1. He condemns utterly
Longstreet’s failure to assault the Federal left wing early in the
morning of July 2. But he waves aside entirely the exhaustion
of A. P. Hill’s corps at the conclusion of the first day’s battle
and the physical impediments to forming and executing an
attack on the Federal left wing before noon of July 2. That
Longstreet’s assault suffered in effectiveness from the delays
of July 2 is greatly to be doubted. The fighting done by his
corps far excelled in dash and brilliance anything done at Gettysburg
by Ewell’s corps or A. P. Hill’s. Longstreet bore the
brunt of both the second and third day’s struggle and emerged
from the conflict with his reputation as a corps commander unimpaired.
There is no reason to think that he could have fought
more brilliantly or more successfully if he had attempted the
attack which General Gordon philosophizes about in the early
morning of the second day.</p>
<p>General Lee at the close of the battle justly and honorably
assumed entire responsibility for the Confederate defeat. Lee
lost at Gettysburg because on the offensive he seemed incapable
of rising to the full height of his military talent. His generalship
in his two brief invasions of Northern territory was commonplace.</p>
<p>In Lee’s own lifetime not a word of criticism was aimed at
Longstreet. It is needless to inquire what influences have conspired
to foist on him the blame for the Confederate failure at
Gettysburg. Another generation of Southern writers will do
him more impartial justice. He will certainly be classed hereafter
by open-minded critics as one of the ablest and most intelligent
of the commanders who fought under the South’s flag
in the Civil War.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<blockquote><div>
<p class="smaller center">“No Southern man suffered more or deserved it less.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The death of General Longstreet removes from the world’s
stage of action one who in time of war had his name and his
deeds sounded by the trumpet of fame throughout the civilized
world. He was a conspicuous figure in the eyes of the world,
and his name was at one time familiar to and honored in every
Confederate household. He was Lee’s Rock of Gibraltar that
never failed to stem the tides of assault, and when he led, in
his turn, the attack, he was a thunder-bolt of war that never
failed to strike with terrible effect. In council he was calm and
calculated well and closely all the chances of conflict, in scales
well balanced, and, as a rule, with almost unerring exactness.</p>
<p>He was essentially a soldier, whose education, training, and
services for a generation in years made his enforced change
to civil life practically the adoption of a new life at total
variance to that in which he has always been a conspicuous and a
noted figure. His was a lovable nature, loyal to principle and
to truth, and when his confidence was secured his trust was sure
to follow.</p>
<p>That trait in his character was the cause of the ban under
which he suffered for such a long period from the Southern
people, and, as many an old Confederate veteran will now say,
with such injustice.</p>
<p>At the time the storm of ostracism first burst in fury over
his head I was an official of the State of Mississippi and resided
at Jackson, the State capital, and I was then, as I am now,
familiar with the cause of the outbreak of public sentiment
against him. Let me explain that there had been on the part
of the Southern people a practical nullification of the Federal
laws regarding the negro and his rights so recently conferred,
and it was hard for Southern people to swallow the doctrine of
equality in anything where the negro was concerned.</p>
<p>The entire South was in a tempestuous turmoil that threatened
the very foundations of society, by rising like the storm-tossed
waves of tempestuous seas and sweeping away the barriers
that had been erected against the domination of the Southern
whites. At this juncture prominent and influential leaders of
public thought, who saw the coming storm, at a conference held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
in New Orleans explained the situation to certain popular and
influential ex-Confederate generals then residents of that city,
and represented to them that an appeal by them to their old
soldiers to accept the situation, obey the Federal laws, and maintain
peace and order would result in great good and assist in
allaying the suppressed, indeed often open, excitement of the
people. They were appealed to as patriots to come to the
rescue of their people and lead them in peace as they had in
war.</p>
<p>The text of a letter to be written by each was then outlined,
and at a second conference each submitted his letter. The substance
of all the letters was identical, each with the others.
They were published in the New Orleans papers simultaneously
to insure the object in view, the influencing of public opinion.
Their publication aroused a storm of reproach and denunciation
that was without measure.</p>
<p>Instead of acting like oil on the troubled waters, they provoked
the fury of the tempest, and the authors of the letters
were overwhelmed with letters of protest and reproach.</p>
<p>Explanation after explanation by the authors (save General
Longstreet) that amounted to public retraction, followed.
Longstreet, firm as the rock of Gibraltar, bared his breast to
the storm and proudly declared that he had nothing to retract.
He explained the circumstances under which he had written the
letter, cited its approval by leaders of public thought, and declared
that the sentiment of the letter but expressed his honest
convictions, and he stood by it. Every old veteran of Longstreet’s
corps who reads this will say, “That’s just like old
Pete.” He could have saved his popularity had he sacrificed
principle. But like the noble Roman that he was, he could, in
weighing one against the other, defiantly proclaim</p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">“These walls, these columns fly<br></span>
<span class="i0">From their firm base as soon as I.”<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>I was among the few who saw nothing then in any of the
letters to merit the disapproval of the Southern people; and
looking through “the vista of time” back to those days, I can
say in all candor and sincerity that had the seed of Longstreet’s
advice fallen in ground ripe for it, reconstruction would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
been shorn of many of the evils that accompanied it and blighted
the land. Some time after these occurrences General Longstreet
made a trip through territory in Mississippi from which his
mercantile firm derived much business. One day Governor
Humphreys said to me, “General Longstreet is coming this
way. If he comes here, what would you do?” Instantly I replied,
“I would not wait for him to come, but I would insist on
his coming, and tell him that he would be welcomed at the
governor’s mansion.” He directed me to write the invitation,
saying, “I had made up my mind to so act, for nothing could
make me turn my back on ‘old Pete.’ I served under him too
long to do that.” He accepted the invitation and was the guest
of the governor. In honoring him the governor set an example
that the whole town followed, and the period of his stay
was almost a constant levee. On me was placed the special and
agreeable duty of attendance upon him. I was with him much
of the time and participated in conversations in which the letter
that brought to him only woe was discussed. Never did a bitter
word pass his lips in denunciation of those who led him to the
slaughter and themselves stepped aside and raised no hand to
help him. He declared that the letter expressed his true sentiments,
and that it was written after deliberate thought. It
proved to be unfortunate, and though he was then reaping only
thorns from it, time would vindicate him and his course. He
bore his fate like an ancient Stoic. I count my association with
him at this time as among the most pleasant of a checkered life.
I never saw him again.</p>
<p>General Joseph E. Johnston, of whose staff I was a member,
told me with his own lips that the plan by which the army of
Stonewall Jackson was withdrawn from the valley and hurled
on the flank of McClellan was first suggested to him by Longstreet.
He said that the idea had occurred to him, but at a time
when it was not feasible. But just previous to the battle of
Seven Pines, Longstreet submitted a plan that he had matured,
that met his favor and determined him to adopt it. At the
battle that almost immediately occurred he was incapacitated
by wounds and General Lee assumed command. Shortly after,
Jackson’s force was transferred from the valley and hurled on
the Federal flank. We know with what result. The plan was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
communicated to General Lee shortly after his accession to
command. The plan which General Lee adopted may have been
his own, but the idea first originated in the soldierly brain of
Longstreet. Again, at the second Manassas, when Longstreet,
to the rescue of Jackson, debouched through “Thoroughfare
Gap,” a glance at the field showed him Jackson’s peril, and his
masterful, soldierly ability needed no general in command to
direct him as to the placing of his battalions. Like a thunder-bolt
of war his command struck the Federal army. Jackson
was saved and the victory was won. Space forbids further
prolixity, while the theme invites it. Let me say that no
Southern man suffered more at the hands of the Southern people
and deserved it less. I uncover my head in honor to his memory
and bid him “all hail and farewell!” Little cares he now
for the plaudits of the world or the censure of his critics. When
a chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy refused a wreath
to his remains, Jeff Davis, Lee, Stonewall Jackson, the two
Johnstons, and a host of others gone before, were giving him
brotherly welcome in the city of the living God, and his old
corps who have crossed the river joined in shouts of welcome
to his knightly soul. Let us all feel that</p>

when the second day’s fight was over.” This was General
Sickles’s comment to-day at the city hall with reference to criticism
by General John B. Gordon, who seems to think that the
defeat of the Confederates at Gettysburg was due to General
Longstreet.</p>
<p>“Gordon is a gallant gentleman, and he was a gallant
soldier,” continued General Sickles, “but he commanded a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
brigade, while Longstreet commanded a corps. Lee told Longstreet
afterwards that he had done as well as he could. He had
no criticism to make. Gordon was in no position to judge the
merits of the case. Longstreet was on my front. I led the Third
Corps on the second day. The fighting was on Hancock’s front
on the third day. He was in the centre. I guess every one who
was there knew that Longstreet fought brilliantly. Longstreet
was practically in command of the Confederate fighting on both
the second and third days. If Lee had been dissatisfied on the
second day, he would not have let Longstreet command on the
third day. As a matter of fact the Confederates had no better
fighter than Longstreet.”</p>

<p>“His record needs no defence.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="in0">To <span class="smcap">The Editor of the Telegraph</span>:</p>
<p>The able editorial in your issue of several days ago touching
the Savannah incident in which the Daughters of the Confederacy
refused to send flowers to the funeral of General Longstreet,
assigning as the reason “that General Longstreet refused
to obey the order of General Lee at Gettysburg,” met a
responsive chord in the hearts of many old veterans of the Confederate
army.</p>
<p>Longstreet’s war record, like that of Stonewall Jackson’s,
needs no defence. History is replete with his grand deeds of
chivalry, and places his name high in the ranks of the great
commanders of the Civil War. The rank and file who fought
under this great and intrepid commander know that he was incapable
of such conduct, and the only tongue that could convince
them otherwise was forever stilled when our peerless Lee
passed over the river.</p>
<p>In the first battle of Manassas, at Seven Pines, when he lead
the main attack, at Gaines Mill, Frazier’s Farm, Malvern Hill,
and at second Manassas, when the illustrious Stonewall Jackson
was being sorely pressed by the entire army of General Pope,
he hurried to Jackson’s relief, and together gained one of the
greatest victories of the war. He commanded the right wing
of our army on the bloody field of Sharpsburg, and was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
thickest of the fight during the entire battle. At the battle
of Fredericksburg he commanded the left wing of the army,
where the assault proved most fatal to the enemy. In all of
these battles, and others I do not now recall, General Longstreet
participated, winning fresh laurels in each fight.</p>
<p>At Gettysburg during the second and third days of the
battle he commanded the right wing of the army, and I never
saw an officer more conspicuous and daring upon the battle-field.
One of the most lasting pictures made upon my mind during
the war, and which still lingers in my memory, was in connection
with this officer. While in line of battle during the terrible
cannon duel between the two armies, when at a signal our
cannons ceased firing, I saw General Longstreet as he motioned
his staff back, sitting superbly in his saddle, gallop far out in
our front in full view and range of more than one hundred of
the enemy’s cannon, stop his horse, and, standing up in his
stirrups, place his field glasses to his eyes and deliberately and
for some time view the enemy’s line of battle, while shells were
bursting above and around him so thick that at intervals he
was hidden from sight by the smoke from exploding shells.
His object having been accomplished, he turned his horse and
slowly galloped back to his line of battle. No officer upon the
battle-field of Gettysburg displayed greater courage than Longstreet,
and his presence upon the battle-field, like that of Lee
and Jackson, was always worth a thousand men.</p>
<p>General Lee trusted Longstreet implicitly, and every act of
his from the time he assumed command of the Army of Northern
Virginia to Appomattox Court-House sustains this assertion.
When President Davis requested General Lee to send to the
relief of General Bragg, who was hard pressed by Sherman, he
sent his old “war-horse,” and, true to his mission, Longstreet
reached Chickamauga in time to turn the tide of battle in favor
of the South. Afterwards he was ordered to drive the Federal
army under General Burnside from East Tennessee, which he
ably accomplished, driving him behind his entrenchment at
Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>When General Grant attacked General Lee at the Wilderness​—​the
second battle in magnitude of the war​—​and by overwhelming
numbers was driving our army back, Longstreet by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
forced marches reached the field in time to snatch from Grant
a victory almost won. Here he received a wound which nearly
cost him his life, and which, perhaps, saved Grant’s army from
being driven into the Rappahannock.</p>
<p>At Appomattox Court-House, “where ceased forever the
Southern soldiers’ hope,” General Lee asked his old war-horse,
if the necessity should arise, to lead the remnant of the army
out, and he was ready to do so, and would have done so had not
General Grant granted honorable terms of surrender. Would
General Lee have trusted General Longstreet after the battle of
Gettysburg had he been in the least disloyal to his commands?
Impartial history will ever link the names of Lee, Jackson, and
Longstreet upon the brightest page of the history of the incomparable
Army of Northern Virginia. One word more about
Gettysburg. I happened to be there (but at the time would
have liked to have been elsewhere), and I decided then and am
still of the opinion that the Yankees are to blame for our defeat.</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p>“The idol of the Army of Northern Virginia.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>If the conduct of some of our people towards General Longstreet,
the great soldier, just dead, was not pitiful, it would be
brutal.</p>
<p>He, the stubborn fighter of all our armies, the trusted arm
of General Lee, the idol of the Army of Northern Virginia,
dead, forty years after his many battles and the establishment
of his undying fame, is refused by some of the daughters and
granddaughters of the men who fought and fell under his banners,
a wreath of flowers for his grave​—​a grave that makes hallowed
the land that holds it; is refused a resolution of praise, by
the sons and grandsons of the men who cheered his plume, as it
waved them to victory. Why is this? A silly story attributed
to General Lee, published after Lee’s death, by General Gordon
upon the authority of Fitz. Lee. The story contained the
charge that the faithful “Old War-Horse,” as General Lee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
affectionately dubbed him, failed, wilfully, or from other cause,
to obey orders at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Can this story be true? That depends upon two contingencies,
neither of which the wildest of General Longstreet’s defamers
have dared to formulate: first, that General Lee was
lacking in candor, or, secondly, he did not know his best soldiers.
Can either of these propositions be true? A thousand times no.</p>
<p>We all, or at least those of us who had the honor of serving in
the Army of Northern Virginia, recall that in September, 1863,
it became necessary to detach a portion of that army to send
west to relieve Bragg, then being driven south by Rosecrans
from Chattanooga; we also remember that, with all of his general
officers to select from, including Gordon and Fitz. Lee,
General Lee selected General Longstreet to lead his immortal
battalion, and the fame of how well he performed that proud
duty is still ringing in the ears of all who love honor and glory.</p>
<p>Would General Lee have selected General Longstreet, miscalled
by malice and envy “the slow,” “the disobeyer of orders,”
“the loser of the battle of Gettysburg,” and so of the Southern
cause, if he could have found in all his army one general braver
or more competent? Surely not. This fact established, and
established it is (and it also establishes General Lee’s unshaken
confidence in his “Old War-Horse”), what becomes of the
improbable story of Fitz. Lee? It is a matter of common history
that the fighting soldiers of 1861–65 have been silent since.
This at least is true of the Southern soldiers, and pity ’tis
true, because our own General R. F. Hoke, fighting then, silent
since, could add rich chapters to the history of those Titanic
days, if he would only speak.</p>
<p>With this conclusive evidence of General Lee’s faith in General
Longstreet, how pitiful is the unearned slander that has
made the reputation of so many babblers. Longstreet a traitor
or imbecile! Out upon it!</p>
<p>One other equally conclusive refutation of this miserable
story is: In 1866 General Lee, it seems, determined to write
the story of his campaigns,​—​“his object to disseminate the
truth” (would his example had been contagious),​—​at the close
of an affectionate letter to General Longstreet uses these words​—​words
which General Longstreet might have claimed as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
charter of nobility, had he not already had his glorious war
record to ennoble him:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“I had while in Richmond a great many inquiries after you,
and learned you intended commencing business in New Orleans.
If you make as good a merchant as you were a soldier, I shall
be content. No one will excel you, and no one can wish you
more success or more happiness than I. My interest and affection
for you will never cease, and my prayers are always offered
for your prosperity.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p>Does any sane man, or silly woman either, believe the noble
heart that inspired these words could have asked its tongue to
utter the things of General Longstreet that have been falsely
attributed to it. Can argument be more cogent or conclusion
more conclusive?</p>
<p>General Gordon is, I hope, with General Longstreet. Both
are at rest, and I know the “Old War-Horse” of the Army
of Northern Virginia, in the presence of his grand old chief,
has forgiven his comrade the wrongs done him here. Peace to
the ashes of both, the wronged and the wrong-doer.</p>

<p>“Longstreet came out of the war with a record for courage and loyalty
second to none.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>General Thomas L. Rosser, of Virginia, who commanded a
regiment at Gettysburg, and who was with the Army of Northern
Virginia from the first battle to the surrender, bitterly resents
the criticism of General Longstreet’s course at Gettysburg.
General Rosser was appointed an officer in the Spanish War
by President McKinley, and in recent years has been acting with
the Republican party. Reviewing the work of some of the great
Confederate generals, General Rosser said to a reporter for
the <i>Star</i>:</p>
<p>“With the death of General Longstreet passes the last of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
the great soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia. He
fought alone the battle of the 18th of July, 1861, and won
the first victory of that splendid army. He shared in the glory
of the great battles that army fought.</p>
<p>“Longstreet and Lee, as soldiers, were similar in many respects.
Both were great defensive generals, but neither can be
classed among the successful offensive generals of history.</p>
<p>“Take Jackson, for instance. His campaign from Kernstown
to Port Republic, in the Valley of Virginia, in 1862, was
as brilliant as the first Italian campaign of the great Napoleon.
He drew McDowell from Fredericksburg. He left
Shields, Fremont, and Banks confused as to his whereabouts,
dashed across the mountains, joined Lee on the 26th of June,
striking McClellan the surprise blow, forced him to the James,
and raised the siege of Richmond. With the despatch of lightning
he wheeled around, met Pope at Cedar Mountain, stopped
his advance upon Lee’s rear and flank, held him until Lee could
arrive with reinforcements, passed to his rear, and fought the
battle of the 28th of September at Groveton Heights; opened
the way for Lee to press on with his army, and crowned the
campaign with the successful battle of the second Bull Run.
He crossed the Potomac with Lee, was detached, sent back,
captured Harper’s Ferry, and joined Lee at Sharpsburg in
time to stop McClellan and save Lee’s army. In May, 1863,
when Lee was hesitating in the Wilderness, believing that
Hooker’s movement below Fredericksburg was a serious one, with
the foresight of genius Jackson pronounced it a feint, urged
Lee to allow him to move around Hooker’s right, which, in
audacity, boldness, and brilliancy seemed to paralyze Lee, and
while on this wonderful march Sickles got between him and
Lee with an army nearly equal his own. Jackson pressed on,
turned Hooker’s right, as he contemplated, dissipated the
Eleventh Corps and all its support, and was within a half-mile
of his goal, the Bullock house, had he gained possession of which
Hooker’s retreat would have been impossible and he would have
been at the mercy of the Confederate army, when he was shot
and mortally wounded by his own men.</p>
<p>“Lee, then in command of an army that knew no defeat, and
not realizing that his great offensive general had been taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
from the army, committed the fatal blunder of attempting an
invasion of the North. At no time during that campaign did
he move with celerity, manœuvre to the surprise of the enemy,
or do anything of a brilliant character marking him with the
genius of war. The battle of Gettysburg was lost the first day,
although the Confederates claimed a victory, and it might have
been turned into a victory had Lee been a master of the art of
aggressive warfare. But he followed up the first day with a
stubborn attack of the enemy in an intrenched position, and,
failing to dislodge him, seemed to hesitate and his plans seemed
to be confused. Finally he committed a great error in attacking
a superior enemy in an intrenched position at the strongest
point.</p>
<p>“In the history of battles very few generals have ever made
an attack of the centre of the enemy’s position, and history
gives only one example of where such an attack has been successful.
That was the battle of Wagram, where the great Napoleon
deceived the Archduke Charles by so threatening his
flank as to cause him to weaken his centre, when, quick as a
flash, Napoleon struck the centre of the enemy with MacDonald
and his reserves. But then the world has only given us one
Napoleon, and the Western hemisphere has given us only one
Jackson.</p>
<p>“When Lee’s army was beaten from the fatal attack which
he ordered on the 3d of July, he rode among his fleeing soldiers,
begging them to rally and reform on Seminary Ridge, telling
them that it was his fault that they had failed and not their
own. No criticism was made of Longstreet at that time. Longstreet
was retained in the most important corps of Lee’s army
and served honorably and faithfully under Lee to the end.</p>
<p>“At Appomattox Longstreet, with Lee and the Army of
Northern Virginia, at the close of a most glorious achievement,
honestly surrendered. The Southern Confederacy was eliminated
from the map of the world, its flag was forever furled,
and all soldiers who surrendered there had either to return to
the Union and become loyal to the flag of their country or
remain hypocrites and traitors, which they could not do if they
had honestly surrendered and accepted the terms that Grant
had given them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
“Longstreet came out of the war with a record for courage,
devotion to the cause he had espoused, and loyalty to the Stars
and Bars second to none. Disabled by wounds, his right arm
hanging lifeless and helpless at his side, his profession, that of a
soldier, gone, he turned his attention to civil pursuits, and was
struggling for a living when his old friend Grant, the President
of the United States, offered him service in the government. Lee
was dead. Southern politicians had expected Longstreet to
keep the fires of Southern antipathy to the North alive, and as
they were seeking to inflame the passions of the people as a basis
upon which to unite the South and to fuse with the copperhead
party in the North, as a means for repossessing themselves of a
government they had lost by the results of the war, this action
of Longstreet in accepting the offer of Grant tended to break
their influence with the old soldiers of the South.</p>
<p>“To counteract that they brought up the charge of disloyalty
and disobedience to Lee at Gettysburg, never having
thought of it before, and never, in fact, having had a foundation
for it. This, in a measure, served their purpose, because
the old soldiers and their sons in the South are always ready to
resent anything said or done unfavorable to Lee. Now, I am
mortified to see that even the ladies have taken this matter up,
and the Daughters of the Confederacy at Savannah refused to
lay a wreath of laurels on the tomb of the great hero. I was
surprised that Fitzhugh Lee should have charged Longstreet
with disobedience, for I don’t believe that General Lee ever
made such a charge himself. After the war I went to Lexington
and studied law and saw Lee every day and every night. Our
comrades and enemies were often discussed, but I never heard
him speak of Longstreet but in the most affectionate manner.
Colonel Venable was professor of mathematics when I moved
back to Charlottesville eighteen years ago, and my relations
with him up to his death were close and intimate. I never heard
him suggest the idea that Longstreet disobeyed orders or failed
to do his duty at Gettysburg or anywhere else. General Lee
relieved General Ewell, one of his corps commanders at Gettysburg,
from duty with his army. He criticised A. P. Hill
severely for his failure and mismanagement at Bristow station,
but no man ever heard him say one word against Longstreet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
“Now that Longstreet is laid away to rest, all old and true
soldiers of the Southern Confederacy will kneel around his tomb
and pray that they may stand at the great reveille with Lee,
Jackson, and Longstreet.”</p>

<p>From the lips of Lee no word of censure ever fell upon the
military renown of his great corps commander, the intrepid
and immovable Longstreet. However men may differ as to that
last fateful day at Gettysburg, on the historic page there is
blazoned the military glory of James Longstreet. No earthly
power can blot it out. Longstreet’s corps is as inseparable from
the glory of the veterans of Lee as the Old Guard from the
army of Napoleon. And when a week ago with the last expiring
sigh of its aged commander the blood of his fearless heart broke
from the wound which laid him prone on the first day at the
Wilderness, at the moment when he had restored the shattered
lines and saved the Army of Northern Virginia, each ruddy drop,

<h3>(<i>McRae, Georgia, Enterprise.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Only necessary to refer his critics to the official reports.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>It is rather significant in the life of General Longstreet that
under the storm of anathemas which have been hurled upon him,
both by private tongue and public pen, he always observed that
silence commensurate with his dignity of character and magnanimity
of soul. It is furthermore significant, that whenever
an attack was made upon his official conduct at any time, it was
only necessary that he point to the official report of the matter
as made of it at the time. In every case where unfair criticism
was indulged in, where there was no foundation for such, and,
of course, no official data to which recourse could be had, the kind
offices of some distinguished friend was invariably volunteered.</p>
<p>It is also rather a singular fact, that although he took a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
prominent part in numberless engagements, among which could
be mentioned some of the most sanguinary of the ’60’s, he never
suffered serious defeat, and almost invariably bore off the laurels.
This statement applies to Longstreet more truthfully than to
any other general of either side. It was characteristic of him,
and at the same time evincing his great military skill and genius,
that he very often manipulated his forces as emergencies suggested
in the absence of orders from his superior. In no instance
where this was done does it appear that he ever received
a reprimand, but the approval, rather, of the commanding
officer.</p>
<p>After the war, his course seems to have met with some disapprobation
on the part of some of his admirers South. This
is a matter which seems rather best decided by an appeal from
the arena of individual judgment to the forum of justice and
right.​—​<span class="smcap">Old Veteran.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huntsville, Alabama</span>, January 8.​—​General Samuel H.
Moore, a brave ex-Confederate soldier of this city, claims to
know inside history concerning the career of General Longstreet
after the close of the Civil War, and in a communication written
for the public he calls upon General Joseph Wheeler and Colonel
W. W. Garth to tell what they know in justice to the departed
chieftain. General Moore writes:</p>
<p>“It is due General Lee’s old war-horse, who was familiarly
known to the Army of Northern Virginia as ‘Old Pete’ Longstreet,
that a statement should be made which will vindicate
his actions soon after the surrender and reinstate him in the
hearts of those who always felt safe in battle when he was at
their head, and who would have been proud to shed their last
drop of blood to shield his fair name if they had only been cognizant
of the facts which impelled him to pursue the course he
did​—​as he believed for the benefit of his Southern people.</p>
<p>“In 1866, when reconstruction hung over the South like a
sword of Damocles, five lieutenant-generals of the Confederate
army held a meeting in New Orleans, in General Hood’s room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
to discuss the situation and publish to the South the easiest way
to bear the yoke sad fate had placed upon their necks.</p>
<p>“After discussing all the pros and cons, they unanimously
decided to accept the situation as it was, return to the Union
like good and loyal citizens, and be the recipients of the offices
of trust which were being given to carpet-baggers because the
government could not find in the Southern States men willing
to accept the offices that would have gladly been given them.</p>
<p>“In this caucus of generals, Longstreet was selected to write
and publish a letter. He did it. There was a howl of protest
from the ill-informed people. The men who advised Longstreet
to do this did not face this opposition, avoided this martyr, let
him bear the odium alone. I ask General Joseph Wheeler to
say what he personally knows of this. I call upon Colonel W.
W. Garth to say what he knows and the source of his information.</p>
<p>“Let the South beg pardon for the wrong it has done our
greater soldier, General James Longstreet.”</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p class="center smaller">“Did he do his duty as a soldier? Let Williamsburg, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg,
Gettysburg, Chickamauga, and the Wilderness make reply.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>We are here to-day to pay our tribute to James Longstreet,
the soldier who faithfully and ably served, the fighter who
fiercely fought, the leader who bravely led, the sleepless, watchful,
persistent, valorous captain of a glorious host, whom his
great chief implicitly trusted in every hour of supreme and
dangerous service, and who on many a bloody field hurled his
bold and devoted followers like an avalanche on the serried
ranks of his country’s foes, and who, when valor could avail no
more, bore with him from the field of strife the passionate love
of the legions he had led, and the unstinted praise and tearful
benediction of his great commander, who knew him best, and had
trusted him in many an “imminent and deadly breach.”</p>
<p>Every man capable by reason of environment, character, or
ability of exerting an influence upon affairs in any important
field of human endeavor, is called upon at some time to act under
such circumstances that his decision must infallibly indicate the
character of the man and forever fix his place in the estimation
of his contemporaries and of posterity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
That time came to James Longstreet in 1861. He was then
an officer in the army of the greatest and most powerful republic
on all the earth, and had won high and deserved honor in battle
beneath its flag.</p>
<p>High commission in that army awaited him if he but adhered
to that flag, and the future held in store for him exalted rank
which his reputation and ability easily assured him.</p>
<p>On the other hand was a young nation, scarcely emerged
from its chrysalis stage and without moral or physical support
among the nations of the earth. His training and education as
a soldier, and his knowledge of the power and resources of that
great government in whose service he had been so long enlisted,
enabled him to appreciate and realize the odds in its favor in the
rapidly approaching struggle.</p>
<p>The conditions which confronted him required the exertion
of all the virtues of courage, honor, consistency, and fidelity to
conviction. He was called upon to illustrate the loftiest qualities
of human character, and immolate self on the shrine of
duty, or give heed to the siren voice of ambition, and, lured
by the selfish hope of high reward, turn his sword against the
land of his birth in the hour of her sorest need.</p>
<p>As Daniel, Virginia’s great orator, has so fitly said of Robert
E. Lee: “Since the Son of Man stood upon the Mount and saw
‘all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory thereof’ stretched
before him and turned away from them to the agony and bloody
sweat of Gethsemane, and to the Cross of Calvary beyond, no
follower of the meek and lowly Saviour can have undergone a
more trying ordeal or met it in a higher spirit of heroic sacrifice.”</p>
<p>In that hour of supreme test, trial, and temptation, James
Longstreet did not hesitate. He dallied not with dishonor. He
was deaf to every call save that of duty. Obedient to the conviction
that his first, highest, and holiest obligation was to the
land of his birth, he responded to her call, and for four long
years “feasted glory till pity cried no more.” His gleaming
sword flashed in the forefront of the fighting, till when stricken
and scarred with many a wound and with honor unstained he
bowed to the stern arbitrament of battle.</p>
<p>When he made his choice and upon bended knee offered his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
sword as a loving and loyal son to his native South, he thereby
avouched himself unto all the ages as one who in every hour of
trial and in every sphere of duty would keep his “robes and
his integrity stainless unto heaven.”</p>
<p>He then and there gave to the world perpetual and irrefutable
proof that his every act since that day, whether as soldier or
civilian, was prompted by an exalted sense of duty, performed
in obedience to the convictions of an intelligent and deliberate
judgment, and approved by a clear conscience, and standing
on that high vantage ground he courted truth and defied malice.</p>
<p>No man who rises superior to temptation, and offers his life
as an offering upon the altar of duty, and freely sheds his
blood in testimony to the sincerity of his convictions, is called
upon to explain his conduct “in any sphere of life in which it
may please God to place him.”</p>
<p>The exercises of this occasion take color and purpose from
that tragic era in which James Longstreet was so conspicuous
and honorable a figure; and his record as a soldier is absolutely
beyond impeachment. Did he do his duty as a soldier brave
and true? Did he bear himself as became a man in the hour of
battle? Let history unroll her proud annals and say! Let Williamsburg,
Sharpsburg, Gettysburg, Chickamauga, and the
Wilderness make reply.</p>
<p>Ask those who met him and his dauntless legion on many a
bloody field, and they will tell how often he swept down upon
them like an avenging whirlwind. Ask his “boys,” who for
four years followed him with unquestioning devotion and with
ever-increasing love and admiration, and they will with one
accord and with voices tremulous with emotion answer that he
never lagged, failed, or faltered.</p>
<p>Hear the testimony of Robert E. Lee, his great commander,
who, though dead, yet speaketh: “General Longstreet (at Gaines
Mill) perceived that to render the diversion effectual the feint
must be converted into an attack. He resolved with characteristic
promptness to carry the heights by assault.” After
Chickamauga, he says, “My whole heart and soul have been with
you and your brave corps in your late battle. Finish your work,
my dear General, and return to me. I want you badly, and you
cannot get back too soon.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Let Joseph E. Johnston bear witness to the world of his
great subordinate at Williamsburg: “I was compelled to be
a mere spectator, for General Longstreet’s clear head and brave
heart left no apology for interference. The skill, vigor, and
decision of General Longstreet (at Seven Pines) was worthy of
the highest praise.”</p>
<p>We have yet further testimony, which in pathos and convincing
power excels all speech or written language. It is an
historic truth that when the end had come at Appomattox, and
those who had so long shared the hardships of the camp and
the peril and the glory of the battle-field were about to separate,
General Longstreet and his staff proceeded to where General
Lee and his staff had gathered for the last time before their final
parting, and General Lee grasped the hand and spoke a few
kindly words to each member of the group until he reached
General Longstreet, when each threw his arms about the other,
and as they thus stood clasped together both sobbed like children.
When General Lee had recovered his composure, turning
to a member of the party who is now in this presence, he said,
“Captain, into your care I commend my old war-horse.”</p>
<p>Robert E. Lee, standing on the fateful and historic field of
Appomattox, amid the gathering gloom of that awful hour of
defeat and disaster, with his arms about James Longstreet, while
his majestic frame shook with uncontrollable grief, was a scene
worthy to have been limned by genius on immortal canvas.</p>
<p>The tears of Robert E. Lee falling upon the symbol and insignia
of Longstreet’s rank converted it then and there into a
badge of honor, grander than the guerdon of a king.</p>
<p>It is known to countless thousands that only a few years
before he passed away Jefferson Davis moved out from the
midst of a mighty throng, which was acclaiming him with every
manifestation of earthly honor, to greet with open arms General
Longstreet. Turning aside for a time from the thousands
who pressed about him in a very frenzy of love and enthusiasm,
he advanced and folded the great soldier to his bosom,
thus testifying before God and a multitude of witnesses to his
faith in the fidelity to conviction and to duty of the old hero.</p>
<p>Davis! Lee! Johnston! Immortal triumvirate of heroes!
Glorious sons of a glorious land! Fortunate indeed is that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
man who by such as they is avouched unto posterity. When
Lee and Davis laid their hands in blessing and benediction upon
James Longstreet, he was then and there given passport unto
immortality.</p>
<p>The brevity of the time properly allotted me wherein to perform
my part in the exercises of this occasion makes impossible
any discussion or analysis of the campaigns of General Longstreet,
even if such discussion were necessary, which it is not.
His fame is securely fixed, and the faithful historian of the
future will assign him to his due and fitting place in the annals
of his age. The history of that great struggle, in which he was
so majestic and forceful a figure, which does not bear tribute
to his fidelity, skill, and valor will be manifestly and unjustly
incomplete; and if any page thereof be not lighted with the
lines of glory reflected by his heroic deeds, it will be because
the truth has not been thereon written.</p>
<p>In the galaxy of the glorious and the great, James Longstreet
will stand through all the ages enshrined with his great
companions in arms in the pantheon of the immortals.</p>
<p>Over such a life as his, bravely, nobly lived on lofty levels,
death has no dominion. More than fourscore years were upon
him, and his kingly form was somewhat bowed, but the dauntless
and indomitable spirit which had never quailed before danger,
however imminent or dire, shrank not before the coming of that
conqueror to whom the lofty and the lowly alike must yield,
but, soothed and sustained by the holy faith of the mother
church, he passed to his eternal <span class="locked">rest​—​</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="center smaller">“While Christ, his Lord, wide open held the door.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>To those who loved and honored him the thought is comforting
that after all the battles and trials and hardships of
his arduous and eventful life he has found that rest reserved
for the faithful in the realm of eternal reunion.</p>
<p>We can believe that when, clothed with the added dignity and
majesty of immortality, he drew near to that eternal bivouac
where are pitched the tents of the comrades who preceded him
to rest eternal, two, conspicuous for kingly grace, even in that
immortal throng, advanced to meet him and clasp him once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
again to their bosoms, and that as he stood in their arms enfolded
there fell upon his ears the voice of the Master <span class="locked">saying,​—​</span></p>

joy of thy Lord.”​—​<span class="smcap">Judge Norman G. Kittrell</span>, Houston,

<p class="center smaller">“No soldier of Longstreet’s corps ever doubted his loyalty.”</p>
<p>No soldier of Longstreet’s corps during the war, whether he
was one of the boys in the trenches, or wore the stars upon his
collar, ever doubted either the courage, or the capacity, or the
loyalty of James Longstreet. No man ever heard an insinuation
of that kind. No, he was entitled to the splendid name the immortal
Lee gave him of “old war-horse,” and he held in the
very highest degree the implicit confidence of the men he commanded
and who loved him.</p>
<p>I love to think of Lee and Jackson and Longstreet and Hill
as the “Big Four” of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>Many years have passed since that bloody conflict; we are
now one people, with one common flag and one country and
one destiny. But we ought not to forget, how can we forget!
the glorious names which became as familiar as household words
to us during that trying time. Among all the other great
names, that of James Longstreet, the ranking lieutenant-general
of the Confederate army, who earned that title in the field and
worthily wore it to the end, must shine forever in that noble
galaxy.​—​<span class="smcap">Captain John H. Leathen</span>, <i>Second Regiment Virginia

<blockquote><div>
<p>“Always a plumed knight without reproach.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Nothing but sickness and a cold drive of twenty-five miles
could have prevented me from attending the funeral obsequies
of my old friend and great military chieftain and placing my
humble tribute of flowers upon his grave.</p>
<p>And now, in the quiet of a sick-chamber, I undertake to weave
a little garland to his memory. I know that nothing I may
write will add any lustre or greatness to a name that has become
immortal in the annals of a people who more than a third of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
century ago, and for four long years, performed deeds of heroic
valor that would have shed glory upon the military renown of
any country or people that have ever lived or had a place in
history.</p>
<p>I have never permitted any criticism or detraction that has
been written or uttered against General Longstreet, no matter
by whom or for what purpose the same may have been written
or uttered, to have a feather’s weight in varying my love and
veneration for this almost incomparable commander.</p>
<p>I watched him in his course from Bull Run to Appomattox,
and to me he was always a plumed knight, without reproach.
I have seen him on the field of battle, and I have seen him at his
quiet tent. The very first order I heard given to “fire,” was
delivered by Longstreet at Bull Run on the 18th day of July,
1861. It was the prelude to the great victory on the bloody
field of Manassas, three days after.</p>
<p>Bull Run may have been the beginning of battles in Northern
Virginia​—​introductory to greater performances, but it was
nevertheless a finished battle. A flag of truce came in and asked
for a suspension of hostilities, and that the Federal dead be
buried. The Union forces had fallen back to Centreville, three
miles. Detachments from Bonham’s South Carolinians and
Early’s Louisianians were called for to bury the dead. Longstreet’s
brigade had done the principal fighting, and Longstreet’s
brigade rested.</p>
<p>The dead were buried by those who had been fighting them
only a few hours before. The day’s battle was over, and the
sun went down with the victors in possession of the field and its
dead.</p>
<p>The battle of Bull Run (18th of July, 1861) will always
remain in my memory a separate picture, and, like a diamond,
however small it may be when compared with greater jewels, will
retain its own halo and its own setting of gems. Longstreet
was the hero of that historic field. Beauregard was higher in
command, but Longstreet began and ended the fight.</p>
<p>I hope to be pardoned for this reference to an almost forgotten
engagement, wherein nearly four thousand South Carolinians
and an almost equal number of Virginians and Louisianians
received their “first baptism of fire.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
I will relate an incident that occurred after the war, to illustrate
the inward character of General Longstreet, and how this
great man desired to be on friendly terms with every one, especially
old friends whom the accidents of war had estranged. It
had come to my knowledge that in some way or other during
the war General Longstreet and General Lafayette McLaws,
lifelong friends and fellow-officers in the old United States army,
had become separated in their friendships. Seventeen years
and more had passed, and yet no healing balm had been poured
upon these two proud hearts. General Longstreet was a patron
of the N. G. A. College. He had two sons, Lee and James, at
this military institution. General McLaws was contemplating
sending a son to the school. Knowing that there was estrangement
between these great military heroes, I induced Governor
A. H. Colquitt to place these two men on the Board of Visitors
to the College in the hope that they might meet each other in
the quietude of my mountain home and become reconciled. They
both came, and I arranged that they might be my guests, with
others, and in some way I hoped to bring them close together.
Their meeting was quite formal, and I thought they were very
cold to each other. But after the supper was over, and getting
my other guests to seats on the piazza, where they might smoke
and talk, I gently asked the two to walk into the parlor with
me, and seated them within easy distance of each other. I then
began the conversation by alluding to some affair of the war
with which they were familiar, for both of them had commanded
Kershaw’s brigade, to which I belonged. It was not long before
the clouds began to roll away, as these old warriors passed from
one scene to another, and their voices became friendlier. I
then thought I could be excused and passed from the room, and
kept others from disturbing them, and when they came out
together, shook hands, and bade each other “good-night,” I
thought then that they were friends again. That night I called
at General Longstreet’s room and knocked, but heard no response.
I pushed the door gently and peered in, and discovered
that the General was kneeling and praying. I went away as
softly as I could, and the next day General Longstreet thanked
me for the quiet way in which I had brought them together.
“For,” said he, “we are friends again.” If I ever knew, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
have long since forgotten the cause of the estrangement. It
might have occurred at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>It was my pleasure to have witnessed the meeting between
General Longstreet and President Davis, so often alluded to as
occurring at the unveiling of the Ben Hill statue in Atlanta. I
had been given by Colonel Lowndes Calhoun on that occasion
the command of several hundred one-armed and one-legged Confederate
veterans. When these two great heroes met and embraced,
my command “went wild,” and they never got into
line any more. Longstreet was almost a giant in stature and
always attracted attention and produced enthusiasm. Whatever
his political views were after the war was over, he honestly
and fearlessly entertained them, but he never offensively presented
them to any one, and it remains yet to be seen whether
he was not right in many matters concerning which he was
perhaps too harshly judged by some people.</p>
<p>In 1896 General Longstreet’s name was on the McKinley
electoral ticket. He came to Dahlonega to address the people
on the political issues of the day. Although not a member of
his political party, I had the honor of introducing him to the
people of my native county in the following words, as published
in the <i>Eagle</i>, October 29, 1896:</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Fellow-Countrymen and Ladies</span>,​—​A few of the survivors
of that gallant band who rushed to arms in defence of
the Sunny South more than a third of a century ago, without
regard to past or present affiliation with political parties, have
with only a few moments’ notice met to pay an humble tribute to
one who, with dauntless and conspicuous bravery, led the
Southern cohorts through many bloody battle-fields. Like the
plumed knight, Henry of Navarre, his sword always flashed
fiercest where the fighting was the hottest. His was the first
voice of command to ‘fire’ when the Army of Northern Virginia
was receiving its ‘baptism of fire’ at Bull Run on the 18th of
July, 1861. And from the following Sunday, the memorable
battle of Manassas, to Appomattox our comrades followed him.
From Gettysburg to Chickamauga with unfaltering step they
went wherever he led them, and from Chickamauga to the
Wilderness they unswervingly obeyed his commands. His fame
has become the common heritage of us all. No longer the sole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
cynosure of Southern hearts and eyes, he is the beloved citizen
of a restored country and a reunited Union. His patriotism,
his history, his name, are the common property of all the people,
both North and South. He is with us to-day for only a few
hours. Possibly our eyes may never look into his again, nor our
hands clasp his on earth, nor ever hear that voice once so potent
to thousands of his countrymen. That voice is feeble, but he
raises it now only for the purpose of guiding his friends into
what he deems to be the paths of peace and prosperity. Listen
to him with patience. I now have the honor of introducing to
you, my fellow-countrymen, that distinguished soldier and
statesman, General James Longstreet.”​—​<span class="smcap">W. P. Price.</span></p>

<h3>(<i>Washington, D. C., Star.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Would have won battle. Never disloyal to his commander.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Major J. H. Stine, historian of the Army of the Potomac,
has this to say of General Longstreet:</p>
<p>“It would be unjust in me to keep silent after enjoying
General Longstreet’s confidence, especially in regard to that
great battle in which the blue and the gray met at Gettysburg.
A quarter of a century after that great battle I had Longstreet
invited here as the guest of the First Corps of the Army of the
Potomac. He came to Washington some two days in advance,
and was a member of my household during that time. We
occupied a room together at Gettysburg and went over the whole
field, when he gave me a full description of the Confederates’
movements.</p>
<p>“He was never disloyal to Lee, but he feared the Pickett
charge would not be as successful as MacDonald’s at Wagram.
Longstreet attempted to persuade Lee not to order it, but rather
a retreat at night and take up a position on the south bank of
Pipe Creek, where Meade wanted to fight the battle.</p>
<p>“He says, in his history: ‘I was following the Third Corps
as fast as possible, and as soon as I got possession of the road
went rapidly forward to join General Lee. I found him on
the summit of Seminary Ridge, watching the enemy concentrate
on the opposite hill. He pointed out their position to me. I
took my glasses and made as careful a survey as I could from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
that point. After five or ten minutes I turned to General Lee
and <span class="locked">said,​—​</span></p>
<p>“‘“If we could have chosen a point to meet our plans of
operation, I do not think we could have found a better one than
that upon which they are now concentrating. All we have to do
is to throw our army around by their left, and we shall interpose
between the Federal army and Washington.”’</p>
<p>“‘“No,” said General Lee, “the enemy is there, and I am
going to attack him there.”’</p>
<p>“Lee was a great military student. He had before him Napoleon’s
great victory at Wagram, when he ordered MacDonald,
with sixteen thousand men, to charge the enemy’s centre. But
few of that number were alive when success crowned that daring
military movement. If Pickett’s charge had been successful,
it would have crowned the Southern Confederacy as one of the
nations of the world, for it would not only have had foreign
recognition, but valuable assistance. Upon every field except
one Lee had been successful, and that was a drawn battle.</p>
<p>“He had great confidence in himself, and thought that it
was impossible to defeat him with his Southern legions under
his command. Longstreet differed from him on that charge,
and I am truly glad, for the sake of my country, that Lee did
not listen to him. They are both gone forever, but it seems
strange to me that any military mind cannot recognize the
foresight of Longstreet at Gettysburg.”</p>

<h3>(<i>Lost Cause.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Pendleton’s charge a discharge of hot air.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The recent death of the gallant old war-horse of the Army
of Northern Virginia, General James Longstreet, has again
revived some of the slanderous and unfounded reports of his
lack of duty, unfaithfulness, and disobedience of orders at the
battle of Gettysburg. I want to offer some thoughts in regard
to this matter, and the first thing I want to say is that General
Longstreet retained the love and confidence of the soldiers of
Lee’s army up to the surrender at Appomattox, on the 9th of
April, 1865. His soldiers never for one moment questioned his
loyalty, his courage, or his patriotism. If these late reports of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
his default of duty at Gettysburg be true, is it not passing
strange that he retained the love and confidence of General Lee
until the close of the war? If Longstreet had disobeyed Lee’s
orders at Gettysburg, thereby causing the battle to fail of success
to Southern arms, does any one pretend to believe that
General Lee would have continued to place faith and confidence
in him (his first lieutenant) until the close of the war? No
man who has a proper conception of the character of Robert E.
Lee as a soldier and as a great military commander will believe
it. Another remarkable circumstance in connection with these
grave charges against General Longstreet is, that the men composing
the Army of Northern Virginia never heard a word of
them until long after the death of General Lee, who could and
would have refuted or confirmed them. The fame and character
of General Lee as a great military chieftain does not need that
the fame and reputation of another great and gallant soldier
of the Confederate army shall be besmirched. Another remarkable
fact is, these charges came from men that were only brigadier-generals
at the battle of Gettysburg. Brigadier-General
Pendleton, it seems, first made this charge against General Longstreet
in a public speech at Lexington, Virginia, in 1873, in
which he said that General Lee told him that he had ordered
Longstreet to attack at sunrise on the 2d of July. Longstreet
emphatically denied that General Lee ever gave him any such
orders, and Colonel W. H. Taylor, Colonel C. S. Venable, Colonel
Charles Marshall, and General A. L. Long, all of General
Lee’s staff, testified, after this charge was made by Pendleton,
that they never heard of any such orders. Colonel Venable,
replying to General Longstreet, said, “I did not know of any
order for an attack on the enemy at sunrise on the 2d of July,
nor can I believe any such order was issued by General Lee.
About sunrise on the 2d I was sent by General Lee to General
Ewell to ask him what he thought of the advantages of an attack
on the enemy from his position. I do not think that the errand
on which I was sent by the commanding General is consistent
with the idea of an attack at sunrise by any portion of the
army.”</p>
<p>It seems clearly by the testimony of these eminent officers
and soldiers who were at that time members of General Lee’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
official family and were active participants in that supreme
struggle of Gettysburg, that this charge by General Pendleton
was only a discharge of hot air. I think the general view taken
by the best authority upon the history of the fighting at Gettysburg
on July the 2d, which was the second day of these battles,
that up to 11 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> General Lee was undecided as to whether he
would attack on the right or left. No matter in what eloquent
words we may clothe our admiration for him as a soldier, the
soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia would regard all
these eloquent words of praise as inadequate to express the admiration
we feel for the brave deeds in war, and the unselfish
and gallant service rendered the Confederate army by this grand
old hero, General James Longstreet. General Lee told General
Pickett and the Army of Northern Virginia that the lack of
their success at Gettysburg was his fault. This man of glorious
and immortal fame, as the greatest military leader of modern
times, realized that he himself had overrated the ability of his
army, and underrated the army of his enemy, who had the
advantage of numbers and of far better position. General Lee
realized then, as the world has since, that he made a mistake in
attacking the Union army at Gettysburg after General Meade
had secured and to some extent had fortified an almost impregnable
position. Grant made the same mistake when Lee caught
him on the fly in the Wilderness, at Spottsylvania, and at Cold
Harbor, with this difference, Grant was depending upon his
superior numbers and equipment, while Lee was depending upon
the morale and fighting qualities of his army. And while the
morale and fighting qualities of Lee’s army were never equalled in
the history of modern warfare, even they could not accomplish the
impossible. And the traducers of General Longstreet’s fidelity
are strangely oblivious of the fact that General Longstreet at
the battle of the Wilderness made a forced march that taxed
his soldiers to their utmost capacity to get there in time, and
when he arrived on the field he found the Southern line was
being driven back by superior numbers, and throwing his troops
into line and with his accustomed impetuosity drove the Federal
line rapidly back and saved the day and gave the Southern
army the victory at the Wilderness. In this fight he was
severely wounded, and the gallant Jenkins of South Carolina<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
at the same time was killed. Pendleton said that General Lee
died believing that but for the disobedience of Longstreet at
Gettysburg that battle would have been a victory for the
Southern army. How did he know that Lee died with that
belief? Did General Lee ever tell any one so? If so, whom? It
is one thing to make an assertion, but quite a different thing to
prove it. I have seen men in my day look pretty cheap in court
when called on to prove some things they had said on the streets.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I want to say that while we all regretted and
were grieved when General Longstreet joined the Republican
party, that fact ought not to have created prejudice sufficient
to have caused us to ignore, and belittle, and cast any reproach
upon his character, or unjust reflection upon his long and brilliant
career as a soldier. He was a soldier by profession, and,
according to his own testimony, he never cast a ballot in civil
life prior to the Confederate war. He and General Grant were
warm personal friends. They were school-mates at West Point,
comrades in the Mexican and some Indian wars. General Grant
clasped his hand and called him Jim at the surrender at Appomattox.
Grant at Appomattox was a Democrat and a slave-holder,
and he went over to the Republican party and was elected
President of the United States. What influence General Grant
brought to bear upon General Longstreet may have been very
great, for all the outside world knows. Be that as it may, we
do know that up to the close of the war he had taken no active
part in politics in any party. We also have every reason to
believe that if General Longstreet had espoused the Democratic
party, and become a strong partisan in that party, we never
would have heard a word of this imaginary default at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>The soldiers of Longstreet’s corps do not believe he disobeyed
General Lee’s orders at Gettysburg, or at any other time. We
don’t believe it now; we never did believe it, and we never will
believe it.​—​<span class="smcap">W. H. Edwards.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span></span></p>

<h3>(<i>Sterling Price Camp.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“His chivalry is as lasting as the hills of the Old Dominion.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Tribute to the memory of General James Longstreet, adopted
by Sterling Price Camp, No. 31, Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>Comrade A. W. Nowlin, in submitting the report of the committee,
said in part:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Comrades, we have assembled here as a camp to pay tribute to the
memory of the late Lieutenant-General Longstreet. One of the great
soldiers of the age has fallen. He has answered the last roll-call. Taps
has been sounded ‘Lights out.’ The ‘War-Horse of the Confederacy’ is
dead. This great, brave, and fearless officer is gone. The hard fighter
of the Army of Northern Virginia has surrendered to the arch-enemy death.
General Longstreet possessed the esteem and confidence of his troops in
a marked degree. They were devoted to him, and when and where he led
they were invincible.</p>
<p>“His name and his deeds of daring and chivalry are coupled and interwoven
with that of the Army of Northern Virginia, and are as lasting as
the hills of the ‘Old Dominion.’ The heroic battle-fields of Virginia will
ever attest and pay tribute to the military genius of this great leader.
History will hand down to posterity the name of James Longstreet as
one of the great generals of the nineteenth century.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The following was adopted as Camp Sterling Price’s tribute
to Lieutenant-General James Longstreet:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Lieutenant-General James Longstreet recently
passed away at his home in Gainesville, Georgia, and was buried,
amid the tears and regrets of thousands of those who loved him
and had assembled from every part of this country to pay this
last honor to him; be it</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the comrades of Camp Sterling Price have
heard with profound sorrow of the death of this great Southern
soldier and comrade.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That, educated in the profession of arms, he gave
many years of his young manhood to the service of his country
in the war with Mexico and in conflicts and campaigns with the
savages of the West, and everywhere distinguished himself for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
courage and ability so as to win promotion and the gratitude and
applause of his countrymen.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That when wrongs and passion disrupted the nation,
and his native State withdrew from the Union and united with
the Confederate States of America, he felt that his allegiance no
longer belonged to the other States of the Union, but to the one
of which he was a citizen, and he resigned his office in the United
States army and offered his services to the government of the
Confederacy. He received the rank of brigadier-general, and,
being always in the front when campaigns were most important
and the enemy the most powerful and battles were furious, he
was promoted for distinguished bravery, conduct, and generalship
to be major-general, lieutenant-general, and second in command
of the great Army of Northern Virginia, under the great
commander Lee.</p>
<p>As brigadier-general at Manassas he held the left wing of the
enemy, by his boldness, so that it could not give assistance to the
defeated right wing. As major-general he covered General
Johnston’s retreat in the Peninsula before the advance of McClellan,
and fought the victorious battle of Williamsburg. As
major-general he commanded the right wing in the bloody battle
of Seven Pines, and with D. H. Hill drove the enemy from the
field. In the Seven Days’ battle around Richmond no general
gained greater renown, and soon thereafter, when Congress
directed the President to appoint seven corps commanders with
the rank of lieutenant-general, Major-General Longstreet was
made the ranking lieutenant-general and second in command
of the army under Lee, which position he held through the
great battles and campaigns of that army for three years, until
with Lee and the remnant of his heroes he surrendered at Appomattox.</p>
<p>At the second battle of Manassas he commanded the right
wing of the army, and with Jackson on the left drove Pope
into the fortification of Washington. At South Mountain he
held McClellan with a death grip until Jackson could storm
Harper’s Ferry, and commanded the right wing at Sharpsburg
and fought more than double his number under McClellan from
early dawn until darkness spread her sombre shadows over the
bloodiest scene in American history. It was here that Lee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
knighted him as his “War-Horse” as the last guns were sending
their hoarse echoes among the mountains. Next, at Fredericksburg
he commanded the left wing, and at nightfall on the 13th
of December, 1862, eight thousand of the enemy were stretched
out dead or bleeding in front of his corps.</p>
<p>At Gettysburg, riding by the side of Lee, without expecting
nor desiring at that time to join battle with the enemy, they
heard the thunder of Hill’s and Ewell’s guns, and hastened to
their assistance. The first day’s battle was fought and won
before Lee or Longstreet could take an active part. On the
second day Longstreet commanded the right wing and fought
one of the bloodiest battles of the war, driving almost the entire
army of Meade before him, and leaving more than ten thousand
of the enemy slain or wounded on the field. The third day of
this great battle he exhibited the loftiest courage.</p>
<p>Next, he and his corps were sent from Virginia to Georgia and
joined Bragg in the terrible battle of Chickamauga, where he
commanded the left wing and routed the right wing of Rosecrans’s
army. When Grant and Meade, with their forty thousand
veteran soldiers, were advancing upon Lee in the Wilderness
of Virginia, the great commander of the Army of Northern
Virginia called Longstreet with his men back from Tennessee,
and with panting breath and quick step and double ranks he
headed the Texas brigade and rushed upon the cheering and
triumphant enemy on the second day in the Wilderness, and
drove them over their works amid the blazing woods, and a great
victory was in the grasp of Lee, when a bullet from our own
men, by mistake, crashed through his body and he was carried
from the field desperately wounded. The guiding hand of the
great general and fighter was gone, and victory fled as the fatal
opportunity was lost.</p>
<p>In the long siege and through the many battles around Richmond
and Petersburg, lasting nearly twelve months, Longstreet
commanded the left wing on the north side of the James, and
stood like an immovable mountain between the enemy and the
Confederate capital.</p>
<p>When the sad day of Five Forks came, and Lee’s lines were
broken about Petersburg, Longstreet was called from Richmond
with his men to the assistance of his great commander, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
covered the retreat and gave blow for blow to the charging
enemy, and when the sun rose on the day of the 9th of April,
and Grant was about to offer terms for the surrender of the
Southern army, Longstreet told General Lee that if the terms
were not honorable they would fight again and die fighting.
Thus he fought and stood by his chief to the bitter end, retaining
the confidence of his commander and his President to the last;
and if they who knew him best and trusted him most, and were
with him day and night and knew his thoughts and opinions, and
witnessed his deeds and actions throughout all the vicissitudes
and trials of those days that measured the souls of men,​—​if they
believed in him, trusted him, leaned on him, and kept him second
to Lee, who shall have the temerity to criticise, to condemn, and
to throw stones at this imperial soldier?</p>
<p>Those of us who have heard the thunder of his guns; those
of us who have seen him leading his warriors in battle; those of
us who have seen him stand like a Gibraltar against the charging
thousands of a fierce foe, will honor him as a great soldier who
has added to the fame of Southern manhood, and who is worthy
to stand through the ages with Lee and Johnston and Jackson
and Stewart, and all the brave men who laid their bare breasts
to the storm of war in the name of freedom and independence.
We honor ourselves by honoring such a man.</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p>“A Solomon in council, a Samson on the field.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The following resolution in memory of Lieutenant-General
James Longstreet, introduced by Captain Wm. Dunbar, was
adopted by Camp 435, U. C. V., Augusta, Georgia, by a unanimous
and rising vote:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
<i>Resolved</i>, That we deplore the death of Lieutenant-General
James Longstreet. We recall how, in the opening of the campaign
of 1862, his stubborn gallantry saved the Army of
Northern Virginia for its long career of glory; how, later in the
same campaign, his superb strategy rescued Stonewall Jackson
from the swarming thousands about to overwhelm him; how, in
1863, he flew to the aid of the heroic Army of Tennessee, and
with it won the resplendent victory of Chickamauga. In short,
we know him by the proud title of the War-Horse of the Confederacy,
a title worthily bestowed by General Robert E. Lee
himself. He was a grand soldier, a Solomon in council, and a
Samson in the field.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That these resolutions be inscribed on a special page
of our minutes, and that a copy thereof be transmitted by our
adjutant to the family of the valiant dead.</p>

<p>“His fame is imperishable.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Verily, though dead, yet in history he will continue to live;
be it therefore</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That while we, the Daughters of the Confederacy,
deplore the loss of our beloved Confederate General James Longstreet,
who was the first ranking general of the Confederate
army, passes one of the most gallant spirits of the nineteenth
century. In the war drama of his life he played a most important
part. At the beginning of the scene of the Civil War he
took up the Southland’s cause and began as brigadier-general a
career of courageous fighting which won for him the admiration
of the world. He was a comrade of Jackson and a companion of
Lee. In personal appearance General Longstreet was well
adapted to play this important part. So distinguished in appearance,
he was indeed a veritable “war-horse.” His career in the
Confederate army was a magnificent display of this loyal adherence
to his views of truth and right. His fame as a soldier
is imperishably inscribed on the scroll of history.</p>
<p>Worn by recurring paroxysms of exquisite pain, the great
warrior was weary as the evening shadows fell, and patiently
asked his devoted wife to rearrange his couch. “I shall rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
better on the other side,” he said, gently. Then the spirit took
its flight.</p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Let us cherish in our hearts the golden story,<br></span>
<span class="i0">How the chieftain bravely lived and calmly died​—​<br></span>
<span class="i0">Living for his Southland’s never fading glory​—​<br></span>
<span class="i0">“Resting better now upon the other side.”<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>Perish the hand and strike down the pen that would rob
him of a people’s gratitude to a brave and loyal son.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, His death caused universal sorrow among those who
honor the chivalry, gallantry, and bravery which lent to the
Confederate cause the lustre that can never dim, and left a
laurelled history that will never die.</p>
<p>“For he who best knows how to endure shall possess the
greater peace.”</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we extend our heartfelt sympathy to his bereaved
family in this hour of unspeakable sorrow, and pray that
the hand of our Heavenly Father may be laid in gracious healing
upon their broken hearts. That the Holy One may abide with
them in comforting influence, and that the sunshine of His
wonderful presence may brighten the present sad separation by
the sure promise of reunion with their beloved in the land where
suffering and death are unknown.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the city

<span class="smcap">No. 1461, U. C. V., Dickens, Texas.</span><br>
</p>
<p>We have assembled here to pay tribute to the memory of the
“War-Horse” of the Army of Northern Virginia, General
James Longstreet, who died recently at his home in or near
Gainesville, Georgia, at the ripe old age of eighty-three years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
General Longstreet earned his first laurels at the first battle of
Manassas, and fought his way up to lieutenant-general. Being
the ranking lieutenant-general in Lee’s grand army, he served
with conspicuous gallantry in nearly all the battles in which that
army was engaged,​—​Manassas, Williamsburg, Seven Pines,
under Johnston, the Seven Days’ battles around Richmond, Cedar
Mountain, Second Manassas, Sharpsburg (it was here that
General Lee knighted him as his “War-Horse”), Fredericksburg,
Gettysburg, Chickamauga, the Wilderness, around Richmond
and Petersburg, and in almost all the great battles in which
Lee’s army was engaged. However we may have differed with
him in the political path which he chose, when the army which he
led with such conspicuous ability laid down their arms and returned
to peaceful pursuits, we recognize in him a great general,
and the battle-fields of Virginia will ever attest and pay tribute to
his military genius. History will hand down his name to posterity
as one of the great generals of the South, one who was true
and faithful to the Star-Spangled Banner under which he
fought, and in whom our great commander, General R. E. Lee,
placed his confidence and trust. General Longstreet possessed
the esteem and confidence of his troops in a marked degree in
camp and field, and in advance or retreat his deeds of daring
are coupled with that of the army of General Lee, and are as
lasting as the hills of Virginia. We extend our sympathy to
the family of this grand old general who has passed over the
River.</p>

<p>“A patriot who commanded the admiration of the age in which he lived.

<p>To the memory of General Longstreet, passed by Camp James
Longstreet, U. C. V., at their regular meeting in Ennis, Texas,
January 17, 1904:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The Commander-in-Chief has been pleased to call
the late Lieutenant-General James Longstreet across the river,
to rest in the shade on the other shore with his former commanding
general, R. E. Lee, and his associates, Hood, Jackson,
and others, who had preceded him; and</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, In the removal of this great soldier from the walks
of life to his future reward the military world has lost one of the
most distinguished military characters known to the history of
civil warfare; America has lost a loyal patriot, whose inflexible
devotion to duty, as he saw it from a view-point of patriotic
loyalty to his country, commanded the admiration of the age in
which he lived; the South has lost a son, whose distinguished
services as a gallant soldier and whose superior ability as a
general in the Army of Northern Virginia easily classed him
with the greatest of the world’s great generals, one whose brilliant
record sheds an honorable lustre on the Southern soldier of which
the American people feel justly proud; therefore be it</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That while we deplore with sadness the death of
General Longstreet, who enjoyed the full confidence of his commanding
general and of the officers and men of his command
as a gallant and prudent officer, we cherish his record as a general
in the Army of Virginia as a spotless sheen of soldierly merit and

<p>“He was the chosen leader and central figure in every great conflict
from the first battle of Manassas to the fateful day at Appomattox.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Longstreet was the chosen leader and central figure in every
great conflict from the first battle of Manassas to the fateful
day at Appomattox.</p>
<p>Sparta never had a worthier son than the South had in General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Longstreet. From the firing of the first gun his ardor never
ceased, his courage never failed. Often in the midst of the
greatest battle did he stand with his men when they fell around
him like forests in a storm. His presence was inspiring, and his
word talismanic. No soldier was ever more loved or confided in
than he. Who shall say that his name shall not emblazon the
brightest page of our history? Who will deny him that great
praise, so justly his own by reason of his great services and terrible
suffering? History will be incomplete without according
him her brightest page; and as long as we live to recount deeds
of valor and heroism on the battle-field, will live the names of
Lee, Longstreet, and “Stonewall” Jackson. Who that was at
Gettysburg, Spottsylvania, and the Wilderness, when the earth
rocked with the tramp of armed men and the roar of battle
resounded almost to heaven, would deny him this mead of praise?</p>
<p>In all these was General Longstreet a prime warrior, a conspicuous
actor. He rarely, if ever, was defeated. He planned
his marches, battles, and retreats with a strategy little less than
transcendent; and when he made a stand he placed his back to
the rock and bid defiance to his enemies.</p>
<p>He was to Lee what Ney was to Napoleon, a guide, a friend,
and a confidant.</p>
<p>I cannot pass this occasion without recalling an incident at the
Wilderness. On the 5th day of May, 1864, General Grant had
devastated the entire country from the Rapidan River to Fredericksburg.
His soldiers were as numerous as the Assyrian hosts.
Hancock’s corps had advanced to the west side of the plank
road that ran through that dismal swamp, and had driven both
Pendor and Heath out of their breastworks, thus breaking
through the centre of our line of battle. It was an awful hour​—​fear
and despair could be seen in every face. In vain did Heath
and Pendor try to repossess their works.</p>
<p>Just at that moment Longstreet arrived on the ground.
Hood’s Texans were in front. Lee came in a gallop to meet
them. With tears in his eyes and his long hair flying in the
wind, he asked, “What troops are these?” “Hood’s Texans,”
was the reply. “Follow me!” he said. When he started to lead
them, a Texan belonging to the First Texas Regiment, commanded
by Colonel J. R. Harding, now of Jackson, Mississippi,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
caught the bridle of General Lee’s horse and turned him back.
Away went the Texans followed by the Mississippi, Arkansas,
Alabama, and Louisiana brigades, and drove the enemy back
and saved the day. This was but one of the glorious acts of
General Longstreet.</p>
<p>Cold Harbor, Seven Pines, Gaines Mill, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg
are not less glorious than others named, and all made
so by the energy and courage of Longstreet and his faithful
soldiers. At the battle of Sharpsburg for a long time our army
was threatened with defeat; our lines began to waver before the
terrible fire of the superior numbers with which we were contending,
when General Longstreet, just from a hot contest on
our left, was brought around to the centre, and for six long
hours he repelled the assailants of this numerous host and “kept
the executives at bay and drove back the Mamalukes of power.”
Forget him? No! The names of Lee and Longstreet will live
as those of Cæsar and Napoleon, and when this physical world
shall have perished, and the heavens rolled together as a scroll,
the names of these men will be remembered.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That in the death of General Longstreet the South
has lost one of her most brilliant soldiers.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That in battles his name was a synonym of success,
and his presence an inspiration to his men, a terror to his enemies.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Camp wear the usual badge for thirty days
and a copy of this paper be sent to his family at Gainesville,
Georgia.</p>

Saturday, January 2, 1904, in his eighty-third year, Lieutenant-General
Longstreet answered his last roll-call. If Alabama<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
had done nothing save to give us Longstreet and Pelham,
she would have done much for herself, the Southland, and for
fame. If with Alexander, Hannibal, and Napoleon, Robert E.
Lee takes first rank among the world’s great generals, surely
General Longstreet may stand with those who occupy second
rank among the world’s great military men.</p>
<p>If Jackson was Lee’s right hand, Longstreet was his left from
Manassas to Appomattox.</p>
<p>Longstreet was a very thunder-bolt of war. When Jackson at
the second battle of Manassas was hard pressed by Pope’s whole
army, Longstreet rushed to his aid and, striking Pope’s flank,
crushed it as an egg-shell in the hand of a strong man. Thus
always and everywhere that Longstreet led, his men hurried to
death as joyously as the bridegroom to greet the bride; where
his flag waved his lines stood as immovable as Gibraltar to the
storms of the ocean, and when he moved forward, there the
enemy were beaten or death and carnage reigned supreme. If
after Appomattox, Longstreet made mistakes, or we imagined
he did, the mantle of death covers them all. Remembering there
has only One lived without fault, they are forgotten, and standing
by his grave we remember only his virtues and the heroism
and skill which made him great in times and places where great
men were thick as fallen leaves in Vallombrosa; therefore be it</p>

tender to his bereaved family our sincere sympathy.</p>

learned courage, promptness, and determination. Its stern lessons
had taught him fortitude in suffering, coolness in danger,
and cheerfulness under reverses. Every Southerner should feel
proud of his record as a soldier.</p>
<p>“While some of those who were associated with him in the
many great battles in which he was a conspicuous figure, have
permitted themselves to engage in some adverse criticism of his
conduct on one occasion only, the officers and men under his immediate
command never for a moment doubted his courage, his
skill, his integrity, his sincerity, or his loyalty to the cause for
which he unsheathed his sword. Nor did the great Lee, whose

January 17, 1904.<br>
</p>
<p>Two weeks ago to-day the wires flashed the news over the
country that General James Longstreet, the soldier, statesman,
and diplomat, died Saturday night at his home in Gainesville,
Georgia. He was born in Edgefield District, South Carolina,
January 8, 1821, hence lacked only a few days of being eighty-three
years of age. He graduated from West Point in 1842, was
in the war with Mexico and brevetted for meritorious service at
Churubusco and Molino del Rey. He was wounded September 8,
1847, at the storming of Chapultepec. He was commissioned
brigadier-general in the Confederate army at the first battle of
Bull Run, in 1861, where he commanded a brigade on the right
of the Confederate army and held in check a strong force of the
enemy in a vain effort to turn General Johnston’s flank; and
from then until the dark day at Appomattox, when the sun of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Confederacy went down in gloom to rise no more, the flag of
“Old Pete,” as he was familiarly called by his old comrades, was
everywhere in the thick of the fight; and he was one of Lee’s most
trusted lieutenants, and every true Confederate soldier will drop
a tear to his memory. He has crossed the dark river and is now
resting with Lee, Jackson, and thousands of others who have
answered the last roll-call, heard the last tattoo, and will hear the
roll of the drum and the call to arms no more forever. Peace
to his ashes and sympathy to his living comrades is our sincere
wish; therefore be it</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the death of General Longstreet takes from
our earthly ranks another of the brave and true, one who was
ever ready to obey the call of duty, as the writers of this resolution
can testify, having followed him through many bloody engagements
where he was indeed a leader whom any might feel
honored to follow. He was as true as the needle to the pole in
every position in which he was placed, whether in civic or military
life.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of these resolutions be spread upon

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we have heard, with deep sorrow, of the death
of Lieutenant-General James Longstreet, late of the Confederate
army.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
<i>Resolved</i>, That in the death of General Longstreet the world
has lost one of her greatest military chieftains, the United States
one of her most illustrious citizens, and the South one who in the
darkest hours of peril boasted him among her noblest and best;
his sword was one of the most trenchant ever drawn in her defence,
and to her is left the proud heritage of his brilliant career.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That as this sad news is flashed around the world, it
is fitting that every ex-Confederate soldier should bow his head
in deep sadness as his bier passes us to the silent city of the dead.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That as our great comrade has obeyed his last tattoo,
and after a long and useful life has gone to peaceful rest, where
war’s dread alarm is heard no longer, that we pray the reveille
of resurrection morning will wake him to receive a crown of
glory brighter far than heroes ever won in the battle-field.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we, his comrades in arms, tender his noble wife
and family our genuine sympathy in their sad bereavement,
assuring them that a grateful people will lovingly cherish the
proud military record of this wonderful soldier.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of these resolutions be mailed to Mrs.
James Longstreet, and copies be delivered to the press.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Commander and Comrades</span>,​—​Your committee appointed
at the last meeting of this Camp to draft resolutions expressing
our sorrow and grief at the death of Lieutenant-General James
Longstreet, respectfully report as follows:</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Longstreet was the commander of the
First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, and the last survivor
of the great warriors upon whom that rank was first conferred
when the Confederate armies were organized into corps.
He was known as the “Fighting General,” and, with the exception
of the battle of Chancellorsville, was with General Lee in all
his campaigns from the Seven Days’ fight around Richmond
until the war ended at Appomattox, save only when incapacitated
a few months by wounds received in the battle of the Wilderness
in 1864. He was loved and respected by his soldiers, and the
surviving veterans of his corps have always honored their leader
and are mourners at his grave.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we who knew him and followed him through
the dangers and trials of protracted war claim the privilege of
paying our tribute of heartfelt sorrow to the memory of our
dead commander.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>

<h3>(<i>J. E. B. Stuart Camp.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“General Lee leaned on him as a strong arm of defence.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>In the death of General James Longstreet passes away one of
the most prominent generals of the Southern Confederacy. He
was born in Edgefield District, South Carolina, January 8, 1821.
When ten years old, in 1831, he moved with his mother to Alabama,
and from this State he was appointed to the United States
Military Academy, from whence he graduated in 1842. He was
assigned to duty at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, in 1842–44;
on frontier duty at Natchitoches, Louisiana, 1844–45; in the
occupation of Texas, 1845–46; and in the war with Mexico.
Here he was wounded, was promoted several times for gallantry,
his courage being observable on all occasions. He faithfully
discharged his duties as an officer of the United States until
June 1, 1861, when he resigned and entered the service of the
Southern Confederacy. His career is well known to his comrades,
and is a part of the glorious history of our Southern cause.
He was a brave soldier, a superior officer, brave and true, and
one of the hardest fighters of the Army of Northern Virginia.
General Lee had implicit confidence in him, and leaned on him as
a strong arm of defence in the most desperate fighting and
splendid generalship. Longstreet was a man of the front, where
he stood to execute orders the most difficult and hazardous, and
did not lay aside his sword until his leader surrendered his shattered
forces, until there was no more fighting to do. He was
cool, deliberate, and yet generous. It became an acknowledged
fact that where Longstreet and his brave men were, was sure
and desperate fighting. He stood in line of battle ready for
engagement when the surrender came, loosening his grip on
his faithful sword only when the war had ended.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
We honor him for his works’ sake, and bow our heads in
memory of his wonderful achievements, his devotedness to duty,
and love for our great Southland.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this memorial be spread upon the minutes of
this Camp, a copy furnished the family of our deceased comrade,
and a copy furnished such papers as may wish to publish the
same.</p>

<p>Your committee appointed by Horace King Camp, No. 476,
U. C. V., Decatur, Alabama, to prepare resolutions expressive of
their profound sorrow at the death of Lieutenant-General James
Longstreet, of Confederate army fame, beg leave to <span class="locked">report,​—​</span></p>
<p>First, That in General Longstreet’s death we have lost one of
the bravest generals who fought on either side of the Civil War​—​one
whom the great Lee called the right arm of the Army of
Northern Virginia. He was one of the most persistent and determined
fighters that any country ever produced.</p>
<p>Second, He was independent, self-reliant, watchful, devoted
to the cause he espoused. He never flinched from unexpected
difficulties, and showed his readiness to die at his post if need be.
He was a man of superb courage. “He not only acted without
fear, but he had that fortitude of soul that bears the consequence
of the course pursued without complaint.” In the presence of
death, the good man judges as he would be judged. In the grave
should be buried every prejudice and passion born in conflict of
opinion. Fortunate are we, indeed, when we become great
enough to know and appreciate the great. Longstreet was brave
enough to follow the path of duty as he saw it, no matter where
it led. In speaking words of love and praise over his grave, we
honor ourselves. May we with gratitude remember the good
that he has done. May he rest in peace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>

<blockquote><div>
<p>“A noble, heroic, and spotless soldier.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>“I was a member of Longstreet’s corps for three years,”
said General McGlashan, in the preface to his resolutions, “I
followed the fortunes of that corps, served with it, saw its work,
saw its sufferings, its victories, and its grandeur of behavior on
every battle-field from Seven Pines to Appomattox, for I was
fortunate enough to be wounded at only one fight, and if any one
in so humble a position as I was could say anything about
his leader, I think I can.</p>
<p>“You all know the reputation of Longstreet’s corps; you
know the glory of its service and what it accomplished on many
battle-fields, and you cannot dissociate General Longstreet from
the glory and reputation of his corps.” General McGlashan was
here interrupted by cheers. Continuing, he said, “We are concerned
with nothing that may have been said of General Longstreet
after the war; we are here to remember him as a great
Confederate general and leader.</p>
<p>“When General Longstreet, in his old gray coat, came to
Atlanta in 1886, Jefferson Davis received him with open arms;
there was no lack of confidence or acceptance there, and it is
not for any others to say what Lee and Davis left unsaid.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
General McGlashan then introduced the following resolutions:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, It hath pleased our Almighty Father to call to
himself, in the fulness of years, our beloved comrade and leader,
General James Longstreet; be it</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That in the death of General Longstreet, we have
lost a true and gallant comrade, an able and victorious leader
of the Confederate hosts in the past, whose deeds are among the
proudest memories of the South; the South a noble, heroic, and
spotless son; the nation a true citizen who reflected honor on
whatever cause he undertook; and the world a great soldier
whose fame will survive with the annals of the Lost Cause.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we extend our deepest sympathy to the
family of our deceased comrade in their great bereavement, and
that a copy of these resolutions be sent them.</p>

<p>This Camp has heard with profound sorrow of the death of
Lieutenant-General Longstreet.</p>
<p>His life had reached the full measure of human probation;
but it was full to the brim of manly principle, heroic service, and
dauntless courage. Loyal to his Southland and to all the interest
committed to him by his country, he maintained his integrity
of character and the unbounded confidence of all right-minded
men to the end.</p>
<p>Tried in the school of civic life and in the crucible of battle,
he filled a creditable page in the fateful and tragic incidents of
the sixties, and then shared all the privations common to his
fellow-comrades in helping to rehabilitate the homes of a people
wrecked by the scourge of civil war.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Attention, Comrades</span>:</p>
<p>When men conspicuous for sublime action, such as heroic conduct,
goodness or greatness, or other lofty attainment are called
to pass over the “river of death,” it is a patriotic duty for surviving
comrades to give expression to their grief. It needs not
the building of a pantheon or vote of a senate to give them a
place among the immortals, to keep alive their illustrious acts
and virtues. Most certainly it is not necessary in the case of
Longstreet,​—​“Old Pete,” as he was lovingly called by comrades
who followed him unflinchingly through four years of
warfare. “Old Pete” is dead, yet he lives in the hearts of his
old corps and will continue to live in history, poetry, and song,
the beau-ideal of a soldier, patriot, and a lover of liberty. Yet
like all men who attain to eminent merit and conspicuous sublimity,
he lived to realize the truthfulness of the poet, that</p>

</div></div>
<p>Such was the fateful experience of our beloved Longstreet, a
corps commander and lieutenant-general in the Army of Northern
Virginia. To him obedience to constituted authority
moulded and shaped the ideal soldier and citizen for his distinguished
life service; and became the reasons for his acts in
rigidly observing his Appomattox parole. We know that he
was one of the bravest of the brave and truest of the true.</p>

<h3>(<i>Cobb County, Georgia, Camp.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“His knightly valor won for him a diadem of glory.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The committee appointed to give some appropriate expression
of its high appreciation, love, and honor for General James
Longstreet, the great leader of Longstreet’s corps, C.S.A., and
of our deep sorrow at his death, and to report and recommend
suitable action by this Camp, respectfully submit the following:</p>
<p>General James Longstreet was a native of South Carolina,
born of an illustrious family, distinguished alike for intellectual
strength and nobility of character. His love for his native State
and the South was inherent and strengthened by associations,
early education, and environments. In keeping with his natural
tastes and fitness for his chosen profession, his education was
completed at the military school of the United States at West
Point, where he developed that strong and wonderful intellectual
power of perception, combination, and comparison, coupled with
cool self-possession, knightly valor, and lofty ambition, which in
the field of terrific war and deadly battle won for him, the armies
he led, and the Southern Confederacy his diadem of glory, as
enduring as the history of the struggles of nations in freedom’s
cause.</p>
<p>General James Longstreet was the friend, comrade, and companion
of the matchless Lee, Generals Joseph E. and Albert
Sidney Johnston, of the incomparable Stonewall Jackson, Leonidas
Polk, John B. Gordon, and the other great leaders of the
Confederate army; and was inspired with the same love of
his native State and the South.</p>
<p>His love for his subalterns and privates of his army was as
true and sincere as that of father to son. Many of the members
of this camp knew him personally in the tent and on the
march, on the battle-field, and in the dreadful charge; heard his
commands, witnessed his noble deeds, and listened to his kind
words of encouragement and sympathy. He was our comrade,
our friend, and our great leader, and there is a sting, a sense of
bereavement, which finds some solace in the flowing tear and the
glorious hope that we shall meet again. He was a Christian
soldier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>
<h4>IN MEMORIAM.</h4>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we regard it a duty which we owe to posterity
that the State of Georgia, all surviving Confederate
veterans, and especially those of Longstreet’s corps, should provide
an equestrian statue of General Longstreet, to be erected on
the Capitol grounds at Atlanta.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a committee be appointed by the Commander
of this camp to inaugurate the movement and take all necessary
steps to secure such a statue.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That Camp No. 763, U. C. V., tenders to the
widow and family of our beloved chieftain our heartfelt sympathy
in the hour of their bereavement and sorrow.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of the foregoing be forwarded to the
family.</p>

<h3>(<i>Atlanta Camp.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“His name and fame are the heritage of the American people.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Atlanta Camp, No. 159, United Confederate Veterans, in the
following report pays glowing tribute to the memory of the
late General James Longstreet, who died on January 2, at his
home in Gainesville, Georgia.</p>
<p>In the death of General James Longstreet, there passed away
a notable and commanding figure of the Army of Northern
Virginia in the late Civil War.</p>
<p>His history and service are indissolubly connected with all
of the great movements of that army.</p>
<p>It would not be within the purview of this memorial to attempt
to even epitomize the part he took in the many great battles.
Coming into that struggle with a prestige and honor which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
shone with brilliant lustre on account of his intrepid bravery
and gallantry as an officer of the army of the United States on
many fields in Mexico, and being withal an educated and trained
soldier, a majestic man, of mild manners and speech and of
leonine courage, his very name throughout the army and the
whole country was a tower of strength. From first Manassas to
Appomattox, his command and leadership held the first place
among the great army corps of the greatest army that was ever
marshalled in this or in any other country. Made a lieutenant-general
in the early part of the war, the conspicuous bravery,
skill, and reliability shown by him in the very crisis of the
battles of Williamsburg and at Seven Pines, and other great
conflicts before Richmond in 1862, won for him from General
Lee the sobriquet of the “Old War-Horse.”</p>
<p>After General Lee had planned the advance on General Pope,
and after Jackson had passed through Thoroughfare Gap to
the rear of General Pope, and when he was heavily engaged
and sorely pressed, Lee and Longstreet were passing through
Thoroughfare Gap. After a spirited contest at that mountain-pass,
Longstreet’s corps moved like a majestic stream on
to the plains of Manassas, where his lines were quickly formed.
Striking the enemy with the “hand of Mars,” the thunder of
his guns greeted the ear of Jackson, giving hope and succor to
his forces as the sound of the Scottish bagpipes heralded the
approach of the relieving column to the beleaguered garrison
at Lucknow. The well-directed assault which he made in General
Pope’s front crowned the Southern arms with complete
victory.</p>
<h4>LOYAL TO THE SOUTH.</h4>
<p>The Southern cause had no more loyal supporter nor courageous
soldier than General Longstreet, as the honorable wounds
and scars which he carried to his death abundantly attest. He
had the unbounded confidence of his commander-in-chief. The
history of that great war gives but one record of Longstreet
being absent from his command, and that was on account of
serious wounds received on the field of the Wilderness in May,
1864, where, in preparing to lead in person his forces against
General Hancock’s corps, he momentarily halted to receive a
word of congratulation from General Micah Jenkins, of South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Carolina, when Longstreet’s own men, mistaking these two generals,
with the little group of horsemen composing their staff
surrounding them, for the enemy, fired, killing General Jenkins
and wounding General Longstreet in the throat and shoulder,
from which he was ever afterwards maimed.</p>
<p>We would not omit to mention that in 1863, when several of
his divisions were ordered from Virginia to Georgia to reinforce
the Army of Tennessee, on his arrival in Atlanta, and when
at the old Trout House, at the junction of Decatur and Pryor
Streets, where the old Austell building now stands, he was
called to the balcony of the hotel to speak to the large and
enthusiastic multitude of soldiers and citizens who thronged
every inch of the two streets, he said “I came not to speak; I
came to meet the enemy.” The inspiration of his presence and
this short and pithy declaration called forth from the assembled
multitude the exclamation, “What a magnificent looking
man and soldier.” How well he fulfilled his mission in the
battle of Chickamauga history makes no mistake in its record.
How his forces were hurled against those of General Thomas,
and how his army turned the tide of battle into victory, are too
well known to need repetition. In this battle, like others where
he led, his advance was stubborn and decisive.</p>
<p>He followed with unfaltering bravery and devotion the fortunes
of the Confederacy until the last drama was enacted at
Appomattox, and was a member of the last council of war held
in the woods on the night of April 8, 1865, and was the senior
commissioner, on the part of the Confederate forces appointed
by the commander-in-chief, to arrange the details and terms of
the surrender of that little shattered band which, through fire
and smoke, hunger and cold, had stood by the flag of the Confederacy
through all the trying ordeals of four years’ grim
and bloody strife.</p>
<h4>IN THE VERY FIRST RANK.</h4>
<p>The name and fame of General Longstreet are the common
heritage of the South and the whole American people. The
names of his immediate ancestors are historic and dear especially
to every Georgian. His qualities as a soldier have won for him
the highest encomiums not only of the Southern people, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
from the Northern people as well. All true history, including
that written from an English stand-point, places Longstreet
in the very first rank as to ability and generalship among any
of Lee’s subordinates.</p>
<p>No time nor mere political differences can affect or dim the
lustre of that name. The past is secure, the future is safe. We
can say with all the emphasis that the words import that he
was one of the bravest, truest, safest, and the most devoted of
the Confederate leaders. In the generations to come, when
passion and prejudice shall vanish like the mists of the morning
at the presence of the clear sunlight of truth, Longstreet’s name
shall receive at the hands of the entire civilized world the praise
and honor to which it is justly entitled.</p>
<h4>LONGSTREET AND DAVIS.</h4>
<p>We may be permitted to refer briefly to an incident that
occurred on the occasion of the unveiling of the Ben Hill monument
in Atlanta. Among the many distinguished ex-Confederate
chieftains seated on the platform was ex-President Jefferson
Davis. General Longstreet came down from his home in
Gainesville, clad in the full uniform of a lieutenant-general of
the Confederate army, wearing his sword. Providing himself
with a superb mount, he rode out Peachtree Street to the site
of the monument, and, dismounting, walked unannounced to the
platform into the outstretched arms of Jefferson Davis. As
they embraced each other, they presented a scene worthy of the
brush of a Raphael or a Rubens. Once heroes in common victory,
they were now heroes in common defeat. This was a beautiful
and shining example for all latter day critics.</p>
<p>This silent episode, as if too impressive to be broken, stilled
the vast multitude for a moment, and then spontaneously from
forty thousand Confederate veterans and citizens, the ladies
joining in the demonstration by waving their handkerchiefs,
there went up a loud and continuous shout of applause that
rent the air.</p>
<p>Let us never forget the four years of glorious service rendered
by General Longstreet to the Lost Cause, and let the
South erect a monument to his memory, to tell to future generations
that the South is never forgetful or indifferent to that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
glorious service rendered in the cause for which it fought and
for which many bled and died.</p>
<p>General Longstreet died in Gainesville, Georgia, January 2,
1904, and was buried with military honors on the 6th day of
the same month. A detail from this Camp, as well as detachments
from various military organizations, joined in paying the
last honor to the old soldier.</p>
<p>Touching and beautiful was the kindly sympathy shown his
memory by his neighbors in Gainesville who were bound to
him by ties that no time can sever. Never was a funeral more
largely attended and more universal respect shown to the dead
by the entire community in which he lived. All places of business
were closed. The Confederate Veterans, the public school
children, the college girls, the citizens, all joined in the procession
which followed his remains to beautiful Alta Vista, where
on the crown of the hill overlooking the far-away Blue Ridge
was laid to rest all that is mortal of the old battle-scarred hero.</p>

<h3>(<i>Houston, Georgia, Camp.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“His war structure cannot be pulled down.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>At a meeting of the old soldiers of Houston County, Georgia,
to commemorate the birth of the immortal Lee, and also, by
previous arrangement, to take cognizance and condolence of the
death of General Longstreet, under whom many of these old
soldiers served throughout the war, the following resolutions
were submitted and unanimously adopted:</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That in the death of General James Longstreet
we sustain the loss of one of the most valiant and capable soldier
commanders of the “Lost Cause.”</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That while during the gigantic war and struggle
between the States, General Lee regarded him as almost a part
of himself, “My old war-horse,” in the carrying out and accomplishments
of apparently, at times, the impossible against and
over the enemy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
We view him as from behind the guns, and under those conflicts
whose fierceness and terrible results were sufficient to
stagger, and even turn back, the stoutest manhood, yet we
never saw him evince the least fear, turn his back in dishonor,
nor disobey his noble chieftain.</p>
<p>His war structure shows the hand of no ordinary builder, and
cannot be pulled down.</p>
<p>He carved his way through the ranks of the enemy in such
a fashion that they themselves, and their descendants, admire
the man for his great military ability; nor can they be less
thrilled by that chivalry and Americanism he and so many
others, equally valorous and capable, displayed and forged for
conscience’ sake, thus awakening and holding the world as never
before in any age.</p>
<p>This was General James Longstreet as we saw him then, and,
without superficiality, as we see him to-day, through our vanishing
memories and waning manhoods, one of the greatest soldiers
who crossed swords with the many gallant spirits of the other
side​—​brother Americans​—​over a principle which did not, and,
thank God, could not die​—​a gift of God to humanity to stand
for the right, fight for the right, and die for the right, even
though in failure, that others may profit by it.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we regret to have to antagonize and reprove
even one Chapter of that great, good, and soulful organization,
known as the Daughters of the Confederacy, but we can neither
endorse the spirit and sentiment, nor the statement made by that
Savannah Chapter that “General Longstreet disobeyed General
Lee’s order at the battle of Gettysburg.”</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we believe, and would advise, that the life
and future good of that great organization lies in the thorough
education of its Chapters to correct history, and a proper appreciation
of the spirit and tenets of the order​—​a proper
observance of its constitution.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to Mrs.
Longstreet, carrying with it, as it does, a sympathy, love, and
sorrow such as only can be given by old soldiers bronzed by
the same smoke, buffeted by the same battles, and scarred by the
same fury through which he passed for the love of home and
country, for the love of truth, and for the love of a “cause”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
then dearer than even life itself, and for which so many gallant
spirits went down.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the <i>Home Journal</i> be requested to publish
these proceedings.</p>

<h3>(<i>Survivors of Longstreet’s Corps.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“History will give him that which is due.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Another set of resolutions, showing the esteem in which
Longstreet’s men held the dead general, and the love that they
bear for him, were drawn up yesterday by Mr. A. K. Wilson,
who was a member of Longstreet’s corps, and were signed by
the veterans in the city, who, like Mr. Wilson, had been followers
of the dead leader. The resolutions were as follows:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comrades</span>,​—​Our comrade and our leader has left us. He
has gone to join the hosts on the other side of the great river,
and we that followed him at the Manassases, Thoroughfare Gap,
Yorktown, Fairfax, Falls Church, Munson’s and Upton’s Hills,
the Wilderness, where he received that wound said to be from
his own men; Williamsburg, Sharpsburg, to Tennessee;
Chickamauga, Knoxville, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge,
back to Virginia, and on all the great fields on her soil, testify
to his worth. With his corps back to Virginia, see him as
he appeared at Petersburg, and countless other places of trust.
Lastly, with his ragged, half-starved, barefooted remnant,
bearing scars as he bore them, see him as he approaches Appomattox,
his men drawing but one ear of corn for a day’s rations.</p>
<p>My comrades, he needs no emblems. History in time will give
to him that which is due, and those that were with him, his

services at Appomattox show to the world that he was ever faithful
to his enlistment and true to the cause that he espoused, and
his parting with Lee establishes that fact. Now, be it</p>

to his bereaved family our heartfelt sympathy, showing
the love and esteem that we had for our dear old leader.</p>

<h3>(<i>Camp Hardee.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Longstreet more often than any other subordinate was trusted with
independent commands.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="in0"><i>To Camp Hardee, Confederate Veterans, Birmingham, Alabama</i>:</p>
<p>Your committee, appointed to report resolutions commemorative
of the life and service of the late Lieutenant-General
James Longstreet, recommends the following:</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That in the testimony of the estimate of old soldiers
of his life and services to the South in the great war
between the States Camp Hardee adopt the following statement:</p>
<p>General Longstreet, a South Carolinian by birth, a graduate
of the West Point Military Academy as a cadet from Alabama,
while assured of position in the Federal army, resigned the
commission he held in an established service to enter the unorganized,
poorly equipped army of the Confederacy, and undertook
all the arduous duties and dangers of that war, and
fought it out to the disastrous end.</p>
<p>From the time of his appointment as brigadier-general under
Beauregard along the line of Bull Run Creek, in July, 1861,
to the surrender at Appomattox in April, 1865, he was distinguished
as a stalwart, skilful commander and a gallant soldier.
He was remarkable for staying qualities rather than for dash.</p>
<p>In all that brave service there was nothing spectacular, but
he was always steadfast, true, and reliable.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been said of General Longstreet, it is
remarkable that at no time for inefficiency or the absence of
results or disobedience of order was he relieved of his command.
No other subordinate was so often intrusted with independent
and difficult enterprises. Now that death has silenced all complaints
and the great commander has gone to his reward, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
who survive him desire to crown his memory with the degree
of praise which his great deeds wrought in behalf of his people
so richly deserve. As a soldier he was wholly faithful to the
South, and for that fidelity merits the grateful appreciation of
our people. Such a great soul needs no defence. Time will
cover with its mantle whatever has been charged as his faults.
It may be that in the great conservatism of his nature he saw
more clearly what was best for his country. In this hour of
bereavement let us only remember that a great and gallant spirit
has gone to his reward; and therefore,</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this memorial be spread on the minutes of
the camp, and a copy be sent to the widow of the dead general
with the assurance, in this hour of her great bereavement, she
has the sympathy of Camp W. J. Hardee.</p>

<h3>(<i>Camp No. 135.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Hardest fighter in the army.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Comrades, we assemble to pay tribute to the memory of
Lieutenant-General Longstreet, one of our great chieftains.
For him “taps have sounded,” “lights are out,” and “all is
still.” This fearless leader is gone. He was the “hard fighter”
of Northern Virginia, and his opponents always knew when he
was in their front or directing the assault. He had the confidence
of his men, and they loved him. He led them but to
victory. The South admired and trusted him. His name is
enshrined with that of the Army of Northern Virginia, and
when her history shall be gathered and cast into final form,
honorable will be the place assigned to our great general.</p>
<p>We would therefore recommend the adoption of the following
tribute of esteem and respect:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Lieutenant-General Longstreet recently passed
away at his home in Gainesville, Georgia, and was buried amid
the regrets and tears of many who had gathered from different
parts of our Southland to pay the respect due his illustrious
name; therefore be it</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
<i>Resolved</i>, That we bow our heads unto Him who is the author
and finisher of our career, and acknowledge that, while we can
not always understand, yet we know that He doeth all things
well.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the comrades of Camp No. 135, Confederate
Veterans, have heard with sorrow and regret of the death of
this brave general and fearless commander.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, Educated in the profession of arms, he gave the
best years of his life to the service of his country. For twenty-five
years prior to the action which necessitated his State severing
her connection with the Union, he most valiantly drew his sword
in her defence. Through the Mexican War and during the
continuous troubles with the Indians on our Western plains his
services were so conspicuous for gallantry that he attained the
rank of major.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, When his State could no longer remain in the
Union, but withdrew, he resigned his commission, and cast his
lot with that of his State. As he had been gallant and successful
in the army of the Union, he now became more so in
the army of the Confederacy. The enlarged opportunities furnished
what his great ability needed. From the rank of major
he rose rapidly to that of lieutenant-general and second in command
to our peerless Lee. As brigadier-general at Manassas he
engaged the left wing of the enemy with the result that is
familiar to all of us. As major-general he was selected to
cover Johnston’s retreat in the Peninsula. He won Williamsburg
and was at Seven Pines. For his service in the Seven Days’
fight around Richmond Congress rewarded him with the rank
of senior lieutenant-general and second in command of all the
Confederate forces. He was at the second Manassas with Jackson,
and at South Mountain. At Sharpsburg he was knighted
“War-Horse” by his chieftain. Fredericksburg, Gettysburg,
Chickamauga, and the Wilderness felt his presence; while Petersburg,
Five Forks, and Appomattox beheld his gallantry. Comrades,
we knew him, we loved him, we trusted him. To-day we
would pay him his tribute; believing him to be worthy to be
placed beside Lee, Albert Sidney and Joseph E. Johnston,
and Jackson.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That these resolutions be spread upon the minutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
of our Camp, copies be furnished each of our county papers
for publication, and that a copy be sent to Mrs. Longstreet,
together with expressions of our sympathy by the adjutant.</p>

<h3>(<i>Tennessee Division, Daughters of the Confederacy.</i>)</h3>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“Mankind will find no brighter page of history than that written by
Longstreet’s corps.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Resolutions of the Tennessee Division of the Daughters of
the Confederacy:</p>
<p>Entered into rest January 2, 1904, at his home in Gainesville,
Georgia, surrounded by his family, consisting of his wife and
five children, at the ripe old age of eighty-three years, Lieutenant-General
James Longstreet.</p>
<p>A graduate of West Point, one of the heroes of the Mexican
War, where he was desperately wounded, in storming Cherubusco,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
and where he was twice brevetted for gallantry on the
field of battle,​—​once as captain, for Churubusco, and again as
major, for Molino del Rey,​—​a professional soldier in the army
of the United States, the highest in rank from the State of
Alabama at the time of the secession of that State, he resigned
from the United States army, tendered his sword to Alabama,
and from thenceforward was identified with the South in her
immortal struggle for the right of local self-government, guaranteed
to her in the Constitution of the United States, and as
laid down in the Declaration of Independence, from Bull Run
to Appomattox, and, at its close, was recognized as “the left
arm of Lee.”</p>
<p>Since his death, his record as a soldier has been criticised, at
a time when he cannot defend himself, but we congratulate
the people of the South and the future historian that the
Congress of the Confederate States, February 17, 1864, passed
unanimously resolutions thanking Lieutenant-General Longstreet
and his command for their patriotic services and brilliant
achievements in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Georgia,
and Tennessee, and participating in nearly every great battle
fought in those States, the commanding general ever displaying
great ability, skill, and prudence in command, and the officers
and men the most heroic bravery, fortitude, and energy in
every duty that they have been called upon to perform.</p>
<p>This resolution was approved by Jefferson Davis, and was
adopted on the recommendation of the commanding general of
the army of the Confederate States of America, the immortal
Robert E. Lee. After the adoption of these resolutions, nothing
which we can say could add to his soldier’s record. He needs
no defence. We consign his name to history; so long as mankind
reads it, they will find no brighter page than that written
by Longstreet’s corps.</p>
<p>He illustrated the South in a long life, the best years of it
devoted to her and her cause, he sacrificed to serve her as much
as any other one man, he fought a score of battles for her, and
never one against her, and this State, over his grave, mingle their
tears with those of the people whom he served and the devoted
family who survive him; therefore</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Army of the Confederate States of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
America is rapidly passing to the Great Beyond, leaving a record,
a part of the history of the American people, to which we point
with pride, and to which in a few generations civilized man will
look, and admit that it illustrated the highest type of American
citizenship.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That we extend our sympathies to the surviving
family of General Longstreet and to the South, at his death, and
that a copy of the foregoing preamble and resolutions be furnished

fairness, having participated in the battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
in Pegram’s battery, A. P. Hill’s corps, and knowing,
from frequent visits to that sanguinary field since the engagement,
something about what occurred on that eventful occasion,
I can confidently say that General Longstreet and those under
him performed such grand and magnificent service on that
battle-field as to give it the great and important place it holds
in history to-day. We never knew that it was otherwise questioned
until after the war. Future history will vindicate his
character in his course on that field and everywhere else where
duty called him during the eventful period from ’61 to ’65.​—​<span class="smcap">John

<h3>(<i>John Bowie Strange Camp.</i>)</h3>

<p>“Those who followed Longstreet in the fitful fever of war ever had
confidence in his ability, courage, and fidelity.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p>The John Bowie Strange Camp of Confederate Veterans of
Charlottesville, Virginia, assembled in special meeting for the
purpose, desire to spread on their record a tribute to the memory
of James Longstreet, lieutenant-general in the armies of the
Confederate States, whose death has been recently announced.
The Virginians who served under him in the great Civil War
recognize his splendid ability as a corps commander, his dauntless
courage, and the absolute confidence reposed in him by that
immortal band of Southerners who will go down in history
wreathed in immortal fame as Longstreet’s corps in the Army of
Northern Virginia. This camp, a large proportion of whose
members belonged to regiments and organizations led by him in
the Virginia campaigns, wish to record the fact that whatever
criticisms may have been passed upon his conduct on crucial
occasions, yet those who followed him in the fitful fever of war
ever had confidence in his fidelity, his loyalty, and his devotion
to the Southern cause; and along with other comrades from the
South who followed him on the line of danger, they had absolute
faith in his splendid courage and ability as their commander.
It is an historical fact that he so possessed the confidence of our
immortal leader, R. E. Lee, the commander-in-chief of the Confederate
forces, that he continued him in command as lieutenant-general
until the fateful day of Appomattox, when in the expiring
crisis of the Confederacy Longstreet and his corps of
Southerners were in line of battle, ready and willing to risk and
lay down their lives in defence of the South, until ordered by
their great chieftain to sheath their swords, stack their guns,
and furl their flags.</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of these resolutions be published in the
local papers and also be sent to the bereaved widow of this distinguished
Southerner.</p>

<p class="in0">My dear Mrs. Longstreet:</p>
<p>Permit me to subscribe for the book you have just written,
on the work of your gallant husband. General Sickles
has just called my attention to the fact that the book is to
be published. Not only must all Americans hold high the
memory of your husband as one of the illustrious captains of
the Civil War, but they must hold it high particularly because
of the fine and high-souled patriotism which made him, when
the war was ended, as staunchly loyal to the Union as he had
been loyal to the cause for which he fought during the war
itself. In his letter to General Sickles, in speaking of
the part the General played in winning the victory of Gettysburg
for the Union cause, General Longstreet wrote:</p>
<p>“It was the sorest and saddest reflection of my life
for many years; but, to-day, I can say, with sincerest emotion,
that it was and is the best that could have come to us
all, North and South; and I hope that the nation, reunited,
may always enjoy the honor and glory brought to
it by that grand work.”</p>
<p>This is the spirit that gives us all, North and
South, East and West, the right to face the future with
the confident hope that never again will we be disunited,
and that while united no force of evil can ever prevail
against us.</p>
<p>With great regard,</p>
<p class="sigright">

but I have long been interested in the story of your brave husband,
and especially in that part bearing on the battle of
Gettysburg. I am a Canadian by birth, though a naturalized
American citizen, and pastor of the Christian Church in this

truth and give honor where honor is justly due. I had read
General Gordon’s strictures, and was anxious to see what could
be said in reply. After reading your article in the Courier
Journal with great care, I want to say that General Gordon is
completely and fully answered and his statements of fact absolutely
refuted.</p>
<p>The man who would find the Rev. Mr. Pendleton after the
facts you have covered him with, would need a divining rod
or a diving-bell. <i>He is disposed of forever.</i></p>
<p>Your illustrious husband belonged to the class of Southern
men which I have always honored and venerated. With him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
war was over and the great heart which never knew fear had in
it nothing but kindness for all that was American. I feel that
I have suffered a great loss in not knowing him personally. I
drop a tear of sympathy with you in his memory. I think the
following lines on “Gettysburg” most fitting now:</p>

<p class="in0">My Dear Mrs. Longstreet</p>
<p>Permit me to
offer you the tribute of my deep
and sincere sympathy in the great
sorrow which has come to you
in the death of your beloved
husband, Gen. Longstreet.</p>
<p>To none is the
sad occurrence the bearer of so
pain &amp; grief, as it is to you.</p>
<p>I pray God to console you,
&amp; to lead you more &amp; more to see
in the departure of your husband
from earth the will of Heaven, &amp;
the passage of a christian Soul
from the land of trials to the final
home of rest and peace.</p>
<p>Truly a great man
has passed away. The whole
country mourns. He was a
noble American. In war he
obeyed what he believed to be
his duty, in peace he followed
loyally and courageously what
he again thought his duty
dictated. The South found
in him a defender on the
field of battle, &amp; its truest
friend &amp; counsellor when the
field of battle had spoken its
verdict. The North, forced
at one time to admire his
skill and bravery, willingly at
later date, admired his
magnanimity &amp; his high
minded patriotism.</p>
<p>It has been a great
privilege of mine to have met
Gen. Longstreet, &amp; to have been
able to know more intimately
than otherwise would have been
possible to me.</p>
<p>Since then he was
a proud Servant of the Lord​—​always
ready to hearken to the
voice of Conscience, always
prompt to obey it.</p>

<p>As a Confederate soldier who followed the banner of the lost
cause for four years I desire to extend to you personally my
heartfelt sympathy in this great loss to you. I was in the
Army of Tennessee, but a great admirer of General Longstreet.
I had a brother in his command under General Hood.
The Southern people never treated General Longstreet with
that respect that was due him. He was General Lee’s bull-dog
fighter during the war, and remained true to the cause until
all was lost. I read with great interest your defence of your
husband in the Gettysburg affair, and you show to any fair-minded
people that he was not in any way responsible for the
loss of the battle. I greatly admire your courage and fidelity
in this matter. General Longstreet has many strong friends
in Texas. Please pardon me for the liberty I have taken in
writing you. I have two letters from General Longstreet which
I value highly.</p>

Longstreet, I felt compelled to address to you an expression of
sympathy.</p>
<p>It so happened that soon after the close of the Civil War, he
and I were for a time guests at the same hotel in Washington.</p>
<p>I then formed his acquaintance and had a series of conversations
with him, which constitute pleasing recollections to me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Although of Northern lineage and sentiment, I learned to
admire a personality that seemed so charming in civil life, and
which I had learned to dread in war.</p>
<p>I am aware that later he fell under the severe displeasure of
many Southern people.</p>
<p>I know nothing of that for which he was blamed, but it
would make too heavy draft on my credulity to believe that he
ever departed from what he believed to be just and honorable.</p>
<p>I well remember an expression he made to me. He said, “I
conscientiously did what I deemed my duty while the controversy
lasted, and when the fate of war compelled surrender, I accepted
the situation in good faith.”</p>
<p>His widow must greatly feel the loss of one who was great
as a soldier and so lovable as a man.</p>

you, and again express the high appreciation I entertained for
your illustrious husband.</p>

<p>I was greatly shocked to
see the enclosed article in
this mornings paper. Tho’ I
had learned sometime ago
through friends, that General
Longstreet was not in good
health, I had no idea that
the end was so near. The
dear old General was one
of the earliest and most
cherished friends of my father
and mother, and has always
held a warm place in
the hearts of the children
of Julia Dent and Lieutenant
(later, General &amp; President of the United
States) U. S. Grant. Be assured,
my dear Madam, that I join
with you in mourning the passing of the
good friend, the brilliant
soldier and the noble man,
General James Longstreet</p>

<p>General Longstreet’s fame is safe with all fair-minded men,
but it is the duty of us, who knew him and served under him,
to raise our voices in his defence, now that he cannot do so, as
he formerly so ably and conclusively did, and I here make my
defence of the charge that he failed to do his duty at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>If it is true that General Longstreet betrayed General Lee
at Gettysburg, and that General Lee knew it, the legitimate and
logical conclusions are that General Lee was a traitor, not only
to the Confederacy, but to every man who served under him.
All know that at Gettysburg Lee staked an empire on Longstreet’s
corps, and all know that when it rolled back from those
bloody heights, leaving its bravest and its best cold in death
upon its grassy slopes, that the sun of the Confederacy, with
battle target red, slowly sank into the bosom of eternal night.
And to say that General Lee knew that General Longstreet was
responsible for the loss of the battle, responsible for the death
of so many brave men who had there died in vain, responsible
for the ruin of a cause dear to so many hearts, and then permit
the man who had brought all this about, to remain as the commander
of the First Corps of his army, to lovingly speak of him
as he did as his right arm, to send him in two months after the
battle of Gettysburg in command of his corps to save the Army
of Tennessee from the ruin brought upon it by the inefficiency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
of Bragg, to permit him to remain throughout that long and
dreary winter that he spent in East Tennessee, to bring him
back to Virginia and be his chosen lieutenant from the Wilderness
to the banks of the James, and from the James to Appomattox,
is to convict General Lee of a treason to both himself
and his country, more damnable than that which so-called admirers
of General Lee charge upon Longstreet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,​—​Enclosed I send you the <i>Picayune</i> comment

commander.</p>
<p>General Longstreet is blamed for the mistake of General Lee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
in charging the heights of Gettysburg. The same mistake was
made by General Burnside at Fredericksburg; which clearly
proves that American soldiers can not successfully charge
heights guarded by Americans. That is settled.</p>
<p>Why should General Lee send General Longstreet to Chickamauga
immediately after Gettysburg, if Longstreet had been
guilty of anything that his enemies so persistently accuse.</p>
<p>The only thing that General Longstreet was guilty of was
the acceptance of office under the United States government
after the war. Now suppose all the Confederate generals had
accepted office as he did, would it not have effectively kept the
office-holders placed here by the carpet-bag government out of
power? And also, how many ex-Confederates refuse office
under the United States government to-day, is a question I
would like to have answered. Longstreet was too big a man
for his day, that was all.</p>
<p>The scribbling of unscrupulous parties can not dim his fame.
He was the hardest fighter of the Civil War, participant in
all the battles of the Army of Northern Virginia, and victor on
the only great field won by the Confederates in the West,
Chickamauga.</p>
<p>I deeply sympathize with you, as I know all of Longstreet’s
corps do.</p>

rests now over the river under the shades of the beautiful
heavenly trees, the peer of Hon. Jeff. Davis, General R. E. Lee,
Stonewall Jackson, and others. May his ashes rest in peace.
When I read the announcement of his death in the papers and
your letter it made my heart bleed, and the only comfort I
could find was to weep like a child. I congratulate you on your
well-written defence and complete vindication of my old comrade
and general. I loved him so much, and so long as life shall
last I will cherish a lively recollection of his many noble and
gallant deeds. I was with him on that memorable day, and can
testify that he stood the brunt of the battle on the 3d of July
at Gettysburg. I cannot understand how any pure or noble or
brave man could circulate such false statements against one of
the best and bravest men in our army. But envy is a malicious
foe, always ready to destroy that which it cannot imitate or surpass.
May God comfort and his blessings abide with you and
yours is the prayer of one that entertains the highest respect

<p>If some critics had known his methods as a commander, and
witnessed his powers in battle, as we of his corps did on many
hard-fought fields, and understood his course and motives as a
civilian as his friends did, they would bestow upon him nothing
but words of praise and gratitude. The ranking lieutenant-general
of Lee’s great army, he always had the confidence of
the commander-in-chief and the respect and admiration of all,

brought the above tribute from the Veterans to the attention
of the Sons of Veterans.</p>
<p>In a graceful speech he referred to this beautiful testimonial
from the Grand Army of the Republic to the memory of a

footsteps of the fathers in all things attesting the spirit of a
reunited nation; that it was the pleasure of the sons on their
own account and in the light of history to testify to their
enthusiastic appreciation of the valorous deeds of General
Longstreet on the battle-field, and his equally commendable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>

the matter be referred for further official action and endorsement

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>
<div class="footnote">
<p><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_A" id="Footnote_A">A</a> Hood says, “As soon as I arrived upon the Emmitsburg road I placed
one or two batteries in position and opened fire. A reply from the enemy’s
guns soon developed his lines. His left rested on or near Round Top, with
line bending back and again forward, forming, as it were, a concave line,
as approached by the Emmitsburg road. A considerable body of troops
was posted in front of their main line, between the Emmitsburg road and
Round Top Mountain. This force was in line of battle upon an eminence
near a peach-orchard.
</p>
<p>
“I found that in making the attack according to orders,​—​viz., up the
Emmitsburg road,​—​I should have first to encounter and drive off this
advanced line of battle; secondly, at the base and along the slope of the
mountain, to confront immense boulders of stone, so massed together as
to form narrow openings, which would break our ranks and cause the men
to scatter whilst climbing up the rocky precipice. I found, moreover, that
my division would be exposed to a heavy fire from the main line of the
enemy in position on the crest of the high range, of which Round Top was
the extreme left, and, by reason of the concavity of the enemy’s main line,
that we would be subject to a destructive fire in flank and rear, as well as
in the front; and deemed it almost an impossibility to clamber along the
boulders up this steep and rugged mountain, and, under this number of
cross fires, put the enemy to flight. I knew that if the feat was accomplished,
it must be at a most fearful sacrifice of as brave and gallant
soldiers as ever engaged in battle.
</p>
<p>
“I considered it my duty to report to you at once my opinion that it
was unwise to attack up the Emmitsburg road, as ordered, and to urge
that you allow me to turn Round Top and attack the enemy in flank and
rear. Accordingly, I despatched a staff-officer, bearing to you my request
to be allowed to make the proposed movement on account of the above
stated reasons. Your reply was quickly received: ‘General Lee’s orders
are to attack up the Emmitsburg road.’ I sent another officer to say that
I feared nothing could be accomplished by such an attack, and renewed my
request to turn Round Top. Again your answer was, ‘General Lee’s orders
are to attack up the Emmitsburg road.’ During this interim I had continued
the use of the batteries upon the enemy, and had become more and
more convinced that the Federal line extended to Round Top, and that I
could not reasonably hope to accomplish much by the attack as ordered.
In fact, it seemed to me the enemy occupied a position by nature so strong​—​I
may say impregnable​—​that, independently of their flank fire, they could
easily repel our attack by merely throwing and rolling stones down the
mountain-side, as we approached.
</p>
<p>
“A third time I despatched one of my staff to explain fully in regard
to the situation, and suggest that you had better come and look for yourself.
I selected, in this instance, my adjutant-general, Colonel Harry
Sellers, whom you know to be not only an officer of great courage, but also
of marked ability. Colonel Sellers returned with the same message: ‘General
Lee’s orders are to attack up the Emmitsburg road.’ Almost simultaneously,
Colonel Fairfax, of your staff, rode up and repeated the above
orders.
</p>
<p>
“After this urgent protest against entering the battle of Gettysburg,
according to my instructions,​—​which protest is the first and only one I
ever made during my entire military career,​—​I ordered my line to advance
and make the assault.
</p>
<p>
“As my troops were moving forward, you rode up in person; a brief
conversation passed between us, during which I again expressed the fears
above mentioned, and regret at not being allowed to attack in flank around
Round Top. You answered to this effect: ‘We must obey the orders of
General Lee.’ I then rode forward with my line under a heavy fire. In
about twenty minutes after reaching the Peach-Orchard I was severely
wounded in the arm and borne from the field.
</p>
<p>
“With this wound terminated my participation in this great battle. As
I was borne off on a litter to the rear, I could but experience deep distress
of mind and heart at the thought of the inevitable fate of my brave fellow-soldiers,
who formed one of the grandest divisions of that world-renowned
army; and I shall ever believe that had I been permitted to turn Round
Top Mountain, we would not only have gained that position, but have been
able finally to rout the enemy.”</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
