Concerning General Pickett's Presentiment of
Danger the Night before he was
Wounded at Gaines's Mill
LL last night, my darling Sallie, the spirit of my
dear mother seemed to hover over me. When
she was living, and I used to feel in that way, I always,
as sure as fate, received from her a letter written at
the very time that I had the sensation of her
presence.
.
I wonder if up there she is watching over me, trying
to send me some message — some warning. I wish I
knew.
This morning my brigade moved from its canton
ments on the Williamsburg road and, by daybreak,
was marching along the Mechanicsville turnpike,
leading north of Richmond. The destination and char,
acter of the expedition is unknown; but the position
of other troops indicates a general movement. This
evening we crossed the Chickahominy and are biv
ouacked on our guns in the road in front of Mechan
icsville, from which point I am blessing my spirit and
refreshing my soul by sending a message to my pro
mised wife. I am tired and sleepy, several times to
day going to sleep on my horse.
