GENERAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
Well, it is all over now. The battle is lost, and
many of us are prisoners, many are dead, many
wounded, bleeding and dying. Your soldier lives and
mourns and but for you, my darling, he would rather,
a million times rather, be back there with his dead,
to sleep for all time in an unknown grave.

Soldier

sponsible for the disastrous result of his charge. General Lee,'to
guard against dissensions', requested General Pickett to destroy
both copy and original of his report, substituting another in its
place. This was done.
At this point in the above letter follows an account of the
battle embodying, according to the statement of Mrs. Pickett,
material similar to General Pickett's report to General Lee. Mrs.
Pickett feels that this portion of the letter should be withheld
from publication. It has been accordingly omitted - A. C. I.
