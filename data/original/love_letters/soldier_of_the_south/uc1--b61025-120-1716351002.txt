I
Before Cold Harbor
HAVE just this moment returned from a visit to
the lines, where I have been since early this morn
ing. Today, my precious, has only been a duplicate
of yesterday. Thank God I have at last, if not too late,
gotten a line laid out on my right flank. The 'Ides of
March' are upon us! Grant says he intends taking his
4th of July dinner in Richmond. I have been hard at
work, my pet, trying in every way
with
my
limited
force to strengthen my front. This has been done by
my division, but on the right of my line, towards the
Appomattox, it has been impossible for me to ac,
complish anything, troops have been put in and re,
moved, so often. However, now I know what I have
to overcome, and will try and do it - I hate uncer,
—
tainties.
Your sweet letter of this morning came as a true
messenger of love. I was so very, very anxious about
you. My own wife, keep up your heart bravely, and
think of your husband who lives but for
I
would, my prettice, give any thing in the world —
any thing — to see you
- to see you this evening. God knows, I do
you.
