In which General Pickett, while Recovering from
bis Wound, Writes from his Old Home
T is only when you are here with me, my darling,
that I am not chafing, fretting, under my enforced
absence from
my command. As poor a marksman as
the Yankee was who shot me, I wish he had been
poorer still, aiming, as he must have been, either at
my head or my heart and breaking my wing. He was
frightened, too, I suspect, and had, besides, too much
powder in his load. What did you want with that shot
smoked, burnt coat sleeve? The arm it held is yours,
to work for
you, my love, for always.
Impatient and restive as I am to get back to the
field, letters and reports just received show me that I
am not missed, and that my gallant old brigade is
proving its valor as loyally under its new leader as
when it so fearlessly followed your soldier. It held
Waterloo Bridge against Pope while Jackson crossed
the Rappahannock, and on the afternoon of the 30th
received and repelled the onset of Fitz John Porter,
magnificently clearing the field and winning a victory
for our arms.
The news came, too, this morning of the death of
you
