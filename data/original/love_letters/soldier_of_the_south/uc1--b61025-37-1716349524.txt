## p. 15 (#37) ##############################################

THE BATTLE OF SEVEN PINES
on my right, and at one o'clock at night, under his
orders, we withdrew in perfect form while the enemy
retreated to their bosky cover.
Thus, my darling, was ended the Battle of Seven
Pines. No shot was fired afterward. Oh, how I wish I
could say it ended all battles and that the last shot that
will ever be heard was fired on June first, 1862. What
a change love does make! How tender all things
become to a heart touched by love—how beautiful
the beautiful is and how abhorrent is evil! See, my
darling, see what power you have. Guard it well.
I have heard that
my
dear old friend, McClellan,
is lying ill about ten miles from here. May some lov,
ing, soothing hand minister to him. He was, he is and
he will always be, even were his pistol pointed at my
heart, my dear, loved friend. May God bless him and
spare his life. You, my darling, may not be in sym
pathy with this feeling, for I know you see ‘no good
in Nazareth.' Forgive me for feeling differently from
you, my Sallie, and please don't love me any the less.
You cannot understand the entente cordiale between
us old fellows.'
Faithfully,
Your
Soldier
Mechanicsville Turnpike, June 1, 1862
