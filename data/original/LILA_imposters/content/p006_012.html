Yesterday we ware all on Maryland hights &amp; had nothing to eat &amp; raining an no shelter put when we came home those that we left had dinner ready for us. Brother arrived safely yesterday with Thomas Supple put James Supple never will get hear for he took sick at Winchester &amp; I exspect he will go home, very likely it is good policy in him for I know that he would be scorned almost to death. I would not be in his plase for a fortune or any thing that seems dearer. We all enlisted our servises to day as long as Virginia had need for us. I dont think that we will be released before Three or Four years &amp; if that may be the case we all never can come home. John is well, I think he wrote to you all. I am not surtain. Abraham sends you his love to you.</p> <p>I will hafter bring this uninteresting letter to a close, my health is very good &amp; hope that these fiew lines come to hand you may be enjoying the same blessing.
