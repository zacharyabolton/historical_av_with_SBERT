I then had the bridge carefully reconnoitered and it was reported that no enemy was to be seen, then I sent 3 men with a captain to burn the bridge and ordered the rest of the men to feed their horses 3/4 of a mile off, the men went forward to burn the bridge and had put hay in the mouth of it and set it on fire, when a column of the enemy appeared and fired a volley and their dragoons charged, a messenger at once reported that they were coming and I ordered the men to their horses and told Jordan to front his men -- and I went forward to reconnoitre, when <abbr expan="Jordan">J.</abbr> followed me instead of attending to his men, and the enemy came charging up and firing when our men broke at once except some 3 or four, and a perfect stampede of them took place, the enemy pursuing for 3 miles, every attempt to rally was unavailing, some actually throwing away their guns, many their coats, blankets &amp;c &amp;c -- I never saw a more disgraceful affair -- all owing no <i>[unclear: doubt]</i> to the state of intoxication of some of the men, and to the want of discipline -- One of our men was killed, one wounded and we have not found out how many were taken prisoners -- I went on when I found the men could not be rallied, and looked after the party I had left behind and with them brought up the rear -- most of the others having taken to the woods &amp;c--. The enemy now hold the lower bridge, but we have burned the upper. Our escape was providential considering the panic of the men and the rapid retreat over a rough road. I suppose you all thought you were abandoned when you heard that we had left the Valley, but now you see that we saved the Valley by that very movement, for the enemy at once fell back. We shall be reinforced in a day or two I suppose, and a battle will no doubt be fought before many days, and on that may hang the fate of our country, and I do pray that it may be favorable to us. Gen. Ed. Johnson of Alleghany was here last night and went back this morning, so concert of action will be secured by the union of our Generals in council. The weather is still bad -- very bad and the mud deep, making it very disagreeable for our troops. There was some skirmishing at Yorktown a few days ago -- favorable to us, and I suppose the great fight must soon come off -- The varied success of war has been our fate, and I suppose will be, but of our ultimate success there cannot be the shadow of a doubt if our rulers and people do their duty, and I think they will, though we must be tried in the school of adversity before we use our strength as we ought to -- and be -- willing to be disciplined -- Of course it is not my business to tell what I may happen to know is to be done, for such things should not be made known <i>[unclear: I]</i> am somewhat stiff and sore today from my long ride and exposure yesterday, but am perfectly well -- We are quartered in a house, and therefore are secure from inclemency at night. I am sorry, truly sorry, that Jordan was in such a condition yesterday, and I do not know what may come of it to him, but I am sure the Gen. will see that he is properly looked after -- when Ashby's men are with him they behave gallantly, but when they are away they lack the inspiration of his presence, and being undisciplined they often fail to do any good -- only a few days ago a company of 50 of them were taken prisoners through a lack of care in guarding themselves. The excitement was intense along the line of our march this side of Harrisonburg, and many left their homes -- I suppose they will return now -- But I do not look for quiet for some time to come, the war is only begun and Heaven only can tell what the future has in store for us -- but the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, and he will do right, and if we are right we shall surely prosper, no matter how dark the heavens may now appear they must become brighter, and through the thick gloom I think we may see the glimmerings of a brighter dawn -- God grant it may soon come. Give my kind love to relations and friends, and kiss my spared children for me -- I wish I could see you, but the Gen. says I may not be spared now -- Send this up and let Brother and family read it, as I have not time to write him now though I desire to -- I have been busy all day, though it is Sunday, by order, and may I be forgiven for it. Send your next letter to Staunton, care of Capt. Bell <abbr expan="Assistant Quarter Master">A.Q.M.</abbr> to forward by Gen. Jackson's courier -- if we are not back into the Valley before you get this. I hope the children have gotten well and that all things work together for good -- May God grant that they do and bless you all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
