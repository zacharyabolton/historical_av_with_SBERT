J Lee, that were burned by the order of Hunter, informing them, if they did not comply that we would burn the town -- The demand was made &amp; they laughed at Gen.

There is but one opnion about Johnson -- &amp; the only wish is that he had been captured also -- He did good service in <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> &amp; is a bold dashing fellow, but has no discipline -- Averill got about 400 of our men -- I suppose &amp; when he had gotten them he put back as hard as he could go - - The enemy is said to be moving quite a large force to Harper's Ferry &amp; we know that part of Grant's army is coming this way -- but we have arrangements made to meet them in all directions -- We moved today back to near Winchester to to cover the roads leadingto the passes in the Blue Ridge -- It is very dry here also -- I am sorry it has been so dry at home -- as I heard that it had rained there -- I am glad Mr. Geeding will attend to my horses &amp; will be much obliged to him -- Miss Priss F -- had better dry up -- for <u>I know</u> what the people of Staunton think of Allie -- I can get along without <abbr expan="Handkerchiefs">Hdkfs</abbr> until I get a chance to get mine -- I am wearing some of my flannels -- they are large enough -- I will get you what I can of your list -- I wrote you what I sent in the box -- it will soon get home -- &amp; I enclose a few items that I have now I am delighted that the ribbon pleased you -- for my taste is <u>not</u> good -- Glad Anne is improving -- She shall have the red ribbon for it -- I certainly answered all your queries in my last letter seriatum -- I enclose you a few envelopes &amp; will put in stamps if I can get them before I send -- will try for a cloak -- but the chance is poor I fear -- our money is at such a heavy <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> -- write often -- Love to all &amp; God bless you -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
