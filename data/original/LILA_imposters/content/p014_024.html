H.</abbr> today, but a portion of Hooker's army crossed the Rappahannock, below Fredericksburg, late yesterday P. M. and so we are waiting awhile this morning, to see what it may amount to -- it is, most probably, only a demonstration to try and detain us in our movement, we have no idea that Hooker will cross &amp; move towards Richmond while we are moving in the direction of Washington &amp; today will probably find them back to the other side -- they cannot fool Gen. Lee &amp; I doubt not he is aware of the <u>real</u> movements Hooker has made, despite his feints -- We marched some 22 miles yesterday, and were up at daylight this morning &amp; ready to go again -- it is only 5 1/2 <abbr expan="o'clock">o'clk</abbr> A. M. and yet I took my breakfast an hour ago -- It has been a long time since we came to Fredericksburg -- six months - - yet it has passed rapidly and did not seem half as long as the previous three months of continued marching &amp; fighting -- We were all glad to get away from there -- too many unpleasant memories haunted us there, too many of our noble army had there gallantly met their last enemy -- we hope we shall not be obliged to return there, for the feeling of the army was unanimously in favor of a march, anywhere &amp; for any good purpose, in preference to the lazy life of a summer camp -- </p> <p> We have left many a scar on the face of the once lovely valley of the Rappahannock to tell of our long occupancy -- more than 30 miles of fortifications mark the line of the front and then inner works, of all descriptions, attest the vigor of our intention to use every means in our power to defend our country --wide forests have been swept away, many an old mansion has fallen a victim to the flames or been torn away piece meal by the destroying hand of war -- whose business is, surely, "devastation &amp; destruction" -- O! that his might come to an end -- You asked me in a late letter how I liked Harrison's History -- it does very well until he reaches Manassa -- when he becomes fanciful -- the credit of the Messenger as a <u>literary</u> journal his depreciated considerably --I hope it may revive -- The account of the Mt. Campaign of 1861 is not full enough -- he does not reason any -- only tells events -- If you have an opportunity, tell Mr Lindsey I have concluded not to buy &amp; should have written to him but for the press of business -- Events crowd on us, and this must be the most important year of the war -- I will send you the money to pay Hottle &amp; Marshall's <abbr expan="accounts">a/cts</abbr>, they are some of my old ones that I wish to pay off. I have $100, that I shall send to you by some one in few days &amp; you can pay them off -- I owe Bernard S. Brown at Bridgewater, some $100 -- write to him and see if he will send up and get it -- and I will see that you have the funds. -- I shall send my funds home as I have a chance &amp; what you do not need apply as I told and deposit the balance to my <abbr expan="Credit">Cr.</abbr> in the Valley Bank as <abbr expan="Executor">Exr</abbr> of O. Butcher <abbr expan="Deceased">Decd</abbr> -- I sent you $60-- a few days ago -- I saw Capt. Roberts a few days ago and he said he would send some butter by some of his conscripts -- you can put it in the small bucket -- but you cannot spare that -- I think we shall be able to buy enough in a few days &amp; you keep yours -- but every thing is at sea now &amp; I cannot give you any directions worth following -- so be quiet on the subject -- . You will know why I did not go with Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson's">J's</abbr> remains when you get my last letter. I was away, under orders, when he died, and did not know of it until he was dead &amp; gone. I was mo fault of Gen. Jackson's that I was not commissioned, neither is it that of Gen. Lee for both recommended me, but there have so many been appointed from Va. that it is almost impossible for any one to be appointed from there -- but I am content -- I have the same pay &amp; emoluments &amp; like my place &amp; duties &amp; enjoy the confidence of the commanders -- I am gratified to know that Nelly is a good child and so well attends to her duty in studying &amp; reading &amp; learning the Holy Scriptures -- do not omit the duty of labor too, have some domestic duty for her each day - - it is as important as any thing in the world for a child. I am sorry that Anna has been sic again -- why is it she is sick so much, she has a look that would indicate health --I hope she may become hearty I am glad of the efforts to aid the soldiers, but fear too much time is lost in trying to get people to give -- they ought to do it as a matter of course without any stimulus -- our people are not half no one fourth as liberal as the army is -- it is too bad. I hope Nelly will not be made vain by the parade of a coronation -- it would be a sad thing -- Direct to the <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> of 2<sup> <sup>nd</sup> </sup> Corps, Army of <abbr expan="Northern Virginia">N. Va.</abbr> and it will always find me - Gen. Ewell is our chief -- I have no idea I shall be able to get home soon -- tho' I think of it daily -- The enemy crossed a few over to Fredericksburg yesterday &amp; there is some cannonading here this morning -- what a day may bring forth no one can tell -- My love to all -- write soon -- &amp; May God bless you all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff.</abbr> -- husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
