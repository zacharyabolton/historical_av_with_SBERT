I wrote you a day or two ago, but for fear that you did not get it I will send you a few more. I have been enjoying myself for two days very much. I met with Cousin <i>[unclear: Pit]</i> at the Augusta Springs &amp; she requested me to bring her to this place to see Jim - which I did &amp; by the way I am now in closer with the galls - <u>all</u> <u>on</u> <u>her</u> <u>account</u> <u>however</u>. We are on our way down the valley again, if the Yankees don't make us take the back track. I have not time to write much, as our regiment will soon be up. your friends are all well so far as I know. I have been unwell for two or three days, but since I have gotten into the valley. I feel perfectly well. I suppose it is from the past that I have been associated with the fair sex (at least) to some extent. I hope it may continue to exert that influence. I must close for the present. Will be glad to hear from you often.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours in haste as ever</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony Pastor</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.<br> Our Army will just about get across the river to day. The bridge has been burnt at this place so that it is difficult to get across the river being very high. Cousin Mollie &amp; Pit are both here Many came with John. I suppose they will leave for home this evening. I told pit I would send this by her, but I could give it to John as he may see you first. my love to all the girls &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> the same.</p></div>
