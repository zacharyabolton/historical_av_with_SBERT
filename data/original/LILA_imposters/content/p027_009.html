Evans, Merchant, an "old line Whig," moderate and conservative, is a representative man of the middle class of southern Society, known to have entertained Union sentiments through the war, neither of the above mentioned men held any position whatever under the Confederate <abbr expan="Government">Govt</abbr>.</p> <p>3d John W. Alby, Merchant - an "old line Whig," moderate and highly conservative, has always been in favor of accepting the "constitutional ammendment," held no position under Confederate <abbr expan="Government">Gov't</abbr>, and is perfectly reliable under all circumstances.</p> <p>4th Edward M.

Laborer and is all right.</p> <p>It will necessarily take me several days, and perhaps a week, to obtain the desired information from Highland County, for there are not probably more than one hundred Freedmen in the <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> and they are so scattered, that it will be very hard to ascertain their whereabouts, and select suitable ones.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>F.S. <u>Tukey</u>, <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst.
