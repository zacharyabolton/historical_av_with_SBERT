Oh I. want to see Mary and Tishie so bad I dreamed the other night that I saw Mary I thought she was the most beautiful girl I ever saw, I suppose the little boys and girls that I used to know in <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> have grown to be men and women I would like to see them so much If you ever write to Mary and Tishie tell them I am almost as large as Miss <u>Lizzie</u> <u>Echard</u>, Hugh used to laugh at me so much about being so large. If you are needing any thing, money or clothing, <del hand="h1">we</del> let us know and we will try and get them for you and if any of the boys who are with you need any thing we will help them also. When you are released (and I hope our President will be so kind as to do that soon) you must write and let us know.
