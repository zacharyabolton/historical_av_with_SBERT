I would have written yesterday but there was no one to take the letter to the Post Office, as there was no one at home but myself untill it was too late. Alex is staying with us now he came down the same day you left so we are doing better than we expected. We heard some very bad news yesterday heard that Mr Hupp was killed last Wednesday shot just below the eye and never knew what hurt him. Becca and Sister were over last Friday night Becca is going down to Churchville next week for the cloth and wants me to go down to Aunt Sallies she will have a buggy and thinks it will be a good oppertunity for me. I expect to go over to the meeting tomorow or next day. next time you write let me know whether Davis is there or not &amp; how he is getting along. There was two burials at New Providence last Sabbath Miss Eliza Beard and Mr Culton's child. We are all well. when you write again direct to Greenville as I expect to be over at Pa's. I believe I have told all the news. As Mag is waiting I will have to close. I hope you will get home soon. May God watch over and protect you is the prayer of your devoted Wife</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Ginnie Ott</p></div> <!---->
