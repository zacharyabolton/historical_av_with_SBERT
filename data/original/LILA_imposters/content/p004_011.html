With or without your kind assurance relating to my small claim, I never had &amp; do not now entertain the slightest doubt about your entire willingness &amp; determination to liquidate the same so soon as the state of your finances justify it, and I shall only add on this subject that in as much as I expect to be very much pressed for means during the next 5 4 or 3- months (wherewith to meet my Shenandoah engagements) I know--if at all convenient for you?--it will be as much your compliance to pay as it would be for me to receive the amount of your note between this &amp; the first of March, or as soon thereafter as possible. Your note bearing date the 7th day of October 1857, will be left in the hands of <abbr expan="John">Jno</abbr> D Imboden for the reason that you would not know where to send to me or write me, &amp; at Staunton with the <i>[unclear: clerk]</i> it &amp; its wherebouts will always be thoroughly accessible. Unless circumstances or someclever woman turns my course I expect--if life &amp; health be graciously spared me?--to set off for Kentucky in a week or ten days, for the purpose of making a final tour among old grand mama's Eve's fair descendants, to ascertain whether or not indeed this individual can gather up the scattered fragments of his heart's affections so as to concentrate them upon some one whose charms &amp; attractions ((personal &amp; social)) shall be sufficient to lead me right up to Heymen's altar!! The truth is every day's experience like the atmosphere around is pressing me with the conviction that it is not good &amp; never was designed to be, for man to be alone!! that his living is but a mere animal existence floating upon the surface of things, drifting hither &amp; thither after crumbs &amp; scraps of comfort &amp; having like an old shoe-sole from the wheels of time, droped his mortal <i>[unclear: evil]</i>, he goes down to his last resting place with this appropriate epitaph<br>"Here lies old Bach stone dead<br>Here's his feet &amp; there's his head<br>Where old Bach is &amp; where he <i>[unclear: lairs]</i><br>Nobody knows &amp; nobody cares".</p> <p>Depend upon it my dear sir, as I should have said to my friend the gentleman from <i>[unclear: Cuting]</i>!! at the Hospital I have just lingered on the borders ofsingle-wretchedness long enough to discover that there is not in her wide <i>[unclear: haste]</i> one single oasis on which my eyes or my hopes might rest, and therefore I announce to you, to all the world &amp; the rest of mankind, but rather more of woman kind, that ere long I design to shake the very dust of celibacy off my understandings &amp; take up my line of march gladly &amp; joyously for<br>That land of mixed delight<br>Where Bachelors nowhere tarry<br>Where Hymen's says dispel the night<br>And lead me on to marry!!!!.</p> <p>In reply to your &amp; your wife's kind &amp; generous invitation to call &amp; see you at any time, allow me to say that whenever &amp; wherever my lot should be cast near you I shall esteem it both a privilege &amp; pleasure to fill awhile some corner under your hospitable roof, where many hours doubtless would <i>[unclear: glide]</i> away filled with the memories of the past, comments on the present, &amp; speculations on the future. I think I can sincerely say that within the range of my entire acquaintance or friendship few or none are more esteemed, or whose interests I would sooner turn aside to promote than yours &amp; those of your beloved household, and when I bring my mind to bear upon our wonderful constitution &amp; relation to one another here as well as our connexion with what follows hereafterI am struck with the boundless wisdom &amp; goodness of Him who has created us &amp; placed us here <i>[unclear: protationers]</i>in time &amp; candidates for eternity. All these tender &amp; endearing confessions of life that go to make up <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> much of the sum of human happiness, are so <i>[unclear: little]</i> &amp; liable to be shaped asunder, as to convince us that we should not set our affections upon them for we can not hold to them, nor can life <i>[unclear]</i> be extended to us beyond a fitful fleeting years or months or days. Then indeed <i>[unclear: confident]</i> with the <i>[unclear: divine]</i> injunction, philosophy would point &amp; urge us forward to that land of pure delight where saints immortal reign!! where infinite days exclude the night &amp; pleasures vanish pain!!,, you kindly invoked the divine blessing upon me at the close your letter &amp; returning most heartily the same upon yourself, let me remind you of the truth that the divine blessing can only descend upon any of us within the limits of the Mercy of God. Remember the solemn words of Dr Alexander<br>There is a time we know not when<br>A point we know not where<br>That marks the destiny of man<br>To glory or despair!!!!</p> <p>Present if you please my kindest regards to Cousin Liz &amp; to your beloved children, &amp; hoping &amp; trusting &amp; praying that by Almighty grace you may be enabled &amp; induced to set out NOW!! in the narrow way along which I believe your beloved wife has been journeying &amp; which she with the angels &amp; perhaps a mother in heaven would rejoice to find you!!</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>very sincerely, Your Friend &amp; Kinsman</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>B.
