Crawford having by letter and message repeatedly promised to settle I expected no difficulty with him and Simms who is working in Rockingham <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> is depending upon my collecting but Crawford who is abundantly able to pay evidently does not intend to do so until forced. Of course I cannot bring suit and Simms is not only too poor to do so but he has his little property liened upon for a debt he calculated to pay with this money. Crawford I know would settle with me sooner than be summoned to Woodstock.</p> <p>Enclosed papers please return</p> <p>*James &amp; William Crawford</p> <p>2 enclosures</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="obedient">obt</abbr> <abbr expan="servant">servt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thos.
