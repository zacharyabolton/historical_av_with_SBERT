I have taken some pains to impress the minds of several influential men as to the importance of holding the convention &amp; of inaugurating, &amp; thoroughly organizing the "Opposition Party" in Va, &amp; the South. I spoke to I. S. Gallagher and his <abbr expan="brother">br</abbr> of Charleston Free Press, before your first article appeared, &amp; got them <i>[unclear: unlisted]</i>. They have barbed you up zealously.</p> <p>There is a good article in the Whig of the 11th yesterday, which sounds like your voice.</p> <p>I hope you will have an address prepared, &amp; I shall then be sure it will be just right: sound, moderate, conservative, <u>conciliatory</u>. You are right when you say "we must be content to stand where our fathers stood". That is the only safe ground we <u>can</u> stand on.</p> <p>The course taken by Goggin &amp; Bell, of Ky in their canvasses, has hurt us very much, not only with conservative men at the North, but by creating a schism among ourselves. I can never subscribe to the doctrine that Congress must <u>protect</u> slavery in the Territories; never. We must repudiate that vagary.</p> <p>The democratic Party at the South has run upon a rock upon which they must split the African Slave trade. I am glad to see Phillips, late of Ala, &amp; Reuben Davies M. C. of Miss, coming out against it.</p> <p>Wise, like a man detected in a conspiracy to set fire to a building, has the hardihood to acknowledge his complicity, but rails and bellows in the most furious manner against the <u>rascality</u> of treachery, &amp; the publication of a private letter! He is like a pheasant that makes a great flutter till her chickens have all hid, &amp; then flies away.</p> <p>I have seen "Hancock". His purpose is made apparent. What would the South say to Foot of Vt.? If the North object to Bates, Bell, Crittenden, Reves &amp;c, suppose Va. <abbr expan="should">shd.</abbr> offer, in a spirit of magnanimity &amp; compromise, to take Foot--a <u>nominal</u> republican, but a truly <u>conservative</u> man? I throw out this idea for you to turn over and reflect upon. The North <u>couldn't</u> object to him, &amp; the South <abbr expan="would">wd.</abbr> be safe with him. But he must be better known to some of the "controlling spirits" of the South, before they would agree to this.</p> <p>I do not think Fillmore could be run with any chance of success, such is the bitter &amp; inappeaseable hostility to him on the part of the republicans; hence I mention Foot.</p> <p>I hope you will find your farming and distilling operations pecuniarily successful. I shall be most happy to drink your health in your own "old Wheat" whenever you may afford me an opportunity.</p> <p>I have a small place near this city, around &amp; near which a good many are now buying &amp; building. It is 4 1/2 <abbr expan="miles">ms.</abbr> <abbr expan="north-northeast">N. N. E.</abbr> from the capitol &amp; contains 60 7/8 acres. I shall plant to acres of it grape vines next spring, for which some of it is well suited. Population is pushing out in that direction quite fast.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Believe me most sincerely<br>Your friend &amp; obat</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>N Sargent</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Do not neglect the Whig--keep the public mind astir<br>I do not think that Douglas will be the Charleston nominee, If not, &amp; the <abbr expan="Opposition">Opp.</abbr> are united we shall succeed Hon A.
