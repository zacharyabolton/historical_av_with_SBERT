Baldwin commanding 52nd Regiment Va. Volunteers was recd &amp; he ahs been pressing to get a portion of the Regiment ready to leave by Friday or Saturday. I write to suggest that if it is not <u>absolutely necessary</u> that a portion of the Regiment should leave here on Friday or Saturday, if you will order the whole Regiment to leave here on Tuesday next. I think I can safely say, you can rely on it that our whole Regiment will be at Monterey on the fourth day after Tuesay next. I think it very desirable all should move together. Please answer by return express.</p> <p>Capt. Otey's Company from Bedford Co. is here. A very fine Co. Number 127 men. Waiting here for 4 pieces of artillery and Major Gorgas informs me he cannot get them for three weeks. Would it not be well to have him join you with his Company armed with muskets &amp; his artillery could follow him. Capt. Morrison's Co. is also here from Rockbridge--it can be ready in a few days. The arms for a portion of our Regiment will reach here on Monday from Richmond. Yours very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M.G. Harman Major, Comdg.</p></div> <!----> <!---->
