By the assistance of the Bureau in furnishing lumber, they have been enabled to fit up and repair a building to answer the double purpose of a church and School House which they purchased for the former purpose, and which promises to be of the greatest advantage to them.</p> <p>The amount of suffering among the Freedmen is comparitively small. But in cases where there is Extreme privation and are paupers, the Overseers of the Poor invariably deny such admittance to the Poor House on my application thereby setting a defiance the order of the War Department requiring each County to support its own poor. The County Court has issued an order requiring all of its Officers to assist the Bureau in Serving processes, and which if carried out will be of incalculable benefit to the Bureau.</p> <p>Highland County</p> <p>Transportation has been so limited that I have been unable to visit this County, consequently cannot say much about it.</p> <p>I have learned however that like Augusta County the Overseers of the Poor refuse to receive any pauper Freedmen in the Poor House.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Servt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>F.S.
