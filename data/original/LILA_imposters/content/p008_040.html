I for one lay on the top of the cars &amp; slept, but was nearly frozen all the time. Every thing passed off very agreeably, considering - no accident occuring save one - &amp; that was truly sad. One of <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Roberts men fell off the top of the cars &amp; got nearly killed. he lived about 2 hours after they got him on the train. He was an Irishman by the name of OBryan, the rest of the Irish belonging to the company <i>[unclear: after]</i> we got to Strawsburg got as "tight" as they could get. (This you know is part of their religion, or their rule at least - which they strictly adhere to) Well, I cant say now, how long we will remain at this place or whether we will go into winter quarters - this will depend entirely on the movements of the enemy. It was reported before we left Centerville, that the <u>Yankees</u> were advancing toward this place. That there was a number of them in Martinsburg &amp; <i>[unclear: Romney]</i>. Also Shepards Town. But this has turned out to be false; except at Romney. There are about 5000 at that place &amp; are busily engaged fortifying.</p> <p>I am <u>glad</u> to inform you that I am not as corpulent as you heard, but still remain about the same - but not near so good looking as the Gentleman you spoke of. Lieut M<sup>c</sup> says he <del hand="h1">would</del> certainly would like to kiss <u>that</u> lady &amp; you too. he sends his best love to <u>you</u> &amp; all the <i>[unclear: girls]</i>. Mr Miller has recovered. Says he was in the same fix but you can return my <u>love</u> good wishes, &amp; To Maggie &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> tell them I would like to see <u>them</u> so much, also all the rest. Excuse this short letter, nothing more at present but remain yours as ever</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony Pastor</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Direct to Winchester<br> dont show this is you please</p></div>
