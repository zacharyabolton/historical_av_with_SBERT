I attempted the establishment of a civilian <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> at Harrisonburg but he felt obliged to return with the troops. An order has been received here this morning for the muster out of the 193 <abbr expan="New York Volunteers">N.Y.V.</abbr> now on duty in this Military District, and at <abbr expan="Harpers">H.</abbr> Ferry, and those places in <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Ayers <abbr expan="Districts">Dists.</abbr> are to by supported by <u>one company</u> of Veteran Reserves, which will confine my effective jurisdiction in this part of the Valley to sub-distrcts "D" and "E", and I desire again to express my conviction that it is worse than useless to attempt a continuance of the Bureau in this district, without the presence and support of a military force. The Schools might live but I think it very doubtful.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am &amp;c</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.S.H.</p></div> <!---->
