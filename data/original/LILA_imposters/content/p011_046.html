For a wonder I am quiet this morning with nothing but the usual camp duties to perform. </p> <p>Tom is well, tell his Mother that I have been very much &amp; agreably disapointed with him. When he left Staunton with me I though he would be hard to manage &amp; in truth I thought him little or no account. But I have found him not only usefull, generous and Brave to a fault, But I have found in him a pious regard for the truth, His word when given never braken, a disposition and temper rarely if ever muffled, and for one of his age a Boy that any one might be proud to call their son. In the Ardous &amp; hotly contested fields we have operated on. He has allways been at his Post. And at Brandy Manasas &amp; Poulsville my heart beat with pride, when I saw the flag of my Regiment ever in front &amp; borne proudly in the hottest of the fight by him. Say to his Mother that I will care for him as I would <del hand="h1">&amp; will</del> for one of my Boys if they were old enough to fight for their Countrys freedom. I have made no request of Tom, but that is has been readily granted. He has thrown aside whiskey smoking &amp; tobacco, and I think is trying very hard to be all that you &amp; his Mother would desire him to be. I have not written this to flatter him, but as a just tribute to a good &amp; gallant Boy. My kindest Love to Aunt Mary Jane Addy &amp; the Children By the way the Boys tell me Addy &amp; Gen. Thomson are about making a match, tell Addy she must wait unttil Tom &amp; me can come Home, to enjoy the fun &amp; good things. Cousin Jimmy shall give her a big fuss. Good bye.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your affec nephew</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>Asher W Harman</u></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I saw Asher &amp; Mike Sunday.
