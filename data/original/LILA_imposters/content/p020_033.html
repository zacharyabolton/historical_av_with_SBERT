On the 1st day of the month we were ordered away from our former camp at Swope's Depot (very hurriedly too I assure you), on account of the advance of Yankees to Staunton. And up to that day I was looking for you and felt almost sure you would be there as I knew Mr. Phillips was expecting his wife <u>daily</u> and from what Emeline wrote Jimmy, I took for granted you would accompany her. I felt that you had crossed the river before its rise and would arrive in a few days. I had made arrangements at a private house to board you until I could accompany you to Richmond. She was a widow lady and very kind and was near camp. I wished often after we first moved to Swope's that you had been out for you could have been pleasantly situated with me there for two months. We were camped there over two months and if I had known it would have resulted that way, and I could have obtained a place for you, it would have been so gratifying to have you with me. But so it was and we know not what is best for us, for I believe now it was a kind Providence that interfered with your coming because of the trials and trouble that would have been yours under this recent move of the Enemy. If you were in Richmond there would be no telling how or when you would ever get home, as the Railroad and Bridges are destroyed along the whole line from Staunton to Charlottesville. I have no doubt Mrs. Hooff is very much troubled. She and <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> H. went to <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> 20th of <abbr expan="February">Feb'y</abbr> and was to return also with Mrs. Phillips. I suppose they will be in Lexington now very soon as they will have to come by way of Lynchburg and take Canal Boat or stage to Lexington. The roads though are almost impassable for Stages or wagon. I have never seen anything to equal the roads as at present. The night we left Swope's a great deal of Stores and baggage was thrown off our wagons because we could scarcely get along with an empty wagon. I felt pretty sure the Yankees would get our entire Train and which they would have done if they had sent a detachment in pursuit. I was so well satisfied of it that I tied a change of clothing on my saddle and concluded the balances would be captured in the wagon. It was my intention to stick to the Train until I found there was no way of saving it and then to try to save myself but was fearful I would have also been captured for the night was very dark and we could not tell a Yankee from anyone else. I had my Pocket full of your Letters and I stopped at a fire on the roadside and burnt them all for fear they would get them. This I regretted much for I had designed to keep them until the war was over and lay aside for the perusal of our children in after days. The ones containing the announcement and future reference to the death of our dear little Dan were among the treasured ones and consumed with the balance. We are however all safe once more but after undergoing a terrible time through rain and mud. The waters were very high and in one case as the front wagon containing <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> Rosser's baggage was crossing a large stream near where it emptied into North river, the Bridge gave way and the Wagon and contents, 4 mules and driver (a white man) all went down the stream and have never been heard of since. The last that was seen of them the man had gotten in the wagon and holding on to the Bow and all was going down the rapid stream riding on the water as a boat until they arrived at the <u>Falls</u> (a frightful looking place indeed) when all went over and were never seen afterwards. I felt so sorry for the poor man, for he was a very clever man, had a family and only returned a few days before from his home.</p> <p>Just as I finished this who came in but Mr. N___r with a long Letter from you and the cheese, Sugar and coffee you were so kind as to send me. Oh you don't know how glad I was <u>once more</u> to hear from you for I had imagined you situated under difficult circumstances and may be had started and overhauled by the Raiders - maybe in the Luray valley waterbound, or maybe had arrived in Staunton and could learn nothing of my whereabouts. All these and various other imaginings have been mine since we left Swope's.</p> <p>Before proceeding further I will take occasion to thank you dear Rachel for your kindness in sending me the articles named and allow me to assure you they are appreciated. You are ever good and thoughtful, so characteristic of your noble nature, and God grant that I may be worthy of her who thus lavishes her kindness and pure affections upon me, and in after years when this wicked and cruel war shall end, may I be enabled to show my appreciation of your worth as a pure and devoted wife by renewed exertions to promote your comfort and happiness.</p> <p>You enlist my sympathies in the reference to your <u>sad disappointment</u> in getting off, but as you have ere this seen it was a Kind Providence that ordered otherwise and thus frustrated your plans. If you had succeeded in getting off and been in the neighborhood of Staunton or on the way out during the recent advance of the Enemy your suffering and trials would have been much worse. It was well I think that you did not get off. And as you have often remarked to me "all things are the best," and an opportunity may yet present more desireable and pleasant than the one referred to. For <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> I cannot say when <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> be for the next few months, but I presume in the Valley somewhere about Staunton. But if an opportunity desireable should occur by which you can get to Richmond and choose to remain some time, if I cannot meet you <u>at once</u> I will be most happy to see you soon as I can get there. I <u>suppose</u> the Railroad will soon be fixed up to Staunton again, but cannot tell how soon. I hope if you do come you may have a Lady to accompany you for I question the propriety of Ladies travelling so far alone with a man not related to them. Not that I lack a want of confidence in you - far from it, but because of the ground that it gives for the tongue of slander on the part of malicious, meddlesome persons. It is necessary now more than ever heretofore in my experience in life for ladies to exercise the utmost prudence and discretion in all they do and say. However pure and upright may be the intention and design of persons in the various relations of life, there is at this period of our history more demoralization broadcast in the land than ever heretofore, and persons eager and ever on the alert to suspicion or impute improper motives to the most pure and chaste of our wives and daughters. How necessary then, my dear wife, for the sake of your own spotless and unblemished character and for the sake of the dear little ones, that must inherit your good name, that you exercise the utmost caution and not place yourself in any position or under any circumstances where the keenest scrutiny or the vilest tongue can say aught of your actions or question their propriety in any way whatever. This I know you will do and has ever been the ruling motive of your life, and in this case anxiety and eagerness to see <u>me</u> have to some extent blinded your eyes to any impropriety and overcome the dictates of prudence. I know the anxiety to see me was calculated to make you feel that as <u>you</u> had every confidence in the escort as a gentleman (which I know would have proven to be so), others would have no right to question or impute otherwise. But I have seen so much of the feeling that now pervades the world that I know talk and slander would have resulted therefrom, and for this reason I am truly thankful that you did not accompany Mr. R. If you had another lady to accompany the party there would be less cause for meddlesome persons to make improper censure, but it has always been considered a little beyond the bounds of propriety of ladies to accompany strangers alone, even for a day at a time. But you must recollect that in this case you would have been travelling for 5 or 6 days and probably at night placing yourself in an awkward position frequently during the trip. I am sure your good judgement will not let you censure me for speaking thus plainly on a subject which affects so much the honor and happiness of us both. Oh, my dear wife, you in your purity and excellency of character can form no idea of the demoralization that is now rife over the whole country, and while I thank my God you are thus, so innocent and unsuspecting, yet chide me not for what I have said for it is from the purest emotions of my heart that I am prompted to do so. I have almost become disgusted with Society in the past 2 years, for I have seen so much of blasted reputations. I have known of many excellent and unsuspecting ones ruined and deserted by <u>brass buttons</u> which seem to attract those who unfortunately have a false notion of the framework of society. I know of many instances of ladies deceived by harried men and many more of ruined characters on the part of young men. It all grows out of the eagerness of ladies to take up with anyone and a <u>false</u> idea that they must have <u>Beans</u>. It was but a few days since that another instance came under my observation of a most beautiful and accomplished young lady taking up with a married man, and on an acquaintance of 3 days so much affected at parting with him that she shed tears. And he boasting through camp "that she was the worst sold <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> girl he had seen lately." The army is filled with men who are very on the alert to take advantage of any opportunity to blast the reputation of those not prudent enough to keep and manifest that reserve and dignity which should adorn the female character. I know many instances which I shudder to think of and in one case a female School in this country broke up because of some 20 or more young ladies forever disgraced and ruined by a number of young Soldier beans that encamped in the vicinity last winter. In concluding upon this already too lengthy reference on this subject, let me entreat you, dear Rachel, to pray fervently for me that I may be delivered from the snares and temptations to, and the demoralizing effects of, camp life. I wish to come out of this war with an unblemished moral reputation and with an unwavering trust in the Saviour of Men. I know that the prayers of as good and pure a woman and wife will redound to my happiness and add much to my growth in grace and anxiety to become a consistent Christian.</p> <p>I regret to see that so many of our men have been picked up lately and I assure you I shall not place myself in a position where there is danger. I shall therefore take your advice. Am glad to see you received the Letter by Dr. Settle.</p> <p>I shall await your arrival in <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> and will take no effort to go home, or to Mrs. J.'s either, for I do not think it would be pleasant to go there. I do now know where our whereabouts will be soon, but either about Staunton or down near Petersburg I presume. Most of persons are of opinion we will remain in the Valley. But whenever a good and safe opportunity occurs and you feel disposed to make the effort, do so. Johnny might come up to Staunton in a wagon with you and then lay in a supply of tabacco, etc., for himself and also for you. I am sorry I did not know sooner that you could use tobacco to advantage for I would have sent it long since. There is no telling where an opportunity will now present. But if we remain here will try and get you some down there.</p> <p>I am truly sorry to hear of the death of Mr. Crow under such circumstances. Mr. N___r also tells me that Dr. Kownslor is no more.</p> <p>I notice what you say relative to the ladies that attended the Ball. Words cannot express my contempt for them and I trust that you and all true and right thinking Southern ladies will shun such characters as you would a viper. It almost proves what I have said - that I had not admiration for either of them. And then to boast of the <u>honor</u> of <u>Rank</u> is truly disgusting. Did ladies understand the framework of an army and how constituted there would be less eagerness to think they are <u>honored</u> because of the attentions of <u>stars</u> or <u>stripes</u> in preference to men far their superiors. They should understand and study what makes a man of <u>Rank</u>. It is not superior bravery, or superior qualification mentally or morally, but in 9 cases out of ten intriguing, wire-working deception. Men go up in rank because of the death or resignation of the ranking officer above them. Our army (and I say it to our disgrace) is filled with officers who are drunken, immoral, worthless characters before the war in a majority of cases. It is not the man that makes the officer but the man that honors the office. You people at home and particularly you ladies know nothing of the condition of the world as it exists North and South since this war commenced. There seems to be an entire revolution <u>morally</u> as well as politically.</p> <p>Jimmy is not here at present, having gone off with the <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg't</abbr> across the mountain, but I know he will be grieved to hear of AS. ____s doings. It was his calculation to go about this time to Mrs. J.'s and if Emeline states in her Letter she will be there, I suppose he will go as soon as we get quiet. If so you can arrange probably to come out with him. I am sorry you have not gotten the things from Mrs. J.'s as they would have been useful to you I know. I suppose though you will get them soon. I hope I may get the clothes by some reliable opportunity if you do not come yourself. Rachel, I wish if you have any dark material of very light texture, that you would make me what I would call a <u>gathered waistcoat</u>. That is, it is intended to cover my suspender buttons - gathered around and with a row of neat little buttons running up in front so that I can button close my neck if necessary. I design it for warm weather - have seen them frequently in the army. They are so comfortable and one can dispense with a coat of a hot day. But if you come out I can give you a better idea of what I want and maybe you had better wait. I want one badly this summer for I can thereby save my clothing so much.</p> <p>I am glad to see that the dear little children are improving so much in their studies. Tell Lilly she must learn fast and catch up to Justa so they can be in the same classes. Oh how I would love to see the dear little things. I am glad to see that Oscar is progressing and knows his A.B.C.'s. You mention about the Schooling that you have only a sufficiency of funds for 3 months tuition, but don't stop them for I wrote John several months since to get you some <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> money which he did and I will send just as soon as opportunity presents. I regret that I did not sell my horse the other day for I was offered $100 in gold and silver, which is equal to $5,000 in <abbr expan="Confederate">Confed.</abbr> If I come across the man again will send you the specie. Have you exhausted the money due you for wheat as loaned several persons? If not, try and make them pay you in such funds as you can use <u>at all times</u> or else require them to deliver the wheat where you can obtain such funds for it.</p> <p>Tell the children that if you come out I will send each of them a nice little Book. By the way, are you not going to bring Justa and Lilly or else one of them along? But exercise your own discretion and convenience about it and I shall be perfectly satisfied and lavish more affection upon you if neither one of them are here. Now I expect I have given you an idea and you will <u>of course</u> leave them at home in order to enjoy my society all to yourself. But I should not impute such selfishness to you for I know you are so anxious for me to see them, and will of course take the remark as a joke, as I intended it.</p> <p>You speak of receiving Envelopes without the enclosure of Letters. I suppose they were taken out. Did you receive not long since a Letter containing Bills of Hennie's from the Teacher? I enclosed them with Letters from Lucy as she directed. I am afraid Mr. Louthau did not get them as you mention nothing of it. Joshua says he left the Letter at <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Morgan's.</p> <p>I mailed by way of Lynchburg today the Letters for Lucy and Hennie and Miss Lattie Kerfoot. The others will be delivered and I have not heard from John or Lucy for over 3 weeks owing to the irregularity of mails and movement of Yankees. I will write her to get you the yellow cotton and if <u>she</u> has opportunity to send them all to you. I have no way to keep such things in camp in order to await opportunities. But I shall leave no effort untried to comply with your wishes. I have a Letter from Helen written to you which was sent to Mr. Nunn to forward and Mr. Nunn sent it to me a few days ago, - since he was run out of Harrisonburg - I will enclose herewith. It has reference to the reception of yours containing tidings of her brother's death.</p> <p>Dear Rachel I want much to see you and our dear little children, but unless you feel that your coming out will be attended with no risk, liability or trouble in returning I would prefer to await the result of another summer's campaign with the hope of meeting you satisfactorily. The arrangements and time of coming out I leave entirely with you for I am unable to judge of how that can be affected. Another summer's campaign may find me in delicate health and if it could be so I would prefer to see you while I am now in the enjoyment of good health. There may be many changes and if I survive and am spared all will be well, but the fate of war may claim me as one of its victims and I would love to see you for many reasons if such is to be my fate. Oh I lament so much our separation at this period in our lives and under the existing condition of our country. But let us pray on, hope on, and there may yet be sweeter days in store for us. I am compelled now to close for the present and will add more ere an opportunity presents to send off.</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
