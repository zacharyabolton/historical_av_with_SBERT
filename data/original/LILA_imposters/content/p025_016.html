It is very difficult to get a local Magistrate to attend to complaints of Colored men, I have yet to hear of an instance in which the complaint of a freedman against a white man has been taken up unless under instructions from this office.</p> <p>In compliance with Circular <abbr expan="number">No.</abbr> 11 CS from <abbr expan="Headquarters">H<sup>d</sup>Qrs</abbr> <abbr expan="Assistant">Asst</abbr> <abbr expan="Commissioner">Com<sup>r</sup></abbr> State <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> I have registered during the month 544 couples of freedpeople as married by the State Act of February 27th 1866 - making a total of registry for the <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> of 721 couples-- Total number of children recognized by the Father as his 1986 or an average of 2 3/4 children to each married couple-- The total slave population before the war was 5617- the total registry amounts to 3428, which with licensed marriages, illegitimate children, and the floating population not reached by the State Law, must with the losses to the <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> from the emigration of Colored people during the war include nearly all those required to be registered by the Law.</p> <p>Stringent measures should be taken with a <i>[unclear: numerous]</i> class of freedpeople who congregate in towns, and live - no one knows how - or shift about through the country changing employers upon the most frivolous pretexes or often with no reason further than their own inclinations - the forfeit of the wages does not affect them in the least, though a finall compensation to the employer, who is often during the pressing, busy season obliged to seek other labor, with perhaps the same result, as the better class find employment by the year.</p> <p>Highland County</p> <p>In this <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> the General <i>[unclear: Lands]</i> <abbr expan="Department">Dept</abbr> of Virginia issued an order through this office dated May 27<sup>th</sup> 1866 directing that proceedings in certain cases - <i>[unclear: "Burkit &amp; Guhin"]</i> refugees be stopped and the property in question be restored to them at once - this order was promptly communicated to the Common Wealths <abbr expan="Attorney">Atty</abbr> of the <abbr expan="County">C.</abbr> but Mr. Burkit informed me on the 23<sup>d</sup> inst. that he had been unable by personal application to get the property in question and the lawyer of <i>[unclear: Guhin]</i> since informed me that his <i>[unclear: Ch]</i> was still held to answer the charges against him.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Ob<sup>t</sup></abbr> Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> T.
