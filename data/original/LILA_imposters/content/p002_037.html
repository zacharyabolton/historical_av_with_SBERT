I rec'd your letter by Pa was glad to hear from you. We have a very good time it is a rough life but I like it. We have companies of cavalry here &amp; expect two more today one from Point Rocks Capt Ashby Black Horse cavalry 100 men. I don't know where the other is from. I will give John Lipscomb the 80cts you owe him. He &amp; Ned Waddell will be here today. I will be commissioned in a few days &amp; will be quartered with Capt Patrick. How are all the ladies in old Waynesboro. I would like to see some of them very much. I suppose Andrew Darnall is still in town. I would like to see him. I gave Ned Waddell your letter. He seemed very glad to hear from you. I suppose he is busy or he would write. I will send you my likeness the first time I get to Martinsburg or Shepherdstown. I am very much tanned &amp; am getting fat we have plenty to eat. Mollie Rawlins seems to have plenty of beans here in the Shepherdstown Co. They all send their love to you &amp; Ma. Mr Irvine myself &amp; two others were down at the river between Williamsport &amp; little Georgetown on Monday. There was 4 shots fired at us by some roudy boatmen on the Maryland side but they did no damage. The balls whistled over our heads. We had no trees near to get behind &amp; had to get out of the way. We would have fired on them if we could have had some shelter. It was at least 5 or 600 yds from where they fired. I intend trying my sharps rifle on some of them if they fire again. It did not feel very comfortable but I was not the least frightened it will soon be put a stop. You all need have no uneasiness about me. If I am to die by a bullet I will try &amp; be prepared. Pa will give you all the news. I will write you a longer letter Sis. Give my respect to all. Write soon. Tell Clinton &amp; Chas I will write to them soon. I suppose Charley had a nice time in Richmond.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>William</p></div> <!---->
