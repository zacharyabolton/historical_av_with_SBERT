E. Brady of Buffalo Forge Va.; accounting to upwards of Fifty thousand dollars. The Claim grows out of a partnership between them which was dissolved in 1857 and can easily be established by the firm books, besides which Mr. Daniel C. E. Brady gave his bond for $25,000 and for such additional sums as should be found due -- Patrick Brady agreeing not to prosecute the claims for two years from Feb 16/59. The uncle of Daniel's wife (the late William Weaver of Buffalo Forge) left him a property known as the Bath Iron Works property -- near Lexington, and gave the residue of his Estate to his <ins>(Daniel's)</ins> wife -- the personal property absolutely and the land and slaves for life after her death, to her children in like manner as if she were a <u>femme</u> <u>covert</u> dying intestate.</p> <p>The Iron works property consists of some 6800 acres &amp; was valued at $12.000 or $15.000. The Buffalo Forge property -- about nine miles from Lexington -- is more valuable, but I understand that in Virginia such a devise given the children a vested Estate.</p> <p>Mr. Daniel C. E. Brady offered, at first, to give the Bath Iron Works in settlement &amp; after some hesitation Mr. Patrick Brady agreed to accept it -- when his nephew refused to carry out his proposal. Mr. James Davideson of Lexington is Daniel's counsel and can give you further information. If you can give the matter your attention I will take charge of it. We shall be happy to send you the paper. I know was said by the late Judge Thompson in the Course of a very pleasant stage ride from Lexington to Staunton in Sept 1865. I inferred that you would probably attend to the matter, though at some his distance from your home and have, therefore, taken the liberty of addressing you. If Mrs. Thompson be still living in Staunton, I beg that you will make my compliments to her. And believe me, Sir,</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <abbr expan="respectfully">respy</abbr> <abbr expan="yours">yrs</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Samuel">Sam<sup>l</sup>.</abbr> Dickson</div> <!---->
