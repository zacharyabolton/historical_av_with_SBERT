Women with 3 or more little children find it difficult to obtain employment and there is no authorized system of apprenticeship by which such children might be permanently provided for, and the mother disincumbered, be able to support herself. Cases of this kind are comparitively infrequent, but difficult to meet when they occur, because there are no vacant habitations accessible in this District and the cases are distributed on a <i>[unclear: territory]</i> which from its extent and difficient communications render relief establishments impracticable.</p> <p>There will be numbers of infirm and helpless freedmen, besides some among them who were called "free negroes" for whose support some local provision must be made, and I again respectfully suggest that the local authorities, as overseers of the Poor may be made to take care of them -- as they best can for the inhabitants will then have a personal interest in the matter and permit the use of vacant cabins, which they would now rather burn than have them occupied under the auspices of the "Freedmens Bureau" --.</p> <p>The Freedmen are rapidly becoming familiar with and accustomed to their new relations to the whites, and give encouraging evidence that with facilities for education, and unobstructed entrance into fields of labor and business they will soon cease to be regarded as an incubus upon the state or as subjects for the tutelage and guardianship of everybody, particularly those whom they already surpass in patriotism.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Colonel<br>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Resply</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
