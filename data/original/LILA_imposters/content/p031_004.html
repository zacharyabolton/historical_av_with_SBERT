If therefore you have any communications to make, you will please write to me at once, or if it is important that I should be in Staunton, or in your office, I will go any day, though it does not suit me as I expect to attend a mineral spring some six miles from here in the mountain</p> <p>You will please let me hear from you at once, and I will be at your service.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John G.
