It is so much easier to write in this way as I can do it at times when I could not write with pen ink. Mrs Turk &amp; Mrs Anderson got here about half after nine. I got my bundle and a note from you. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> only a note have you got so delicate that you can write no more than a note? I expected my letter to go up Friday evening. I sent it to office Thursday. I think Lucy &amp; Marys dresses are mighty pretty Lucys in particular. I thought <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> that Mrs Turk said you <ins>had</ins> got the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> for yourself. dont let me <i>[unclear: take]</i> it from you if that was the case I think if I <i>[unclear: would put]</i> a <i>[unclear: faring]</i> on the dress and <i>[unclear: brinch]</i> with a <del hand="h1"></del> braid dresses are made very wide so I expect there would not be <i>[unclear: through]</i> for a hem I dont like hems unless they are tolerably deep. I am very much obliged to you for sending my clothes as I dont know that they were clean. I believe my purple callier is not here. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>I expect I will get a bonnet. Uncle <i>[unclear: Jess]</i> was here yesterday and gave me $5 to get me a bonnet or hat said Aunt Lizzie sent it, wasn't that so good, and kind of him. Mrs Turk wanted me to go down street to-day with her but I was afraid to ask Miss Mary I know she wouldn't be willing for me to go. &amp; now I am certain she would have refused to let me go</p> <p>Ella Allen has gone home. we miss her so much she was so lively that she kept the <i>[unclear: ballance ]</i> of us <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. It is only five weeks until school closes and we <ins>will</ins> have some four or five examinations in that time</p> <p>Why didn't brother come down yesterday I think he ought to have been here He could have appreciated the speeches &amp; ceremonies. I could not go was very sorry of it. I heard the bells tolling &amp; the band playing. The sound was mournful indeed. I was at the D, D &amp; B Institution a few Saturdays ago to a rehearsal <del hand="h1">concert</del> that the blind had. I enjoyed it immensely. Some of the blind were examined. I thought they <i>[unclear: shamed]</i> us, they stood theirs as well. We had quite an excitement here a few nights ago. Some one got into one of the rooms (my old room by the way) and was feeling under the pillow and passing the hand down over the face of one of the girls they raised the alarm and who ever it was hustled out in a hurry. Some think it was a servant who was here last winter I have no idea who it was or the <i>[unclear: affect]</i> of the visit. The effects of it were that locks were put in the doors next day. It amuses me to think that in our room we have been keeping open house all winter &amp; now are <i>[unclear: locking]</i> down. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> Miss Agness would be glad to have some dried apples or any thing eatible if you have more than you want to use. I told her we had no apples last year &amp; today she asked one of the girls if they had any beets <i>[unclear: parsonips]</i> at their house I dont know what she would give for them but if she had them soon she would be glad to get any thing of the kind as we dont have any extra variety now Nothing more at present</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am your affectionate daug - oh I mean sister</p></div> <!----> <!---->
