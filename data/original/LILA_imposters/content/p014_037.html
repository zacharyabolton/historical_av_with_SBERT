I first heard that he was only wounded but since I have that he was killed. I want you to show this to William Grass. All the creek boys is well. I don't know where James Padgett is. He came to us when we was at Winchester and they kept him with the Regiment until we got to Shepherdstown and then I don't know where he went. We have marching orders. They have taken all the guards in from peoples houses...</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
