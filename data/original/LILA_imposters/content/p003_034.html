This is a severe blow upon Ichabod <i>[unclear: alapod]</i> Imboden if any two tolerably popular Whigs had run against him, he would have been distanced--he is very distasteful to the leading Whigs of the County, and the Charlottesville Convention did a very silly thing in making him the Whig elector for this Senatorial District, I fear he is not able to cope with Skinner And Summers ought to be here before elections to heal the distractions or devisions in the Whig ranks and make up for Imbodens deficiencies--he is now stumping it little <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. Banks was here yesterday and says his prospects there are very encouraging--He named several conspicuous Democrats in that region that would support him in preference to <u>little</u> Iam--Summers has promised us he would try and be here &amp; address this People before the election. Hozd's friends in South West are a good deal chafed <i>[unclear: I suspect]</i> at Iam's beating him in the convention here.</p> <p>My main object however in writing you now is, to suggest the propriety of some articles being prepared at Washington by yourself or some one who understands the subject appealing to the young Farmers &amp; Mechanics on the subject of the Tariff, which indeed is now the most important issue between the parties, putting the Whigs in contrast with the pauper laborer of Europe, I think a few well written plain essays on that subject would have a powerful effect. The Democrats here are making strong appeal; to the new voters, and nothing it seems to me is doing to counter act their efforts.
