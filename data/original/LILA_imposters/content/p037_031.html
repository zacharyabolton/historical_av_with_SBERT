I wrote to you yesterday by Mr. Jerry Hall telling you of my disappointment, &amp; suppose you <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> the letter, &amp; was surprised to hear that I did not get your letter Tuesday. I have it now &amp; <abbr expan="although">tho'</abbr> short I thank God for it, as it is from you my love. I would rather get <u>one</u> <u>line</u> written by your dear hand then sheets full from any one else. but I love for you to write me long letters when you have time. This last one I willingly Excuse as you were busy. I can't tell you how many things I <u>imagined</u> which made me just as unhappy as any one ever could be in this life, by not getting your letter Tuesday. I was perfectedly miserable from Tuesday evening, until 10 O'clock to day when your dear letter came &amp; made my heart free from suffering. I love you so that when I do not see you or get letters from you I suffer deeply, &amp; long. The whole world seems dark, &amp; dreary to me, &amp; I cannot find peace &amp; pleasure with any one, or in any way. I find happiness in nothing on Earth when I think I have lost your love &amp; I know by my heartaches then that with you is my only real happiness in this life &amp; do beleive that I could not live if you did not love me. You must not smile &amp; say I just think so now. I do not just think so, for I know that my happiness depends upon you, &amp; that I never truly loved until I loved you, &amp; it is my nature to love you with all my soul my heart, mind &amp; strength &amp; loving you so could I ever be happy, &amp; live without your love? I feel that I could not. May God bless our love for eachother always is my daily prayer. I was so disappointed when I read in your letter that you cannot come Saturday. how can I spend another long week without seeing you my love. It seems that I cannot wait so long for Oh! I do want to see your dear face so much, so much--I am saying truly just as I feel. I do want to see you this week for it is so long since you were here, &amp; then you were with me such a short time, &amp; to be with you is the greatest pleasure of my life--a pleasure I love, &amp; thank God for giving me. My dear pa &amp; Ada have not returned yet. we are looking for them to day. There is a letter here for pa from <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> Imboden who is well again. My Editor Mr. Wartman of Harrisonburg is here attending the Musical Convention. his wife just died a few weeks ago. Ella would say he has no heart, I think so myself. I love you with all my heart, Soul, &amp; nature, &amp; will while we both live. I want to see you more then I can write in words Oh I do wish you could come Saturday, if you cannot come (but I hope you will) write to me Tuesday. All send love.
