We got to stay in camp to day for the first time for several weeks. I had the plaisure of looking at the yankey camp on yesterday.</p> <p> We were sent out on a forraging expidition and I was sent up on a little mountain to stand picket while the wagon were <i>[unclear: loadening]</i>. We could see the yankeys riding about the camp very plainly with a glass. They have a large force down in Culpepper. Six yankeys came over on yesterday and gave themselves up to our men. Jacksons whole army moved forward on yesterday. There will be a large battle down here on a few days if Jackson whips the yankeys out here it wont be a great while untill there will be peace made. It is reported that the yankeys are all leaving be low <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. They are all dying down their.</p> <p>Jackson has a large force here. He has <abbr expan="Generals">Genls</abbr> Hills and Longstreets divisions. I think Jackson will give Pope a good grubbing. Wm A. Bratton is very glad to go home. He has been trying to go <del hand="h1">to go home</del> for some time. Tell Miss Harriet Cleek that William has been dreaming about her for some months. I hope he will be satisfied when he gets home for he has been uneasy about his cattle. Geroge Cleek sends his best respects to you and says when ever he gets a furlow you may hear of him on the Cow Pasture below Williamsville.</p> <p>Give my best respects to Harriet Cleek and all the Young Ladies on Jacksons river. I won't have time to write a long letter to you this time for I have to go on camp duty tonight, and the time for the bugle to sound is near at hand. I expect that we will move in a few days some whear else.</p> <p>Excuse bad writing and mistakes.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Wise, Com.

I heard that the yankeys were faling back. Lieutenant McGuffin has resigned and gone home on account of his health. I want you to make me a cheese and send it to me a piece of cheese would not <i>[unclear: eat]</i> bad. We get plenty of bread and <i>[unclear: mead]</i> and that is all we get. We can have some stewed apples occasionally when we can get them. If there is plenty of apples you can make apple butter. This is a fine country down here it looks like old Augusta. The wheat crops and corn crops are very fine in this county. Culpepper is a fine county as far as I have been. Give my best respects to Father &amp;c. You must write by mail the company has been getting letters by mail. I have nothing more of interest to write you this time. Yours As, John Wise Com. F 17th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. Mary E.
