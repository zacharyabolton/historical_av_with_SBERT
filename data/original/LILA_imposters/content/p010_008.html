I feel sorry for poor <abbr expan="John">Jno.</abbr> Harman, he has lost two children and told me this morning that he expected two more to die today --when will the pestilence of Scarlet Fever cease from our county. I have just been reading the Spectator, it has a good deal of interesting news in it. We caged and ironed today the leader of the militia rebellion in <abbr expan="Rockingham">Rock<sup>m</sup></abbr> he is a tigrous looking fellow: also a Dutchman of a <abbr expan="New York Regiment">N. Y. Regt</abbr> was brought in -- he had on him quite a number of letters, one from his wife, all in German, in which she berated him soundly for not writing to her, but got over her wrath before she ended &amp; wrote to him like a loving Vrow - - she had come on to Alexandria to see him -- he had several letters from others in which they all spoke of being <u>infinitely</u> tired of the war and desirous of getting out of it. O! by the way Sam. Hernsberger, the tall young man from McGaheysville that went to school, is here in a Cavalry Co -- he was in Western Va. last summer with Wise and he has just told me that Brodt was in the army a member of a Kenawha Co, and furthermore that he was at Roanoke island and was probably taken a prisoner there -- good for old B-- that he proved true at last --</p> <p> It rains here all the time -- I hope you have a better spell of weather. We are kept in doors most of the time of late by it. I am very much pleased with Gen. Jackson and his staff -- he is at times very chatty, but usually has but little to say -- Sunday he went out through one of the Brigades with a bundle of tracts and distributed them -- he stays by himself most of the time -- eats very sparingly -- does not drink tea or coffee and hardly eats any meat The <abbr expan="Adjutant">Adj.</abbr> Gen -- Lieut. AS Pendleton, son of the Rev. Col. Pendleton of Rockbridge -- (the famous Manassas Artillery Capt.) is a young man of about 22 -- light haired -- has taught in Lexington, graduated at Wm Coll, &amp; was at the <abbr expan="University of Virginia">Univ. of Va</abbr> when the war broke out -- he is talented, and admirable talker &amp; man of fine sense &amp; acquirements -- he is the one spoken of in the Spectator as carrying off wounded men -- he says he did many things he does not remember, at Kernstown, but he knows he did not carry any body off the field, and Berkely, the Surgeon of the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> was not there Dr. McGuire says, so it is hard to tell who the surgeon was. Dr. McGuire the Medical Director is also a young man of fine talents -- is not more than 26 &amp; has been a <abbr expan="Professor">Prof.</abbr> at <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Philad<sup>a</sup> </abbr> &amp; also in New Orleans in a <abbr expan="Medical College">Med. Coll.</abbr> he is a son of Dr. <abbr expan="McGuire">McG.</abbr> of Winchester you have often heard of him. The Dr. is one of Bro. George sort of men, blunt good humor &amp; full of honest life. Lt. Col. Baylor is a good fellow -- first rate, good natured and accommodating -- he will, no doubt, be elected Col. of the 5<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> -- we shall miss him much, Lieut. Boswell, the chief of the <abbr expan="Engineer">Eng.</abbr> Corps, is an excellent good natured honest Presbyterian of <abbr expan="Alabama">Ala.</abbr> formerly of Fauquier <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> -- is well off -- has a sweet heart in Fauquier where the Yankees are and he talks much about her -- he is my bed fellow -- is one of your good fellows that everybody likes and of course I like him too -- Lieut. Douglas is from Maryland and has lately been on the staff -- was a lieut. in a Company -- he is quite young but has been practising law in St. Louis -- is one of your wide awake smart young men -- I like him too. Lieut Meade is from Clarke <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> he was <i>[unclear: a private]</i> at Manassas and lost his right arm -- he has had a Lieutenancy given him because of that -- and is a good negative sort of man, kindly disposed and willing to do all he can -- then there are two clerks detailed from the Washington Coll. Co. Logan and Laird -- they are good fellows too -- Sergt. Brown is engaged with the <abbr expan="Engineer">Eng.</abbr> Corps -- he is Co. <i>[unclear: Surrey]</i> or of Jefferson, &amp; is an excellent surveyor, a big stout fellow -- accommodating &amp; pleasant, but a mass of facts -- a painfully matter of fact man, at times, painfully exact, but I really like him nevertheless -- then add a half dozen darkies of all shades and natures -- &amp; put in your husband -- Mr. Lipkiss as one of the Dutch girls here calls me, Mrs. Rude says, that cant say Hotchkiss, and you have the Generals staff described after a fashion. </p> <p> I will describe mine host if we stay here much longer. I have nothing of interest to write -- the enemy still at the same place, being reinforced we hear -- what a set of cowards they must be to want any more troops to oppose our small army. The militia have all been drafted into Volunteer Regiments, officers &amp; all. I have the same place I had last year with Gen. L. and am <abbr expan="Topographical Engineer">Top. Eng.</abbr> on Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson's">J's</abbr> Staff -- I may get a commission as the <abbr expan="Engineer">Eng.</abbr> Corps is to be increased -- I shall get the same pay I did before I suppose. We get the papers here every day &amp; the news often comes here from over the Ridge by express. I wish I could come in and see you all -- the little darlings -- kiss them for pa -- Tell Allen to have a good garden well worked and everything done like a good boy that I hope he is. My love to all our relations &amp; friends -- read them my letter <u>or</u> send it up -- for I have not much time to write. Write often. God bless you all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
