He is making a tour of his District and will go over into Page, Warren &amp; Clark <abbr expan="counties">co's</abbr>. As I determined to accompany him instead of going straight to Winchester, where I shall now arrive in Tuesday. The opportunity is a good one for observing the condition of the Freedmen in these <i>[unclear: rebellious]</i> counties, and I hope to persuade the <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> to send troops there, though he has but four (4) companies of <abbr expan="Infantry">Inf</abbr> and 2 of <abbr expan="Cavalry">Cav</abbr> in his Command.</p> <p><i>[unclear: Tell]</i> Mr Tukey to look up that woman who stole the "body". "Marian" something. Mr <i>[unclear: Sipee]</i> will perhaps know where she lives. She <i>[unclear: wist]</i> him to come to me yesterday morning to be sent to jail, but evidently doesn't want to go. Had she come I should have scolded her and let her off, but as it is, I <i>[unclear: wist]</i> the Provost Marshall to put her in for three (3) days. Tell Mr. Tukey also to take possession of Mr Campbells <i>[unclear: house]</i> as abandoned property and make such disposition of it as he should judge best <i>[unclear: collecting]</i> rents due, giving notices to quit, &amp;c.</p> <p>Also to see that the man who maltreated the Freedmen at the -- Furnace got their deserts at the hands of the Provost Marshall. Take the <i>[unclear: census]</i> in hand and copy the census of Staunton first, in the <i>[unclear: proper blanks]</i>.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W Storer How <i>[unclear: Capt]</i><br><del rend="none" hand="h1"></del></p></div> <!---->
