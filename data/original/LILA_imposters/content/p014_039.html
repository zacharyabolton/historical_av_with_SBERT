Harman bought 2 lbs. of indigo and sent to his wife -- 1/2 lb. of it is for you &amp; he will write to her to send it to you -- we only found it at Williams-port &amp; it was $10-a pound -- I did not get the other articles mentioned in your last but will bear them in mind -- I shall soon know if my bundle went home -- &amp; will see to it -- I have 2 <abbr expan="pairs">prs</abbr> of silk gloves, some <abbr expan="handkerchiefs">hdkfs</abbr> &amp; 10 yds fine cotton, I dont know what, wh -- I will send soon -- Only see if Brown will take the money &amp; I will sendit -- I will send you some more very soon -- I fear you may need it. I have <u>some</u> tea also for "the old lady" bless her heart -- I would like to take a cup of tea with her &amp; rest my weary head in her bosom -- weary of the toils and turmoils of war -- Heaven grant they may soon end -- I long for home &amp; all its sweet delights, its innocent repose &amp; quiet -- I shall try to come home, but do not see any chance now, in the midst of active operations such as we must have this summer I saw most of our neighbor-boys a few days ago -- Heizer, Hoover, Stover, Drinkler, Shumate, &amp;c &amp;c -- they are all well -- we have had rain, rain lately &amp; the rivers have been foaming -- </p> <p> I think it well to give Nelly rest during the summer -- let the children enojoy the free air &amp; fruits of the season -- I am sorry the croup continues to attack Anna so much -- I would try oiling her throat with sweet oil often washing it -- I have another bottle for you -- very fine oil -- write soon I forgive "the pouts" knowing htey are love ones - only they are not as sweet as smiles and kisses, you know Kisses &amp; love for the children --- William is very hearty &amp; we are on "Old Virginia's shore again -- Write soon - </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
