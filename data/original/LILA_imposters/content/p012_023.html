He is quite a loss to Papa I dont know what he will do without him &amp; Mr. Peyton poor man was killed. I feel so much for poor old Mrs. Peyton. I did not understand what you said about Mr. Dabney.</p> <p>I went to Preaching this morning and the Preacher wants the people here to cut up their carpets to make blankets for the soldiers. They are going to give the carpets in the aisles of the churches here to them. Ma I want you to buy one of Aunt Lees Linsey dresses most suitable to line my overcoat with as we can get nothing thicker than <i>[unclear: osenburgs]</i> to line them with and we have to give the biggest kind of price for it. Send me a piece of home made soap to wash my feet with. If you have started the box you needent trouble your self about them.</p> <p>Tell Maurice I will answer his letter next Saturday. He had better buy as many chestnuts as he can if he can buy them low and sell them. They are selling here a 50 <abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> a quart. I want to write to Aunt this evening so I must stop. My love to all at cousin Hues. Kiss Mag and Mary, love to all both White &amp; black. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I remain your affectionate son</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Kent</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>PSSS My Math is as much as I can possibly master &amp; some of the examples more.
