I will send Franks gun up on monday by the express train. There is nothing talked about here but that all absorbing <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> subject secession. South Carolina has gloriously vindicated her honor. She has passed her ordinance of secession and henceforth the 20<sup>th</sup> day of December will be as glorious a day for the South as ever the 4<sup>th</sup> of July was to the United States. We speak now of the United States as of a nation that has <u>passed</u> <u>away</u> as of a government that has lived out its allotted time and passed away into the dim past. More glorious things are looming up in the now <u>near</u> future. </p> <p>Enclosed I send your bill. Mr. D. gave me $25. I would send the change but it would not be safe I will bring it up with me when I come. As you see it is $2.85.</p> <p>Give my respects to all my friends. Hoping all are well I remain your affectionate son.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John">J.</abbr> H.
