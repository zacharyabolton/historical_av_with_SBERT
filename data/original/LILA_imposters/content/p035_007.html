How to me its truthful lines gave the glad assurance of your continued love you could have seen had you been near when I read it over &amp; over again. It is so sweet to have you call me dear. I repeat the treasured words so often in my mind since your dear hand traced them to me. I had looked &amp; waited so long for you to call me Dear Mollie &amp; at last my wishes have been fulfilled I feel more sure that I am indeed as dear to you as you are to me &amp; My heartfelt prayer is that you may never regret giving me the sweet &amp; affectionate little <u>Dear</u>. I love to read the short words so expressive, written by you &amp; coined from your true, &amp; noble heart I know how dear, how inexpressably dear you are to me always &amp; to feel that I am as much loved by you makes meso happy. I wish Oh so anxiously that you were here this Evening I want to see your dear face more then I can tell I miss the happy &amp; loved Evenings of the past three weeks when I could have you near me, &amp; now I think you must come in at twilight &amp; sit with me &amp; as I can't see you I feel so lonely &amp; that I can't live without seeing you Every day. I know you miss me when the lamps are lit, "&amp; evenings home pleasures are nigh." You have a heart made to love, enjoy, &amp; appreciate fire side, &amp; home pleasures this I have known for some time &amp; when I am in Staunton I am happiest &amp; so are you when we are with each other round dear Ella's fireside. Yes I am so happy then &amp; happy when you are here with me any where with you I am contented &amp; happy so happy that I love to sit silent &amp; think of my blessing without talking much I love to muse when with you &amp; you think if I don't talk that I am sad &amp; gloomy but I am not. with me much talking does not prove the heart to be in its happiest mood. I am often silentwhen with you &amp; I know that I am very happy. I am fearful you think I would not make a "cheerful, &amp; happy fireside" You must not think this of me. I am sure with help from Above of making home happy for I do love to see others happy &amp; unless those I best cherish are so I cannot be so myself. Please don't think I would make a gloomy &amp; cheerless fireside. to me the shake of your dear curly head &amp; the rapid motion of your foot are very <u>Ex</u>p<u>ressive</u> I saw these when you spoke of Sue Forney &amp; I wondered then if you thought I would be such a gloomy wife, a dark cloud to hide the light, the beauty, &amp; happiness of home &amp; not a "fireside angel" making home a sweet &amp; much loved shelter for the dayworn husband. what were your thoughts then? did you think I was like Sue? perhaps I have been unjust to you &amp; this I do not want to be for I love you too dearly to be unjust forgive me then. one of my greatest wishes is to please you &amp; to render myself a worthy object for you to love &amp; trust. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a long letter from dear Ella Tuesday night she wrote that she never was so lonely in her life. I am sorry I did not stay. wish I was there to night I loveto stay with her. I would rather be with Ella in one little room then live in a palace in Bridgewater. I do in truth always enjoy my visits in Ella's dear upstairs home more then anywhere else in all the wide Earth. Ma <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a letter from Rennie to day she says she hopes you &amp; I were as glad to visit them as they were to have us there. she says she was so lonely after we left. wants me to go down &amp; stay awhile with her. dear Rennie I love her too but don't think I can go only when you take me. You &amp; I will go again before long. she is very happy &amp; I thank God for it, but I would rather be with Ella then in Bridgewater. dear Rennie has a warm place in my heart &amp; I hope God will always bless her with happiness here &amp; in Heaven. You &amp; I will go to see her when ever we can. Do you remember the letter you brought for pa? it was from Mr. Estell I will let you read it when you come. I was so glad to hear you are coming Saturday a week if you live. I want to see you more &amp; more every day of my life. I will have a bright warm fire &amp; a warm supper for you, a sincere loving heart &amp; glad face to meet you. Oh! I am so happy when you are with me best &amp; dearest of all the whole world. Hamie sends his love &amp; says "do you miss him" &amp; that "he is chewing Mr. Cupp's three <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> tobacco." Pa is getting ready for his trip to <i>[unclear: Paye]</i> I have not yet consented to go with him. I may just to please him.
