I am very well only a little too cold. Georgie is out here with me &amp; as well as ever. Mr Smith has taken a great fancy to him &amp; says he likes him better than any Cochran he ever saw. Willie is in Staunton I believe he is very well &amp; intended going to Mr Swopes to day- Howe Peyton I saw yesterday he had been a little sick but was getting very well He had not been in bed at all.</p> <p>The 4<sup>th</sup> was celebrated here in a grand style. The Winchester company were here &amp; their uniform was that worn in 1776. Buckskin pants &amp; large boots &amp; ruffle shirts. I admired it more than any I saw at all. The Charlottesville company was very pretty &amp; the best drilled by far. They were so much pleased that the <abbr expan="Captain">Cap<sup>t</sup>.</abbr> went off &amp; left them all in Staunton. The dinner was in the bottom of Mr Greys yard &amp; he invited us up to his house where we took our dinner &amp; saw every-thing without being in the crowd at all Of course there were a few fights All the Mickies, Harmans, &amp; Garbers got in a fuss with the "West Agusta Guards", because a <del hand="h1">Garber</del> <ins>Harman</ins> got drunk &amp; tried to force through the guard &amp; the officer pointed his musket &amp; threatened to fire. <abbr expan="Brother">Bo</abbr> Jimmie said out loud that "he thought Mr <del hand="h1">Garber</del> <ins>Harman</ins> ought to be put in jail &amp; his father heard it &amp; told Jimmie that he <del hand="h1">inter</del> <ins>took</ins> that as a personal insult &amp; would see him, but Jim in his way laughed it off &amp; said it was nothing but the truth.</p> <p>Every thing was very quiet when we left town yesterday evening I suppose the <abbr expan="Charlottesville">Ch-ville</abbr> <abbr expan="company">co</abbr> left this morning-</p> <p>The <i>[unclear: Carringtons]</i> got here Monday and are staying at Mr Imbodens. We all went to see them. Cousin Sue Baldwin invited them to her house last night. I don't know how long they will stay in Town The Peytons are quite delighted with cousin Campbell &amp; cousin John Preston; so much so that they have invited them up every day &amp; evening since they have been here.</p> <p>Aunt Sarah &amp; Lizzie are fixing to go to Bath. They will go some time next week.</p> <p>Has Monty Lewis ever sent the <u>curls</u> or has he written about them. <u>May</u> be he <u>is</u> <u>waiting</u> for the <u>money</u>-I wish you would send them on by express to Uncle Ben Crawford - Last night we had to have a large fire &amp; this morning it is still cold, a very great change from the 29<sup>th</sup> of June in Charlottesville.</p> <p>Aunt Maria got a ripe tomato out of her garden yesterday.</p> <p>Georgie says he would have written before but could not get Pen, ink, or paper at Uncle <i>[unclear: Miffetts]</i>.
