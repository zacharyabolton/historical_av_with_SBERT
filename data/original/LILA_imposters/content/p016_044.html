So far as ours is concerned if they will take it now let it go. I have plenty here to keep us well during our lives if properly managed. dont let this matter weary you one particle but just take it as it comes &amp; if unpleasant for you there or if you are in any way in need come out here at once or at any time you can &amp; may desire I have a good place here for you and only wish you were here now, to help to cheer up my dull gloomy hours that I spend in my lonely room only relieved occasionaly by the dropping in of some friend The doctor being my most constant visiter.

But I hope you will soon dispel these dark gloomy cloud<sup>s</sup> &amp; look forward to brighter days. I spend portions of my time in reviewing your pictures thus calling to mind lovely recollections of the past similar to which I hope soon to be returned</p> <p><abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Brown is here &amp; well the men generally from our section are well.
