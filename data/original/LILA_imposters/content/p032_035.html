Evans,</p></div> <div class="source__body source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your letter of the 15 is the dearest &amp; most affectionate you have Ever yet written to me, just such a letter as I love to get from you &amp; I have read it over &amp; over again thanking you from my heart for such expressions of devotion Why do you not always write so freely &amp; affectionately to me? My letters to you have Ever been dictated by the truest &amp; deepest love, have they not? I am not complaining now but only showing you that your last &amp; dearest letter met a loving welcome from her to whom it was written &amp; that I prize it more dearly than any you have Ever written to me</p> <p>You ask me if I thought of you during your lonely homeward ride of Monday. I did indeed think of nothing else. I sought my bed but could not sleep for thinking of one I loved more than all others riding a dreary long road alone. I could not rest when I knew you were travelling &amp; then I would so much rather have been with you my heart &amp; thoughts were with you all the way, but you knew it not. Do you remember I told you I would not sleep until I thought you had arrived safely at home. nor did I either. I was glad &amp; thankful to hear you reached Staunton for I was so fearful something might happen to you that I was as anxious &amp; miserableas I could be until I heard from you. God is so Merciful to us ungrateful beings. I thanked Him fervently for protecting your dear life &amp; person from danger. I bless His holy name for loving &amp; caring for you during your many rides to, &amp; from Staunton May God Ever guide your way is the daily pleading of Mary's heart for you.</p> <p>I am as happy &amp; rejoiced to know of the bright &amp; cheerful change in your feelings &amp; manner as you can Ever be. do you believe me? do you think it possible for the great change in you to make me just as happy? It does, for all my unhappy doubts thinking you did not love me as my heart longed to be loved by you in return for the deep &amp; undying devotion it had given &amp; lavished truly upon you do you know, that I often thought one reason why you seemed so thoughtful &amp; troubled was that you had <i>[unclear: seen]</i> my affection &amp; found after calm consideration that you were mistaken in your feelings &amp; did not love me. I told you last Sunday night how often &amp; how deeply you grieved &amp; pained me whilst in Staunton by your cold &amp; silent manner, because I thought you did not love me &amp; I was loving you all the time with a true &amp; unchanging love. I was loving &amp; thinking of none but you, wishing &amp; praying Oh! so earnestly that I might know your true feelings for me &amp; why you were so cold &amp; silent when you came in mypresence. I never was as unhappy, never suffered so much in all my past life as I did then when doubting your love. I am glad of the happy change in you for your own dear sake, for I know you are so much happier &amp; to feel &amp; see that you are bright &amp; happy is to make me so also. If I could give you uninterrupted happiness in this world you would never know one moments trouble. I would keep all sorrow &amp; anxiety far from your heart &amp; mind your face which I love to look at should never be clouded with painful thought if the power were mine. Your pathway through life should be sunny, glorious, happy &amp; beautiful, but no mortal being ever has yet in this life tasted of the cup I would if I had the power place to your darling mouth but any one can be very happy if they just would try in the right way for there is joy for all who will have it if they only try they will find it but I can't be happy when I think <u>you</u> don't love me. How I did wish to be with you when you left Sunday. I felt so lonely &amp; sad when you were gone. If I could see your dear, dear face to night &amp; have you near me, I should be so glad &amp; contented. Oh! I do want to see you so much so much if you could just come in now I would cry with joy for I would be so glad &amp; even thankful to see you can't you come Saturday with Magnus if Ella don't come? it is so long till Saturday a week I wish I could see you every day like I once didI know since I love you that I never did love truly before. I feel &amp; know it every hour of my life for I love you more then I do my own life my Soul, or my God This is as true as I know that My God looks down from His glorious Home in Heaven upon me in sorrowful displeasure for making you my one Idol. I must love God best, if I wish for our Earthly happiness. May God help me to love Him first &amp; you next that is the way I would have it for His blessings upon us &amp; our love for each other.</p> <p>Pa has written to cousin David &amp; given his free &amp; willing consent to Their marriage.
