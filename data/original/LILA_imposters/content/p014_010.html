I have had quite a nice time since I have been in camp. I have made the acquaintance of a good many nice officers. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Steptoe is one of the nicest gentleman I ever saw and is so kind to me. I understand that Floods &amp; Pickets divisions are camped near here &amp; Jones, Imboden, Hampton, Jenkins and W.H. Lee are and in fact all our cavalry forces are here. We expect to leave here for some unknown point in a day or two. I shall try and fill your memorandum if possible. I dont intend to write long letters to you when you have nothing to do and write short ones. Judge is here and sends his love. I will write to Ma in a day or two. Never forget to mention <abbr expan="brother">bro</abbr> Jim in your letters. I will write to him soon. Love to all. I am your <abbr expan="Brother">Bro</abbr>, Kent.</p> <br> <p>Dear Cousin <br> I received your two very short notes and regret to write as I have nothing in the world to write. I have not seen your <abbr expan="brother">Bro</abbr> yet. I shall give him your memorandum in full and shall tell him not to apply for a furlough untill he hears from you. Forbear he may not get another in time espetially if you are in as big a hurry as cousin Nannie R. I shall try to get the veil and dress. What cotton will you have it. The paper is unruled on the other side and I cant write on my knee. Judge sends love and speaks of you very often. I am your attached cousin, Kent. </p> <p>I shall expect to hear from you all often but you musent look for letters from me more than every 2 weeks.</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
