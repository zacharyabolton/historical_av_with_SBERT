We are getting some very important legislation here to reach the sea with our coals. Hope to have it all right in a few days.</p> <p>Touching your request to join the searching party after supposed Confederate <ins>metaphorically</ins> "buried" treasure in Europe, I have simply this to say why I can't <u>possibly</u> even think of it.</p> <p>1<sup> <sup>st</sup> </sup> My entire time, and all my energies and capacity for labor are the property of my Company, by Contract. I have agreed to engage in nothing else of a business nature whatever. This one reason is enough so far as I am concerned. But as you desire me to enlist friends in the scheme to the extent of putting up $10,000, I ought to state further why I cant undertake to do so. My reasons are, First: That I have no faith in the alleged fact that the <abbr expan="Confederate">Confed.</abbr> <abbr expan="government">govt.</abbr> had $50,000,000 - or even $5,000,000 or one million in Europe in money or property when it collapsed. I know of my personal knowledge that Mr. Seddon <abbr expan="Secretary">Sec.</abbr> of War late in 1864 had neither credit nor money to buy two ship loads of supplies at Liverpool when we were starving &amp; freezing, &amp; in the dead of winter <ins>he</ins> shipped 2 cargoes of cotton from Wilmington to buy supplies, &amp; Ben Ficklin got the proceeds, &amp; the <abbr expan="Government">Gov't</abbr> got nothing. It is all m<ins>o</ins>onshine about this $50,000,000. But <u>suppose</u> it <u>possible</u>, do you think that a man who had spent $150,000 of his private fortune to unearth it, has not the credit amongst his <u>own</u> friends to raise a paltry $10,000 more to <u>insure</u> his success? Why John Sherman would put it up. Any gambler in <abbr expan="New York">N.Y.</abbr> would put it up on half a show of winning. But suppose good reasons to exist for applying to <u>you</u> to help in the last moment, do they offer <u>you</u> enough interest in it? I understand Nicholas is to have $500,000. This is only 1 per cent on the $50,000,000. And if you can raise $10,000 you are to have $250,000, which is only 1/2 a per cent, or 50 cents on the $100 <del hand="h1">dollars</del>. To get the $10,000 you would have to give away the larger part of the $250,000.</p> <p>Major! Mr Nicholas may be honestly duped in this matter, but the whole thing is so preposterously rediculous as I view it, that if I had $100,000 idle cash lying in bank to day, I would not give $100 for a half interest <u>in all</u> that will <u>ever</u> be recovered. The war has been over 16 years. The <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> <abbr expan="Government">Gov<u> <u>t</u> </u></abbr> has pursued the defunct Confederacy like a beadle for the last dime to be found anywhere, at home or abroad, &amp; has taken even private property in some cases, and is grudgingly making restitution. If a stray fund should now be found, it would take years of litigation to establish the <abbr expan="Government's">Govt's</abbr> claim to it, and then years of diplomacy to get it into the <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> treasury, and then more years to get Congress to pass an act to divide the "swag" with the <u>detective</u> who now only wants $10,000. See the course of Congress on the Geneva Award and the Alabama Claims. The <abbr expan="Government">Gov<u> <u>t</u> </u></abbr> recovered $15,000,000 from England ostensibly as a guardian &amp; trustee of her <u>loyal</u> Citizens whom Semme's, the hero of the seas despoiled. England paid it over 8 years ago. And the larger part of it remains in the Treasury to day, undisposed of. If there was the possibility of any truth in the story of the $50,000,000 life is too short for <u>you</u> &amp; <u>me</u> to take a hand in its recovery. We might <u>begin</u> it, but the next Centennial will be celebrated before we or our heirs would <u>realize</u> from the venture. With these views, it is unnecessary for me to write to Mr. Nicholas, for under no circumstances could I go into it, nor would I be willing to commend the scheme to any of my matter of fact <u>business</u> men in Pittsburgh, who see <u>money</u> in <u>Coal</u> &amp; <u>Iron</u> in the late Confederate States, but none in the mysty vaults of a defunct, starved out, naked &amp; ragged psuedo nationality.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Hastily Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.D.
