I have not heard one word direct from home yet. I imagine some have been sent, but oweing to the diranged state of mail affairs I have received none There is more confusion here at this time than has been heretofore. oweing to the fact, that our commanders have all been superceded by an appointment from the <i>[unclear: convention]</i> - or rather the Governor wich has caused considerable dissatisfaction among the soldiers generally. I wish they would settle matters some way or other, &amp; let us get back home for I cant see any good that we are doing here now. It is thought that all our officers ranking from captains will be superceded by this order of the Governor. <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Harman Harper &amp; <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Baylor are all in powerful stew about it &amp; I wouldn't be surprised if we all c<i>[unclear: eceede ]</i> &amp; go home</p> <p>I will not trouble you with a long letter from the fact that I have not got time to write a long one, we are in fine spirits.
