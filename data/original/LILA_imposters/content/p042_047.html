You say you are going to Brunswick next week, and this may reach you before you start. I am so sorry your sister Ella's letter has unsettled your mind again as to the time. You now say <u>May</u> instead of <u>March</u>. Well let it stand till I see you, and I am sure we can agree. And if you are not a very firm and obstinate little woman I will argue you into my views or be greatly mistaken.</p> <p>You have heard "jokes" on me? And want to know when I saw Miss Parke Perkins of <abbr expan="Prince">Pr.</abbr> Edward. I saw the lady you mention in <abbr expan="Prince">Pr.</abbr> Edward during the fall, though she does not live there. She &amp; I were reported months ago to be engaged &amp; have had a good deal of fun over it. We are the very <u>best</u> of <u>friends</u> - <u>nothing more</u>, &amp; I hope we shall never be less. She is not a marrying woman - declares she never will marry any man upon earth, &amp; I believe she will not. <u>She certainly will never marry me</u>. She is a Poet of a good deal of genius &amp; I have several of her poems now in my hands to have published - besides she is very beautiful. Now ain't you jealous? She sometimes comes to Richmond &amp; when you are mistress of my household I shall want you to invite her to visit us. If there had been any truth in our reported engagement, I shouldn't have so hopelessly fallen a victim in Mecklenburg last August. I dont deny that I felt <ins>once</ins> mighty tender towards Miss Parke, but it has all ended in nothing but an abiding friendship - and when I see her in Richmond this winter I'll tell her I belong to you, and ask her if she isn't sorry?</p> <p>Now what are the other "jokes" - I am honest &amp; own up to the truth like a man. I send you a slip from a Richmond paper of this week shewing how near you will have a church to go to.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Devotedly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.D.

What are the "ugly words" you are mad about in my letter? I always try to use sweet words to my dearest little sweetheart. "Bye bye" with a kiss.</p></div>
