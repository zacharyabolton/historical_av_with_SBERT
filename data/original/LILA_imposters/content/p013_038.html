We are having very cool weather for the season, in fact really cold -- but it must come warm weather before long, and then must open again this bloody drama -- how many, "now full of lusty life" will meet their fate the coming year -- ! God grant that all may be ready &amp; prepared for any event that may come -- I pray that my life may be spared for my family, but I feel a calm resignation to the will of the Most High, perfectly satisfied that he will do all things well -- </p> <p> I went over to the 31<sup>st</sup> Va. <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> this P. M. to see some of the boys I had known in the Mts -- they are from Beveryly&amp; Huttonsville -- a hardy &amp; brave set -- I paid Lt. Louy ($100) one hundred Dollars that Dr. Butcher owed him, and enclosed you will find the <abbr expan="receipt">recpt</abbr>, which you will please put away with my Butcher Papers, carefully, and let me know if it came safely to hand -- I also enclos you twenty Dollars -- I am going to write to Mr. Walker to come down and spend two weeks here, laboring as Dr. Lacy invites in the "central", I can keep him in my tent &amp; lend him my horse or find him one to ride -- and he can take charge of some eatables for me and bring them down -- I am contriving some way to send home, how I have not yet decided -- The last of my butter will be eaten tomorrow morning, the pickles have departed &amp; we are now engaged on rice &amp; molasses, with fruit variations. We shall soon obey the scripture injunction and take no thought of what are eat or drink, for it will be one thing, bread only , and will require no thought -- Put up pickles for us if you can, but I reckon your stock is low -- mayhap you can get a few cabbages of some one for the purpose &amp; cut them up so they will pack close &amp; make much in little. I had a horrible headache Sunday, but had my hair cut &amp; a hot bath for my head &amp; got well -- am very well now -- I have absolutely nothing to write &amp; am as dull and stupid as I can well be so expect little and excuse this -- Boswell is writing to his sweet heart -- all wrapt up in his own thoughts &amp; I will go to bed - - so good night &amp; God bless you all</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed. Hotchkiss</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Dont omit to write often - - good news from <i>[unclear: a far]</i> country, you know its effects -- Tell Mr. Walker what I say if you see him &amp; ask him if he will accept the hospitalities of my bed and board for a time</p></div>
