At a time like this when our country is shrouded in gloom, when so many heart-rending scenes have been witnessed, when bitter tears are gushing forth from eyes unused to weep, to some the parting of schoolgirls might seems so insignificant as not even to deserve a passing remark. To us it is different; we feel it, oh! how deeply we feel it, may be seen by the many sad attentive countenances that now surround me: and still more plainly have we seen it in the gentle words and looks of the last few weeks. The very thought of parting seemed to soften each <i>[unclear: tone]</i>, and melt each breast, all past wrongs and injuries were forgotten, each <i>[unclear: caused]</i> to forget her own case and comfort as she eagerly sought the welfare of her compranion, remembering as she did so only her good qualities, and the many pleasant scenes through which they had passed together. A few months ago we met in this hall as strangers. And well we remember that feeling of loneliness, that longing for home, which at first would steal over us causing us to feel as sad and lonely as it was possible for strangers to feel. But when at last our house was full, all restraint was banished, and it was then that our happiness began to show [missing section] bright faces of our little circle. [missing section] possible to feel lonely or foresaken [missing section] one of our <del hand="h1">number</del> little number [missing section] and around her, those who were [missing section] many were there to under those [missing section] the troubled heart, and which [missing section] the distressed.</p> <p>The many pleasant remembrances of the blissful past will follow us through life! How long will our memories dwell with rapture upon the gay winter evenings when we gathered all around the firewood and so attentively listened to the reading of some interesting book, that the dismal howling of the stormy wind, as it mournfully swept through the deserted streets, scarcely reached our cars. The dreary days of winter glided as quietly and swiftly by, that nothing intervened but what seemed to concur in bringing some pleasure, some enjoyment, to animate and kindle hope, was in the heart of the most cheerless. Can we ever forget the merry old times we have had in the hall together, the many delightful walks we have taken, and all those pleasures which ever throw a charm around school life? No! each spot is consecratad by the remembrance of some pleasant scene that occurred there, and our hearts will be forever bound to these old familiar walls by all the endearing recollections of you. It was in this spot that those tender ties which bind friend<del hand="h1">s</del> to friend were first formed and that pure and lasting friendship which will ever be remembered by us as pilgrims remember the flowing fountain in the burning sands of the desert. Though the life of a school girls may have some crosses, some inconveniences, yet it may be truly said that the hours spent at [missing section] period of our lives. We may [missing section] passing our youthful days [missing section] year advances, changes must [missing section] stern, old age have some [missing section] when the hair has turned [missing section] have give up their brightness [missing section] blasted and our hearts have been seared and blighted by contact with the <u>deceitful</u>, outer world, then, oh! then will we look back upon the happy days spent at school and sigh bitterly that they can come no more. But while my heart would fain linger over those endearing charms which ever throw a fragrance over the pleasant retreat and the many dear friends tht we have formed there, time is hurrying us on and I must muster to close. A few hours more the last farewell will have been spoken and we will be travelling here and there, scattering far and wide, returning to the loved ones at home. Some of us expect to return after vacation. Others of you go hence to return no more, certain it is that we will never all meet here again.</p> <p>I know that our minds have been improved by our short sojourn here, and that we are better fitted to <i>[unclear: aslorn]</i> society and <del hand="h1">that we</del> to enjoy all the refined pleasures of literature. Can I not say that our hearts have kept pace with our minds, that they [missing section] forth into the world, purer, [missing section] <i>[unclear: which]</i> we may be <i>[unclear: called]</i> [missing section]</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
