In answer I would say that his prospect for making a comfortable subsistence are very good. He has been working very diligently and has a garden which promises an abundant supply of vegetables. Since living in my property he has conducted himself very well. He will, I have no doubt, provide comfortably for the girl if intrusted to his charge, and I think needs her services very much at this time.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Andrew Hilmes</p></div> <!---->
