I notice all you say and am sorry to see you in such a disponding moode, though dont see how you can be otherwise being left alone &amp; have no help &amp;c, but we must hope for better times soon. I think the tables are about being turned and we may be able to be constantly together.</p> <p>I have set several times to start down since I came back but it seems that about the time I have all arranged to leave our forces fall back from Martinsburg and when they advance again we dont get the reliable word until about the time they start back I had set tomorrow again to start down but cant get a buggy until friday &amp; again we learn that our Army have fallen back to Millcreek so I will have again to put off starting until I can learn that the way is open, for if I can<sup> <sup>t</sup> </sup> get home I care nothing about being in that neighborhood but from what we learn here I think the way will soon be open and kept clear for sometime and <del hand="h1">get</del> give me a fair chance it is a hard tramp to make &amp; to be foiled when most there it is too hard</p> <p>I have found a little irish girl who wants a home. she was a chamber maid in this Hotel before we got it and bore a very good name the proprietor kept her in his family she agrees to go and live with you and make that her home. I pay her fair down and pay her $5 <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> month. I have told her what the work will be (house work) you take her and put her to work at this bargain. you put her in a room to herself to lodge on the porch or at the head of the stairs and not to room with you all. I think she is honest &amp; trusty &amp; will suit you well dont hesitate to put her at anything you have to do, and dont make too free with her as it might spoil her <ins>she sews well</ins> get some one to cut your wood get M<sup>r</sup> Staub to get you some one dont think of getting <ins>along</ins> the way you have been doing try this girl &amp; if you cant make her suit, I will send you Louise &amp; run the chances of loosing her as you shall not be put too so much for assistance</p> <p>Or if upon reflection you would prefer coming out here just write me at once &amp; I will have you brought out at once and let the property take chances, as I would much prefer having you all here comfortable and loose the property to having you grabbing your way along as you write me We are still doing considerable business here I have been offering my interest here for sale and rent we could sell now for about $175,000<sup> <sup>00</sup> </sup> in <abbr expan="Confederate">Confed<sup> <sup>t</sup> </sup></abbr> funds but then the query is what to do with the money now &amp; this is not the worth of the property we are now asking $300,000<sup> <sup>00</sup> </sup> and think we can get 2 at most anytime but we must make this pay as much as possible. I want at least to be even when this war is over &amp; wish to be something ahead</p> <p>If I were to stay at home as you intimate I think that I would be arrested and required to take the <u>Oath</u> or be sent off and imprisoned during the war. the <u>oath</u> I wont take and and of course to be imprisoned would seperate me from you and yet I would not have my liberties or any chance to make something for you in future so of the two it is [section cut off] me to be here and make somthing for us. My inclination of course it to be with you constantly as my course up to the beginning of the war will show <ins>scarcely</ins> ever staying from home over night &amp;c &amp;c-</p> <p>If you prefer coming out here dont hesitate to say so &amp; you shall come &amp; I will make you as comfortable as I possibly can in Dixie</p> <p>I have got hold of $20 more green backs which I send you. apply it as you chose. it is quite scarce here &amp; hard to get hold of, but I will still try &amp; get some &amp; will send you and as you have the chance get us such things as <del hand="h1">we</del> we may need</p> <p>I will come down as soon as I can learn positively the way is clear to Martinsburg. I learn that Jacob Thomas has gone to the Yankees that is heavy work I would rather cut my throat that to be so treacherous and heap up such a stigma on my family but these are strange times, hard to fathem depths</p> <p>Tell moses I will try &amp; do the very best I can <del hand="h1">for</del> with his &amp; Wilsons fund<sup>s</sup> but have not as yet determine what is best to do with it.</p> <p>You try &amp; keep this girl &amp; if you come out &amp; she wishes to come along bring her out also. I have no directions to give about our business there as all seems to be conducted as well as I could direct it from here</p> <p>Take good care of yourselves keep plenty of every thing on hand If smallpox there is too dangerous there move from the house out to the mill with Henry</p> <p>I will be down as soon as can Write soon God bless you all</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours ever</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John Quincy Adams">J Q A</abbr> Nadenbousch</div> <!---->
