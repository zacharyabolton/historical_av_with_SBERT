The <i>[unclear: careless]</i> manner in which such cases have been disposed of - their marked indifference to the interests of the freedpeople - their <i>[unclear: unconquerable]</i> prejudice against the colored race &amp;c &amp;c all tend to deepen the conviction in my mind that the <u>necessity</u> for the establishment of Provost Courts in each county of <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> is more evident than ever and especially is this the case in this portion of the state. I have at the same time no cases of injustice to report by reason of the aforementioned fact viz. most of the difficulties in which Freedmen are concerned are not sent to the Civil Courts but settled in this office.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am General, Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="obedient">obt</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Svt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jno W.
