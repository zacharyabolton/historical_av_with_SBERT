He fought like a hero all day with his company and in the evening in making a charge on the enemy he rushed on and became separated from his company and fell in with the Hillsborough Border Guards whare he did good service until just at dark when my Brother who fought with him during the day and was then detailed to bring off our <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> Howitzers saw him and Clinton waved his hat to him and cheered him on.</p> <p>The fight was just <i>[unclear: closing]</i> and Clinton going on to the river bank, when within thirty yards of the bluffs the enemy discharged one more and the last volley when Clinton fell with a ball shot through his heart.</p> <p>His last words were come on Boys let's give them one more charge. He fought fearlessly and well, but poor fellow, I fear he was too rash.</p> <p>I sometimes think if he had have had less courage he would not have been killed.</p> <p>He thought it his duty to defend to the uttermost his native country and in so doing sacrificed his life.</p> <p>Poor Clinton, He sleeps his last <del hand="h1">sleep</del> long happy sleep May he rest in peace I will plant the rose as you requested.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your sympathetic friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thaddeus A.
