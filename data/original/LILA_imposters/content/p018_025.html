Monaghan of the 6<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="Louisiana">La.</abbr> was killed -- &amp; Col. Wolf of one of the Western Va. Regts. Gen. Gordon was struck by a glancing ball, in the forhead &amp; bled profusely, but was not much hurt -- he did not get off his horse or stop to have his wound dressed but pressed on after the enemy all sprinkled over with blood -- the very personification of a hero -- The Yankees say they lost 500 in the fight -- I suppose 100 will cover all our casualties -- Our cavalry went on to Williamsport &amp; today will cross the river We shall also move -- The Yanks will not get much rest here Gen. Early believes in motion &amp; keeping them well stirred up -- We never stay more than 2 or 3 days in one camp -- The country owes much to Gen. Early -- &amp; his vigilance I think will keep this Valley safe from incursions of the enemy - </p> <p> I hope my letter with the ribbons &amp;c in, my box with the cups &amp; saucers &amp; Tumblers &amp;c, &amp; the little bundle with the bonnet pattern in, have all gotten to you safely -- If you do not like the bonnet pattern you can sell it. I will get everything I can for you - rest assured my dear One -- I want to send you some money but the comunications are so uncertain -- I will send before long -- I have not heard from you by letter for a long time -- two weeks at least -- but Jacob Henger told me you were all well &amp; quieted my fears that you might be sick -- but do write -- I long to hear from you &amp; have an ardent desire to come home, but no chance while we are so busy &amp; if we can only end the war I am perfectly willing to endure this season of activity -- the signs are brightening &amp; I still confidently <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> a conclusion of hostilities with the ending of "Old Abe's" reign -- I have not time to write more now -- Kiss the children for me, they must be good girls -- I hope Mary is doing all she can to please you -- if she is industrious &amp; diligint I will bring or send her a present, tell her -- Write to me often --</p> <p> Good bye &amp; my the Lord bless you all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your loving husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
