As to the popular vote on the Ordinance of Secession.</p> <p>There is not a shadow of doubt as to the <i>[unclear: verification]</i> of the Ordinance by a vote which, for unanimity, has no example in the history of popular elections.</p> <p>Many of our people do not believe in what is called the "right of Secession," but they all maintain the right of revolution, and they are all agreed that the time has come to exercise it.</p> <p>In the midst of their efforts for Union and Peace, war has been thrust upon them, and they have no idea of calling for "quarter," either by vote or otherwise, before the fight begins.</p> <p>2nd. As to the course of the Union men in Virginia.</p> <p>There are no Union men left in Virginia.</p> <p>The moment it appeared beyond question that the people of the North, without distinction of party, were clamorous for a war of invasion and subjugation against us, our people accepted disunion as a fixed and irrevokable fact, and we stand this day a united people, ready with one mind and one voice, with one heart and one arm to make good the eternal separation which we have declared.</p> <p>The issue of peace or war is in the hands of the North. We only ask to be let alone, and to be allowed to consult our interest and our safety in peace. If this is denied to us, mark the prediction, we will give you a fight which will stand out upon the page of history an example for all time of the determination with which a people can make war when they are conscious of having exhausted all honorable means of pacification.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am sir, very respectfully,<br> Your obedient <abbr expan="servant">serv't</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>JOHN B.
