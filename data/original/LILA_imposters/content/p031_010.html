At the time of writing to <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Schofield I did not know that you were established at Staunton or I should have written to you instead. I have no complaint to make of an official, either Military or Judicial as I believe they are all prompt executing the law when called upon. That which I complain of as being <u>intolerable</u> is horse stealing and the trouble is to get officials on the task in time and not in any want of of promptness on their part. In Some neighborhoods in Augusta County the citizens are forming themselves into vigilance committees for their own protection against this nuisance, and we were about doing the same, and I had written to the <abbr expan="General">Gen<sup>l</sup></abbr> as one of the Committee for instructions not wishing to go into an arrangement of that kind unless with the sanction of the Commandment of this <abbr expan="District">Dis<sup>t</sup></abbr> horse stealing has highly become intolerable here a short time since there were five horses Stolen from this immediate neighborhood in one night from different persons the <ins>time</ins> that would, necessarily have been consumed in getting officials would have enabled them <ins>(the theives)</ins> to make their escape but by pursuing them at once they were over taken in the north mountain and the horses recovered. But for want of arms the theives escaped which is to be regreted by every law abiding citizen. Since then there have been other horses stolen in the neighbourhood, no doubt by the same individuals so that no one was safe at any time. It was with a view to break up this band of marauders that the letter was written and not designing to call in question the <i>[unclear: promptness]</i> of any offical whatever <del hand="h1">(Scratched out writing)</del> Hoping this explanation may be satisfactory. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I Remain<br>Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.F. <u>Earman</u></p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.
