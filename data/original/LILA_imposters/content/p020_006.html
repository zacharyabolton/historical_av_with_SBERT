Tis useless for me to undertake to give you an idea of the pleasure it affords me to receive a letter from you or to discribe the feeling &amp; interest with which each &amp; every line is carefully read. Would that I could be the recipient of such dear letters every day but truly it is a pleasure that such a character as I do not deserve. Well Christmas is over, it past very quietly with me I met with no gay crowds or rather visited no place where there was merry making. Christmas day I went to Church &amp; heard a very good &amp; appropriate Surmon delivered by Doctor Duncan of this City in the after noone I called on a friend for a Short time &amp; at night went to Church again. Thus past the day making the fourth Christmas Since the war all of which I have spent away from home. The only treat I had during this Christmas week was the receipt of you Ever welcome letter which was handed me yesterday about noone. I am just learning how to appreciate such pleasures. it was always very agreeable to me to correspond with my friend, but situated as I am now makes it doubly so. a way from my home &amp; among Entire strangers leaves me quite a lonely life, it is truly more monotonous here than it was in all my Experiences in camp. tis true, I believe that I have made many freinds while here but I am deprived of the social comforts that I enjoyed with my company for there, I have a fond brother whose society has been the greatest source of my pleasure ever since I have been old enough to duly appreciate a brothers love and were I deprived of a correspondance with you <u>dear Kate</u> - dreary, &amp; all most comfortless, would be Every hour of my life. Just think what a pleasure to have some dear loved one who, though separated from me by many miles, still I have the pleasure of speaking with though it be through the silent medium of the pen, tis truly gratifying believing as I do that I am honored to night with this pleasure of writing to one who loves me with <u>a pure sisterly unselfish love</u> on whose word I may, with impunity confide, believing that her pure heart knows no treachery, one whom I love above all others of her sex, save her to whom I have given my heart &amp; hand, with the promise that the arm &amp; hand which wields this pen shall shield her fragile form, through a life time that I hope may be as pleasantly ahead as the few short hours are now in writing to my dear Sister Kate.</p> <p>You stated in your letter that you wished to know how many brothers &amp; sisters I have. I have four brothers &amp; four sisters. There are nine of us in all. My Father and Mother are both living. My Father is nearly 75 years old. My Mother about 66. I am the youngest son living, I have one sister younger than my self. She is the youngest child &amp; she is grown. Well Kate last Tuesday the 20<sup>th</sup> one year ago we parted a day Ever to be remembered by me. what wonderful changes has taken place since that Eventfull day.

I have found that my ideas of physiognomy &amp; human nature in my slight observation has served me justly. you have proved to be the realization or rather the result of my course has been a realization of what might have been termed a castle built in the air for you are all that I had fancied you were in my silent musings <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> simple language, <u>a pure hearted kind affectionate good girl</u>.</p> <p>Well dear Kate, I will not impose any longer on your patience, but will close my uninteresting &amp; uninstructive letter. you must remember me kindly to your dear parents &amp; your sisters. say to your Sisters that I am glad to hear that they are so merry hope you all spent a gay Christmas.
