In my opinion taking into consideration the time of the year, he kept him, when he was of but little Service to him. I think he has paid him enough unless the Boy is made to comply with his contract &amp; serve the Balance of the Year in which event Mr. S. ought to pay Balance &amp; not otherwise.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Rspy</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M.
