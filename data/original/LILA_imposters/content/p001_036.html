Our company has been transfered to the Wise Legion.</p> <p>I would have written to you that we would pass Staunton but I feard that you would not receive my letter in time and would be more disappointed at not seeing me if you had started for the purpose tha if you had not known of it until now.</p> <p>We will be mustered into service this evening for the war. It has all along been my wish to join for the war and I was glad that the company determined to serve during the entire war.</p> <p>There is nothing of importance going on here. We are busily engaged in drilling raw recruits and getting ready for a fight in the north West.</p> <p>We will start tomorrow morning for Charlestown in Kanawha <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> where we intend to establisg our head quarters at least for the war. </p> <p>I cannot say when I will be able to come to Augusta but hope it will be soon. Direct your letter to me at Charlestown Kanawha <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> Care of <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> O.J. Wise. All are well with us and in fine spirits. Hoping that this will find all well I remain as ever your affectionate son </p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John">J.</abbr> H.
