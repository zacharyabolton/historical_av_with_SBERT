Maj. Reger goes to Staunton &amp; will take this We have come back here to recruit -- I shall be able to come home in a few days -- as soon as Maj. Reger gets back -- and I will then see that all things are properly fixed. I was a little sick last night, for the first time since I left home. I went up to Felix Hull's and begged a cup of tea &amp; was much relieved by it &amp; the slept <u>well</u>, on the ground floor of my tent. We would be very comfortable if the sun <abbr expan="would">wd</abbr> only come out for a few hours -- It will not be more than a week before I shall come home -- &amp; then I should know what I shall do all the time. I cannot come now If have not yet got any of the things you say you have so kindly sent me -- They can now be left here -- we are encamped by the side of the road where they cross the bridge. I wish you could come out here -- I do wonder if Harvey Bear would not hitch up his carriage &amp; bring you &amp; his wife out for a day &amp; see us -- it is only one days ride. God bless you -- good by my love Love to all --</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
