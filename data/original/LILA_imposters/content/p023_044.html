I was obliged at the first of the month (and also the last of Jan.) to lose a number of days. I regretted it exceedingly, but it could not be helped. I went into my School again as soon as I was able, but I found it did not make as much difference with the <u>Scholars</u> as it did with <u>myself</u>, for when I opened school again it was "Miss Annie, while you was sick I went through <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> not come to school," and after hearing them recite I found they had learned a "heap." I have a promising "First Reader" Class. (it being the second I have promoted) and two or three other Classes are nearly through the "Green Back" the second time. they are very anxious to know if they are to take the First Reader after they get through "dis yere time." the interest in both Day and Night Schools could not be better. it is very encouraging to me to see them so eager for knowledge. I have an interesting First Reader Class in my Night school which I enjoy very much. I have to select a <u>monitor</u> from it every night to teach the Alphabet Class. if it was not for <u>that</u> it would be impossible for me to get around <u>once</u>. I think I am safe in saying, that <u>every night</u> some one <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> from the house <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> have time to hear <u>all</u> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. One Young Girl came to me three months ago and just knew her letters. she could not read one word. <u>now</u>, she is reading in the "First Reader" we were all very sorry to lose our friend, Mr. Coan, it seems that we have lost a friend indeed, each and all of us thought he was <u>the</u> man for <u>the</u> place, hoping that this may meet with your approval, I am </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mrs Annie A.
