I consented to serve at the request of the <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr>, when it was not at all probable that another person could have been induced to occupy the position, owing to the noted disloyalty of the Citizens, and the prejudice existing against the existance of the Bureau. I am a poor man and owing to the prejudice against me, on account of my known loyalty to the Government, and my connection with the Bureau, I have but exceedingly limited means to support myself.</p> <p>Therefore I respectfully ask that you will use your influence and power, as Chief of the Bureau, with the view to accord to me remuneration, however moderate, for the service I have rendered to the Freedmen; every one of whom would cheerfully endorse this application if it was deemed necessary, and I do further assure you I should not have made this application but for my pecuniary embarrasment, as I served without expectation of pecuniary reward.</p> <p>I am a returned refugee, an unconditional loyal man, and a Virginian. With reference to this application, allow me to refer you to Mr. F.S. Tukey, <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> at this place.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir, Your <abbr expan="obedient servant">obt. srvt.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Wm J Dews</p></div> <!---->
