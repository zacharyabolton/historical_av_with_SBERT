Pendleton was mortally wounded, just at dark &amp; we had to leave him in Woodstock -- I am truly sorry for his young wife -- he was one of the best officers in the army &amp; it will be difficult to fill his place -- William got scared in the stampede &amp; I have not seen him yet, but hear that he went up the road badly "demoralized" Thanks to a Kind Providence I escaped -- my horse was hit by the fragments of a shell &amp; one piece struck my had but did no damage -- If William comes home I want him to come back -- I do not want Mr. Geedings to sell my horse for less than 15 or $1600 -- Love to all write soon Don't get the "blues" all will yet be well -- Don't know of any one you know hurt -- Good bye &amp; God bless you </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
