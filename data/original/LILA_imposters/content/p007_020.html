At our last encampment we <br> were placed in an open field, under a burning <br> sun &amp; orders to be at your posts &amp; had to stay <br> there for four days. The enemy were all the while <br> stationed at Martinsburgh 6 &amp;half; miles off.</p> <p>General Johnston sent <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> to <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Patterson <br> who is in command of the enemies forces <br> to send away the women &amp; children from Martins <ins>burgh</ins> <br> but he refused &amp; sent back word that if he (<ins>Johnston</ins>) would <br> lay down his arms &amp; return home the he (Patterson) <br> would forgive all past offences. <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Johnston offered him battle for four days, if he would <br> come out of Martinsburgh but he would not do <br> it and John <ins>s</ins>ton thinking his numbers too great <br> being at lea<ins>st</ins> twenty five &amp; perhaps thirty thousand <br> &amp; a reinforcement of 5 thousand at the Potomac <br> at some point between Harpers Ferry and Shepherds-<br> town and his position too strong, thought it <br> advisable to fall back &amp; so we have had no <br> battle yet, but on Saturday evening<sup>[2]</sup> a dispatch <br> was brought to the General that our pickets <br> had been driven in &amp; that the enemy were advan-<br> cing: we were soon drawn up in battle array <br> &amp; advanced to a position, after having been <br> on the field about <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> <ins>two</ins> hours, we were taken back <br> to quarters, it having turned out to be simply <br> a fight between the pickets; the enemy not coming. <br> Jackson on that morning received a letter <br> from <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee congratulating him upon his <br> promotion to brigadier General, the letter<br> came in advance of the official announcement. <br> While on the field the two Generals made <br> a review of the troops Johnston of all of the forces <br> &amp; Jackson of the Virginia brigade. </p> <p> I like Johnston's appearance very well; I think <br> he is a very prudent commander: indeed the same is <br> true of both: you know "prudence is the better part <br> of valor."<sup>[3]</sup> What is going to be done I don't know; <br> the soldiers never know the intentions of their com-<br> manders until it comes to execution; so we here in <br> camp have as little idea of an intended action <br> as you. I suppose the Yankee papers will glory over <br> our falling back as an inglorious <ins> and precipitan</ins> retreat; but <br> call it by what name you please I think that <br> Johnston knows what he is about &amp; am very willing <br> to obey his orders, although it did pester me a good <br> deal for a while &amp; does yet somewhat, to go at <br> things as it were blindfolded. <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> Even suppo-<br> sing that we could have whipped them, it would <br> have been at too great a loss of life &amp; consequently <br> it is more prudent to retire. How soon we <br> will have an engagement I can't tell you; but <br> there must be one at some time or another. </p> <p> The result of the fight that took place on Tuesday <br> the 2<sup>nd</sup> I suppose Andrew gave you very correctly; <br> on our side <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> three killed &amp; four or five wounded. <br> The most reliable report we get <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> in regard <br> to the loss of the Federal forces comes from <br> Mr. Boteler, a brother of <abbr expan="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Alex Boteler, <br> who says he had it from the quartermaster of <br> their army to this effect: that there were <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> <br> from three to five hundred in killed &amp; wounded <br> however true this is I think that there is no <br> doubt that their loss was considerable.<sup>[4]</sup><br> The number engaged on our side was <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> <ins>the whole (except one company)</ins> <br> <del hand="h1">illeg/</del> of Harper's regiment <ins>and one piece of canon</ins>: on the enemies there <br> was supposed to be about 3000 a great many <br> of them being regulars.<sup>[5]</sup> </p> <p>Since writing the above I <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> hear through one <br> of our company who has been at Winchester, that <br> they are throwing up a breastwork about one mile <br> on this side of town; which looks very much like <br> making a stand here, I didn't suppose however <br> that we would retire beyond Winchester.</p> <p>Billy Wilson received a letter from home, a day or <br> two ago, which brought the news that Edgar Wilson,<br> whilst capping his pistol, shot himself in the foot, shooting off <br> one toe &amp; another almost off.<sup>[6]</sup> I heard from Gam Dalhouse<br> a day or two ago, he was then improving with a prospect <br> of getting well. John D. Brooks<sup>[7]</sup> &amp; all my acquaintances <br> are very well. We have just perused yours and aunt Martha's <sup>[8]</sup><br> letters. On their way down McComb and Baskins <sup>[9]</sup> heard at <br> Bunkers hill, a village between Winchester &amp; our camp, that <br> we had sent back all the baggage, except so much as we <br> could carry &amp; accordingly left their knapsacks there &amp; our letters <br> with them &amp; did not get them again until this evening.<br> Aunt Martha wrote that Mr. Lee was taken prisoner by <br> the Georgians, our own troops. I didn't understand <br> it at all; he has not turned traitor has he? <sup>[10]</sup></p> <p>We heard yesterday that Lincoln message recommends <br> calling for 400,000 more men &amp; 400,000,000 of dollars. <br> I don't <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> know where he will get the <br> money from. Andrew joins in sending love to all <br> at home and Uncle Ben's <sup>[11]</sup>. Remember us both very <br> especially to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Murkland; we would like to <br> be there to see them, but more especially the folks <br> at home. I was sorry to hear of Father's sickness <br> but I hope ere this shall have reached you he will be <br> restored to his wonted health. I regretted very much <br> <ins>not</ins> seeing Willie and Elick Murkland. <del hand="h1">illeg</del> <br> To night Andrew is pretty well again. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I have nothing more to write.
