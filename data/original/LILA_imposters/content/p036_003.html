Thompson claims to have information that his horse is not branded and was claimed by <abbr expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Long as <ins>his</ins> private property when <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee's army surrendered. Thompson attempted to reclaim the horse immediately after it was taken from his stable, but while he was seeking evidence required, the command to which <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Hunter was attached left Staunton, taking off the horse. Thompson bean an excellent character and reliable neighbors say there will be no difficulty in identifying the horse which was well known as a valuable animal of Morgan stock. I am further informed that the horse was taken by <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Hunter without any authority whatever and has never been known as a public animal. I have the honor to request such enquiry be made as will restore the horse to Hiram Thompson if above fact can be proved. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully<br><abbr expan="Your obedient servant">Yr obt serv.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> P.
