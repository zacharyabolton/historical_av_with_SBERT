He, therefore, was "compelled to rely on memory and very imperfect memoranda, in reproducing the <u>substance</u> of your remarks."</p> <p>Thus, not pretending to give your <u>words</u> or <u>phrases</u>, he publishes as a part of the substance of your remarks, on the occasion named, the following passage: - </p> <p>"Mr Stuart referred to the opposition which had been made to the mission and action of the "Nine," and to the unjust reflections which had been made on their proceedings. He adverted to the opposite sources from which criticism came. Governors <u>Wells</u> and <u>Wise</u> were <u>pulling together in the same team</u>, and the Richmond Enquirer and the Radical Journal were in full accord in opposing the "Movement," and George Pye, Yankee Allen and D<sup>r</sup>. Bayne found coadjutors in Augusta! <u>It was an alliance of the Carpet-baggers and the fire-eaters from which no good could come</u>! <u>Gov. Wise had written five letters he understood in opposition, but he thought the history of the last eight years</u> proved that Gov. Wise was not a safe counselor."</p> <p>The allusions, personal to me, contained in this report, published in a paper friendly to you in the town of your residence, authorize me to ask you whether it is in <u>substance</u> correct? or, whether it is approved and sanctioned by you?</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I have the honor to be - Yours respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Henry A.
