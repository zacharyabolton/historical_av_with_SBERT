It is 92 miles they got on the cars for Richmond &amp; part of our Regment went with them &amp; we are staying here till they come back. We will then start back to Winchester &amp; then on to Maryland I expect for our army is gong there now. There is prisoners coming our army is cuting a big swag at the present is the scale. Dont think we had a good time coming through the Valley. We could get milk &amp; butter, plenty milk, 5 cents a quart &amp; butter 50 cents per pound. I spent money every day for mild. I cannot tell you how much was captured from the Yankees at Winchester &amp; Martensburg but it was a great deal of property &amp; 5000 prisoners.
