As to the crop of <u>Corn</u> &amp; <u>Potatoes</u> raised by Toby Taylor (Ellens Husband) I will say that I had to study awhile before I knew what it meant; then I recollected that told Toby that he might have a piece of corn (about an Acre) if he would attend to it; but unfortunately for him he took sick and died before the corn was gathered.</p> <p>I also told him he might have a piece of ground for <u>Potatoes</u>; he planted them, <del hand="h1">and died before they came</del> but they were never gathered in, they rotted in the ground. This you see was before the negroes were free (in 1864) so I think I am clear of that.</p> <p>As to <u>Ellen's</u> <u>wages</u>, I told her when she first was set free that I would give her her victuals &amp; clothes if she would stay with me. She stayed until about 2 months ago, when she left; and now I think it would be great injustice for me to have to repay her.</p> <p>I sent you a note by A. Smith stating that I would be in town in a few days &amp; see you but other arrangements makes me write this to you instead. I hope this will make all things right.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours <abbr expan="Respectfully">Res</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Sarah A.
