Stribling, &amp; the place of <abbr expan="Deputy">D</abbr> Sheriff of the County at the same time. <i>[unclear: Sff]</i> Woodward did the sheriffs part of the business, Kinney attended to the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> During the time of this joint business, there were two run a way Negroes <i>[unclear: sold]</i> out of Jail, on the same day, Churchman who acted at the time as <abbr expan="Deputy">D</abbr> Sheriff of one of one half the County sold one &amp; Woodward the other; the course of business as you know is the <abbr expan="Deputy Sheriff">D.S.</abbr> reports the amount of sale to the <abbr expan="Clerk">Ck</abbr>, the Clerk certifies it to the auditor, so that when the <abbr expan="Deputy Sheriff">D.S.</abbr> attends the auditor for settlement, charges of this kind are made to appear against him, in the sale above refered to, the sale of Churchman's Negro sold as <i>[unclear: a restaid]</i> was certified, Woodwards was not, and it was a mere accident that the money on the last mentioned sale was <i>[unclear: wirpared]</i> into the treasury, the circumstances of the case come out in this way. Churchman some year or two afterwards, had sold another Negro out of Jail taken about paying the money to the auditor spoke of the former sales, the auditor said he did not recollect of but one Negro's sale being accounted for, this led to an investigation, and it was found, but one had been reported, Mr. D. W. Patterson, as heinformed me, informed Mr. Kinney of this <i>[unclear: omission]</i> the money was of course immediately paid into the treasury--Now I would ask any <i>[unclear: replacting]</i> whether this <i>[unclear: omission]</i> was by design or not, would not the fact of certifying the sale of the Negro by Churchman, call up to the mind of a man, <i>[unclear: situated]</i> as Kinney <i>[unclear: was]</i> the sale of the Negro by Woodward???</p> <p>Another case, in which I was concerned, in May 1831 a short time before I was ejected by honor Judge Thompson &amp; Mr. Kinney appointed to my Office, about $800.00 was paid into Court as the case of <i>[unclear: Paseter]</i> &amp; <abbr expan="agent">agt.</abbr> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>, as soon as the money was <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> I loaned it to Thomas J. <i>[unclear: Michie]</i> and of course took his bond as the security for it, I will here remark that when I went out of office, I had a good deal of public money loaned out to some of my friends, which I did not wish to go into Mr Kinneys hand, for several reasons, therefore ask <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> to retain the bond as <i>[unclear: reiceived]</i> (which his honor most graciously awarded) &amp; pay the money as it might be called for which <i>[unclear: good]</i> for several years, <i>[unclear: mild nearly]</i> all the money in my hands was paid out, in the case above referred to that collected of Miche &amp; feared <i>[unclear: over]</i> as well as I can recall <i>[unclear: ect]</i> some three hundred &amp; odd dollars in 1837, being a great deal. From <i>[unclear: home]</i> at the time I determined to transfer the bond of Mche in this cast to Mr Kinney as <i>[unclear: reciever]</i> of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> which I <i>[unclear: rcd]</i>, at the same time I filed amongst the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> in the case a statement sharing the amount of money rcd. &amp; the amount <i>[unclear: year'd]</i> &amp;c sharing a balance due <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> of <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> $750, with interest from 1837. You may Judge of my astonishment when in Charlottesville in 1853, on reciving a notice from <i>[unclear: Court Henderson stationy]</i>that Mr W Kinney was <i>[unclear: ringing]</i> the payment of the <i>[unclear: appointment]</i> balance in the interest as due from me Immediately and sued <i>[unclear: Herndon]</i>, that I had not a <i>[unclear: card]</i> of momey in my hands in the case, and asked him to get Mr. Kinney to <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> his papers, and see if he could find any <i>[unclear: hav]</i> of this <i>[unclear: money]</i> he said he did so, and <i>[unclear: he denied]</i> that he had ever any thing to do with it, or know any thing about it--in this state of the case &amp; found it necessary to visit Staunton, I had kept a book, in which I <i>[unclear: sol]</i> down the receipt of <i>[unclear: palker]</i> money to whom loand &amp;c, on looking into this book I found a statement showing all about the matter, and on <i>[unclear: sacing]</i> Mr Miche he stated he had made required payments on the bond, &amp; that Kinneys <i>[unclear: lite]</i> held it with a balance due-<i>[unclear: him]</i> My opinion is that Kinney <i>[unclear: thought]</i> as I was two thousand miles off &amp; as <i>[unclear: seven]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> had <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> he could <i>[unclear: throu]</i> the chains on me, &amp; thus <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> some fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars. He did not think I could explain after such a long time, nor perhaps should I had it not beef for the <i>[unclear: minco landam]</i> which I kept <i>[unclear: admil]</i> he acted <i>[unclear: Cowardly]</i> on this matter, about which I shall, <i>[unclear: soull]</i> can hardly <del hand="h1"></del> it was an unpardonable piece of neligence, on his part not to be able to give any amount of such a large sum of money which had in <i>[unclear: partpass]</i> &amp; <i>[unclear: recipt]</i> his <i>[unclear: hands]</i>. That he has used the public money I never had a doubt because I have heard numerous complaints of his not paying out money in his hands, belonging to cases when called for a long time, indeed for years, and see it was the <i>[unclear: Cassione]</i> course pursued towards him by the Judge, that I heard it charged that it was supposed the Judge had himselfborrowed some of the money--but I was glad to hear Mr. Stuart say he had <i>[unclear: asiamined]</i> into the matter and he did not think it was the case--I <i>[unclear: wonder Chocran]</i> and not charge him with withholding the public money where colled for this charge could easily have been sustained I could give you some more of Mr. Kinney <del hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> but it hardly <i>[unclear: anch]</i> while</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectuflly Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W<u>m</u> S.
