I was sorry to hear that "Ma" has neurolgia -- I am a full convert to open fires again -- I have felt so much better, every way, since using them &amp; shall surely "turn out" the Latrobe as Ma desires -- In fact I wish you would open &amp; use the fire place at once, only firing up the "heater" when very cold -- I think you would all be benefitted by it -- I was <u>astounded</u> to hear that Stiles had come -- I had no idea that he was coming &amp; expressly told Uncle A. that I did not want him to come unless <u>you</u> wrote to Aunt &amp; asked for him to come -- I cannot conceive how he got the idea into his head any other way -- I hope to be home for a day or so in a week or 10 days and will then see -- &amp; hope in the mean time you may get along without much trouble -- but I really feel better satisfied that you have some male in the house that is white. I am glad you got an arrangement for a boy to do your chores &amp; hope you will get all the help you feel that you want &amp; I will provide for it. I am very busy &amp; have been feeling very well until yesterday. I had no idea there was so much difference in the climate -- it is so much warmer here -- I am satisfied -- than in Staunton -- I dined at Gen. Lee's last Thursday, by invitation, with Mrs. Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston &amp; daughter from <abbr expan="California">Cal<u> <u>a</u> </u></abbr> &amp; Col. W. P. Johnston &amp; wife -- we had an interesting talk after dinner about <abbr expan="California">Cala.</abbr>, the Chinese &amp; c. I called at Dr. Madisons Friday, after dinner &amp; had a pleasant visit there -- they had many questions to ask about all of you, Staunton &amp;c -- The use open grates now -- have not used their furnace this year -- I have not called at any other places as yet -- I have a fine <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Phila.</abbr> photograph of Gen. Lee with his autograph which he gave me -- it is for Ma -- so none of the rest of you need speak for it. In writing to Mr. Haynes I enclosed a photograph of Gen. Lee with his Autograph to Mrs. <abbr expan="Haynes">H</abbr> -- and told him to tell her it was a "rebel" present -- I went to Church twice today -- at 11 A.M. to the <abbr expan="Presbyterian Church">Pres. Ch.</abbr> where Dr. Kirkpatrick preached a long &amp; very good sermon &amp; the choir sang <u>very mechanically</u> &amp; the organ was played <u>very jerky</u> with 10 minutes preludes -- At 4 P.M. I went to Episcopal <abbr expan="Church">Ch.</abbr> &amp; heard Dr. Pendleton on "How beautiful are the feet &amp;c. The Dr. had to rub the government twice -- I don't think you could find as many "unregenerate" rebs, in any other place in the state -- it "crops out" all around -- &amp; I could not help thinking Ma would find here many "congenial spirits" -- I have just been reading the "Central" -- a good number -- I thought how you had all read it today also -- It would be a much more endurable "exile" if I could be at home on Sunday &amp; when I coem I shall make it so as to take in a Sunday -- I got the Spectator -- much obliged -- but you need not send any more for I find <u>all</u> the town papers at the printing office &amp; go there &amp; run them over -- Sandy Garber was here last night -- as full of troubles as ever &amp; as shiftless -- has had a fuss with <i>[unclear: "Dunning"]</i> &amp; drove him off -- but told me he had heard that he had gone back yesterday -- I am much gratified at Nellys statement of what she intends to do in the way of study &amp; hope she may &amp; will persevere -- I know Anna is getting along also &amp; if you both get so you can go to school of course I shall send you -- but you can learn <u>more</u>, far more, with <u>"Mother,"</u> if you will -- We will see when I come - - I am sorry to hear that Grand Ma is worse -- I hope she may get better &amp; that Ma may find her in the spring in her ususal health - Mr. Ruffner came to see me &amp; we had a <u>long</u> talk -- he is sanguine of success - I don't think Allan will run -- This letter is for <u>all</u> &amp; I want all to write -- I won't excuse Ma -- I want the continuation of the sweet good page she gave me -- Stiles [?] must be a <u>good</u> boy says uncle Jed -- Heavens blessings on you all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours in love --</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
