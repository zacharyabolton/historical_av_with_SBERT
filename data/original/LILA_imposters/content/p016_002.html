Some think Gen. Lee may go over to attack Meade, but I hope not, it is too late in the season, &amp; we might find ourselves in the midst of a winter storm &amp; suffer much. Today has been quite cold, sharp wind -- I have spent the day at home, reading &amp; talking. Read Doddridge's Life, my Bible &amp;c. Mr. Lacy preached in one of the Brigades not far from here -- He is a good talker &amp; has now formed one of my mess &amp; consequently I see much of him -- he always has something good to tell &amp; whiles away much of the tedium of the men -- society, camp life &amp;c. Everyone longs for the conclusion of the war &amp; a return to their homes, yet no one talks of giving but until our liberties are obtained -- come what may. A few days ago, while we were in the <i>[unclear: near ch]</i> I found <abbr expan="Washington">Wash.</abbr> Reeves &amp; Lil. Stout marching back from where they had been as a guard &amp; they told me they had not had any rations for a day &amp; a half -- so I invited them to come and spend the night with me, as our camp was near -- &amp; I had a big supper prepared and you may believe they did it justice, it would have done you good to see the hungry fellows eat -- they slept in my tent &amp; breakfasted with me &amp; then went to camp -- very grateful for my hospitality -- they are both good soldiers - Reeves an excellent one &amp; very neat -- Lil retains much of his former self, but has been improved by the duties &amp; labors of a common soldier -- Our men endured much hard labor unrepiningly during our late movement - - in fact I do not thing the world ever saw a nobler &amp; more unselfish set of men than the Army of Northern Va -- I shall apply for my furlough some time about the 20<u> <u>th</u> </u> &amp; intend to ask for 20 days. I much hope that Richard will come up before I get home -- I know Garber is very loth to part with him, but he promised me that he might come when he got his fall work done -- But some way will be provided I trust, for the Lord has been very gracious to us in these days of trial &amp; suffering &amp; let us humbly acknowledge his mercy &amp; strive to obey in all things his most holy commandments -- Kiss my little daughters for me, may the Lord make them good &amp; amiable, abounding in modesty &amp; all Christian graces -- May the Lord bless &amp; keep you all -- My loved ones -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Ever sincerly your husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
