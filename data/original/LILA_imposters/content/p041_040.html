I never before was turned out-doors by any-body until the school with their teacher was driven out of the church by the colored minister.</p> <p>And the school will never be very successful until there is a school house here. We want a building large enough to accomodate 800 scholars. Now how can we obtain it. The colored people ar already in debt - having just purchased a cemetery for $1200 and the baptist denomination are now trying to build a church.</p> <p>I have made application to the <abbr expan="Government">Gov't</abbr> for aid and find the appropriation exhausted.</p> <p>The colored people have land here, now, can any money for the building of <u>school</u> <u>houses</u> be obtained from the Peabody fund on any condition, and if so, on what condition.</p> <p>Have you any circulars or printed information.</p> <p>There is I suppose an <abbr expan="Agent">Agt.</abbr> in this city, but I am entirely unacquainted with the business methods of applying for this fund or with the specific object of it further than the newspaper <abbr expan="account">acct</abbr> of such a fund having been left for the benefit of schools in the country.</p> <p>If it can be properly used for such a purpose I would like to obtain something for a school building.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Scott</p></div> <!---->
