I have been busily employed since I wrote last either reading or working. I have been reading Prescott's Conquest of Mexico in three volumes of more than five hundred pages each. I will soon be through with the last volume. These volumes belong to the Summerville circulating library I wish there was public spirit <ins>enough</ins> in Talladega to get up a public library. After I get through with Mexico I will try to get Prescott's Peril and History of "Ferdinand and Isabella". I feel that my health is greatly improved since I came here. I was at church yesterday in Summerville. Rev. Mr. The. Smith preached. I went home with Mr. Gilkeson and stayed all night. Next morning Mr Gilkeson, Willie, and myself went over to M rs. McCrae's and stayed awhile. I came <del hand="h1"></del> way back <ins> to Grandpa's</ins> in the evening I'd spent an hour at Mrs. Rounceville's. David is recovering his strength <i>[unclear: ]</i>.

I can't comprehend the reason you give for secession that the North and the South did not love each other. With what cruel hatred do the most pious people of the North regard the Southern Rebels "Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft." The pious and highly conservative Dr. Engles declares that our <i>[unclear: mo ]</i>ment of piousness Consigns the South to Execr ation! Malignant fanaticism fills the best minds in the north. The Christians of the North are as much justifiable for Supporting this war as the pious Catholics were for supporting the Inquisition. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>In great haste, Your affectionate son</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><i>[unclear: Gamble ]</i> Mc<del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>kle</div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.
