I hope there will be no other expense here for next month aside from the salaries--as I think the school will pay the board of Miss Burke and myself until warm weather comes. The past week has been a holyday with nearly all the school--which is the reason why Miss Davison has had to pay her own board one week. The <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> price ($3.50) per week covers the proportion of board and <u>house rent</u> as we have to have a shelter as well as food.</p> <p>Please send me two or three Blanks for Mission House Expenses. The expense for my board seven weeks and Miss Davisons time, making nine has nearly all been paid by the freedmen as you see That is they have paid $26.50/100 out of $30.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J Scott</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mr Whiting<br> Please send me Twentyfive and 50/100 Dollars, as Mr Scott suggests.<br> S H Davison </p></div>
