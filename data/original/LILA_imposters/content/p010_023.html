In this part of the country there is no safety for travellers, even along the neighborhood roads. Men travel about, &amp; arrest any citizen they meet without regard to law, and carry the prisoner to the army You of course would be subject to no such danger, but a quiet <i>[unclear: retiracy]</i> is my only safety. Until a few days since, the country from Staunton to Lewisburg offers every facility for the test of M<sup>c</sup>Causland's idea. It is not <u>much</u> changed now. Could you run up to Staunton and consult on the subject of your letters to me? Apprise me by say two or three days notice (getting my letters from town is so uncertain) &amp; I can meet or send for you. Under the apprehensions, &amp; with the view I expressed in my last from the Southwest, I could not venture to visit you with safety. You have no such apprehensions. </p> <p>It seems to me that the Governor of my state (whose authority I acknowledge as supreme power of government) might &amp; should protect me from the dangers by which I am beset. I have frequently thought of applying to him for it. I ought not be placed in a position which requires me to do that which is utterly revolting to the purest sentiments of nature or to seek refuge in a prison. Poor old V<sup>a</sup> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> is utterly ignored - she is powerless</p> <p>My uncle Mr E S Arnold now in Richmond contemplates a movement similar to that suggested. In accordance with an arrangement made some time ago, he has written to consult with my present intentions. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> his letter by some mail with yours, &amp; will feel it incumbent upon me to apprise him of any arguments I may make. If it should be inconvenient to you, it is not all improbable he would confer with you, &amp; then come up to see me, &amp; report your plans. Like yourself he has something to apprehend from the causes which prevent my coming to Richmond. </p> <p>My kind remembrances to the family. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Isaac N.

I have no direct &amp; no other intelligence. My letters have not been sent to me. I have had some suspicion that they had been detained by military authority, but I hope this is a mistake. The condition of my wife &amp; child I know nothing of &amp; am in great anxiety. Don't mention my suspicion. it may be &amp; I earnestly hope is erroneous.</p></div>
