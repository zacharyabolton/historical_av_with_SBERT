I handed it to Mr. White who gave me his receipt. Receiving your letter has perfectly satisfied me in regard to staying here, and things are moving on about as usual. last week and part of this has been taken up with examinations, and they were very hard indeed. two of my first examinations on Chemistry and Moral Philosophy were valued at one hundred and from the first of them I got ninety, and the other ninety-eight which put me in the first division by far in bothe as only 3/4 is required for 1st division. The other studies I have not heard from yet, that is Geometry Latin and Surveying, but I hope to stand pretty well in each. I have taken up Surveying as I think I will have time to attend to it, in connection with my other studies. it is a new work on the subject called Gillespie's Surveying. by the time I get through with that, in connection with the knowledge I had of it before, I think I will be quallified for work, although I may never have use for it. and another thing I did not like to get rusty in it, as you went to the expense of buying me a compass. I shall not neglect my other studies on account of that. Mr. White experimented on Chemistry last night, and it was very interesting indeed, he made Hydrogen gas and Oxygen gas which are the sole elements of the atmosphere we breathe, they also unite and form water, therefore being two of the most essential gasses in existence. he also performed a great many amusing scenes, such as burning Hydrogen gas it burns very brilliantly. he placed some of it in a vessel and set fire to it and it exploded making a loud report. he also over a lamp of great intensity bent glass tubes in every shape he wanted to bend them, such were some of the feats he accomplished all of which were instructive.</p> <p>Augusta has sent three Union Candidates as well Rockingham, but I see that Shenandoah has sent two good secessionists, which I think are the right kind, but I am fearful that the Convention will be made up of Union men, or we can hardly call them union men submission would be the better name. for to wish to stay in this union as it now is would be downright submission. the Black Republican party will hear no compromise, and will concede none of her privilidges whilst the dominat party and what good is that peace conference agoing to do. first I do not believe that they can make any compromise whatever, because, some of the delegates go their instructed not to give up the Personal Liberty Law <del hand="h1">Bill</del>. Massachusetts is an instance of that. And it would be better for Virginia if <del hand="h1">she</del> that Conference did not settle the question for this reason, if the North made the proper promises, she would not keep them, because she has violated the constitution which she had sworn to obey. and the consequence would be we will be hooked on to the north in a few years abolishionized and be trampled in the dust by the tyrannical heel of the North. Whereas if it <del hand="h1">seceades</del> seceds with the South, it will be the great Commercial and Manufacturing state of the Southern Confederacy. Thus it will be enriched and in case of staying in the Union, it will be impoverished, the North will scoff at it when once in its power and the South will spurn it as being an untrue state. Such are my views, and I would like very much to hear yours. You must excuse this long letter. My love to all, write soon.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your son,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>Casper</u></div> <!---->
