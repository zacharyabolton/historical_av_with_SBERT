The Overseers of the poor have assisted, to my knowledge, 21 cases of suffering among them, and about fifty ($50) Dollars worth of clothing has been distributed by the Bureau. I have had many applications for Rations that I could not supply, simply because I had none. And I would most earnestly recommend that Rations in small amounts be furnished for this <abbr expan="Sub-District">Sub.Dist.</abbr> for the temporary relief of the Aged, Sick, and infirm. Also I would again call your attention to the necessity of providing Medical attendence for extreme cases. Am of the opinion that an allowance of twenty five ($25) Dollars per month to some one of the local Physicians would cover all such cases.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> with much Respect<br>Your Obedient <abbr expan="Servant">Servt.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Frederick S. <u>Tukey</u><br><abbr expan="Assistant">Asst.</abbr> <abbr expan="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr></p></div> <!---->
