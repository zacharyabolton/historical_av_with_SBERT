Sandy Garber is going to Staunton today so I will write a few lines by him &amp; enclose five dollars more &amp; so keep doing. -- We had a very hard snow storm Sunday last, the snow was over a foot deep &amp; now it is raining hard. The roads are getting desperate. The Yankees are still on the other side, the fired salute of 34 guns in "mockery" of the memory of Washington on Sunday morning last. I was amused by Nelly's comparisons -- very good -- &amp; we had quite a laugh over them. -- I am glad she is inclined to be humorous, it will relieve the tedium of your loneliness. Enquire of Mr. Dankle why he did not send 4 <i>[unclear: bbls]</i>, or if the 20 <abbr expan="bushels">bush</abbr> of wheat only made 3 -- I have written to Nelson about the pigs &amp;c All is quiet here. I am very well indeed. Garber <u>goes</u> &amp; I must <u>close</u>. Write soon -- &amp; I will write more God bless you all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
