Lee &amp; chatting a while with Maj. Harman I went up &amp; had a good night's rest on a <u>feather</u> bed &amp; I tell you my Dear I stood in need of it, for my early start, hard seat &amp; a little cold &amp; the all days ride in the cars had wearied me much &amp; I was decidedly <u>nervous</u>, but the night's rest refreshed me. William got there in good time. This morning I got up early, breakfasted with Harman &amp; then rode down with Maj. <abbr expan="Harman">H.</abbr> to <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> fifteen miles -- quite a pleasant ride, the air bracing. I found them at Morton's House, "The Hall" a very nice place &amp; all in the house, though the tents are up in the yard "for charn" Mr. Robinson had a room in the house -- big fire &amp;c, so I am quite comfortably fixed &amp; though somewhat jaded, hope to stand it very well. Everything is quiet &amp; there is no prospect of fight at present, though one is expected here before long -- I hope you were not made sick by your many labors of the day before my leaving. Please send me back my letters -- you can put them all in one of yours. Tell Mrs. Wise I saw the Rev. Mr. Slaughter who had seen some people lately from Culpeper &amp; they said Meade had his quarters at Mr. Wollocks &amp; had a large drove of cattle in that vicinity -- The ladies that came out lived near Mitchell's Station &amp; were compelled to come away for want of food, they had to ask Gen. Warren (Fed.) for something to eat before they could come to our lines -- it was said the Yankees had killed a Mr. Nelson at Culpeper <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> -- but in general they had behaved very well -- I found all very well &amp; enjoying their comfortable quarters. My snack was delightful -- Maj. Allen &amp; brouther ate with me -- Gen. Rodes got on the cars at Charlottesville -- he said he had got a <u>fine boy</u> &amp; his wife was doing well. Aint he a lucky man? I forgot to tell Allie that I did not get a chance to see Capt. <abbr expan="Sterrett">S.</abbr> privately - - sorry I did not -- but she must be of good cheer &amp; hope for a change -- time mends all things even rheumatic joints.</p> <p> I shall write to you again in a few days &amp; send some money -- I wish to go to the <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> tomorrow.</p> <p> Kisses &amp; love for all the children including allie &amp; the rest if there &amp; a full <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> for you my Love -- Write to me soon -- very soon: By the way I left a roll of paper on the pile of big books, which I want sent to Lt. Koemer, Staunton care of Maj.
