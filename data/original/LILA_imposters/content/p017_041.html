The meeting was small but pleasant. You have doubtless seen the published proceedings.</p> <p>You are aware that we have had a visit from our Yankee Brethren. Our community has suffered greatly. Many were robbed of almost every mouthful of food and every peice of apparel. My house &amp; its contents escaped, but they robbed me of 36 bushels of corn, a ton of Hay and my favorite riding horse. Besides this they destroyed my grass, <i>[unclear: consumed]</i> a great deal of my ice, ruined my carriage harness, cut the curtains from my carriage &amp; endeavored to steal the carriage. One of their Generals made his head quarters in my yard. This was some protection to me. On the whole they appeared to me like a great mob of <i>[unclear: licensed]</i> robbers and house burners. They did immense damage to the college. They utterly destroyed or carryed off the college library &amp; did the same to about half of the two society Libraries &amp; destroyed or gave to the negroes all the furniture of the two society Halls. They broke every peice of the philosophical apparatus &amp; would have burned the buildings if it had not been for <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Moore. They burned the Institute, Mess Hall, two professors houses, sparing Smiths on account of the illness of his daughter <del hand="h1">&amp; all</del></p> <p>From the way in which I am told many of their officers spoke of our "<u>cruel treatment to Dr. Junkin</u>," I have no doubt that his <i>[unclear: representation]</i> didn't lead to much of their cruelty here. It is curious, that his daughter, Mrs Col. Preston was the only lady here who was treated with personal rudeness <del hand="h1">here</del>. Of course the party who did it, did not know that she was his daughter. One of their officers stated that both he &amp; Dr. Junkin were with Averill on his raid last fall.</p> <p>I am thankful to learn that they did not reach your house. May a kind providence shield us from their presence &amp; deliver us from their power. I trust your health is comfortable. My wife joins me in kindest remembrances to you, Mrs M<sup>c</sup>Farland &amp; Mary.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly &amp; <abbr expan="affectionately">affy</abbr>,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr>.
