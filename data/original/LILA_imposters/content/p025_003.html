I am very much pleased with the progress my Scholars have made during the month. My first class in Green Back is about taking the "First Reader" and of course are very much gratified with the idea of going to the "High School." I have no particular cases of insubordination to report. As a general thing my Scholars are very obedient and cause me but little trouble.</p> <p>My Night Class is still increasing, nearly every night brings some one that "never was here before." A Union officer kindly offers his services in my night class, if it was not for him it would be impossible for me to do justice to them the number is so great. My visit at Lexington was very pleasant and I trust profitable. Mr Coan and myself remained there nearly two weeks teaching one session a day and evening until we were relieved by Mr Johnston.</p> <p>I received your kind letter of the 25<sup>th</sup> and am happy to know that I have your best wishes and I trust, prayers for my welfare. it is indeed a great work and I feel that I need the prayers of my friends to enable me to faithfully perform my duty. My Sister--Ms Tukey--feels grateful for your kind wishes for her prosperity.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mrs Annie A.
