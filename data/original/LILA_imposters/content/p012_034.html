We have but little duty to do now <i>[unclear: except]</i> picket duty and have not had any fighting <i>[unclear: to do]</i> the last three or four weeks but move <i>[unclear: camp]</i> every day or two. Still moving back toward Richmond <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> of our Regiment is out on picket now, been gone a day, will be back this evening. Our picket <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> is twenty-three miles from where we are at camp, but we only gave to go on picket every <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> day and stay on three days at a time.</p> <p>I was detailed to go on picket when a part of our regiment <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> out the other day but got James Vance to go in <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> place by letting him ride my mair was glad to <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> it off for it has been very cold ever since They <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> and the snow is about six inches deep.
