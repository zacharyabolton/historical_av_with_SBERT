But I will endeavor to do the best I can under the circumstances as I have just finished reading yours &amp; Jimmis letter which believe me was a source of much pleasure &amp; I shall proceed immediately to answer it for fear that an opportunity will not present itself soon again. The 5th Regiment (of which we constitute a part) arrived here last night about dark after travelling about 22 miles from Charlestown. The day before we marched from Shepardstown a distance of 12 miles starting from their at about five oclock in the evening &amp; arrived at our camp at 12 in the night. lay out in the woods on the ground like "Hogs" without anything to eat. This is the way soldiering goes.</p> <p>about one half of our men were so much fatigued. &amp; their feet so sore that they could scarcely walk. my feet have blisters on now, as big as <i>[unclear: ten]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. You have no idea how much we have to endure &amp; yet I fear its nothing to what it will be. But if I have my health I care not what comes I can stand it as long as the most of them. I have no idea when we will leave this place. The Bridge together with all the publick buildings at the Ferry have been burnt by our troops &amp; the place is now vacated entirely. Also the bridge at shepardstown was burnt the evening we left by <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Doyle such a destruction of Property. not less than <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> of <i>[unclear: it]</i> destroyed &amp; what <i>[unclear: will]</i> it be by the time the wars are ended? I had a little excursion over into Maryland the night before we left Shepardstown, some 20 of our men went out on a scout to see if we could find any of the Yankey's I tell you we ran a considerable risk nevertheless we went. We were at a place where a sentinal had been posted the night before but did not see anything of him. Then was a company of 35 camp<i>[unclear: ers]</i> about 3 miles from the bridge &amp; if the <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> had'v let us we would <i>[unclear: tried]</i> them any how one <i>[unclear: round]</i>. But we had orders not <ins>to</ins> go farther than a mile &amp; half - consequently we got no fight. I must stop for the present, it is so warm &amp; I am so crowded that I cant write more. if we dont leave directly I will write you again &amp; give all the news I can. As for the note enclosed - I hope <ins>you</ins> will not think any thing more about it. I'll say nothing more myself. &amp; believe me to be as ever <u>yours</u>.
