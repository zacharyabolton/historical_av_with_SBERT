Tukey, <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asstist Supt</abbr> <abbr expan="Sub District">Sub Dist</abbr> "B" in the case of E. P. Walton, and I endorse the proposed action since there is no force <i>[unclear: easily]</i> available for his arrest, and no Military prison in that Sub District in which he could be confined for his contempt of authority and until he should comply with the decision of the Board of Agents.</p> <p>It would seem that no serious disturbances have taken place during the absence of Military Power, and it must also be evident that no effective jurisdiction can be exercised by the officers and agents of this Bureau when unsupported by the presence and use of United States <i>[unclear: forces]</i> I have therefore again to request that a detachment of troops, number thirty (30) or more, may be sent to Staunton with a commissioned officer who may be empowered to station ten (10) of them at Lexington and to send small squads, when requested, anywhere through Augusta, Highland, Bath, Alleghany and Rockbridge counties.</p> <p>The other portions of the District will soon contain a force, including Cavalry, which will suffice for the maintenance of Bureau Power at the most important points, and with the officers on duty and the Agents at their posts will enable me to carry out instructions and protect the Freedmen in all their conceded rights.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Colonel<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
