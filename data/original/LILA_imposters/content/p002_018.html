To define what the beautiful is, is a question hard to answer properly. It does not consist merely in perfect figure or colors for we consider many things beautiful that have neither. There are various opinions as to what our ideas of the beautiful are to be <u> refered </u>. Some make it a feeling or sensation others <del hand="h1">to</del><ins>an</ins> association &amp; again others <del hand="h1">to</del> expression. These all lie within or in the mind. Then again there are those who refer it entirely to the external, to novelty, utility, unity and order or proportion. Still we know from our own mind that it does not consist altogether in any of these, as for instance novelty does not always please at first sight and <ins>to</ins> again <ins>with</ins> its opposite. So also it may be proved of the other theories. The true meaning does not lie in any one of these different theories but rather in a combination. The question is asked is beauty something objective or subjective. Is the beautiful merely an emotion? We know it excites a pleasant emotion within us, but the beauty does not consist in this. If it did then the beauty would be in us and not in the object. To speak and think of the beauty of objects is the most natural and sensible view of the question. There are objects which when viewed call forth these emotions of beauty in all. The child who has never before viewed a certain <ins>beautiful</ins> object has as lively emotions of its beauty as those who are familiar with it. So it cannot be association merely that makes any thing beautiful. The ideas of the beautiful are not alike in all. There is a difference in thought, education, custom &amp;c which makes the effect produced by a beautiful object very different in differnt individuals. There is by no means a perfect uniformity in the efect produced on the mind by the same object. If the beauty of an object <del hand="h1">co</del>exists in the mind of the beholder only, it follows then that there would be no beauty were there no observers There is an intimate connection between the emotions produced on the mind and the objects themselves. There is another theory mentioned, called the spiritual, which makes beauty consist not in matter as such, nor in any mere arrangement of it in stuff considered, but in the manifestation or expression under these forms of the higher, the hidden spiritual nature or element, appealing thus to our own spiritual nature which is thereby awakened to sympathy. It argues there is something in the different kinds of matter that expresses to us the higher and spiritual principle which is the life and soul of <i>[unclear: thing]</i> The perfection of beauty is not to be found in any of the different scales of matter but is found in God alone. There are considerations in favor of the spiritual theory In nature and art the beautiful expresses something and in this lies much of their beauty. God speaks to us through them, silently but none the less doesn't come from Him. The impressions of beauty are perceived by the senses and through them conveyed is the mind. The power of judging of and selecting the beautiful is called taste. Here again there has been a variety of opinions in reference to the exact definition of taste. The definition given is, the power of judging and discriminating objects whether beautiful or sublime in nature or art. All nations possess taste of some kind though often not good taste. Good taste depends very much on cultivation by education and exercise.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mary A Smiley</p></div> <!---->
