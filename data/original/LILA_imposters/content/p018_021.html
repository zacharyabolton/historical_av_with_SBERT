We just got a letter from Mosby in which he says he fell on the enemy's train day before yesterday at Berryville &amp; Captured &amp; destroyed 75 wagons, got some 200 prisoners &amp; some 600 mules &amp; horses &amp; killed a good many &amp; also he fell on a scouting party that was going to Culpeper &amp; routed them capturing &amp; killing a good many, Mosby is certainly one of the bravest spirits we have -- quiet &amp; modest, a fine looking fellow, but always in motion &amp; reaping a rich harvest of spoils -- William &amp; Sam. Chapman are both captains in his command -- &amp; are highly esteemed by him, I understand --</p> <p> We had a little rain last night &amp; it is pleasanter today than heretofore -- it has been intensely hot -- but we have managedto stand it so far -- &amp; if we can whip the force that is now before us it will be a fine thing for the country. I think, as heretofore, that this campaign will go far to end the war &amp; do not think there will be much if any fighting after this campaign. No doubt the entire army will be here before long &amp; the field of battle be transferred to the Banks of the Potomac or North of it. Grant was at Harper's Ferry a few days ago &amp; is, no doubt, trying to get away from Richmond as best he can -- I got a very fine young horse in Maryland, it only cost me $100. in Confederate money, as Gen. Early let us have horses at the cost price there, paying in Confederate money the value fixed on them in Federal -- it was a good thing for me &amp; will enable me to sell one of my horses &amp; help to get along &amp;c whenever Charley gets in order I want to sell him if horses command a good price I hope there may be some cessation of active operations so I may get home for a few days early in Sept -- My shirts are getting somewhat worse for wear &amp; I think I shall try to buy some ready made ones if we get where there are any, I believe white ones do as well as any others in the army &amp; they usually last longer -- I do not think it best to have any pants made of my cloth just now -- if you have not done anything to them just keep the cloth safely -- I will do all I can for your memoranda bless your dear little heart I wish you had all the things you <u>want</u> I hope Parkins carried up the box of cups &amp; saucers &amp; that you have gotten it by this time. Write me how the children like the books -- I sent them &amp;c &amp;c Write me my love -- I know you have hard times this hot weather &amp; wish I could be at home to attend to affairs but be of good cheer -- all will yet be well -- Love &amp; kisses &amp; blessings for you all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
