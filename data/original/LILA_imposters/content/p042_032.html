I left you at Miss Goode's because I thought I discovered I was in the way, and that your friend was present on our walk to deprive me of the coveted opportunity I sought, but could not have; all the evening, for only a very few words of good bye. If I had <u>known</u> before we started that he was going I would have sent Miss Goode my apology by you &amp; not have made myself a third party to the walk. Where one is so deeply attached as I am to you, without any ground of hope to stand upon, even trifles are watched. And the Constant presence of this gentleman with you all the evening <u>till I left</u>, when he also left and came to town in the same <del hand="h1">vehicle</del> ambulance with me, has alarmed me more than I can express. If he alone is responsible for this Constant watchful presence, I would not attach so much im-portance to it, for it is natural he should wish to be with you, but if it was your request that he should be a third party during the last few hours I could possibly be with you, then indeed I am about to awake to a reality I have all the time dreaded - that I am too late - hopelessly too late. I do earnestly - Oh! so earnestly hope all this, <u>as far as you are concerned</u> was accidental. Forgive me for writing you this hasty note, and for God's sake answer it to 257 Broadway New York, by the first mail and relieve my anxieties if I am laboring under a painful, but I think natural misapprehension. God bless you and make you always happy.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Sincerely &amp; devotedly yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.D.
