Jones being unfortunately been killed, and our forces thereabout, not deeming themselves strong enough, having fallen back toward the mountains. Of course the enemy unobstructed will proceed to <i>[unclear: loot]</i> and what outrages they may perpetuate there none can say. I am anxious about our Dear <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> and yet not <i>[unclear: corroding]</i> - a, my trust's in that Almighty goodness - which can protect Christ's servants under all circumstances. <abbr expan="Your">Yr</abbr> Ma will be sustained, I believe, for the time. And I cannot suppose that even Yankee villany will be allowed to indulge itself in <i>[unclear: any]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> disgraces to my family. They may destroy property, and so inflict a good deal of suffering. But all that can be <i>[unclear: re------]</i>. Meantime, however, while they cannot hear from us, nor <i>[unclear: we from]</i> them. J <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> be deeply <i>[unclear: concerned]</i>, and they will suffer, I know, extreme anxiety. The Lord, however, is with us. And will be a very fervent help now and in all times of trouble. <u><abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Lee</u> is much in <i>[unclear: your]</i> thoughts. He too will be taken care of, I feel assured. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> and going off immediately, and I do trust the despicable <u> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> </u> <u>&amp; traitor, Hunter,</u> may be <u>punished</u> as he deserves, before he can do much <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> mischief. Of course Kate &amp; yourself must now remain in Richmond until this state of things is remedied. My best love to you both. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yr. fond father</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.N.
