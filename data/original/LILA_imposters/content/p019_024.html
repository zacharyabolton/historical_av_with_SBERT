R.</abbr> &amp; fixing to have winter uqarters in the Lower Valley -- . I got chance to sketch the line of battle &amp;c at Cedar Creek William came to me at Fisher's Hill - got back here when I expected -- I got your letter, &amp; Maj. Bells about Green's baggage, but found no letter from Mrs. Butcher in the coat pocket -- you certainly did not put it in -- send it to me &amp; I will attend to it -- her funds were not lost by the burning of the bank's money. Col. Smith has come up here as Chief Engineer of the Army -- just the news I want here &amp; he tells me that the <abbr expan="Chief Engineer">Chf. Eng.</abbr> will give me the highest civil appointment in his power &amp; a salary of $4000 a year -- he cannot commission me because I am from Virginia -- they all make such a fuss about appointments from Virginia -- that will be better than I expected &amp; I shall be very much gratified by it -- &amp; hope soon to get the appointment -- say nothing about it -- I am glad you got <u>some</u> wood &amp; hope you will have enough until I can get you more -- I suppose our winter quarters will be some where in Rockingham -- if so I shall get mine at or near home -- at least in Staunton -- won't that be good -- then I can get home at least once a week -- hope you are not going to have the rheumatism. I can let you have my two smaller flannels (shirts) as I have two others in my box in Staunton &amp; you had better use them -- Mr. R's things were all right -- I sent you $20. in my last. I send you $20. in this also. -- &amp; I will try &amp; supply your wants -- the <abbr expan="Quarter Master">Q M.</abbr> has no money now or I would send a larger amount -- but will keep sending -- You say you got your 4<u> <u>th</u> </u> bbl. of flour -- &amp; do not see where the 5<u> <u>th</u> </u> is to come from -- I engaged from Sieg Trimble, Hanger, &amp; Geeding &amp; you got one from Smith through Glossbrenner I thought -- that makes <u>5.</u> I want to provide for being at home some during the winter -- Mr. Seig is also to have some potatoes for us -- I sent to <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> for the articles Miss Kate wants -- Put me up some pickles &amp; things &amp; buy some apple butter if you can if you have none to spare. I shall be after my meds chest again in due time -- I shall not draw on your resources though as heretofore -- things are too scarce -- but then your storehouse always seems to yield something -- &amp; I have unbounded faith in it -- It has been bitter cold &amp; I found my blanket a great comfort I tell you -- The <u>new</u> coat fits <u>finely</u> -- only I did not mean to have it sent here -- Many thanks for the chestnuts to Nelly and Anne &amp; the 3 apples -- Heaven bless you all I am glad your pest is gone -- All things "work together for good" Write <u>soon</u> </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your loving husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
