Though you need <br> fear no hostile demonstrations on the <br> account as we are yet ten or twelve <br> miles from the outposts. We were only <br> moved about five miles—only one <br> mile below us in Fairfax Court House<sup>[1]</sup>, a <br> very pretty village in time of peace, <br> but now every where you see signs of the <br> presence of soldiers; a general air of neglect <br> and confusion, fences torn down, tents <br> of regiments and brigades seem in every <br> direction as far as can be seen through the <br> openings of trees. The country here is very <br> pretty; it is hilly, though not such high <br> hills as we are accustomed to in the valley, <br> but a succession of low parallel<del hand="h1" type="supralinear">l</del> ridges running nearly north and south, which <br> render the appearance a great deal more beautiful <br> than the low flat country around the Junction.<br> It is very densely wooded—mostly pine <br> and the whole filled up with thick under <br> growth, forming the very best protection <br> to the pickets and scouting parties, and also <br> a shelter for those terrible engines of destruction <br> (to the Yankees)-"masked batteries."<sup>[2]</sup> </p> <p> Troops are still concentrating between this <br> place and our picket lines—the main body <br> of the army is here—what it all means <br> no one of course can tell, though you may <br> rest assured there will be no more falling <br> back on the Junction, unless we are com <br> pletely beaten, of which however I have <br> little fear. I do not believe the Yankees are <br> ready to fight us yet—their loss was too <br> great on the 21<sup>st</sup> July for them to have <br> recovered from it so soon.<sup>[3]</sup> All military <br> operations are exceedingly dull <br> and sluggish. </p> <p> We are both very well and right <br> pleasantly situated, if indeed a camp <br> life can be, at all pleasant. The camp <br> is a right good one, the water not quite <br> so good as that we left. </p> <p>William Wilson<sup>[4]</sup> reached camp <br> this morning, from Fairfax Station <br> where he left the boxes, and for which <br> we will send tomorrow. He gave us <br> all the news, both from home and <br> Rockbridge. The Cars now run regularly <br> to Fairfax Station, about 3 miles from <br> the Court House. You will hereafter<br> direct your letters to <u>Fairfax Station</u><br> Company I 4<sup>th</sup> Regiment Va. Volunteers. </p><p> I suppose Charles told you that <br> Capt. White's resignation has been accepted <br> and that Mr. Morrison has been elected <br> Captain. He will make an excellent <br> captain. I like him very much. <br> He is one of the most industrious and <br> intelligent men I ever saw.<sup>[5]</sup> </p> <p> Father wished to know that amount <br> coming to <u>William</u> from the Confederacy.<sup>[6]</sup><br> <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> White is not here and <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <br> Morrison knows nothing about it, he <br> can only make the calculations at $11 per <br> month which results as follows: $31.63 <br> up to the first of July and then 16 days <br> in that month $5.50 making $37.13. <br> The pay master made a note on the pay <br> rolls, that William had died and the day <br> of his death (16th of July) but the amount <br> could be drawn at anytime without <br> difficulty. Any statement from the <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> <br> could in no way, be of any service, I think. <br> He can find out better in Staunton than any <br> one here can tell him. <br> I am going to Fairfax Station today for the boxes. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Much love to everybody.<br> As ever your son.</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Andrew Brooks</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Eston is very well, the most con <br> tented man in camp. <br> John D.<sup>[7]</sup> is pretty well.<br> Lieutenant Wilson has been right sick <br> but is now nearly well.</p></div>
