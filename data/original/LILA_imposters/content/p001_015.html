And it must be done <br> to night or you will not get one this week. <br> Because we have a little more spare time <br> Wednesday night than any other, and <br> precious little then, for in addition to our <br> regular studies we have a poor chance to <br> do for examinations; two of which <br> we will have next week, Greek, Mathematics.<sup>[1]</sup> </p> <p>We are very well. The anniversary of the <br> Graham Society <sup>[2]</sup> came off on last night. <br> It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight <br> that there was a large crowd. <br> The anniversary address was delivered by Mr. <br> Paxton of Rockbridge.<sup>[3]</sup> It was a very good <br> address, well written and very well delivered. </p> <p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her <br> Christians <ins>should</ins> nations interfere" was then <br> discussed by four other members of Society, <br> whose names it is not necessary to mention. <br> All the front of the college was illuminated <br> and made a very pretty appearance. </p> <p>The people of this county held a meeting at <br> the Court house, Monday to nominate candidates <br> for the convention which resulted in the nomi-<br> nation of S McD Moore and James Dorman,<br> two strong Union men, so that if the <br> question of Virginia's secession depends upon <br> their votes, she wont go out soon. Who are candidates in Augusta?<sup>[4]</sup> </p> <p>From all I can hear, I think that the <br> secessionists are rapidly gaining ground <br> in Virginia, and would not be surprised if <br> that convention should declare Virginia out <br> of the Union. From present appearances it <br> seems that we are almost sure to have civil war. <br> There are such extensive military preparations <br> going on in the north and from the threatening <br> and insulting way in which the Republican <br> papers and from the overbearing and <br> contemptuous actions <i>[unclear: ]</i> <br> of Congress in refusing compromises giving <br> the South the barest justice, it must be Lincoln's intention to compel the South <br> to remain in the Union, if he can. <br> And if he attempts that, the whole South <br> will and ought to unite and oppose it. <br> A week or two ago, a few of the boys secretly <br> made and hoisted upon top of College <br> a Disunion Flag, bearing a single red star and <br> the word Disunion. But Dr. Junkin very <br> soon had it taken down and there has <br> been nothing said about disunion since.<sup>[5]</sup></p> <p> Yesterday was warm and clear, but now it <br> is cold and snowing. I never saw weather <br> so changeable, or so much rain, or so many <br> cloudy and foggy days in my life as we <br> have had here. It is hardly ever clear three <br> days at one time. </p> <p> We have been looking for a letter from <br> home for two or three days to tell us <br> about the wedding, but haven't got one <br> yet. You must think we don't want to <br> hear! Does Uncle Andy look like he <br> is married?<sup>[6]</sup></p> <p>Writing letters is the hardest work <br> that I have to do at College and since <br> there is nothing here that will interest <br> you, and believing that I have done <br> remarkably well in having written this <br> much, I quit. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Love to all,<br> your brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>A.
