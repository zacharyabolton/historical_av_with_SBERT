I had<br> begun to think you had forgotten me, it<br> was so long coming. He mentioned<br> that Johny had gone <del hand="h1">to</del> somewhere (but<br> didn't say where) except that I would no<br> doubt see him before I got his letter.<br> He didn't tell me what he had gone for,<br> or anything about it, nor did you except<br> that he sent to <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Lee a recom<ins>m</ins>endation<br> for my detail. What<del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> sort of a thing is<br> it and who recommended me. I suppose<br> he was in Richmond and took the contract to<br> the war office. I havn't gotten the letter you<br> say he wrote me and have never gotten<br> but one letter from him since I left. I have<br> been very anxious to hear from him, and<br> know what is doing at the Furnace. It will<br> now soon be time it was put in blast. When I commenced writing I had just<br> returned from preaching, which we have<br> every night. <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Hoge<sup>[3]</sup> and Mr. Lacy <sup>[4]</sup> are gone.<br> There is a chaplain with each regiment of<br> the brigade, two Presbyterians and three<br> Methodists. <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Culton<sup>[5]</sup> has resigned -<br> unable to stand infantry service. I dont<br> know who will get his place, if his resignation<br> is accepted. We heard considerable firing<br> across the river yesterday, but havent heard the<br> cause. Wednesday morning, I will get<br> the box today -am very much<br> obliged to you all for it -I am not<br> much afraid of it being much like<br> what <del hand="h1">y</del> I get here, there is but one place<br> I ever saw that I got such rations.<br> I am sorry Miss Sue Harden is about to<br> leave the neighborhood -young people<br> are sadly scarce there. Emmett is on another<br> trip to Uncle John's, wonder if he will get ther<br> this time. I heard Mary Susan <sup>[6]</sup> was to atttend<br> a small party at <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Dold's -a kind of farewell<br> to Jim<sup>[7]</sup> I suppose. I am very well. Love to all<br> the friends. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>As ever your son</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Andrew</p></div> <!---->
