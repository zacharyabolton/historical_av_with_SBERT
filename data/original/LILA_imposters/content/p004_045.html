And to reverse the order of this arrangement I begin by announcing, I was going to say Alas!! my continued existence (for that's all it can be called) within the confines of single wretchedness!!--Still floating like a <i>[unclear: zoophyte]</i> upon the surface of human affairs, gathering here &amp; there a few scraps or crumbs of comfort &amp; at last going down under the billows of a forlorn hopelessness, or a premature, decay, unwept unhonored &amp; unsung!! I tell you my dear friend &amp; kinsman, I strongly incline to the opinion that I shall not allow my hopes &amp; my happiness to be so submerged or dashed in pieces upon the rocks of single wretchedness. As I stated in a soft epistle to one Richmond lassie, I believe the Scriptures to be true, When they assert that it is not good for a man to be alone!! and fearing lest I be carried away too far into the merits of this delectable theme, I round up by informing my friend the gentleman from <i>[unclear: Cuten]</i>, that if life &amp; health be spared me--graciously? I hope to be off for the better state betwixt now &amp; the ripeningof next summer's fruits!!-- <i>[unclear: ie]</i> I cherish the joyeous anticipation of springing into the conjugal state ere the Spring season shall have doffed its buds &amp; blossoms!! As sure as you are born Should your &amp; my life &amp; health be continued &amp; such an event as is proposed should ever transpire? You shall have a little missile sent you concerning the time, the place &amp; the <i>[unclear: ooman]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> if expedient? an invitation to witness the gentleman from Lonesome Hollow bow his willing neck to Hangmen's yoke. Under the genius of this new constitution--for which alas!! you persuaded me to vote contrary to my convictions--we are again to have the whole mass of Society bestired &amp; fomented into angry or at least selfish excitement, on account of the hungry &amp; often unscrupulous contest for office. The general &amp; almost universal wish among the good people of Augusta is that the old dynasty shall go out of office &amp; others take their places. I do not wonder at all at this wide-spread popular sentiment, because I in common with others believe very many of the people have suffered no little from what I fear has been the rascally conduct of one or more of the Sheriffs. Friend <i>[unclear: Fultz]</i> seems desirous to set in judgement upon the rights of his fellow citizens, but I incline to think that after the people shall have sat in judgement upon his aspirations, he will conclude rather to retire to the shades of agricultural life, or hamer away at the bar upon his cases, with such doged pertniocity as to weary out the patience of judge &amp; jury. Now awarding all due credit to Mr <i>[unclear: Fultz]</i> for his energy, his attention to business &amp; his success in life, and feeling altogether friendly towards him, or as much so as is necessary, I think he wants two or more important qualifications for the office to which he aspires. In the first place (if I can judge at all on such a point?) his legal attainments, are quite too scattering &amp; superficial. He has never trained his mind in the investigation of, or imbued it deeply with the great fundamental principles of the laws, and besides this throughout the entire course of his practice--so far as I know--he has so twistifyed &amp; mystifyed what laws he knew to Suit the particular case in hand, that his mind now, it seems to me would be very much disqualifyed to examine into &amp; to adjudicate very important or intricate cases. If you happen to agree with me in this opinion, it will behoove the present incumbent's friends in Nelson as well as here to exert themselves to secure his election in that the desire for change, the restless spirit of the people might oust Judge Th, and surely whatever objections may be urged against Th, this proposed change would be from bad to worse. But I shall take little or no part in the struggle since I properly belong to another district.Have you seen Dr Breckenridge's letter to his nephew, the Vice-President? Doubtless you have &amp; I know you would agree with me that it is perhaps the ablest thing that has appeared before the public on the subject that now, as heretofore, so much agitates the country. With that clear &amp; comprehensive mind of his he has mastered this vexed question in all its <i>[unclear: vaneil]</i> &amp; extended hearings, and has presented it before the people in a more satisfactory light than I have yet seen. Truly as he says if the entire people throughout every part of the country here agreed &amp; determined upon the preservation of the Union, each &amp; every difficulty now growing out of the subject of slavery, or out of any other subject, might be &amp; would be speedily &amp; permanently settled within the Union. But with all my regard for his great production I do not see how one of his leading ideas could ever be carried out, in the event of any thing like a combined secession of several states from the Union. If you remember he alleges that instead of going out of the Union, or allowing any one or more states to subvert the national government by withdrawing from the Confederacy, he should compel by force of arms if necessary, the revolting state or states to cease their rebellion &amp; to behave themselves. In my opinion this theory of the <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev</abbr> Doctor is easily written but would be found to be perhaps altogether impracticable.</p> <p>Whenever such a state of things as is contemplated by Dr <abbr expan="Breckinridge">B</abbr>, occurs among any provinces or sovreign states, it seems to me the difficulties growing out of them become too complicated &amp; vast for the wit of man to understand or to arrange, and unless we look from man to Him who rules among the armies of heaven, we must follow in the wake of all other nations that have been swallowed up in the vortex of revolutions, or been crushed under the iron heel of despotisms!! But I rejoice to believe &amp; to trust in the unerring &amp; overruling providence of God, as connected with this, &amp; all other nations of the earth. I rejoice to believe that very great &amp; gracious purposes are yet to be brought out by this government &amp; by this people for the permanent good &amp; happiness of our fallen race &amp; for the ultimate honor &amp; glory of Him who is both the Author &amp; giver of every blessing!! And I further rejoice to believe that even in these degenerate times there is being found &amp; will yet more be found quite enough conservatism &amp; patriotism, in the north as well as in the South to stay the foul tide of Sectional strife &amp; fanatiscism, and to continue this glorious union in its prosperous &amp; beneficent course.A short time since I was glad to hear through your sister Elizabeth, of your pleasant situation in <i>[unclear: Lovingston]</i> &amp; yet more in your present success in business as well as in your future brightening prospects. Right glad would I be to visit you &amp; your dear family &amp; pass many pleasant moments in your domestic circle recounting olden times &amp; descanting somewhat perhaps upon your future professional &amp; my future hymenial prospects. Should it fall within your next summer's perambulations to pass up or down the Valley as far as <i>[unclear: Mt]</i> Jackson! you must jump on the stage &amp; come out to <i>[unclear: Crtney]</i> Springs to pay me a visit. I should like for to see <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> pass your opinion upon these springs &amp; my connexion with them. Please remember me very particularly to <i>[unclear: Cos Signance]</i> &amp; to each of your dear little ones. Tell Co--S, I cherish for her as well as for you a very high regard &amp; most decided friendship--insomuch that I class you among my most esteemed friends &amp; shall continue to follow you through future life with my highest hopes &amp; my best wishes. I close by simply requesting you if possible? to forward me the amount of my note <i>[unclear: vs]</i> you some time between this &amp; the first of June--since I am greatly pressed &amp; even sued. Your note--if you mind?--I left with Mr. George Imboden to whom you will hand or remit payment as soon as possible. Please answer me this by return mail directing to me at Mossy Creek <abbr expan="Post">P</abbr> Office Augusta Co.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>B Estill</p></div> <!---->
