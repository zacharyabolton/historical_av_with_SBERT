I am still here and well, and doing as well as can be expected I have rented a house in the country some few miles in case you can get to move out, but think it best not to come without your household effects, as such here would be hard to get, and could not live without them. <del hand="h1">and</del> the rent will not be much &amp; I had better pay the rent than to miss having a place in case should need it. I wrote you several times to try &amp; see if you could be allowed to move your things out here &amp; if could get teams to move say to Woodstock &amp; I would meet you there with teams to bring you on up &amp;c. have you learned this if so why not send me word what the result is if you Can<sup>t</sup> write get some one else to write me, Henry, Moses John or Jimmy C. or someone I am anxious to know what to count on If you will not be allowed to bring your things, unless Molested or interfered with or uncomfortable or unpleasantly situated there, I rather think best to remain there for the present but if not Comfortable &amp; pleasant there Move to the country or Come on up here with what you will be allowed to bring.
