This was done at his request.</p> <p>He now informs me that no plan has been fixed upon and that thus far all expenses have been met by himself--home rent paid to next March, teachers boarded etc. by himself.</p> <p>I know how Committee do not intend to neglect Mr Tukey but he is entitled to their notice. He has done and is doing more for the schools than any Bureau Supt I know of.</p> <p>Will you not see that Lamps. Bells etc ordered by Mr Scott are sent <u>immediately</u>. And also that Mr Tukey be <u>properly</u> informed as to their preferences, or wishes in reference to teachers board etc.</p> <p>Mr Tukey now does not know what kind of a <u>bill</u> to present but having advanced money for <u>various</u> expenses needs a remittance and I would recommend that you send him 150 to 200 dollars by return mail</p> <p>Please also send an Invoice of school books Slates etc sent here some weeks ago as none has been secured</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W L Coan</p></div> <!---->
