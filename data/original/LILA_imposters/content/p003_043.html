Mr. <i>[unclear: Brison]</i> is very anxious to settle with me for the painting of my house. Can I have the measurement done so as to be useful to yourself and Mr. Imboden as arbitrators? I hold that I have a right to call on Mr. Armentrout to make out his bill and prove it, and, of course, to not herewith waive that right. Still, I would suggest that, if Mr. Armentrout is really anxious to have his work fairly measured, we ought to meet at my house (<abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Smith, Mr. <i>[unclear: Brison]</i>, Mr. Armentrout &amp; myself) at some appointed day and hour, when the whole work may be measured and the part done by each workman ascertained. If you approve of this suggestion, please consult <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Smith &amp; Mr. <abbr expan="Armentrout">A.</abbr> and let me know the day and hour appointed.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very respectfully yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>S.
