The same congregation who built the church and who for more than fifty years have worshipped in it and other churches which in that time have stood upon the same spot.</p> <p>The title of church property is by the law of Virginia held by trustees for the benefit and use of the local Religious congregation. The building has for many years been held by such trustees approved by the current court of Augusta County under the law of the state. It is with the consent and by the authority of these trustees that our congregation hold and uses the property.</p> <p>There are three congregations of Methodists in Staunton, one composed entirely of White persons, the other two exclusively of collored persons. As each of these congregations has its own separate place of worship, I am unable to understand how the use and occupancy of our church edifice has become the subject of discussion &amp; inquiry by those you represent.</p> <p>As I have stated we are and always have been in the peaceful possession of this property, and if any complaints or <i>[unclear: ---cutations]</i> has been made in denegration of our right to such possession, I submit very respectfully that it is proper that we shall be informed of its source and its character. So that we may be enabled to meet it promptly and distinctly. As soon as I have the points to which I am expected to respond I will take pleasure in laying before you such information as will enable you to make a just and and proper disposition of the whole subject of your inquiry.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir, very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt.</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Sevt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.
