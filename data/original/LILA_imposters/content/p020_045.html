I have fit Jack out with team &amp;c &amp; want him to locate on some of our land &amp; farm it to make a living for himself &amp; something for us. If could be done it would suit best to put him on your land of home place, as he could haul wood to you But under the present condition of affairs it might be best not to have him so close to town To put him on the North farm he would have most room but so close to the pike that he might be interupted The Lowry farm would suit best I think at this time as J- &amp; M<sup>r</sup> G. could see after him if the house along the road is vacated. I have written to J &amp; M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> G on the subject &amp; asked them to assist him &amp;c they may see you on the subject if so view all the advantages &amp; disadvantages &amp; Make the best arrangement you can for him &amp; it will suit me now He I think will stay there &amp; if so I will do a good part by him he will want a cow &amp; a few hogs to raise. I want him to put out some corn if it is late I want Louise to go home &amp; stay with you &amp; I think you will get along better She has expressed a desire to go &amp; I think she will remain with you &amp; she seems determined to do it. You will have to fix her up a little in clothing, and take positive controll over her. F &amp; J are quite well F still goes to school &amp; learns fast we are fixing up for our tramp home. I have expected to get off next week but may not get off so soon, but will at least go the week following, When as Aunt Matty says we will have a new wedding. You have no idea how much I want to see you</p> <p>I have gotten a good man to take charge of Tanyard &amp; operate it I think I will rent out the Hotel today. the Man is to be here for that purpose</p> <p>I have stopped the store &amp; divided the good<sup>s</sup> &amp; will either sell at wholesale or put in someones hand<sup>s</sup> to sell for me. I have a number of small matters to settle up here which I must put in some good shape before leaving &amp; it takes sometime to do it May get through sooner than now expected if so will not delay in coming home</p> <p>We have had a heavy crash here in money matters <abbr expan="Confederate">Confed<u> <u>t</u> </u></abbr> money has gone up entirely I have lost smartly by it but not so much as some here have. I am still not so bad off here have nothing new to write that will interest you it is quite dull here now being no communication open from here to Richmond the rail road having been distroyed &amp; not yet repaired</p> <p>Provisions &amp; everything here now seem plenty Our currency here now is specie &amp; greenbacks No Army with us here now We now live quite a quiet retied life</p> <p>F send<sup>s</sup> a little puppy down (Pomila) by Jack &amp;c to be raised for him. He still has another rat terrier here raising</p> <p>When I come home I expect I will want to <i>[unclear: meet]</i> you at M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> G. before coming home if you hear from me to that effect come out at once. As I will be anxious to go through at once. Make all the necessary enquire &amp; be prepared to give me all the information desired</p> <p>Let all my friend know that I am well</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>My love to all &amp; remain yours ever</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John Quincy Adams">J Q A</abbr> Nadenbousch</div> <!---->
