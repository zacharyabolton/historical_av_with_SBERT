Our trains and everything was safely crossed to the S. side of the North Anna &amp; we have since Monday noon been here in position -- our line extending nearly parallel to the Va. <abbr expan="Central Railroad">C. R. R</abbr> -- leaving a big bend of the river in our front, into which we have allowed the enemy to cross -- our line is a very good one &amp; if Grant will advance on it, he will find a "fiery mass of living valor" even denser than that he encountered at the Ny -- We have received reinforcements &amp; it is thought the two armies are more nearly equal than ever before -- I do not know but the fortune of war may expose the Valley to invasion, but I trust that the same kind Providence that has so far shielded it will continue His favor &amp; keep it from pollution -- the manybloody lessons the enemy has learned there ought to teach him to keep away -- Every available man has been brought from the North to make up the army of Grant, reserves &amp;c and of course we must concentrate to meet them &amp; the result will be two <u>immense</u> armies instead of many small ones &amp;, eventually some decisive victories instead of many fruitless skirmishes. Our army is well supplied now as several ships loaded with provisions have lately come into our ports -- they issue 1/2 lb. of bacon to the men in the trenches -- I hope you are getting along tolerably -- though I am full of anxiety knowing you are illy able physically to endure this fiery trial, but your great heart I trust, &amp; an unfailingProvidence will sustain you &amp; enable you to go through these trying times -- I have money but do not think it safe to send it -- new issue -- but if you need any money call on either of the Mr. Bears to advance some to you until such time as I can send it -- which I hope will not be long -- for this great battle cannot be delayed much longer if Grant goes to the Peninsula the road will soon be open &amp; if we fight here we shall soon end the act &amp; a charge will take place -- I am in the very best of health -- with all I can do. Did you see the Enquirer of the 26<sup>th</sup> -- it had in Mr. Hewson's letter to the London Herald -- he makes mention of me -- I am pleased to hear that the children are doing so well much love &amp; many blessings for you all -- write -- via Lynchburg -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
