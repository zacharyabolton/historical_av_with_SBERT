They had a very large infer. at M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> Turk's last night. Lucy &amp; Mary didn't know anything about that until this morning &amp; they certainly have been quarreling today because their Uncle Rudolph didn't send for them. I think it will <ins>be</ins> real mean if Fulton's dont invite you to their weddings, and living so close too. Oh well, If they do ask you it will be well and good &amp; if they dont it will be no odds. who will keep house for Bill now? I suppose he will try &amp; get Becca now.

They are to be divided into two parts. Zephyrs &amp; Gelowers all the tall girls are Flowers, each girl to personate a flower. the dresses are to tbe trimed in green.

The salary would be $200. there were five children in the family &amp; you could take in day-scholars. that would make it 100 more. said it was in a very retired place. and thought you could have a very pleasant home there. She said she thought it was in Alleghany County, &amp; told me to write to you. So you can consider the offer. She said if you had been an advanced Latin scholar, she could <ins>get</ins> you almost any situation. was very sorry you couldnt come another session. &amp;c &amp;c</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
