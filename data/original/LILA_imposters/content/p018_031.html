We are constantly moving about, as usual; yesterday we moved from Bunker's Hill towards Charlestown, intending to attack the enemy, Averill found we were moving &amp; drove in our cavalry Vaughn's Brigade, which offered but little resistance to him &amp; then ran away leaving some 14 wagons in his hands &amp; compelling us to return from our movement to look after him -- we drove him away &amp; recaptured some of the wagons -- We came back here for the night -- had a very long march -- Today we move again, back to Bunker's Hill &amp; then after the Yankees again. It is said part of the Yankee troops have gone to City Point -- if so we shall give them a staggering blow -- We cannot rely upon our cavalry to hold points &amp; that makes it very difficult for us to move rapidly as we have to guard our trains constantly We learn by the late papers that McClellan &amp; Pendleton are the nominees of the Chicago Convention -- I have not seen the Platform -- but think it must be a peace one -- Pendleton is a southern man in principle &amp; it is thought he will be for peace -- everything indicates a strong peace movement in the North &amp; they may succeed in electing their candidates The nights are getting quite cold, but the days are very pleasant. I will write to Mr. Geeding about the horse -- should like to know what he will give -- he knows what horses sell for now -- Ask him?</p> <p>Sept. 5<u> <u>th</u> </u> -- I did not finish my letter before we were started off to join Gen. Anderson who had gon to Berryville &amp; there met &amp; defeated the advance of the Yankees towards Winchester -- whipping a corps with a division -- We went down to aid him &amp; found the Yanks had entrenched themselves strongly so we did not attack them, but the defeat Anderson gave them caused their cavalry to come back from a raid they had started way up the Valley, so our object was accomplished -- Yesterday we came back to Stephensons where we now are, in time to join our Cavalry in a fight they were having with Averill &amp; we drove him back several miles, until dark stopped the pursuit -- One of Alfred Wilson's sons was wounded in the fight, not severly though -- we had several of the Cavalry killed &amp; wounded -- They behaved well It rained very hard last night &amp; today it is very moist -- We are being smoked by camp fires &amp; lounging round to pass the day -- I think the rain will do much good -- making the ground fit for plowing. I suppose McClellan will be elected as nearly all the Army of the Potomac goes for him -- Pendleton, the nominee for Vice Pres., is a man with strong Southern feelings &amp; a peace man, it is said -- Evidently the Peace &amp; War men have made a compromise matter of the nominations &amp; will all be for peace if the signs of the times are as much in our favor as they are now. We are very well assured of the fall of Atlanta, since the Yanks have official despatches announcing it, but we are full of hope that even good may come from temporary ill &amp; that Hood has not given up the place but for good &amp; sufficient reasons -- I am in excellent health -- Hope to hear from you today again -- it seems a long time between your letters - Love to the children &amp; blessings for you from our Merciful Heavenly Father -- Write often My Sweet one -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
