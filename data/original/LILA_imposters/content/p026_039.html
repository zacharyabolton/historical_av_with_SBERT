I made the acquaintance of Mr T. very soon after he first came to our town; and my Office being in close proximity with his, and having frequently attended professionally to <i>[unclear: business]</i> which came up before him officially, I had a better opportunity perhaps than any other person to view his conduct both as a private citizen and a public officer.</p> <p>And it is but justice to say, that his course has given universal satisfaction to all colors and all shades of party. He has happily mingled a spirit of moderation and conciliation, with a <i>[unclear: firm]</i> upright and impartial administration of justice to black and white, loyal and disloyal. I am satisfied that no man could <i>[unclear: accept]</i> that office who would be more acceptable to our people <ins>without regard to color</ins> than Mr T.</p> <p>I am not the less qualified to judge of the conduct private and public of Mr T. because of the <i>[unclear: sentiments]</i> I have <i>[unclear: entertained]</i>, and maintained in relation to the rebellion. I never have had but one opinion on that subject, and that was, that such folly and wickedness never was exhibited in any age by any civilised people. This opinion I have expressed on all suitable occasions, for which I have been frequently insulted and threatened with personal violence.</p> <p>After the order directing a Freedmans Court, I was selected by the Freedmen to attend to their interest in said court, but owing to my professsional engagements I had to decline. This would show that I had their confidence, and never having heard a solitary complaint from any one of them, I take it, that there could have been no cause for it.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>David Fultz</p></div> <!---->
