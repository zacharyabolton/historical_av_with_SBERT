Monday -- had a very comfortable nite, considering the fact that it was coming to Lexington -- Fred Effinger was my fellow traveller <u>all</u> the way &amp; he made himself very agreeable - - we joined "snacks" at Middlebrook &amp; I thereby kept the most of mine &amp; am "lunching" off it yet -- You can't imagine how good it tastes -- it has such a "home" flavor -- so different from the "hotel" flavor I am now <u>"enjoying"</u> -- (as Ma would say) -- <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> the hotel here is very well kept &amp; things are in very good order -- I got to work today -- Gen. Lee was very kind &amp; had my office fixed up just as I said -- got a "Morning Glory" stove &amp; anthracite cover split bottomed chairs, a good large table pro. tem. and he sent to Richmond for stuff for a new drawing board -- had a new window put in for more light, -- wash stand &amp; fixings &amp;c. and I have all "my traps" there and am very comfortable -- I go to work after breakfast -- normally 8 A.M. -- really 8 1/2 &amp; work until 3 P.M. when I come to dinner -- then stroll about until dark &amp; then come to my room at the hotel to read &amp; write until bed time -- 11 or 12 P.M. or sooner -- as the spirit moves -- I am availing myself of the college library to read some rare and valuable books that I have long desired to read -- I see the Richmond and N.Y. papers at Allen's but wish you would send me the Valley Virginian &amp; Spectator after you have read them, both in one wrapper for 2 cts. If the Co. Fair Spectator comes to the house please put them in my drawer so they will be together. I have a fine large room at the hotel, fire place, carpet, bed on castors, lounge, bureau, wardrobe, table, <u>rocking chair</u>, <u>arm chair</u>, split bottom chair &amp; Windsor chair, wash stand &amp;c -- (room for me sometimes) I am almost over my cold -- hope you are too -- I sent a boy up the day I left -- not knowing but you might want him - did you? I gave some of my oranges to Mrs. Lee &amp; some to Mrs. Campbell -- kept 3 &amp; gave Allen one. -- I have not been to see anyone -- Altmanns called to see me -- Write often &amp; tell me how you get along -- I shall write again soon. -- 10 P.M. Good night &amp; God bless &amp; keep you -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Affectionately</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
