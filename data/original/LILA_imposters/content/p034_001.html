I notified Mr. Somers the Sheriff not to arrest Curry until some decision had been given on such case. Without defending the conduct of such men in all cases, I am satisfied all such suits should be dismissed for as the courts are constituted in Highland the <u>same</u> law will not be administered if the <i>[unclear: Union]</i> man is <u>plaintiff</u> as if he is <u>defendant</u>.
