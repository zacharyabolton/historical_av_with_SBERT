His daughter is named <u>Easter</u> <u>Jackson</u>, and resides, as you informed me, with a <u>Mr. Kelloe</u>, a few miles from Staunton. He wishes you to have her delivered to your office as soon as possible, as he has made arrangements with the bearer of this - a train hand on the <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> Central Railroad, for her, transportation to Richmond, the bearer having kindly consented to bring her at a small cost to said Jackson, who is a very poor man, and is not able to pay full fare for her. He is under the impression that she would be of great service to himself and wife in enabling them to maintain a livelihood. <u>Jackson</u> is a very worthy colored man, and I would be obliged if you would do all you can for him in this matter.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> C Black<br>"New Nation" Printing Office</div> <!---->
