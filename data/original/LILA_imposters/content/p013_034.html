Jackson today, about the enemy in the Valley -- he said they had been Providentially protected so far and he hoped they would still be forced by the same kind Hand still. I wrote to you Friday, "Fast Day" and have been so busy, preparing some maps to accompany the "Reports of the Battles" which they have been writing, getting nearly through with the campaign of 1862, that I have not had time to write, but must rest tonight from drawing and so will write up my letters. The Gen. told me he had been notified of his being made a Life Member of the <abbr expan="Methodist Episcopal">M. E.</abbr> Home Missionary Society -- said he was glad they succeeded so well. We had a prayer meeting Sunday evening at 6 P. M. and also another yesterday evening -- and they are to be held regularly at our <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> Sunday &amp; Wednesday evening -- there were several preachers there yesterday evening.</p> <p> We have no news here, all quiet, a snow storm, then a clear day &amp; a variation of rain the next day -- It is quite spring like this evening, a high wind, some rain falling, warm red clouds, frogs croaking &amp;c. Gen. Lee has been quite sick for a few days, but is better now -- Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> was very much disturbed by Gen. Lee's sickness, for he thinks there is no one like him, having unlimited confidence in him. I am still eking out my butter &amp; we have a plenty of very good Molasses so get along very well -- but I shall try and send home before long in some way; we have a plenty of every thing except butter, though, as yet, and will have for some time, it is surprising how well the things last, they are so good too that it is a wonder we do not eat them up very soon -- but I husband them carefully so as to have something relishable every day -- Boswell was up, a few days ago, to Fauquier Co. and brought back a jar of pickles, so we get along very well in the sour line -- by the way, will not Mrs. Wilson, or some of those that make butter to sell, send it to Gen. Jackson -- Capt. Avis at Staunton will receive it and pay for it, the market price, he want wants some 10 or 15 lbs. every two weeks -- if any of them will supply him he will be much obliged -- enquire and let me know -- and if they can, any of them, send some the Gen. will write to Capt. Avis &amp; so it will come safely and mine can come by the same conveyance. I took a good bath today, a warm one, and put on a good nice suit of clean clothes and feel quite civilized -- we got some good soap from the Commissary and so William washes the clothes clean &amp; they look very well. Mr. Lindsay wrote to me a few days ago about buying his place -- it would be a very good one for a school, a small one, and then it is well fixed up -- but I do not know how it may buy it, but I will write to him and find out his terms &amp; see what I may devise then &amp; see if I can secure us a home &amp; quite a pleasant one too -- if he does not ask too much for it I can borrow the money on a long time and pay it in instalments and get it at a low rate of interest as money is so abundant now -- what do you think of it write to me at length, about it, but say nothing. I shall write to Lindsay about his terms &amp;c and can hear from him and you by the same mail -- I am glad you wrote in such good spirits &amp; hope you may continue feeling thus self assured, thus nobly relsoved, come weal, come woe, to endure to the end, trusting in God for the result -- and of that result we need not fear, for we have been favored and we shall still <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> favored of heaven if we do our duty &amp; forsake our sins, endeavoring to work honestly before God -- &amp; discharging all the obligations to our fellows that he requires of us -- Boswell laughs at your suggestion about sweethearts &amp;c, but says in the laugh that he will do as well for me as any <u>man</u> can -- he is a capital fellow -- a whole souled one, no little [underscored] meaness about him -- but always anxious to do his share of everything. I enclose you a slip taken from "The Sentinel", about Pelham -- Gen. Stuart wrote it -- keep it for me -- put it in your scrap book -- the poetry is rather hard, but the prose is good -- I will send you some money in a few days -- I pay an <abbr expan="account">a/c</abbr> of $100 against Dr. Butcher, that a Lt. in the army here has against him -- and I will send you the <abbr expan="receipt">recpt.</abbr> to file in my papers of his -- I shall try &amp; pay up what I have borrowed of his money this spring, so as not to be behind hand in that -- I think I can do it -- Did the cotton come to hund--? If you have to get shoes you hadbetter get them of Hughes in Staunton, he will make <u>good</u> ones - - &amp; if they may cost more they will be more durable -- Find in my bundle of receipts for 1859 or 1860, those of O. F. Grinnan for his salary that year and give it to Nelson -- in fact find all Grinnan's <abbr expan="receipts">recpts.</abbr> and give to him those he may select as necessary to close up his matters as connected with the deed of trust -- you know where to find them --</p> <p> I do not see any chance for home yet, but I may still get there some tiem during the Spring -- I shall send William with my box and let him stay, &amp; help you awhile -- as soon as Boswell's servant comes so we can have some one to take care of our horses.</p> <p> I send you, by the mail, today, the "Campaign from Texas to Maryland" -- it will interest you for some lonely hour -- O how eagerly I long for home and its sweet quiet -- its peaceful joyous days. God grant they may come back to us again -- and we "be happy still" in its sacred precincts.</p> <p> I wrote to Nelly &amp; she has my letter before now, I hope she could read it -- I regret that she is so much trouble to you in teaching her, but hope the labor will be lightened as she grows older &amp; that I may, ere long, relieve you from the double duties this unholy war imposes on you -- May God impart strength &amp; comfort to you &amp; have you all in his holy &amp; constant keeping -- My love for you all -- good night -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr>husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
