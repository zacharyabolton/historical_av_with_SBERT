Jackson -- the train was very long &amp; it was 5 o'clock when we started &amp; it was late when we got there back -- I got your letter after dark -- There are many that want furloughs to go home, but all are refused -- I have come up to town to ask for one by the influence of Col. Baylor but it will have to go to Woodstock for the Gen's Approval &amp; I am in poor hopes of his approving it as he wants troops so badly &amp; Baylor trusts the Battallion to me more than the other officers. We are poorly provided with tents &amp; cooking utensils but have guns enough The battle of Sunday last was one of the hardest yet -- the enemy had 25000 &amp; we 2500 engaged -- our loss is not nearly as great as reported &amp; many of our men are still coming in -- we took 10 prisoners -- Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> says he accomplished all he expected by his move I am in good health tho I have a little cold. Do not look for me though I will come if I can -- If our darling Nelly should die have her buried at Union -- but God grant she may be spared to us --</p> <p> I have but a moment to write &amp; must close -- Good bye. My love to all -- God bless the kind friends that aid you </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
