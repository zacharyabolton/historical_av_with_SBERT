He says that he will ship it to day + I told him to come to the Bank + draw a draft on you + I would give him the money for it at once, which is perfectly satisfactory to him. He says he will change you $9<sup>00</sup> but that it will be a very superior article of <u>Extra</u> flour- Extra flour is selling out of the waggon at 8<sup>25</sup> to 8<sup>50</sup>. I understand however that there is a great deal of indifferent flour brought in. I had been thinking of writing to you on the subject of fish when I received your letter.</p> <p>I wish you would send me about 8 pair nice shad by next Saturday's train. If you can get some of the men on the train to agree to deliver the box to the Pat Woodward baggage master on Central Road he will bring it up to me, but if you find any difficulty or have any doubt about their getting here on that day, just put them in the express, the fish we get here from the husksters are all so old + stale, they are not fit to eat. I want these fish for myself + friends. if you can put in some kind of <u>pan</u> fish for breakfast I would be glad. Let me hear from you on the subject</p> <p>You have never said anything about the flour I sent you. How did it turn out?</p> <p>With much love to Cousin Mary + the rest of the family, I am</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours Truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>A F Kinney</p></div> <!---->
