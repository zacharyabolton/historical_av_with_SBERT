Assaults have been quite frequent and the Magistrates to whom the cases are referred for trial do not give impartial decisions - the trials during the past month have resulted unfavorably to the freedmen. I have talked the subject over with the Judge of the Augusta <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> Court Common Wealth <abbr expan="Attorney">Atty</abbr>, and others, and feel convinced that it will be impossible to get just decisions before Magistrates until the sentiment of the people changes. The Magistrates holding office as a mere honorary title will not give decisions contrary to the sentiment of the communities in which they live, and until these preliminary trials are properly conducted, the Freedmen cannot get justice.</p> <p>Grand Jurors have in a very aggravated case refused to indite - the case has been duly reported. </p> <p>Freedpeople have conducted themselves well during the month, labor has been in good demand.</p> <p>I have registered since last report in compliance with Circular <abbr expan="number">No.</abbr> 11 C.S. 37 Couples and 144 children making a total of 758 couples and 213 children in the <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> of Augusta.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt</abbr> Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="George">Geo</abbr> T.
