Freddy enjoys himself here very much <i>[unclear: nocking]</i> about the Hotel running errand<sup>s</sup>, carrying messages for me &amp;c &amp;c I find him of great help to me he stand<sup>s</sup> in the office &amp; collect tickets at the dining room door thus making himself quite useful. I write this &amp; send both together. I hope you are all well Freddy wishes for you daily &amp; I too I do wish you were all here we are doing a good business here now.</p> <p>I had a bidder for the hotel yesterday I think we could have sold for $200,000<sup> <sup>00</sup> </sup> two hundred thousand Dollars furniture &amp; all. but this we would not take. gold is 25 for one which would make but Eight thousand dollars in coin and to hold the property until after the war it will always bring about fifty thousand dollars in good currency &amp; from this it would seem best to hold on to it as we could not apply the money now to any advantage. I would much rather rent it out but if I have to stay away from home, I dont see any better chance to make money than this although it is a disagreeable business</p> <p>I wish we could have had more time to consider this matter and have come to some definite conclusion on this subject</p> <p>The things I had with me I got through safely the articles groceries &amp;c, I sent out are still at the place I sent them near millcreek I could not get a wagon to bring them out M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> T- disappointed me.
