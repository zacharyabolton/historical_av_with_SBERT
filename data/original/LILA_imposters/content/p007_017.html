Not that I have any particular news to write about but to relieve the anxiety that presses upon my mind, for night &amp; Day my thoughts are with you both, and unless I can hear from you very often I get in a desponding mood which I can only relieve myself of by writing. I am now anxious at present for the reason that we have just heard the report of another battle at Shepherdstown where you are, and that your <abbr expan="company">Co.</abbr> was engaged in it, hence my writing before I again heard from you. If the report is true let me hear from you as soon as possible. There is no news of interest in this neighborhood, all are engaged with the war and seem to think of nothing else. Most of the farmers are engaged in harvesting, which is the best we have had here for several years. Fruits &amp; everything else in abundance. Corn is also looking finely.</p> <p>Sallie is mending slowly - she was down to see me on yesterday and sends her love to you with her sincere prayers for your safe return. Write soon all at home send love to you hoping to hear from you soon &amp; often.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your affectionate Mother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M L Roadcap</p></div> <!---->
