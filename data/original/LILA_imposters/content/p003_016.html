You need not tell any one where I have gone to. I will try and get back tomorrow night, if it be midnight when I get here. I know of no care in Court in which I am interested which will come up before my return.</p> <p>Didn't you tell me that our $300 note in Bank <abbr expan="would">wd.</abbr> be due to day? If so you must attend to its renewal or we will be protested. I forgot the thing on yesterday, or I should have attended to it. Mike Harman is our endorser. Renew for 116 days. You will find some blanks lying on your Table. The note is drawn "Imboden &amp; McCue."</p> <p>Bob Bickle has 294$ of mine which he told me last evening he would deposit to my credit in the <u>Central</u> Bank this <u>morning</u>. I wish you would see him before court meets &amp; have the money put there. I gave Ficklin a check for $300, &amp; two others checks for $50 each last evening &amp; my account at bank may be <u>short</u> to day unless this deposit is made this morning -- Don't forget it. Tell any body who wants to see me that I will be at home again on Friday--</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Yours">Yrs</abbr></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>J.
