I am stranger here but find no difficulty in making friends with them. The parents very <i>[unclear: readily]</i> promise to send their children to both day and Sunday School. Some of the parents keep this and send their children to both Schools are on the the increase we have some trouble with the Sabbath School on account of the disorderly state it is in. The superintendant and teachers are colored persons, and are not educated well enough to govern or teach. Mr. Scott cannot take the management of the school into his hands because the superintendant does not like anyone to interfere with him by Mr. Scott has formed a Bible Class for the benefit of the teachers and young persons who cannot attend Sabbath School the Class commenced with twenty young persons all of which appeared quite interested with the lesson and the manner in which it was conducted by this means we hope to have the scholars better taught and by degrees adds hope with the blessing of God to bring about a better of things I have obtained a Class of about seven scholars by visiting at their homes and asking them to help form a class more have promised and soon I hope to see them also--There are many others who need teaching and whom I hope will come before long--In addition to the day and night schools we have several outside classes. I have two the numbers of which study Reading Writing Arithmetic and Geography and as soon as the Christmas Holidays are over I expect to form a Sewing Class for the benefit of those who wish to learn to sew for many of them can neither <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> or make their own clothes so I hope to help them in this way--It seems to me it is very pleasant work to try and help those who are so willing to learn. I do not regret coming here and I like the work I am engaged in very much. I did not expect to find so many pretty and interesting children among colored peopke there are some pretty and <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> children in our school--Some of them are quite small and yet are allmost the best and farthest advanced scholars we have--And look as bright as they are in reality--It is indeed a pleasure to see their pleasant and happy faces</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>very respectfully,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>S H Davison</p></div> <!---->
