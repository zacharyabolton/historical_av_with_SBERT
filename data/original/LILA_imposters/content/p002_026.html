Here <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> we <i>[unclear: ly ]</i> down at the root of an oak to give you an idea of our camp life. We expected to have a long march to day as it is the day on which we generally do our large marching. We are within a few miles of the enemies camp. On yesterday we received information that they were crossing into <abbr expan="Virginia">V<sup> <sup>a</sup> </sup></abbr> and we were immediately if not sooner ordered out to meet them We got up the road about two miles when we called a halt to wait further news. About ten at night we were informed that they had gone back so we returned to camp. They however were met <del hand="h1">with</del> by our cavalry who killed three or four of them. We do not know there number but we have various reports from two to thirty thousand</p> <p>There are only three or four thousand of us, with four pieces of artillery It is thought that they are great cowards but, I think they are endeavoring to get us into a snap It is certainly very trying on the constitution to be <del hand="h1">always</del> on the verge of battle and then be disappointed. Our men seem very thoughtless &amp; indifferent on the subject &amp; I expect I am a little worse than any of them. For I have fully made up my mind to die here if necessary &amp; I really feel eager to get into action. I would much rather be at your fathers table enjoying the delicacies which your own hand has prepared; but since it must be so, I am perfectly satisfied. We have just listened to a sermon from <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Pendleton which differed in one immaterial respect from the one you have doubtless heard, in that we had no <i>[unclear: fase]</i> faces to look upon. This I believe is the first Sabbath we have spent in rest, &amp; we may yet be ordered out before night.</p> <p>The weather is dry and favorable for our mode of living only it is rather warm. We frequently pass soldiers on the march who have fallen in the road from heat and fatigue. It is certainly delightful to the weary soldiers after a hard march to lie down in the woods or clover field as it may be, and gaze at the moon &amp; stars. Lest Toney should think I am monopolizing space, (&amp; I have no doubt I am if I know anything about dryed apples) I will close. I can never forget, &amp; shall ever appreciate your kindness to me; &amp; if it should be my misfortune never to return I hope you at least will not allow my memory to perish with my body. <i>[unclear: How]</i> arrived in camp last evening, he was complaining a little but <i>[unclear: he's]</i> better this morning. He say he dont know whether he will remain or not Some of my love to all friends and the rest which you will find much the greater portion unless the bag leaks, <del hand="h1">and</del> you will reserve for yourself<br> Your sincere friend<br> S. A. T.xxxxxxx</p> <br> <p>Exit <abbr expan="Doctor">D<sup>r.</sup></abbr> Enter Toney:<br> John is now enjoying a sick repast, served up in soldier style, consisting of dry bread &amp; ____ beef which doubtless he enjoys as much if not more than the delicacies he spoke of in the introduction of this epistle. It is not worth my while to attempt to give you a d<del hand="h1">i</del>escription of our camp. John has already given you a full discription, &amp; in much better style than I could even if I were to try. This day appears more like sunday than any that I have passed over since I left home. Mr John Lightner arrived here on yesterday with <i>[unclear: How]</i> &amp; several other boys from town.</p> <p>I have written some three letters to you since I left the Ferry &amp; as yet have not received one from you. As for the note that accompanied yours &amp; Miss Jennie I would say as I have done that I hope you will drop the question in discussion. &amp; believe me to be as ever your <u>devoted</u> friend. I thought from the winding up of it that you meant differently, but I am <i>[unclear: strongly]</i> glad <i>[unclear: to]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> that such was not the case. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> You still have a heart that vibrates to the <i>[unclear: chords]</i> of love I must bring this letter to a close - for we cant get time to write any more at present <br></p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>yours truly in haste</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony P____</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S. Sam Thompson is laying by my side sound asleep - says he is going to cease all corrispondence after to day, when you write direct to Winchester. Our boys are tollerably well some have mumps &amp; some have the measles.
