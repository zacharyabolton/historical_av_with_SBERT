Who bought them or where they were taken to she never could learn, but thinks perhaps John Mitchell or Landon Talieferro who lives at New Glasgow, Amherst <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> may know. The poor woman it appears hid herself in the woods with her children to escape the sale but hunger compelled her to let her children return to the house for food, when they were seized and carried off. Her information is I fear too indefinite for discovery but she she is so earnestly desirous of regaining them that I respectfully forward her request in the hope some clue may be obtained from Mitchell or Talieferro.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Your obedient servant">Yr obt servt</abbr></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thos P.
