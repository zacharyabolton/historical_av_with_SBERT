But since our last meeting, (on the 25<sup>th</sup> last,) I have been led to believe that you then anticipated but little real enjoyment, or satisfaction, from a correspondence with us <u>being</u> so unworthy of being so highly honored For this reason I feel a considerable delicacy in writing, and indeed the thought of not writing at all, forced its self upon me, so powerfully, that for a time, that it had well nigh gained the day. If it be true that you cherish such thoughts [and it may be, that they are only too true] <del hand="h1">But</del> I think it nothing more, or less, than your duty, (and certainly no harm) to inform me of the fact. I censure no <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> for speaking the truth, thought it be at my expense. It is only that we may fairly understand each other that I write to you now. I know that you are uncertain, as to whether I will write or not; but I think I hear you say you give yourself but little concern about it. Very well: that is all right speak it out boldly; and I assure you, we shall soon understand each other. It is far from being my desire to prolong a correspondence, which would be far from satisfying to you. And I hope you will pardon me, if <ins>I</ins> say it was to obtain definate information, in regard to this correspondence that caused me to make that very unappropriate demonstration, on the (ever-memorable) morning (to me) of the 25<sup>th</sup> of August. But let me ask you to pity me, when I confess that I was met by a force, so irresistible that I was Gallently repulsed, and obliged to retreat somewhat in disorder, and doubtless, leaving behind the wounded; and without gaining the desired information period. But I sincerely hope that there were no wounded, at least, none that were more severely wounded than I was: <i>[unclear: just]</i> remember if I was wounded, it matters not: I censure no one but my-self for it. But please pardon me talking this nonsense. I know <del hand="h1">the</del>if you are looking for a letter from me, you are not expecting it to be made up, of this sort of material. - Probably I am <ins>doing</ins> wrong by expressing my thoughts in this way - I am naturaly of a rebellious nature; and these may only be rebelious thoughts that have been forced upon me; and have no foundation: I hope that this is all. I cannot blame <del hand="h1">a</del> persons for ceaseing to bestoow his affections upon any one whom <del hand="h1">they</del> <ins> <del hand="h1">he</del> </ins> <ins>they</ins> cannot like. I <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> no hard feelings towards you. <i>[unclear: But]</i> on the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> they are <i>[unclear: warm]</i>, and <i>[unclear: gregarious]</i>.</p> <p>But, allow me, (in conclusion, on this subject,) to say that though this correspondence may cease to exist; yet our relations towards each other, as <u>true friends</u> shall never cease. It is not my intention to wound your feelings by and of these ab<i>[unclear: e]</i>surd expressions; - to touch the tender cords of your generous heart, would be an experiment, which I have no particular fancy and which I dare not attempt. I am declared here as a patient only, in the hospital, and do not dislike it as much as I had expected though it is rather lonesome to me, as I am not acquainted about here. I spend my time in walking and sitting about the streets, when I have no reading, writing, or other duties to claim my attention. I <i>[unclear: intent]</i> to appear again before the board as soon as it meets in our <u>ward</u>, if I can get a recommendation from the <u>ward</u> surgeon.</p> <p>I guess we have no news except what you will have heard before this reaches you. Rumor says that Early has had a fight, and whiped the yankeys badly, and captured - - - prisoner<i>[unclear: s]</i> four or five hundred, and they say he is now at Bushers hill twelve miles below Winchester Lee, (I am glad to hear) has captured two thousand prisoners, and nine pieces of artillery, but the yanks still hold the Weldon railroad.</p> <p>I had the wholesome pleasure of listening to two sermons last sunday; - and of drinking in the ward, or of "feeding upon the sincere <i>[unclear: milds]</i> of the word", as preached from the pulpit, of the Episcopal Church. - Excellent sermons; but not to be compared with that delivered by Mr. Preston, at <u>Rocky Spring</u> If possible, I would be glad to hear from you soon. A letter from a friend is always welcome by me, and never rejected - - direct to the care of <u>Woods &amp; Gilkeson</u></p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yates Ramsey</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="September">Sept.</abbr> 1<sup>st</sup><br>P.S. As I did not get this sent off yesterday, I will add a line, to say that I did not succeed in getting another leave of absence, but have improved so fast, that they consider me fit for duty, and I will start for the command tomorrow morning. There are some wounded coming in from down the Valley; and among those who came in this morning, was <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> <abbr expan="William">Wm.</abbr> L. Jackson. He has a right bad wound - look pretty <del hand="h1"></del> It is reported that what few men are left of the 25<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="Regiment"> <i>[unclear: Rg]</i> </abbr> have got permission to go to other commands, untill the prisoners shall be exchanged. But I think it herdly probable that he would give them that privilege. In case it be true, I guess I will have to flank a horse and try and share some of the glorious reputation, attached to the 47<sup>th</sup> battalion <br> <br> Should you think to confer upon me the honor, of receiving a letter from your hand please direct to <abbr expan="Company">Co.</abbr> "D." 25 <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> <abbr expan="Infantry">Inft.</abbr>: Jones brigade Gordons Division; and to the care of <abbr expan="Captain">Captn</abbr> G.
