Ewell says we will all get fat here -- It was one of the most amasing sights I ever saw to see the broadclothed gentry com-ing in &amp; bringing saddles, bridles &amp;c &amp; making a pile of them in the square for the use of the Rebels -- this land is full of every thing -- the stores were opened &amp; they had to sell goods at their old prices for Confederate money -- I bought about $100 worth of calico, wool <i>[unclear: delaine]</i>, bleached cotton, hoops, gloves, thread, gingham, pins &amp;c &amp;c which I hope to get home in due time if we stop short of N.Y -- Providence has abundantly blessed our movement, few casualties of any kind -- and our success wonderful -- we shall get nearly a million dollars worth of horses, supplies of all kinds &amp;c from this county, (Franklin) &amp; we have invaded Fulton &amp; Adams Cos. -- also and shall levy on them in like manner -- supporting our army entirely on the enemy -- they say they never felt the war before but the first taste is enough for them they do not care for more I saw Kenney Campbell, <i>[unclear: Brow]</i> Allen, Eubanks, Cameron, Cochran &amp;c on yesterday, they were all well &amp; were enjoying the fat of the land hugely -- it is like a whale full of blubber to a Greenlander Gen. <abbr expan="Ewell">E.</abbr>says -- The people are very submissive and comply, meekly, with the demands made on them -- I think we shall be able to do a good deal towards bringing about an honorable peace -- Yours of the 8<sup>th</sup> overtook me in <abbr expan="which">wh.</abbr> you had the "blues" badly -- I feel like writing often but the flesh is weak &amp; I have to yield to sleep -- have not had time even to write in my journal But do not scold me -- but write to me as often as you can -- It is cheering to <u>hear</u> from home when one may not get there -- yea <u>cannot</u> get there so be of good cheer &amp; dont complain &amp; dont say, pouting out your sweet little lips, I wont write unless you do -- that's naughty. -- I am glad you were soon rid of the army, but such is the history of it every where when about home &amp; you may be thankful you fared no worse, though I am very sorry the fruit of your wearisome labors should be thus <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> destroyed -- I will be as well to sell the sewing machine if you can get a good price, it is a piece of <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> B. <i>[unclear: Gamber]</i>.
