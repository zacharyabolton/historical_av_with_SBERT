McCue lost his goods in one of Imbodens wagons -- I am sorry -- for he had a great deal of trouble to get them I sent my bundle up to Staunton by Maj. Braithwaite -- directed to myself care of Maj. Bell &amp; I will write to Maj. Bell to send it to you -- I hope to be able to get other things before the season is over -- a great many got nothing as the people of Frederick purchased immunity by paying $200000, &amp; only sold if they pleased &amp; they required "greenbacks" -- &amp; they were hard to get -- we were not in any other place where there was any thing -- I will repeat the contents of my bundle so you may know if all of it comes -- to hand -- I enclosed it in some linen &amp; sewed it up &amp; then put it in a bag -- There is an overcoat along - a very nice one - which Robinson captured at Harpers Ferry -- take care of it -- then 7 yds. of grey cloth, for a coat &amp; pants for myself -- 1/2 doz. <abbr expan="Handkerchiefs">Hdkfs</abbr> -- (2 kinds)2 <abbr expan="pairs">prs</abbr> shoes -- 40 yds. dark calico 20 yds bleched cotton -- a piece of some 8 or 10 yds -- 6 yds. of bonnet Ribbon, 1 small cravat -- 2 undershirts, 1 <abbr expan="pair">pr</abbr> drawers, 1 bottle of brandy -- (a present to me from Maj. Hawks, which I send for your use) some <i>[unclear: gents]</i> socks -- that is all I believe -- sorry it is no more but will hope for another opportunity. </p> <p> Yesterday, after we thought we were fixed for a rest in camp the Yankees came on across the Mt. &amp; attempted to cross the Shenandoah River -- in fact they did cross, but Gen. Rodes fell on them &amp; compelled them to go back with considerable loss -- we had quite a hard fight &amp; lost quite a number of men -- The fight was at Rock's ford some 6 miles <abbr expan="North East">N. E.</abbr> of Berryville -- Today the enemy has been demonstrating towards Winchestertrying to induce us to go away from here -- I do not know how well they may succeed -- they have quite a large force -- the 19<sup>th</sup> Corps that has been in La. has been brought up -- the 6<sup>th</sup> Corps from Grant's Army -- then all Hunter's &amp; Siegel's forces -- some 25000 men perhaps -- but I think if we can induce them to fight, by God's blessing we can whip them -- It is very dry here -- the grass completely scrorched -- I sent my watch up by Maj. McCue -- get it if you have a chance -- I have sent my horses home by <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> Horger to go to Mr. Geedings -- say to him I hope he will do the best he can for them in the way of pastures -- I am riding over this county mapping it -- am very busy &amp; tired at night -- so do excuse this -- Love &amp; kisses &amp; blessings for you all -- Write often -- I just got yours of June 12<u> <u>th</u> </u> -- Hunter filled it up -- Good bye my sweet one </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff.</abbr> husband --</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
