The enemy made an attack yesterday at 5 A. M all along our lines, sending up four solid lines against our front -- but we repulsed them handsomely, with tremendous loss to them &amp; not much to us except in officers -- it is thought we killed &amp; wounded ten times as many of them as they did of us -- we drove off all their attacks on our line every where &amp; were masters of the position -- We captured 2 Brigadiers just at dark, one of them Seymour that commanded at <i>[unclear: Aluster]</i> &amp; they were here last night. Col. Warren of the 10<sup>th</sup> was killed - Capt. Wilson, <abbr expan="Daniel">Danl</abbr> Wilson's son, was wounded in the leg -- not a very bad one -- . Col. Thompson Brown was killed -- our loss in privates quite small -- Longstreet gave them a good dose on our night surge think the Yankees are leaving -- but I think not, for they have a large army -- have soked it up from every direction &amp; have staked all on the issue of this battle -- they burned Orange <abbr expan="Court House">C. H</abbr> a few days ago -- the scoundrels -- Gen. Lee led a gallant charge yesterday -- he praises the counduct of our Corps much -- we have our Army closed up &amp; can make a fine fight with God's blessing -- Many of our men have not beeen engaged yet. Love and Kisses for you &amp; the children &amp; may God bless you -- write to me -- in haste </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
