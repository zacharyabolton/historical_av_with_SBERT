I have a great deal of work to be done and am in very great need of a hand being myself very weak handed. The neighbors are very much down on me for hiring him under the circumstances but I assure you I did it in good faith not intending anything wrong towards anyone.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully Your Friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>L.
