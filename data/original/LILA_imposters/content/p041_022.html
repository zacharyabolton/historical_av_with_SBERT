The Report of your speech, an extract of which I sent you, certainly made "injurious reflections" upon me, and contained matter "personally offensive." This, now, you fully disclaim; and, of course, I understand you as <u>not</u> approving or sanctioning the Report.</p> <p>You know that Mr. Wells &amp; myself are extreme antipodes. If he opposes the "New Movement" for reasons of his own, I oppose it for reasons opposite to his own. I oppose <u>both</u> <u>Evils</u>, and he <u>one</u>, and it is hard for me to say which is worst. If yours be the <u>better</u> of the two, <u>the worst may, perhaps, be most easily escaped from</u>. I will take neither. Either must be <u>forced</u> upon me, and I will not only contest it for life, but have the contest to be carried out by my heirs forever. I dont hold to your logic that it follows that the Enquirer &amp; I must be wrong "because of the association we were thrown into." - We have been thrown into no association whatever with Mr. Wells. The Enquirer &amp; I are doing, what <u>you</u> were doing but very lately, <u>opposing both Wells and Negro Suffrage</u>. <u>You and he</u> are now both advocating it, and you have joined him in yielding to the wisdom of Congress the whole "organic law" of this old State; and the Enquirer &amp; I are continuing our opposition to you both.</p> <p>But, if "Noscitur a Sociis" is to be the test, and you dont desire to be judged by your companions, let me tell you there are worse people than Wells to beware of - people who are not Wells nor Wises - and you had better seek better company when you next visit Washington. Your very mission there throws you necessarily into bad "association, I say this in the most fair &amp; friendly spirit of a comrade who by signing the Ordinance of Secession with you, on the 17<sup>th</sup> June 1861, counseled the people of Augusta to fight for their Constitutional Liberty and for their rights of Self-Government.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Henry A.
