On last Thursday I met the above mentioned freedmen on the Valley Pike &amp; they told me they wanted work. I told them I had about two dozen stumps I wanted dug up &amp; would give the customary price (ten cents a stump) or fifty cents a day when they finished the job. They agreed to take the job at fifty cents a day to be paid when the job <u>was</u> <u>finished</u>. They commenced work &amp; continued to work for one day &amp; a half getting all of the stumps <ins>up</ins> but about eight which would have taken a little over a half day. They then came over &amp; told me they would work no longer &amp; demanded their pay. I told them if they would return &amp; finish as agreed upon I would willingly settle with them. <u>That</u> they refused to do. Richard Vaughn said he was sick &amp; could not work whereupon I paid him a part of his wages (65 cents) &amp; told him when the rest of the work was done the remainder would be paid. As to Robert Napper, he gave no reason whatever for not fulfilling his part of the contract consequently I paid him nothing. Now sir I think you will agree with me that the said men are not entitled to their pay until they perform the labor agreed upon. In regards to digging the <u>stumps</u>, which are old locust &amp; consequently not particularly difficult to get up I helped myself a great part of the time they were at work &amp; assisted in getting up at least half of those that were gotten up. I suppose you know nothing of me. I will refer you to any &amp; every gentleman in Staunton in regards to my character &amp;c &amp;c. Hoping that you will sustain me in what I have done </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I remain Sir <br><abbr expan="yours">yrs</abbr> &amp;c</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John N.Opie</p></div> <!---->
