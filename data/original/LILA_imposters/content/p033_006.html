Miss Rowell however intimates to me that she will not be allowed to act as his assistant nor is she willing to do so. This will necessitate a change for her and the assistant promised by <abbr expan="Freedman's Aid Commission">F.A.C.</abbr> of New York, now daily expected. Please have matter arranged definitely (for this double correspondence and expectation of change is prejudicial to the school and unpleasant to Miss Rowell) and inform me of decision as soon as possible.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Your obedient servant">Yr obt servt</abbr></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thos P.
