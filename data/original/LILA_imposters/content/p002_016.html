I hardly know what to write about, as we are now leaving our <u>beloved</u> <u>valley</u> to the mercy of the Yankees. But we have certainly left - &amp; are now on our way across the Blue Ridge. I suppose to join Johnsons Army. In a few more days you may expect to hear of <ins>a</ins> big fight somewhere. I will not trouble you with any more war news at present. But will say a word in answer to something you said in your letter. You spoke of being forced to come to a certain conclusion but you did not say what it was. Well I have imagined to myself what that conclusion was &amp; from what cause <ins>you came to it</ins> I am <i>[unclear: truly]</i> at a loss to know. You have made such declarations before &amp; I assure you you do me great injustice. I hope therefore that you will give yourself no more <u>uneasiness</u> on that subject, unless it is your pleasure to do so - please excuse this hasty note &amp; I will if <i>[unclear: prompted]</i> write you again at my earliest opportunity. I wrote you twice since I left but suppose you did not receive either from the <i>[unclear: tenor]</i> of your last. I must bring this to a close for the present with a hope (however faint it may be) of hearing from you soon again. But if the Yankees get up the valley so as to cut off communication Remember that you will still be remembered most affectionately by your absent friend <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del><br> Tony_<br> The Boys are generally well &amp; in fine spirits. My love to all &amp; <i>[unclear: recain]</i> the same. Farewell for the present.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Buck is with us again <i>[unclear: stands]</i> the march very well We have been out two nights without anything in the way of new clothes. All our baggage has been sent up to Staunton &amp; will go across by <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> I suppose. I tell you we have hard times now sure but hope there are better times coming.<br><br> P.S. Please don't show this to any one for my sake. I could write more if I had paper but we are all out. I dont know what we will do after this, but it may be we wont need it. This I hope will not be the case. Tell Annie B I owe her a letter &amp; will answer it as soon as I can</p></div>
