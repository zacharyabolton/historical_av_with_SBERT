You have before this, long before, heard of Gen. Jackson's death, funeral processions &amp; burial -- he is gone and sleeps in the Valley he loved so much -- We miss him all the time &amp; a void is made here which time can hardly fill -- it seems not like our "old <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> to any of us &amp; less to me than to any one else, for my tent mate is gone as well as my General -- I do not know whether I shall stay here or not, I shall for the present. Gen. A.P. Hill is in command of our Corps, he is an able General &amp; will fill well the place of Gen <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> in a purely military point of view, but he is not a "man of God" like &amp; wears not "the sword of the Lord and of Gideon", but still we have Gen. Lee, a <u>good</u> man &amp; true, faithful in all things &amp; we trust Gen. Jackson "still lives" to plead our cause. Our success was a decided one, the Yankess had exhausted every appliance to make Hooker's Army complete &amp; it had the power of numbers, he could not have managed more men &amp; yet we routed &amp; defeated them at every point and compelled them to seek safety in flight, and though we had a large number of men wounded, yet many of them were slight &amp; a large number have already returned to duty-our loss in killed was disproportionately small, less than usual for the numbers engaged, though the loss of officers was remarkably large. Some that we thought killed were only captured &amp; will soon be back. Gen. Jackson was riding ahead of his men after we had routed the enemy &amp; pursued them some 2 miles when, it having become twilight he suddenly came on the enemy's skirmishers &amp; being appraised of it by some one he turned back, when a lineof our men on the side of the road mistook him &amp; his staff for the Yankess coming back &amp; fired on them, he then went towards the other side of the road &amp; was fired on again -- by our own men -- Boswell had just gone to report to Gen. A. P. Hill who was putting his men in front at the time -- taking the place of Rodes' men who had been in the front during the day &amp; he was a little behind Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> when it is supposed his horse rushed forward &amp; thus brought him under the fire of the volley of musketry the enemy opened very soon after our men fired -- Maj. Pendleton &amp; myself came riding up a little distance behind, a few rods &amp; came up to Gen. Jackson a moment before the Yankee Volley opened &amp; I had started back after Dr. McGuire as the enemy opened several pieces of artillery on us in the road, a short distance off, with grape &amp; canister, one of the most terrific storms of such missles I ever saw -- and I was only surprised that every one exposed to it was not destroyed for it raked the road which was full of soldiers, artillery, officers on horseback &amp;c -- I hope to never be in such a place again. I went to the hospital where Gen. <abbr expan="Jackson">J.</abbr> was taken &amp; then to where Gen. Lee was, that night, aftermidnight, having to go a long ways &amp; I did not get back to look for Boswell until noon the next day, in fact the enemy had possesion of the place where he was killed until about the time -- I found him looking perfectly natural, a smile on his face -- I have no doubt he was instantly killed, for two bullets went through his memorandum book in his side pocket &amp; then through his heart. I got an ambulance and took his body to a nice family grave-yard, Mr. Lacy's brother's and there had a grave dug &amp; wrapped his over coat closely around him, putting the cape over his head &amp; buried him thus, in all the martial dress, lowering him to his resting place in a shelter tent I picked up on the field of battle, and then spreading it over him -- Mr. Lacy made a noble prayer &amp; we finished our sad duty just as the moon rose over the distant hill of his own loved native county, Mr. Lacy, Mr. Brown &amp; myself &amp; the two men that dug the grave were all that were there &amp; we freely wept a we left his manly form to await the last trump -- he was a Christian &amp; has gained by the exchange of worlds, I doubt not -- and so too has our "Great Leader" for this life was to him one of constant toil and anxious care for the welfare of those entrusted to him -- and for the good of our beloved country -- they were both true to their country &amp; their God --I am sorry the people despond. I see no reason to do so, but, on the contrary, much to cheer and gladden -- true lives have been sacrificed, but such is the price of liberty and without it there can be no redemption -- <u>all</u> will mourn, I doubt not, but the days must come when sorrow shall be turned into joy. I have not the most distant idea that Virginia will be given up, I see nothing to indicate it, but much, very much, that proves conclusively, to my mind, that we shall successfully hold it &amp; perhaps make it too warm to hold the enemy at the same time -- trust still in God's protecting care -- the enemy has gained but little ground here, in Va. I mean &amp; holds that at our discretion, as proven by the successful movement of Imboden &amp; Jones, and I do not think the Yankees will ever be able to make another successful raid towards Richmond, Stuart will be after them -- he is now in the saddle &amp; may be heard from ere long -- he commanded our Corps after Gen. Jackson's wound was rec'd for Gen. A. P. Hill was struck by a spent ball &amp; bruised so he had to go off the field &amp; nobly did Stuart lead it too. The conduct of the enemy is horrible in the Valley, but I hope our day of retribution will come soon -- I saw a poor woman yesterday whom the Yankees had robbed of every thing the third time, she had been in good circumstances, she was mending an old &amp; tattered dress, the only one they had left her she said save the poor one she had on -- they had taken every thing she had laid up to eat -- she said she prayed &amp; she hoped it was not a wicked prayer "That there migh never be another Yankee child born &amp; that not one of the race might be left on the face of the earth by the first day of next June" -- &amp; as she spoke the tears ran down her cheeks -- . I wrote to you about the Lindsey place -- I do not want it now &amp; I will think about the other -- I send you forty dollars in this letter -- have you used your check -- If you put me up a jar of butter make it salter &amp; hack it harder if you can -- It is late &amp; I am tired -- so my love to you may our Heavenly Father bless you.
