You must direct one at Swope's Depot Augusta <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr>, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> as we have orders to move tomorrow to that neighborhood. I suppose we remain there for some time. Could you see any chance to send out a Letter direct as follows: <abbr expan="D. C. Snyder">D.C.S.</abbr>, <abbr expan="Quartermaster">Qt. M.</abbr> <abbr expan="Department">Dept.</abbr> 11th <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg.</abbr> <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> Cav'ly, Rosser's Brigade, near Swope's Depot, Augusta <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr>, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> I wish our move was in the direction of home rather than another direction. I fear I shall not hear often from home. You must write me on all occasions. Do all you can to find opportunities to forward.</p> <p>I have been made very sick tonight. I am not sick or dangerously so - will explain when I see you. Jimmy can give you an idea of the cause if you see him for he frequently is called upon to undergo such a dose as I have had tonight. I only wish he had been here tonight to enjoy the sickness and swallow the dose I had to take tonight. I shall put in for a Furlough as soon as I see a chance to get it. Has Mrs. <i>[unclear: Nunn]</i> been to see you? I shall call and see her as I go through Harrisonburg. It will take us 3 days to go to camp. We will camp 12 miles west of Staunton at Swope's Depot.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Hastily your <abbr expan="affectionate">Aff.</abbr> <abbr expan="husband">H.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="D.
