I dont think<br> he is yet any better. He didnt rest well, <ins>Last night</ins><br> not sleeping much, though not so<br> restless as he has been.<br> His mind still wanders some but<br> not so much <ins>as</ins> it <del hand="h1">has been done</del> did<br> yesterday and <ins>the</ins> day before<br> The <abbr expan="doctor">Dr.</abbr> says he has an affection<br> of the spine and through that<br> affects his brain. He just now<br> advised me to try and get a private<br> house to move him to, and promised to go<br> with me to find one. I think it<br> will be a great deal better to move <ins>him</ins><br> if I can. He is here in a room with 5 or<br> six others Making it too much<br> crowded and too much noise <ins>and</ins> with<br> their bad breath. He was at first<br> so restless tossing from side to side<br> and getting up, that I could scarcely<br> keep him in bed at all. He now lies quietly<br> but doesnt sleep very much, has<br> considerable fever, but does not com<br> plain of any pain. The <abbr expan="doctor">Dr.</abbr> has put a<br> blister between his shoulders this morning.<br> All the medicine, he has given,<br> is spirits of turpentine and dovers<br> powders mixed with quinine and<br> calomel.<sup>[4]</sup> I stay with him all the<br> time, and will, until he can be out<br> The boys, of our company, are very kind<br> in assisting me. </p><p> <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Wilson <sup>[5]</sup> is this morning<br> a good deal better. His eyes were so<br> swollen for a day or two, that he could<br> not see at all. </p><p> Ther are a great many sick here.<br> </p><p> A few regiments of the enemy were<br> advancing this way yesterday, causing<br> us to anticipate a battle here last night<br> or to day, but this morning it is suppos <br> osed there will be no fight for some days. <sup>[6]</sup><br> I havent time to write any more this<br> morning. I will write in a day or<br> two again. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>As ever your son,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Andrew Brooks</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>After I had mailed this letter <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr><br> Houston came in and told me, he<br> thought <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> would likely not<br> get well.
