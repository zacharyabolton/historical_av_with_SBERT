In these, the accused have been required to answer indictment for larceny &amp; assault &amp; battery before the next Grand Jury. I have no hesitation in saying that impartiality and fairness were observed on the part of the Magistrate in the disposition of these cases.</p> <p>In settling difficulties of a Civil nature where a colored man appeared as a party, I have adopted the course of my predecessor - by adjudicating them at this office as far as possible. I am convinced that this course results to the welfare &amp; interest of the freedmen, they being relieved of the expense of a trial by the Civil tribunals, which expense, in their poverty stricken condition, they are unable to bear.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Roswell Waldo<br><abbr expan="Assistant Sub Assistant Commissioner">A S A Comr</abbr></p></div> <!---->
