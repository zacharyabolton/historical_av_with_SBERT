Some of your old friends wish very much to see &amp; hear you again. Mr Morrison I know would be greatly gratified to meet you. He was out yesterday, but I did not get to speak to him. I believe he is in his usual health.</p> <p><abbr expan="Brother">Bro.</abbr> Harris would supply your pulpit for you I have no doubt.</p> <p>Remember me kindly to Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Farland &amp; your family.
