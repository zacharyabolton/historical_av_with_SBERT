T. Brodt sued me-- I was a good deal surprised -- for I thought we had the matter safely taken care of, and that we could offsett my note with his. How is it? How came they to get judgement &amp; what is the state of our proceedings <abbr expan="against">agst.</abbr> Brodt. I wish you would, immediately, write to me, <u>fully</u>, in reference to this, that I may know what to depend on -- &amp; if you will not be over in time to urge the matter to a close I wish you would send over the papers and instruct me in reference to them, directing what to do. If it's "Common law', it's not common sense, that I <abbr expan="should">shd.</abbr> pay him when he is largely my <abbr expan="servant">Ser</abbr>. Harman has never sent any queries to me, and so I have not answered them -- I should suppose that he could be compelled to try the case now -- after waiting so long. I shall apply to Harman for his interrogatories &amp; I wish you would put all the legal machinery to work to bring him up -- I tell you he is hard to head off on anything -- as poor Skinner is finding out to his cost -- worse off the track than on. I shall wait anxiously for a reply.</p> <p>We are having glorious weather now -- joyous May. The candidates for M. C. are in motion too -- so life is stirring on all sides -- The contest though is getting too much one sided -- Harris is decidedly gaining ground -- the Dutch blood is getting up for the favorite son of the "Tenth Legion", I should like to see Skinner elected, myself, but I see no chance for him. My school closes, in 4 weeks <del hand="h1">here</del>, then, I shall go to <abbr expan="Churchville">Chur-ville</abbr> and open there, perfectly independent, on the 1<u>st</u> of next <abbr expan="September">Sept</abbr>.</p> <p>If you can do anything for me, from your region, I will be obliged to you. If you come over at any time, we should be glad to see you at Lock Willow Farm.</p> <p>I suppose you saw the notice of Bartlett's Marriage, in the Spectator. He is making a decided stir among the Brooklynites as a preacher. They are improving this place in a way that will render it very attractive -- making walks, renovating cabins &amp;c &amp;c -- It will soon be one of the pleasantest places in the <abbr expan="mountains">Mts.</abbr> I had the pleasure of hearing Everett, in Staunton, His address was just what I expected -- from the man &amp; the subject. Of course "Old Augusta" came in for her share of the <i>[unclear: honors]</i>.
