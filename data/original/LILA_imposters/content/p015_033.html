I am much gratified that Allie has recovered from her worst state &amp; reason has resumed its sway -- I think she has done right &amp; am ready to sustain her -- I wrote fully in my letter of a few days ago &amp; hope that has come to hand. As to Lora you must do as you please &amp; charge as you please, I have not a word to say, only I fear you would have too much to do -- I want you to use yourown judgement, for I am not at home to aid you &amp; all the trial would be your own -- I know you have enough to do &amp; unless you were helped at the same time I fear you would only add to your cares &amp; I do not want that -- but as I said I cannot advise - I wrote to you to send the butter I hear from you that Reed has butter &amp; Cheese for me at quite a reasonable rate -- I am much obliged to him &amp; now the getting of them -- the ladies tell me that Mrs. Wise is coming down next week -- perhaps she would take charge of them especially if she has any one with her &amp; I will be under many obligations -- or Mr. Reed may find some one coming to the army who will bring them toBrandy Station -- where Maj. Hawks will take care of them -- he is at Dr. Harris' house a short distance from the depot -- have Reed box them securely -- &amp; I want them to come by some safe charge --</p> <p> Mr. W. J. Points comes down day after tomorrow &amp; if Reed can get them to him he will bring them down. We are on hard tack, bread &amp; meat but in very good quarters, in a roomy old house -- "Berry Hill", 4 miles from here -- full of broken furniture which the Yankess destroyed -- If my butter &amp; cheese get here I shall live very well for a long time &amp; they will be as cheap as any thing we buy. Get him to get you some if you can --</p> <p> I am very well &amp; very hard at work -- I heard today that Imboden captured 480 Yankees at Charlestown but was retreating up the Valley Much love &amp; Kisses for all may our merciful God bless you -- </p> <p> Write to me soon - the young ladies here send you much love --</p> <p> My regards to Mrs. Wise &amp; family -- Tell Allie to be of good cheer.</p> <p> I will write to Mr. Bear in a day or two -- I am waiting to hear from some of the officers of the <abbr expan="Engineering">Eng.</abbr> <abbr expan="Regiment">Rgt</abbr> It was a roll of flat cap paper I wanted to send to Lt.
