I was glad to hear from you &amp; to know that you were well. I received a box of provisions from John some time since, in which was a cheese that he said you sent. I am very thankful to you for it. &amp; must say that it was the best I have eaten since I left home. you have no idea how much I appreciate this present, in the way of eatables &amp; I hope by strict attention to business &amp; duty to merit a continuance of your hospitality.</p> <p>I have nothing of interest to write you at this time. we are in tolerably good spirits. We have had pretty hard times in the last few days, have taken up the line of marching. We have made three trips to Fairfax, &amp; are now under marching orders to some point. The troops are passing our camp this morning, going in the direction of fairfax. I suppose there is where we will go. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Craig is still mending slowly, but is very low yet. There is a goodeal of sickness amongst our soldiers now. Caused by the damp weather. we have rain nearly all the time. it is raining now &amp; has been for several days.</p> <p>I will not trouble you with a long letter at this <ins>time</ins> as times are very dull &amp; news hard to get. Our pickets extend within five miles of Alexandria at this time. They have had several little <i>[unclear: mishes ]</i> lately. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Stuart succeeded in taking a hill on which the enemy's picket have been posted for some time, &amp; is now busily engaged fortifying the same. It is said that he can see every move of the enemy from this point with the aid of a spy-glass Washington &amp; Alexandria are visible from this point. All that is necessary to make us in <ins>(a</ins> great degree) successful is to hold this positiion. But I must close for the present. excuse brevity, &amp; all mistakes as I am in a great hurry.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>yours truly in haste</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>Sam</u> <u>Frank</u></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.
