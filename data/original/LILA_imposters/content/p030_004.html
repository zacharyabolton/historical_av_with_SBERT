I want him to give me a deed for the Bath iron works, also the Bonds for Five thousand <abbr expan="Dollars">Doll</abbr>, to be transferred to me and to pay me one thousand <abbr expan="Dollars">dolls.</abbr> Semi Annually for ten years with interest, the first payment to be made on the first January next, and to pay your fee for effecting a settlement with him. I must have something tangible as I have debts that must be paid or secured by something substantial, he must have the control of money or securities as his own family are to received Nearly all the legacies left by Weaver. My Claim for the amount <u>stolen</u> with interest amounts to 32.160 <abbr expan="Dollars">Dolls</abbr> which amount I must have paid to me and to Cover up which my Ledger has been stolen from my Office. But fortunately I have copies of the transaction which I can prove by two witnesses who took the copies from the Ledger &amp; compared with the Cash Book.</p> <p>Mr. Dickson is also aware of the alteration of Book, having comparred the entries on the Cash Book &amp; Ledger.</p> <p>I consider this last theft as bad or worse than the first and I am determined to sift it to the bottom as no person but Brady could have had any interest in taking the ledger from <sup>my</sup> office, under these circumstances, I must insist on having some justice done Me for God knows he has caused me a large amount of trouble by his Course, when it should have been other wise after all I did for him -- My dear Mr. Stuart I hope You will succeed making this settlement for me as soon as possible and in getting all the Security that is possible for I have lost all Confidence in him, in whom unfortunately I had paled too much I beg you will urge a speedy settlement as I have pressing claims on Me.</p> <p>I trust your Son has recovered entirely from illness. Waiting your answer I remain</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very truly Yours &amp;c</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P Brady</p></div> <!---->
