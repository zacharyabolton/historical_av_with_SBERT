Every line written by your dear hand is sacred, &amp; valued I wish from my heart that you were here this Evening for it has been such a long time since you were with me. I looked for you last Saturday. I thought you would certainly come, &amp; stay all week I did want you to come so much but your letter Explained it all why you could not come then. I am so glad you are coming Saturday if you live I hope the day will be as bright &amp; pleasant as this has been then you will have a nice ride. You can't imagine how much pleasure it gave me to have you say you never doubted my affection for you. it is such a relief to me to know that you safely trust &amp; believe in my love, for I do so entirely give you my heart with all its affection that were athought to enter my mind that you for one moment doubted me I should be very unhappy. Then never think that I do not love you, &amp; nothing but a wish from you can Ever change my devotion, &amp; were you even to wish that I should cease to love or think of you I could not obey you, but would love you to my dying day Even without hope. it is far better suited to my nature to love &amp; remember then to hate, &amp; forget those once dear to me. You must never ask me not to love you for I do firmly beleive that if you should cease to love me &amp; would not want my love that my heart would break, &amp; I would not wish to live without your dear &amp; most precious love for it is the brightest sweetest &amp; best beloved joy of my life to feel sure of your undivided &amp; entire affection. I never want to think that you have Ever loved any one but me nor that you ever will love another while I live. it is my nature to be selfish in my love I can't help it either. try as I may to be more generous I can't that is just the truth. in verytruth I can't bear to think that any one should fill your heart &amp; thoughts but my self. I know no one does for your word is law to me I believe the slightest word you ever utter for I know that you are sincere to me in all things you say or do, &amp; it would be both unkind &amp; cruel of me to doubt, or not to believe you since you have always been so truthful, &amp; frank.</p> <p>Ma, &amp; I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> letters from Rennie to day she &amp; her husband were well. Rennie write that she loves him more &amp; more every day of her life. says he is such a good husband. I am truly thankful that they are so happy &amp; they can always be so if they will. Ma got a letter from dear pa Tuesday. we are still lonely without him Rennie wants to know when I am coming to stay with her. I don't know indeed when I can go, bless her heart I must go some time before long. Hamie has come in to intrude upon my quiet with his studies for tomorrow. We had a great time at dinner he wanted to make me read Rennie's letter out to him &amp; I wanted him to read it to himself. for awhile I refusedbut at last I read it <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> rest Oh! I do want to see you. I can't wait with any patience for <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> long days to pass away before you can come. it is so long long since you bid me Goodby. I shall be so glad, thankful &amp; happy to have you here again to look at you, &amp; to hear you talk, to see you throw back your dear curly head &amp; shake your foot, but I don't like to see you look grave, &amp; unhappy, for then I think that I have done something to displease you, &amp; that I don't want to do, for I do love to add to your happiness. I never wish to give you one moments pain, or to displease you about any thing. I love you more &amp; more Every day of my life with all my heart, strength, mind &amp; thoughts I <u>lov</u>e <u>you</u> &amp; you only, &amp; Ever shall It seems that I can't find words enough to tell you how dearly I love you.
