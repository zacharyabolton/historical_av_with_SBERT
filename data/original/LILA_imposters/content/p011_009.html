As we were coming down we met 10 or 12 Yanks coming in to town and every day some one or two are brought in the camp the Col. sends them on to the Provost Marshall office to be kept until he has a pretty good crowed and then send them on to Staunton. We are encamped about 2 1/2 or 3 miles from Harrisonburg on the Gamble place about 1/4 of a mile from his house he was up to see us Sunday and asked me over to see him which I will do soon. I asked Cousin Ash what company he should advise me to join. He said hold on a day or two until he could look a round and then he would tell me he is going to make Color sergeant but he has no collars yet so I am going to be his orderly until he gets the flag. he sent Bunch to Staunton Saturday evening. I told him to tell Pa to send me sone smoking tobacco and a pipe. Bill Waddell has some good tobaco put up in bags 2 1/2 pounds each tell Pa to send me one of them. Cousin Asher &amp; Lewis have gone out to see the companys drill and left me in charge of camp and about every 5 minutes some come for a pass to go to town the Col did not give me any orders about it so I refused them all. I don't believe there is any news in camp there are several yankee papers in camp the firs one I get a hold of I will send it up to Ma give my love to all of the girls and tell Sister <i>[unclear: Seal]</i> she must write to me.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your affectionate Brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thos.
