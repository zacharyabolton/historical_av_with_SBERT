My object in requesting the subscription of a dozen citizens for the <u>first</u> year was merely to put the paper in a firm footing; I did not wish it in advance, for there are but few villages where there are not a dozen men to be found, who would not be willing to advertise to the amount of $30 each during the year. But if 500 subscribers, (good) can be obtained, to <i>[unclear: convince]</i> with, the thing would be settled. I never was there, but it strikes me that that is a wealthy section of country, and that a paper could succeed well there. If we succeed in getting the subscribers, I am in hopes we will be able to remunerate you in some way for your kindness in taking such an interest in the enterprize. If you say so, I will send my son-in-law there next Court-day, and get you and your friends to make a strong pull and we will have an office there, and I believe yourcitizens will support it liberally. Of course your Clerks, Lawyers, Merchants &amp;C., would do all they could to keep it up. 500 subscribers to begin with would establish the paper on a firm footing. I have all the material, <u>and all of it paid for</u>. I think a neutral paper would succeed better than a political one, but I am <u>Whig to the core</u>. I presume you will be there at your court day. How near Lovingston does the Railroad run? I mean when it is done, and how far is Lovingston from Charlottesville? When is your court day? </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully your friend,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>A.
