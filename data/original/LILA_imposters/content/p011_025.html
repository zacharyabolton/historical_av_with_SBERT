We are all well at present and hope when these few lines reach you they may find you well. M<sup>r</sup> Lucas got home last night. I reckon Mr Lucas was beggining to get a little uneasy he stayed longer that he expected and did not hear anything about what was keeping him. There hasn't any of us seen him yet but he sent your letter to Aunt Ellen down along with several others. we took the liberty of opening and reading it. We heard yesterday that you had left your camp near Gordonsville and were marching towards Mannassa. I pity you if you have to march this hot weather I think it would nearly kill you This is the hottest weather we have had this summer it makes a person nearly melt; M<sup>r</sup> Robert M<sup>c</sup> bride died on Saturday of Typhoid fever. and was buried yesterday. M<sup>r</sup> Junkin preached up at the Lutheran church yesterday evening which made the third sermon for him that day M<sup>r</sup> John L Beard was here one day last week he appeared to be very uneasy about Billie. we told him the University Hospital ahad burn up. he wanted to know when we would be writing to you so as to request you to give any information concerning him that is if you knew any thing about him. But he got a letter Saturday from him and is sending him an answer to-day directed to Loringston Nelson Co I think he is anxious to keep up with D<sup>r</sup> White. He was talking about them having Billies name down as a deserter. He says D<sup>r</sup> White &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Smith drew up that detail and General Jackson signed it so it is all right he thinks. Pa has got all his grass cut he cut that and attended the mill. He has right smart grinding to do come <del hand="h1"></del> taking grain in that have not had their grinding done here for a long time., William Wright expects to go down to see about getting a substitute for Henry.
