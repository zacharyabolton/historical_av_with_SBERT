You mentioned to me while I was at Staunton, that there was an appendix published in connection with your report about the raid of John Brown, containing extracts from the personal liberty bills passed by several of the Northern States. You said that it could be procured in Richmond. If you could lay your hands upon and send it to me at this place you would greatly oblige me. I have some curiousity to see those extracts, although I place implicit confidence in the conistny of your report. When I last saw you, I expected to have been in Richmond ere this, but were if I were there, I would not know very well how I could hunt up that same appendix.</p> <p>Please excuse the liberty that I have taken in making this request. I congratulate you on the prospect of your being speedily released from your labors as a member of the convention[.] the post of honor I believe to be now a private station, otherwise I could wish to see your talents &amp; your fidelity employed in the service of your country. I hope you will enjoy yourself in the Society of your family &amp; I will always to myself the honor of calling on you, when I am in Staunton. I take a lively interest in the welfare of your children. Remember me to them when you see them. With sentiments of respect &amp; affection.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John L.
