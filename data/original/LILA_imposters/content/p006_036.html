I wrote you a long letter whiles on the "Shanandoah Hights" one Sabath &amp; sent the same by Dr. McChesney, which should have reached you by the time <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> McKanny arrived at home, but I suppose you never received it. As you only spoke of receiving a note. I have nothing of interest to write you now. Things are going on about as they were when I last wrote you. I have seen some nice ladies this week. In the evening when we go on Dress parade they begin to come in from the country &amp; assemble on the <u>parade</u> <u>ground</u> untill it's a very difficult matter to get though the crowdin consequence of their "<u>extension shirts</u>". Yesterday I had the exquisite pleasure of becoming acquainted with a beautiful little girl, but she was <i>[unclear: summoned]</i> so with <u>soldiers</u> that I had no chance of cultivating it to any extent.</p> <p>I have had so little to say to the ladies since I left that I hardly know what way to conduct myself in their presence not being a lady's man. &amp; this you know.</p> <p> I got a letter from your dear Cousin Anne B - which I estimate very highly indeed from the fact, that she is the <u>only</u> lady (<u>except</u> <u>your</u> <u>self</u>) who has thought enough of one to write. I also received a nice rosette from her that I will endeavor to keep as long I possibly can as a token of her respect for me.</p> <p>You wished to know the state of my health in your last? well I am in good health. never engaged better in my life. I think that the <u>camp life</u> will agree with me firstrate if I can only get plenty of <i>[unclear: provender. ]</i></p> <p>You need have no fear of my coming to the conclusion you spoke of in your last from the fact that I am no longer held (by you) with the same esteem that I have reason to believe I once was. This is my humble opinion, which I drew from the winding up of your last. I had no idea of ever hearing that thrown up to me again. I think you ought to let "by gones" be "by gones". And not harbor the idea any longer. I am very much obligated to you, for any thing you have done in endeavoring to make my stay here comfortable &amp; agreeable. And I sincerely hope that your pathway through this life may be strewn with flowers, &amp; that you may have a peaceful entrance at last into heaven above.</p> <p>I must bring this uninteresting note to a close. hoping to hear from you soon.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I subscribe myself your <u>true friend</u> and well wisher,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>Tony Pastor</u></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.
