Ada ironing Lola churning. Hattie &amp; Lula entertaining their company on the green sward. I have just left the spining wheel for the more pleasant duty of answering your welcome letter of Tuesday. I was so glad to hear from you that you were well. God is truly good &amp; merciful to us sinful creatures. I have not finished my spining yet. will try hard to get through by Saturday if I live. I was rejoiced to hear that you are coming down Sunday I can scarcely wait until then it seems so long since you werehere. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a letter from Rennie to day she &amp; David are coming up Sunday you will get to see them. she told me to say to you that "she was still true to her cousin Davie" sends love to you. The good people of Mt. Solon are busy now making peach &amp; apple butter. I am invited to an "apple butter boiling" tomorrow night at Mrs. Cupp's. I am going to send <u>ma</u> in my place. I think she would enjoy herself vastly well just as much as I should were I to go. I have made no visits since my return home the report is floating now that I have come home to make preparations for my marriage with you. That Rennie &amp; I are to be married at the same time. Dame Rumor has it all very nicely arranged. Sam Ferror's sisters want me to come&amp; stay a few weeks with them. Sam will come up for me when I conclude to go. I did not promise as I expected to return to Staunton before I go any where else. I look at your photographs often they are so much like you. I don't know how I could content my self without them since I cannot see the dear original. I wish you had a good one of me when I go back to Staunton you shall have one. When you come down Sunday I'm going to give you some pies to eat of my own <u>making</u> you said I could not make pies Lula is a dear good child she kneels at my feet every night &amp; says her childish prayer "Now I lay me down to sleep" then asks me if the angels will watch while she sleeps after the "goodnight kiss" she is put in her soft white bed at 8 O'clock but not to close the blueeyes until I tell her a "<i>[unclear: Rat]</i> Tale" as usual. We have not heard from pa since he left look for a letter tomorrow. I wish I could see you this evening it would give me more pleasure than any thing if I could hear your footsteps in the hall. I must be contented as it is for that can't be to day or for two more days. If I'm not on the porch Sunday to meet you just know that I am in the kitchen. but I want to be on the porch &amp; will if I live be there The ladies of Mt. Solon are going to have a grand "Picknick" the 25th of this month. Ada is one of the <i>[unclear: lady's]</i> committee I have nothing to do with it so far. Be sure &amp; come Sunday I am so anxious to see you. Ma send love to you. Did you send me the Ledger last week? if so I did not get it. Take care of yourself I send a kiss &amp; love to you come come Sunday will soon be here I'm so glad May God bless &amp; protect you is the prayer of one who loves you. Goodnight.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mollie Sibert</p></div> <!---->
