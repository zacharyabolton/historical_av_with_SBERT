Major <i>[unclear: Corly]</i> the quarter Master for the north west being stationed off your line at Hardy <i>[unclear: V]</i> the business in that Department from some cause is badly arranged on the Monterey line,for instance I have sent out thousands of bags with grain &amp; c &amp; not one has ever been returned for supplies. I have again been compelled to commence the impressments of wagons &amp; pledge the farmers that their teams shall only be kept one trip.</p> <p>My object in writing to you direct, is to ask the favor of you to direct the return of all the bags &amp; also all the wagons &amp; teams that can be spared. I will return them immediately with corn &amp; oats for the horses, which you so much need. Col. J. B. Baldwin also wishes grain &amp; c. sent to the Petersburg Line.

I am very sorry General to trouble your with these matters, but I am unable to manage the transportation without your assistance. I sent out yesterday 25 wagons &amp; today 26 wagons loaded with corn and company (or commissary) supplies.</p></div>
