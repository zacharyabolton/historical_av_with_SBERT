W. of Middletown but our artillery forced them to retire -- Rosser also drove them on the left We halted near Midelletown &amp; reformed our lines preparatory to another advance but so many of our troops had left the ranks to plunder the Yankee camps that it was a long time before it could be done -- in the mean time by the aid of their numerous cavalry the enemy rallied their fugitives, except the 1300 we had captured, &amp; formed a body of them, of no great size, that moved up &amp; attacked our left which was siezed with a sudden, unexpected &amp; unneccessary panic &amp; gave way &amp; the whole line did the same thing, but our artillery &amp; some infantry held them back &amp; we retired over Cedar Creek more like a mob than an army, still the enemy did not gain any great advantage or take many prisoners &amp; our trains and artillery were all over &amp; moving off &amp; it seemed that the substantial <u>result</u> would be ours, when a small body of Yankee Cavalry dashed upon our train by a <u>by</u> road &amp; by killing horses &amp; overturning wagons, amulances &amp; artillery threw all into confusion &amp; as it was night no one could tell what to do so the train &amp; artillery was captured -- at least left &amp; the Yankees got it, not by force of arms but because our army had become disorganized -- we lost 30 pieces &amp; about 100 wagons &amp; ambulances, but brought off our prisoners &amp; much that we had captured -- the enemy's loss in killed was very hevy, they fairly lay in heaps -- they have lost not less than 6000 in killed wounded &amp; prisoners -- our loss in men is small &amp; our army is again together &amp; organized &amp; ready for a fight -- I do not think the enemy will follow us -- the cavalry came slowly after us &amp; halted when we did we are now here in camp. A more splendidly conceived &amp; executed movement I never saw &amp; if our men had behaved the reverse could not have happened -- I got a letter from Nelson yesterday, Harriet has had Typhoid fever for 6 weeks &amp; was very low -- she is now getting better -- they have had much sickness but are getting better I have written to Allie &amp; Ed. Palmer -- asked him to aid the Stout <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> who are in prison at Elmira -- Mr. Robinson wishes you to keep his clothes for him -- Excuse my hasty note -- I want it to go today -- Love &amp; blessings for you all -- write soon </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours <u>as ever</u></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
