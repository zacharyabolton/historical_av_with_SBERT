I have gotten nearly well of my cold. I was very much surprised to hear of Miss Tassie Houston's death, as I had not heard of her sickness. Becca had a letter from home this morning, which said they were all better but Miss Jane. It certainly must be a dreadful kind of fever. Miss Bettie Loyle, Miss Agnes' neice died about two weeks ago. Grandma &amp; Miss Agnes were very much distressed about it. Mattie Tate came here yesterday as a boarder. M<ins>r</ins><del hand="h1">iss</del> Haddell is going to Richmond to enter into business. I think she feels right sorry. We have had a new boarder since you were here. Miss M<sup>c</sup>Garrek, from Pulaski. Becca wrote to her cousin M<sup> <sup>rs</sup> </sup> Dunlap to send for her Friday evening. Miss Mary told her she had better write. Her father was down to see her <abbr expan="Saturday">Sat</abbr>. I tell you she was glad. We all went to the Episcopal church last Sunday night. M<i>[unclear: r. Jenkin]</i> will preach on Friday night &amp; Saturday. We walked out to <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Byers last Saturday morning met M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> Leckey there. Mary Dudley stayed all day. <i>[unclear: Suslie]</i> Stephenson &amp; I wouldn't stay but we had mighty work to get off from Mattie. I believe M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> M<sup>c</sup>Gauly is to be one of M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> East's waiters. wonder who he will wait with. It sounds funny to say were going home week after next. it seems like Christmas oughtn't to be here yet. I reckon its because we haven't had any cold weather. Think Ean Fulton did have a rainy day sure enough for wedding. why in the world didn't they both get married the same day. just two troubles &amp; expenses. Tell <i>[unclear: Niza]</i> she musn't laugh when she gets married. I wish I could go to some of their weddings. did you have much fun at Eme's wedding. How is cousin Nancy Berry now? where will John &amp; <i>[unclear: Niza]</i> live? &amp;c. What did the <u> <i>[unclear: thing]</i> </u> look like that day? &amp; how did the <u> <i>[unclear: Jucen]</i> </u> enjoy herself? I dont think the glove pattern is at home. I know I loaned it to Bettie Echard. &amp; I dont think I could tell you how to trim the dress...I have seen some trimmed <del hand="h1">across the</del> with three rows of velvet across the breast. then turned &amp; go up to the seam on the shoulders. I dont know where I could get a pattern for the tails. perhaps M<sup> <sup>rs</sup> </sup> Turk has the pattern like Lucy's, if you like them you can make them that way. I have not thanked D<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> Spragins for my present yet. Miss Howard has given up having Geometry examination before Christmas as we would have too much to<del hand="h1">o</del> think of at once. We will have our examination on Heaven Tuesday before the Cantanta. I don't think braided bodies will do wear then, will send my white body home and have it done up before that time. I reckon that will do. I expect you will be right busy until after the wedding. I want to send this down to the office now so it will go up tomorrow. I will look for you <abbr expan="Saturday">Sat.</abbr> a little, bet you wont come through.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Sister</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>L R Smiley</p></div> <!---->
