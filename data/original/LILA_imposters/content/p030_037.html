So I thought I would write down to you to see if you know such a one as I want or could find me one without giving yourself very much extra care. Any girl of ordinary intelligence of good habits and not less than seventeen will do although if I could get one who has been brought up as nurse I should like it. She should be a good strong girl and knowledge of washing and ironing will not injure her in my eyes or those of my wife. Please answer me as soon as you can. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours Very Truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.E.
