Capt Patrick seemed glad to see me he said he intended writing to Pa but had been very busy. I was about leaving for Shepherdstown when we got orders to get ready to leave at once but after we were told to march at 8 oclock tomorrow morning. I expect we will go to Shepherdstown. Everyone is talking about the way they were treated at Shepherdstown &amp; are anxious to go there again they were so well treated. I will have no difficulty in getting along. I went down to see Eddie Waddell. He was glad to see me &amp; said he wished he was in our company. Saw also Lipscomb. Both are looking well. Camp life seems to agree with them. I left Clinton at Stroudsburgh &amp; gave him money to pay his way home. I wish he could have come to the Ferry. There is about 11000 men here now. You can see tents &amp; soldiers all over the place. We are in camp in a large brick house in the upper part of Bolivar. It is only a few hundred yards to Capt Baylors company. There is a regiment of 1100 men just left here for Shepherdstown or Martinsburg. I will write you from where I am to go. I think to Shepheredstown I will go &amp; see the folks. Tell Pa I will write to him next &amp; will write to you all the first chance I have. The Capt myself &amp; the officers all sleep in the same room. I will sleep with Irvine. I am very well pleased with camp life. Give my love to all. Excuse this short &amp; badly written letter as I am very busy fixing things. I am very glad you put so many little articles in my trunk. Write soon. I got Charley letter with no trouble and a piece of the Dispatch. I will read it and take good care of myself. You need have no fears of me keeping bad company or anything of that kind.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>From your affectionate son</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W B Gallaher</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Kiss the little folks for me. My horse stood the travel very well. I had her put on the cart at Winchester &amp; brought down. It did not cost me much. Give my respect to all. Write soon.<br> Your son<br>William <br> Tell Pa to keep a sharp look out in the farm yard &amp; at the stable. I have never seen anything wrong but if they are so inclined they have a very good chance. The reason Guy wrote to me to come he could not enlist as a substitute unless he would enlist for 12 months &amp; he said he did not want me to lose my place. He is going home Monday &amp; will be back in a week &amp; join our company or get an appointment as he is trying very hard to get the adjutants place in the Regiment. I will get Capt Patrick to sign the certificate for my horse &amp; send to you next week.<br> <br>Your son<br>William <br> Love to all. Tell Mr. Evans to make me a pair shoes like the ones he made me &amp; send down with Ed Waddells. They are too narrow at the toes. I can get along with the boots.</p></div>
