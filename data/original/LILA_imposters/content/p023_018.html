I would have replied sooner but for the fact, that having sent your letter out to David soon after I received <ins>it</ins>, I was under the impression until yesterday that he had answered it. I was delighted to hear from you once more; and truly thankful to hear that you were all living and in your usual health. My little family are all in their usual health also. <abbr expan="Emily(?)">Em.</abbr> and my two little girls returned from Wheeling, about ten days since, whither they had been on a visit since the last week in October. I took them out, and on my return home I met with a merchant from Chattanooga, who was on his way home from New York, whither he had been to purchase goods. I thought it a good opportunity to communicate with you, as it was then very difficult to send a letter directly through to Summerville. (Indeed I do not know that it is much less difficult yet.) I accordingly wrote you on board the cars and gave the letter to him to mail in Chattanooga which he promised to do. That was written on the 2<sup> <sup>nd</sup> </sup> of November but I have never heard whether you ever received it.</p> <p><abbr expan="February">Feb.</abbr> 3<sup>rd</sup> You will observe more than a week has elapsed since I wrote the foregoing. The reason of the delay in finishing my letter is this. I did not have time to finish it on the day I commenced it, and I concluded the next day that I would wait until there might be a decided change, one way or the other, in David's condition, who was then quite ill. He has been very much better now for three or four days past, and, I think, with care will be well in a short time. He has had an attack of inflammatory rheumatism, but not near so severe an attack as he has had. But his nervous system seemed to become very much deranged, and he was in a state of delirium, most of the time, for three or four days. He has been sick about one month: suffered a good <i>[unclear: eal]</i> with rheumatism in his arms, hands and legs, the first two weeks; but has been in a measure clear of pains for the last ten days. He has no negro men employed now: he has, however, two white men and boy about seventeen years old. Ann &amp; Mary are still there, but I learn indirectly that they contemplate leaving in the spring. Ben still remains with me and also my woman, and are both doing well. Henry left David soon after the surrender, and is now living with William Guthrie. The negroes are very trifling, as a general thing; and none of them are willing to contract by the year, and a majority of them do not seem to be willing to contract at all for any length of time. Business of all kinds is very flat now, and there seems to be no money in the country. It is almost impossible now to collect a few Dollars from the best men in our community. And what is more the tax collector is here now gathering in the Land Tax. I very much fear many of our farmers will forfeit their land from their inability to pay the Tax. The Tax here is 27 cents on the 100 Dollars on the assessment of 1860. And if the Tax is not paid in a <i>[unclear: certain]</i> time the government will sell the land and appropriate all the money arising from the sale. Aint the Yankees the most fiendish nation on the face of the earth? We have just got in money sufficient ($42.50) to pay the Tax on Father's Estate. Write me and let me know whether you will be able to pay the Taxes on your land. If not, and the thing is possible, we must <i>[unclear: assist]</i> you in order to save your land. <abbr expan="Emily(?)">Em</abbr> and the children send much love to you and your children. How much we all would be to see you and them. Write so soon as you receive this and find me all the news. And now I must close May a kind providence protect you and yours</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I <i>[unclear: am as ever]</i> your affectionate brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>A.
