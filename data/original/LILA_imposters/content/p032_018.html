The Trustees of the <abbr expan="Methodist Episcopal">M.E.</abbr> Church have now given consent to use of basement for school purposes if <abbr expan="Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands">BRF&amp;AL</abbr> will expend $100 in school fixtures in lieu of rent for the season and in my <abbr expan="September">Sept.</abbr> report I respectfully urge such appropriation be made and now I ask your assistance in securing this and teachers. If <u>but one</u> can be sent by all means send a gentleman. We want a teacher who can go out among the poor and "make them come in".</p> <p>Mr. Brackett when here was much in doubt whether his principals could spare teachers here, but the field is too large the in- terest of too many at stake to let the door of the school house be closed at Staunton. The room will answer at once for school purposes if you can send a teacher <u>now</u> and his suggestions would be useful in making the $100 provide the most needed articles.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Your obedient servant">Yr obt servt</abbr></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>Thos P.
