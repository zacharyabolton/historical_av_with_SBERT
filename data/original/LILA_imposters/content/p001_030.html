I am sorry your health is not improving more. My health is very good. I have improved very much since I came here. I have had the dysentery, &amp; the cold since I came but I think the dysentery was a benefit to me. You said you would like to send me something good to eat, well I would like to have something god. Some little "one makes" I mean. I get plenty of meat and bread &amp; coffee but I am getting tired of it all the time. I have'nt eat off a table or slept in a bed for a month.</p> <p>If I was to sit down to a table well filled with good things now, I expect I would kill myself eating, no doubt at any rate, but that I would pitch into every thing with my fingers, for I have hardly eaten with a knife &amp; fork since I left home.</p> <p>There are 8 in my mess, &amp; we have but one fork, &amp; you know the foremost man always gets it.</p> <p>John Berry left for home the other day, he went off &amp; did'nt tell a man in the company good bye. We have several late recruits Ress Kerr, Wm. Wiseman, Henry Wiseman, Fred Alinger, John Montgomery &amp; Mordecai Smith. Adkins that used to live in Middlebrook is here with the Mississippi troops. But I must stop this time. I will write more next time. Write soon. Kiss all the children.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am as ever your affectionate brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.
