I was thankful to hear of your safe arrival home You could not have been more grieved to leave me than I was to give you up. It seemed that I could not let you go I cried a long time after you left my home looked forsaken &amp; desolate, &amp; so it was to me You Ella, Magnus, &amp; our two <i>[unclear: Sunbeams]</i> Lula, &amp; Macon all gone Oh! I felt that I could not stay. I hope it will not always be thus. I am so glad you sent me back the photograph you took from my Album because I did want to keep it so much. I was not angry with you fortaking it from me. I thought you would rather I did not have it, &amp; I knew you knew best that you did not think it a very good one but I do. I will not put it in my Album again as you don't want me. I thank you Oh! so truly for sending the Ledgers. I was both surprised &amp; pleased to see them for I thought after what you said last Sabbath you would not send them to me again. I only blamed myself for saying what I did to you. <abbr expan="Although">alltho'</abbr> I was teasing you only to see what you would say I did not blame you. How my heart longs for your presence to day. I feel that I can't wait until I see you again. each visit you pay me only increases my desire to haveyou always near me I am happy &amp; contented when with you, lonely &amp; sad when we are parted. Oh! how truly my heart Loves, trusts, &amp; looks to you for happiness. I am so glad to hear you love to come to my home, for I know now that you enjoy your visits &amp; in the future I shall try more earnestly to make my home pleasant &amp; attractive to you. I will not leave you so often alone to attend to any domestic affairs, but will stay near you only &amp; with you, for I do love you more than all in the world. Yes I have a very dear &amp; happy home but this bright &amp; loved circle has been so broken of late years by Ella's marriage my precious &amp; noble brother's sad &amp; early death, &amp; pa's absence that I can scarcely realize it to be my once cherished happy home.God has been merciful in sparing from the grave many to make home still sweet to me but not as in days gone forever, &amp; "Memory oft will heave a sigh" for buried home joys. The circle will never be again united link after link will be taken by marriage &amp; death until my dear lonely father &amp; mother will have no bright &amp; smiling face to look upon or make joyous their fading years. This picture is too sad I must brighten it by saying we will all, if we Can, go to see them often &amp; fill their hearts &amp; home with happy voices, sunny smiles, &amp; social talk. then The old home will ring with gladness. I can see Ma &amp; pa now in imagination on an occasion like I have just pictured, smiling &amp; happy, feeling young again with their dear daughters &amp; their husbands who have all come at <u>once</u> to cheer up the lone but loving hearts which have been forsaken by their children for other loves &amp; homes daughters who left them lone &amp; sad to make sweet &amp; happy the hearts &amp; homes of their chosen husbands as they once made I send love &amp; a kiss to you. Come down soon I forgot to tell you Mr. John <i>[unclear: Firns]</i> sent me a basket of peaches Monday Ma sends love</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
