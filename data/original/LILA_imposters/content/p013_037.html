One request I will ask of you that is to forgive &amp; forget, I intended writing before I left camp. But after I had a chance for a furlough I thought I would wait untill I got home &amp; then I might come down, But alas it seems that I can never get away from home, I have had very bad health ever since I came home. Some days I suffer with chills &amp; fevers with violent headeache &amp; pains in my limbs. Father is very ill with the mumps, though I think he is getting better, It will be my time to have them next, as I never had them, I have had chances to have taken them before, Proberably I may miss them this time, I wount care if I ware so fortunate. Well I reckon you think, "What have I been doing towards enjoying myself" since I came home, The blues have been my most constant companion I declair I never was as lonesome in my life Time seems to stand still on her wheels, Tom is busy blowing so if I wanted to go anywhare I have no horse to wride. I formed a slight acquaintance with your friend Fannie Seems to be a very nice girl, Kind I think would make a noble coquet, But you must not tell her that I ever thought such a thing, well you know that it is natural for self willed man to form an opinion of the fairer sext on first sight. Well I do not know what to write to interrest you I promist to answer the questions that I asked in my last letter in reference to your Cousin Lizzie, But I will wait hoping that I may see you before long. Then I can answer you verbaly, I know that I can sadisfy you in that way better than by writing I suppose you have already form some idea of my reason for asking you. I hope that I may soon get my health &amp; be able to help work some on the farm as we will be late with the spring crop I suppose you ware surprised to hear of me coming home as you wrote that I wount come home for six months, <del hand="h1">Thare</del> if I could get a furlough. Tharefore dont suppose you are very ancious to see me, But for my part I never was as ancious to see you in my life Though you may think my actions do not prove it, Well you must recolect my health &amp; more I have no way of getting about, Dispair not I will be down ear long, And then my long absence will make it a hapier meeting, Often you are by my side in my nightly dreams them it seemes that I am happy, But I wake up &amp; find it all delusion I must bring this uninterresing letter to a close I hope this may find you enjoying your usual good health if I have written anything in this letter to mar your feeling your parden I crave</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>From your attached friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Willie</p></div> <!---->
