Well, Kate I scarcely know what to communicate first; as I am aware you hear <u>directly</u> from the neighborhood <del hand="h1">that</del> so frequently that you receive the news almost as early as myself; suppose from what I have learned that your fruition has been dazzling in the zenith of its magnificence during your visit up to the present time; &amp; presume it will not cease to continue as long as parties, are the fashion &amp; Valley Rangers, with plenty of "Tobacco" are the Chorus in your "<u>Town</u>"; <u>Oh</u>! I have a great desire to hear from you. There has no material cha<ins>n</ins>ge occurred within the limits of our vicinity since you left us, we still experience the alternations of joys &amp; greifs which we have been accustomed to almost daily since the war commenced; we, in accordance with the dictates of the Sacred writings rejoice in time of victory &amp; grieve when conquered. Suppose you <ins>have</ins> heard the particulars attending our friend John Lightner's sickness &amp; death; he died wishing us all to meet him in heaven, which should be our unwearied endeavor &amp; consequently our final end. You had my heart-felt sympathy upon hearing the melancholy news; but this Providence like theirs should be weighed with the balance of humiliation, as the loss of one is the gain of another.</p> <p>Fast Day was generally observed in the neighborhood, preaching at St. Johns &amp; Bethel but none in Greenville or at Calvary. I met with your sister Lizzie, &amp; Jacob at St. Js. that day, we all thought Mr Crawford did admirably on the occasion; but I believe some had the presumption to say it was nothing but a perfect abolition sermon; so much for diversity of opinion. Captain Newton came home yesterday, suppose he has reenlisted, your brother John has recovered from the mumps I believe. From what I can learn the defeats which our forces were compelled to experience have not discouraged our men; as the spirit of reenlisting is <ins>still</ins> prevailing to a great extent. Well Kate, as my last page is generally appropriated to messages of others which are sometimes prerequisite to a conclusion, I <del hand="h1">will</del> now give place. Sister Lizzie with Miss Evaline are spending the day with us; Miss Evaline sends her love, &amp; says take great care of <u>Moses in the bulrushes</u>; sister Sue says to captivate <u>him</u> thoroughly bring <u>him</u> up with you, &amp; make a great big wedding for she is almost sick to be at <ins>a</ins> wedding; just such a one as you &amp; <ins>Moses</ins> the brother to Jesse would make. Sister Mary sends love &amp; wishes you much success in the <u>beau-line</u> she says tell you that she is afraid the South will be subjugated since- "The man who did his country save, Lies cold and silent in his grave."</p> <p>Mother says tell you Rockingham is the place "for the right sort" so dive down, make a sure grab, &amp; bring up by the locks a most precious Pearl one of dazzling splendor &amp; none to equal.</p> <p>Sue &amp; <i>[unclear: Mag]</i> join me in love. Please excuse all imperfections &amp; honor me with <u>a response very soon if you please</u>.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>From yours <abbr expan="affectionately">aff</abbr>,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Maggie E.
