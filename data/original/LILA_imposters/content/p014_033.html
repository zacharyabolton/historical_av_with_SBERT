Va., which, I hope came to hand. Communication with home either way now has become tedious and I suppose uncertain. You will continue to address us as before, <u>Winchester</u>, Va., this will probably be our direction for some time. Wednesday morning last, 24th.Inst, we broke camp near Berryville and marched 20 odd miles. The start was made was at 3 o'clock A.M.; uncommonly early. Our march lay by Smithfield in Jefferson, after leaving Clarke, via Summit Point, and terminates at Darksville, 7 miles short of Martinsburg. Early Thursday morning Charles and myself started before the troops and went to Martinsburg where we breakfasted, with Gen. Pendleton and other officers, at Mr. Conrad's. We received a most hearty welcome from Mr. &amp; Mrs. G. and the young ladies, all of whom seem in high spirits at seeing us back again and at the prospect of an invasion of the enemy's country; which will we hope guaranty them immunity for a longer time than usual from their hated presence. Miss Jane, Mr. Conrad's eldest daughter unmarried, has been very unwell lately and though much better now appears still far from well. Mr. &amp; Mrs. C. &amp; Miss Nannie appear in the best spirits and full of enthusiasm for the cause. They are all pretty warm against Maryland, who, they say, has been trimming in such a way as to escape the hardships of war from either party, at the expense of her honour. They think the State very questionably on our side; I think her undeniably in sympathy with us, but completely cowed by the Yankees.</p> <p>In the fight the other day before Martinsburg, (wherein the enemy behave with unusual pusillanimity, I understand) they threw some shell into the town. One lit in the street before Mr. Conrad's house and another burst in the garden, tearing off a raspberry bush close to the ground and damaging another. No further harm was done. The family took shelter in the cellar during the danger; which did not last long. I do not understand that this shelling was intentional, on the enemy's part. It could scarcely have been, as the town was then in the Yankees' hands. </p> <p>The Provost Marshals of Martinsburg and Berryville, respectively Colonels Smith &amp; McReynold, have left behind them an enviable name for moderation; justice and gentlemanly deportment: so far as any one could exercise either who was under the command of that infamous brute, Milroy. McReynold was an Episcopalean and to this the people in Berryville attribute the fact that the Episcopal church in that village not appropriated or defaced by the Yankees. </p> <p>In Martinsburg I saw nearly all of my old friends who received me with much cordiality and their usual hospitality. They are certainly unsurpassed in their self- sacrificing devotion to our cause, and the family to whom I refer deserve to be kindly remembered by every friend of the South, and advocates of its uncompromising support. I spent the day until 4 o'clock in Martinsburg, and then rode on to our Hd.Qrs., fixed for the night in Md. 1 or 2 miles from Williamsport, and about 14 from Martinsburg. For <u>nine</u> miles after leaving the latter place I rode by an almost continuous train of troops and wagons -- chiefly of Longstreet's Corps. -- </p> <p>Wednesday and most Thursday was cloudy, but dry: excellent weather for marching. Thursday afternoon however it began to rain and during almost the wole of Friday it thus continued. Early Friday morning we started from our Hd.Qrs. on toward Hagerstown. Five miles after leaving our camp we reached Hagerstown, where we found A.P. Hill's Corps encamped and just starting out as we got to the edge of town. This delayed the passage through of Longstreet's advance division for five or six hours. It seems that this <u>contretemps</u> was unexpected by Gen. Lee and very distasteful to him: such at least in the report. In Hagerstown I met wih a very pleasant bevy of Southern sympathizers, including 4 or 5 of the prettiest girls in the place. At one house I was hospitably entertained both at breakfast &amp; dinner and had various other kindnesses extended to me. These good people I shall always remember with especial gratitude. I would fain mention their names, and those of other nice people I met, thinking you might know of some of them, but the remote chance of this letter's falling into the hands of the enemy prevents me from doing so. I cannot run even the smallest risk of criminating them with the Yankees, whose well known valour in oppressing and tormenting women and other obnoxious <u>non</u>-combatants, I can never be unmindful of. For the beginning of my acquaintance in Hagerstown I am indebted to Major Green of Gen. Kemper's staff (Miss Mary Green's uncle) Subsequently I multiplied my acquaintance. I met one very pretty girl who had recently been staying with the Ross' in Frederick city. They, it seems, remembered me kindly and recommended me to her favour, if I should happen to fall in with her during the campaign. When I was introduced she asked me if my name was not Launcelot &amp; then told me of this. I also met with a very pleasant family, accidentally, when Eugene had taken tea last Sunday evening, and apparently commended himself to their liking. I did not leave the town until about 4 P.M., spending most of the time standing about corners and porches, chatting with ladies while the troops were passing. Though it rained almost continually the ladies stood thus for hours, bestowing welcome &amp; encouragement on our veterans, as, drenched wiht rain though they were, they marched with firm elastic step and true soldierly bearing along the streets, all the time in good spirits, and whenever they passed the ladies, shouting lustily at their presence and encouragement. I pointed out to two very pretty girls with whom I was standing, with much pride, the 11th. Va. Inf, -Co.G. in particular - as the former commands of the hero who fell at Boonesboro, my noble townsman Gen. Garland. I see Pickett's Division on the march constantly, and really of the many fine regiments it contains, none strikes my eye for general bearing and physique as does that commanded by Maj. Obery. The excitement became greatest, and the smiles, nods, waving of handkerchiefs, etc. most striking when, toward noon Gen's. Lee &amp; Longstreet, followed by their respective staffs and Corps of Couriers, rode gracefully by -- in twos. The two Chiefs both courteously rode uncovered a few seconds, in acknowledgement of the welcome, but did not stop. The beautiful majesty of Lee's whole person, and the lion-like serenity of Longstreet, seemed to produce a profound impression. It was hard to determine which enjoyed this view of the commander-in-chief-most, the Hagerstown ladies who saw for the first time the renowned general, or the officers and others of his command who stood near and witnessed with undisguised pride and satisfaction the sensation his passage produced. After dinner I rode on with Major Walton, of Gen. Longstreet's Staff, to our Hd.Qrs., fixed that night 8 or 10 miles beyond Hagerstown, Md., and about one short on Greencastle, Pa. From Hagerstown to the Penn'a. line a very fine turnpike extends all the way. At the line it abruptly terminates &amp; the way continues in an inferior road, not less broad however than the turnpike. A wretched little village called Middletown, is situated immediately across Mason's &amp; Dixon's line, giving but a poor idea of boasted Yankee civilization. </p> <p>Nothing of interest struck my notice during the march from Hagerstown to camp near Greencastle. Md. &amp; Pa. looked pretty much alike that far. Saturday morning - (yesterday) we resumed our march and advanced via Greencastle and Chambersburg, about 15 miles to this point, where we laid over to day. In the village of Greencastle the people swarmed about doors and windows and sullenly gazed on our troops passing by. Several women wore the U. S. flag on their bosoms, where it was seen by our men. Such natural and innocent indications of loyalty to their government, our soldiers would of course <u>scorn</u> to object to. It would be a matter of indifference to me if every woman in Pa. had one on her person, and every house one floating from its roof. Another indication of the reasonableness of our men is seen in the fact that last Sunday in Hagerstown the Rector of the Episcopal Church (a Yankee) with commendable independence said the usual prayer for the President of the U. S., though the house was full of C. S. soldiers. The only notice taken of it; one who was present tells me, was one officer leaving the Church. I learn that the same course was followed in Hagestown last fall. Last Sunday Gen. Ewell &amp; other officers of rank attended the Roman Catholic Church by invitation of the priest. I think I should have done likewise, without an invitation, had I been there, though like Gen. Ewell, and Episcopalian. I do not think I could stand the ministrations of St. Paul himself, if a Black Repub'n. </p> <p>Yesterday was a fine day for marching. Nor rain, but cloudy and cool for the season. We made Chambersburg by noon, it was only 12 miles distant. The country passed through is interesting enough. It is fertile and highly cultivated, and more like our Valley than anything else. It is 2 or 3 times as thickly settled however; the fields are much smaller, the houses more frequent &amp; handsomer; (generally of stone or brick) and the barne bigger and more complete than any I have ever seen. Many are of stone and brick, and have glass window sashes. An indifferent building of this sort is hard to find, and the average of the most inferior is better than that of the best in Eastern Virginia. One I saw, on the premises of a Mr., or Judge McClure, this side of Chambersburg, which was not only of very large size, but really elegant: painted snow-white, with ornamented eaves, pendants. The house and whole property of this individual however are beautiful and complete beyond description. I spent some hours in Chambersburg, which is a pretty town of 5600 inhabitants. The stores were all closed when we entered the place, but many of them were opened by threats of violent entrance by armed force if it was not done quickly. When opened, guards in most instances--not all--were posted at the door and but a limited number allowed to enter at a time. When we did get in we bought what few things we could find that we wanted with C. S. money. Their prices varied in an advance of from 10 to 50 per cent on old figures, but at this no one complained. At some of the stores the soldiers got in, and not being restrained by a guard, took a good many things without pay. There was, in short a good deal of lawlessness, but not as much as might have been expected under the circumstances. I did not know of more than 6 or 8 stores in all being opened. I secured some needed things, for our <u>messmenage</u>, and for myself a handsome black felt hat, and material for military shirts. To send home I could only get a few dozen spools sewing cotton, superior quality, No's. 16,40, &amp; 24. and some buttons. These are for home and Sister Sue. The stock of dry goods I got at was very meagre. Shoes, gloves, pins, etc. unattainable. I shall keep the interests of the "home department" constantly before me, however. Our whole party re-hatted themselves. We have held court to-day, though Sunday, and I have been very busy: therefore am very tired now. The army is in splendid condition: marches almost wholly without straggling, and is in the highest spirits. Lee is making a bold stroke for peace. Pray that it may succeed. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your affectionate son</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>L.
