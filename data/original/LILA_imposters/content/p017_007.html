Walker gallantly brought in the rest of the old stonewall &amp; drove them out aided by Battles Brigade, the enemy again &amp; again attempted to take the position with a fire of death perfectly terriffic, but all in vain &amp; though we lost many our line stood firm &amp; by God's blessing, the battle was not to the strong alone --. in themean time Gen. Early, in command of 2 divisions of Hill's Corps, flanked the enemy's right &amp; came down on them in Jackson style, carrying 3 lines of the entrenchments &amp; driving them a mile &amp; a half, the fighting kept up until in the night -- I never heard heavier firing &amp; of course we have to mourn the loss of many brave men -- Gen. Lee was in the midst of it cheering on our men. Col. Higginbotham of the 26<u> <u>th</u> </u> Va was killed. In the previous fight <abbr expan="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> Reeves was killed. Yesterday Capt. Turner of our staff was severly wounded in both legs -- Capt.

Mosby has broken the Orange &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R</abbr> -- the enemy now communicates by the Acquia <abbr expan="Creek">Cr</abbr> Rd. Grant fights stubbornly &amp; keeps butting his head against our breastworks &amp; is getting it badly bruised. We have been eminently successful &amp; have abundant cause for thankfulness. I am in good health &amp; getting along very well &amp; hope <u>you</u> are all getting along well.
