Bailey who is a white man was examined by a justice upon a Peace Warrant, and committed for want of Bail, upon an appeal to the Court, his Counsel stated that Bailey was manifestly a Lunatic and there upon a commissioner (under the Chapter 85 Code of <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> 1860) was appointed, who having complied with the law, reported him insane. The Court directed him to be discharged upon the Peace Warrant, but retained in Jail to await the order of the <abbr expan="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr> of the Lunatic Asylum. The sheriff had the papers he sent them to Dr. Stribling of Staunton who reports that there is room for him and the sheriff has made arrangements to take him to Staunton in a few days.</p> <p>He is a poor unfortunate man, is violent, and is firmly impressed with the idea that two men are attemting to take his life - one is said to be dead and the other not in the Commonwealth.</p> <p>It is not rare for insane men to complain of ill treatment. W. P. <i>[unclear: Kidd]</i> is the jailor, Schuler G. Harris and Robt. Johnson are gentlemen in the neighborhood of Fabers Mills where he lived. I do not presume that these gentlemen were aware that he had written to Governor Wells. <i>[unclear: Dissapation]</i> is said to be the cause of his insanity, and if so, it is to be hoped that Dr. Stribling will soon be able to restore him to his right mind.</p> <p>The commission was composed of three intelligent justices, one if not two of them were physicians. You may rely upon it there is no purpose to ill treat but to benefit this unfortunate man.</p> <p>He has no estate and is a mechanic and sympathy not unkindness was manifested to him.</p> <p>As is generally the case he is unwilling to be taken to the Asylum.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient Servant">Obt.
