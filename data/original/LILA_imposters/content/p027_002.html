As it was, he was committed for further examination before the Circuit Court. Propose to call your attention to his case by special communication hereafter.___</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr>, with much Respect<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt.</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Servt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Frederick">Fred<sup>k</sup>.</abbr> S.
