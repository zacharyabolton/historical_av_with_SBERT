There is a great appropriateness in the name, from the well known character of Mr. Lincoln, and from the love the colored pople bear him.</p> <p>Please see to it, that officers or Agents of this Bureau, who may be intemperate men, be immediately reported to this office.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obed</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Svt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>(signed) O.
