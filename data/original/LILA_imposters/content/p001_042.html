Lowe will give (3/4 %) is considerably lower than our rates, at least so far as his shop is concerned. As to his dwelling house we think that at least 1/4% too low, but if that is the rate charged by other Company's we would take it. The shop is lower by 1 1/4% than any risk of the kind of which we have any knowledge, -- 2% is as low <i>[unclear: as any]</i> risk <ins>of</ins> this character is taken by us, but even at that rate, the building <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> fire proof, other wise the risk is worth according to circumstances from 2 1/2 to 5%, by most <abbr expan="companies">Co's</abbr> such risks will not be taken, indeed they are desirable with none. From the above you can gather the views of our <abbr expan="Company">Co</abbr> as to Mr Lowes risk, which I need scarcely add is at the rates proposed respectfully declined. Your remarks about Mr Imbodens risk has been under consideration, and although 1 1/2 % is as low as we have taken such risks, yet we are from our knowledge of the character of Mr <abbr expan="Imboden">I.</abbr> willing to continue his risk at 1 1/4 % but we would be doing injustice to our other customers to reduce his <abbr expan="premium">prem</abbr> to 1% when the <u>very best</u> risks of the character of Mr <abbr expan="Imboden">I.</abbr> are taken for others at not less than 1 1/4 %.</p> <p>The risk of Messrs G. &amp; M Hirsh expires on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and that of R H Phillips <abbr expan="President">Presd<sup>t</sup></abbr> &amp;c. on the 13<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="December">Dec<sup>r</sup>.</abbr> next. Should they desire a renewal I will send you renewal receipts upon being informed of the fact.</p> <p>I shall be pleased to hear from you frequently.</p> <p>-- November 1<sup>st</sup> 1853 --</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>C.
