Jackson where we had been marched the day before at 5 P.M. 9 miles -- We are now at the same place we were before where the roads passes between two streams of water on a narrow ridge -- It is thought Jackson will make a stand. Asby is fighting them every day -- one of their cavalry was just taken <i>[unclear: in]</i> as a prisoner -- he is a Marlander -- says he is tired of the war -- thought it would only be against So. Carolina &amp; for a short time. Our men get very weary &amp; I suppose these moves are to make them used to marching -- The 5<sup>th</sup> Va <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> -- (Augusta) is in a sore condition having been marching every day &amp; fighting too. Gen. Jackson <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> a letter today from Mrs. Lee saying that the Mayor &amp; ladies of Winchester buried our dead. The loss on our side in the fight of Sunday was about 470 in killed, wounded &amp; prisoners. Our prisoners marched through Winchester waving their hats &amp; shouting hurras for <abbr expan="Jefferson">Jeff.</abbr> Davis -- the ladies cheering them too. It was reported that Ashley had killed 500 of them before Saturday night.</p> <p> I see a good many of the Augusta people here, they have come down to look after friends in the 5<sup>th</sup> as the first accounts that reached Staunton were very much exaggerated Henry Robertson (the Dr's <abbr expan="brother">bro.</abbr>) is among the missing -- Lt. Dale of <i>[unclear: Dayle's]</i> Co. was killed. One fellow was saved by a ball hitting his pocket knife &amp; <i>[unclear: shivering]</i> it into some 10 pieces -- <abbr expan="James">Jas.</abbr> Galt had to throw away his gun &amp; everything &amp; tore through the fields -- The enemy's cavalry cannot jump fences or stone walls as ours does, therefore many of our men escape even when cut off the West Augusta Guards lost one of their pieces because a horse was shot &amp; they could not extricate it -- I am in great doubt about our dear little Nelly &amp; spend much of the sleepless nights in thinking of her &amp; your sorrowing situation --</p> <p> I have just been detailed by Gen. Jackson to make a map of this country &amp; must go to work at once -- I am unable to get a furlough now but hope I may soon &amp; that God in Mercy has spared my beloved child &amp; thus consoled you in your affliction --</p> <p> May God mercifully bless you</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly your loving husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
