I wrote you immediately after my return to camp but from some cause or other, I have (as yet) not heard from it. Don't know whether you got it or not. Perhaps I mistreated you in some way other, If so, I ask your pardon. You know we promised to write every two weeks, which I fully intended doing. But if it is <u>your</u> <u>desire</u> (which I trust is not the case) to cease corrisponding I of course submit. I thank you very kindly indeed for the interest you manifested in my wellfare. I will close for the present, As I only write to know the cause of your silence. And if I have done you injustice I trust you will forgive me</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>With much respect I remain your true friend and wellwisher.</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony Pastor</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S. <br> We have just returned from picket where we enjoyed ourselves very much indeed.
