The result to the interests of the freedman of restoration of jurisdiction to the Civil Courts, has been to make it very difficult for him to obtain preliminary hearing before local Magistrates who seem to dislike taking notice of complaints of Freedmen unless directed to do so by this office. I do not know of an instance in which the complaint against a white man has been noticed upon application of the freedman.</p> <p>In the Circuit Court the Judge has treated all cases in which Freedmen were concerned with impartiality and fairness, and the law respecting their testimony has been carried out in good faith.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Ob<sup>t</sup></abbr> Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> T.
