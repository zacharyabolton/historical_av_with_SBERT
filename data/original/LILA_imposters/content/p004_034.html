I see by the paper this morning that Cook has been convicted--Stevens has been handed over to the U. S. authorities and will doubtless be tried in Staunton. There is considerable excitment here in reference to this insurrection. Many persons are selling, and sending their negros to the South.</p> <p>My kindest regards to your mother &amp; sister. I have no news to give you &amp; read none. I thought I would write you a line, to let you know of my safe arrival--Love to all</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I remain<br>Truly Yours,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>B.
