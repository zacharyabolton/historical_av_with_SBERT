I arrived at this place on the 13th of March from Hilton Head S.C. where six hundred of us had been confined since last <abbr expan="August">Aug</abbr>. I have heard nothing from home since my arrival here, consequently can give you no news from that quarter. The two McCutchins &amp; Henry Wright are still here. My respects to Mr. Miller.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours in haste</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Samuel">Saml</abbr> F.
