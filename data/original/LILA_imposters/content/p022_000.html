Women with three (3) or more little children find it very difficult in obtaining employment and there is no authorized system of apprenticeship by which such children might be permanently provided for and the mother, disencumbered, be able to support herself. Cases of this kind are comparatively infrequent but difficult to meet when they occur because there are no vacant habitations accessible in this District and the cases are distributed over a territory which from its extent and difficult communications renders relief establishments impracticable.</p> <p>There will be numbers of infirm and helpless freedmen, besides some among those who were called "fire <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>," for whom support some local provision must be made; and I again <del hand="h1">respectfully</del> support that the local authorities, as Overseers of the Poor, may be made to take care of them as they best can, for the inhabitants <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> them have a personal interest in the matter, and permit the use of vacant cabins which they would now rather burn than have them occupied under the auspices of the "Freedmen's Bureau."</p> <p>The freedmen are rapidly becoming familiar with and accustomed to their new relations to the Whites, and give encouraging evidence that with facilities for education, and unobstructed entry into fields of labor and business they will soon <i>[unclear: cease]</i> to be regarded as an incubus upon the state or as subjects for the tutelage and guardianship of everybody, particularly those whom they already surpass in patriotism.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Colonel <br>Very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
