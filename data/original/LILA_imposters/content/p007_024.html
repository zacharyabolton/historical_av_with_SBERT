I have not had the opportunity of seeing Mr JPL yet we are often parted hear for some times two or three weeks. I do not feel like writing this eavning and thare four you must excuse me if I may write a short letter. I suppose you all have hurd a crorect account of the skirmish of the 2nd of this month thare was but little loss on our side. The report is hear that we killed from Two fifty to three Hundred of the Yankees.</p> <p>That is the statement of one of Pattersons aids if all Johnsons force hear fights like the 5th regament did on the memorable seckond we will soon whip all the Yankees back into Maryland that is all that would escape the wiry arm of the South. We just now recieved orders to draw three days rations and cook one days it is said that the enimy is marching against us it may be so but it is sirtainly to thare loss, for our force now nearly eaquels thares and we have the most artilery ond our side we have some twenty stationed pieces and some five or six flying Batterries and all commanded by as brave as the bravest all the Southern troops are as eager to fight seemingly as they are to eat.</p> <p>It seems to me that will soon whip our enimies if our offices Just let us have a trial at them.

They are with in twelve miles of us and it may not be long untill death may step between us put if so I hope not for ever.</p> <p>I'll put my trust in the God of battles for he is able and willing to save those that put thare trust in him.
