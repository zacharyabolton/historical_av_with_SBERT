But I am determined another week shall not pass, and find your dear letter unanswered. So although it is <u>Monday</u>, &amp; I act in the capacity of <u>Bridget</u>, while my girl is <u>Washing</u> I will sit down and write until time to get dinner for the farm hands. When I <abbr expan="received">rec<i>[unclear: ']</i>d</abbr> yours, I had just mailed a letter to Sarah in which I sent some messages to you, little dreaming I should so soon receive the letter I had looked for so long and vainly. I am so glad you are so happy and very thankful that you have given your heart to the blessed Savior, and <u>with</u> <u>your</u> <u>husband</u> have professed Him before the world. I know by happy experience what an increase of joy and peace, <u>religion</u> has brought to your wedded hearts I pray that you both may prove "bright and <u>shining</u> lights" in this world of darkness, sin &amp; sorrow.</p> <p>I had the pleasure of seeing Stiles a few weeks since at Uncle Jed's. He had changed so much in the years since I had seen him, I could scarcely recognize the handsome mischievous, baby pet, in the tall boy before me. I wondered if he wasn't homesick, for he said he wanted to see them all at home right badly. I had a very cool reception from <u>our</u> <u>Aunt</u>, and have concluded not to give her the oppurtunity to treat me so, soon, again.</p> <p>May just came to me for permission to take her doll and walk on the lawn. So I put on her little hood, &amp; red cloak and she kissed me "bye". She will be <u>three</u> years old the 14<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="instant">inst.</abbr> She grows rapidly, &amp; becomes daily more interesting as her mind develops. She is a <u>world</u> of comfort to her Pa &amp; me. I received a letter from Ma last week, and she says sister Emma, (Mrs. <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> P. Holman) has a beautiful little daughter! How I would like to see Emma and her <u>bridling</u>! She has an excellent husband, and a lovely home Our family were all well, and still delighted with the climate, soil, scenery, &amp;c, of <u>Oregon</u>, and especially with the celebrated Willameth Valley, where they live. I am very anxious for brighter skies natural, financial, and political. Are not you? By the way, is "<u>Mayor</u> Ellyson" your husband's father? I was very much interested in the correspondence between <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> Walker &amp; <abbr expan="General">Canby</abbr>, in which reference is made to Mayor Henry Ellyson, &amp; wondered if he and your fatherinlaw were not the same.</p> <p>Do you know that Nannie was in Richmond last week? Yes; she was there from Thursday <abbr expan="evening">eve.g</abbr> until Saturday morning. It rained Friday and she didn't get anywhere except to Capitol Square. She stopped at the <u>Exchange</u>. About a month ago she went to Salem, Roanoke <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> to visit a school-mate, and while there, here uncle William was appointed a delegate to the Valley Rail Road meeting in Baltimore, &amp; wrote to her to meet him in Charlottesville, &amp; he would take her on with him. She did so, and they spent one week in Baltimore. There she heard <u>Carlotta Patti</u> sing, and <u>Ritter</u> the great Pianist, played. She was quite <u>carried</u> <u>away</u> with the concert From Balt imore they went to Washington, where they spent two days, visiting all the public buildings. Georgetown, Arlington, &amp; <abbr expan="Mount">Mt.</abbr> Vernon. Went by water to Richmond. Nannie was so <u>sorry</u> she did not know your address, for she was anxious to see you. She enjoyed her trip mightily, and <u>declares</u> she has been <u>half</u> around the world! She came home last Saturday <abbr expan="evening">eve,g</abbr>, and we certainly were glad to see her. She is well, and sends a great deal of love.</p> <p>Do you ever see Maggie Eidson, alias, Mrs. Pete Wilson? I hope when I visit Richmond I may see both of my old scholars, Lora and Maggie.</p> <p>I have stopped to get dinner for the hands, and "snack" for Frank, and now as I have a chance to send this to Churchville, I must close. Give my love to your Ma &amp; Pa when you write, and all the family. I do not feel as if your husband were exactly a stranger, and shall therefore follow the promptings of my heart, &amp; ask you to present him with my kindest regards.</p> <p>Will you not write very soon? I do want to hear from you often.</p> <p>Goodbye</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your loving friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Allie M.
