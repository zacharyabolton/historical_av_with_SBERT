We are all well, and hop you are the same. I have no news of special importance to write. We are all in anxious Suspence Waiting to hear news from the various counties, but as yet we have heard in a manner nothing. Old Augusta as usual done her duty but not what she might and ought to have done. We gave Baldwin 1900 majority, but ought to have given him three thousand. the people did not turn out, but done better in this County than in any that I have heard from. <abbr expan="Baldwin's">B<sup>s</sup></abbr> majority in Rockingham while <del hand="h1" rend="none"></del> near 1000 and 700 in RockbridgeRobinson will cary Shenandoah by a very small majority, say 150. We have heard from five of the largest precincts in the county and <abbr expan="Robinson">R</abbr> has a majority over <abbr expan="Baldwin">B</abbr> of 72 and I think 150 will be a large estimate. Albemarle will give <abbr expan="Robinson">R</abbr> 950, there was not more than one third or fourth of the vote polled in the district-in Frederick there was but about 650 votes and <abbr expan="Baldwin">Bal</abbr> received 172 Robinson 43 and Parker the rest-we think from the present indications Baldwin is elected by a small vote; Culpeper has gone for Baldwin by a small majority 40 or 50-and I hope Nelson has done the same. Well I am truly glad to hear that you are coming over to see us at the June term of the Circuit Court. We allwill be truly glad to give you an old shake of the hand. You must excuse me for braking my promise to come over to see you, for I assure you it is not for any want of paying you a visit but from the fact that I have been bound hand and foot and have not had the time and it will be the case untill after July, for John will take up the whole of next month in his trip north, and the the month of June we will have the <abbr expan="circuit court">cir ct.</abbr> and then in July we will have a special term of the Federal Court to try the Jarvis <i>[unclear: Yactview]</i> suit so that it will be out of my power topay you my intended visit, till fall. I have seen D<sup>r</sup> <i>[unclear: Mervillatt]</i> in regard to the letter you spoke of-and he told me he had not translated it, but would do it, in a short time. I hope you are doing good work for Goggin &amp; Co. I made my first speach at Mt. Sidney on last Saturday-We will give 1000 or more majority. I have more news to write but as it is late I will close-Give my love to all</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>in haste your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>GW.
