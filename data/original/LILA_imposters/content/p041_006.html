By the blessing of God the Lecture was a success, and the children again flock to the school in new platoons</p> <p>You inform me that you have shipped bedding--This is kind, yet you remember that in my last letter I stated that I had made arrangements so that I would get along <u>someway</u>--but it will be handy to have the beding Last Saturday I road 30 miles in the rain to see about that Mt Solon School--but as the people only get together on Sunday there was no opportunity of setting any arrangement by which to secure the proposed $10. per month. But I left it in shape for the people to do on sunday, and they agreed to send me word yesterday morning but it did not come.</p> <p>But if the teacher is as you say a <u>volunteer</u> there is no risk in sending him</p> <p>The people will undoubtedly board him.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Scott</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.

Solon school and would not make a bulky bundle</p></div>
