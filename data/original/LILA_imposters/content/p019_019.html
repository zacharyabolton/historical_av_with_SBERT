I was talking with Mr. Lacy today &amp; he says he can but think as I do, that in the good Providence of God this year will end this long &amp; cruel war -- I do not see that any good can come to us from this Yankee election &amp; yet I long to know how it has gone -- to know if the majority of the people have approved the course of "Old Abe" for the last four years &amp; desire a continuance of the same -- I do not think there will be a <u>real</u> election, so many have been sent from the army &amp; from government employ to use the influence, patronage &amp; means of corruption at their disposal that they will carry the election by <u>fraud</u>, if no other way -- One of the Consuls of the "Hessian States" from New York has been here for a few days -- he left there three weeks ago -- he says there are many Southern sympathizers there, but they are so closely watched that they do not dare to express their sentiments -- he also says that the frauds practiced on foreigners to entrap them into service are almost beyond belief. I send you the paper today containing the President's Message -- he broaches some "new doctrines" -- the country is much divided in regard to the proper employement of the slaves -- I think the soldiers are opposed to arming them -- they want them used as wagoners &amp;c but are unwilling to see arms put into their hands -- the President handles the subject cautiously as though treading on uncertain ground. I wrote you that I was very busy, am really tired I have been working so closely, &amp; am glad to ride again &amp; have field duty -- then it has turned warmer today &amp; the air is inviting -- I suppose we shall now have "Indian Summer" I have not heard from Mr. Euritt so I suppose he got off as he desired, else he would have let me know as he agreed. Our men have been much improved by the course of discipline they have undergone &amp; are in better "trim" than at any previous time <u>during</u> the campaign, I hope much from them. Gen. Early has issued orders in regard to the keeping of the Sabbath, getting liquor &amp;c which have had a fine effect; the men have been kept in camp &amp; drilled most of the time, then so many have come back from hospitals &amp;c and filled up our depleted ranks -- &amp; so I might go on -- "hopeful as usual" you will say. I hope William has been of <u>some</u> use to you, though of not much -- for I fear he was out of the way -- during my absence he got hold of liquor and got a taste of the accursed stuff &amp; has used every effort to obtain it since -- I shall take him in hand after he returns -- I gave him money to pay his way up &amp; back, but I fear he spent it -- yet I can stop him &amp; will do so -- I shall try now to get some of the the things you want -- hope William will come tomorrow &amp; bring letter -- I have had a pair of shoes made for myself by one of the Engineer Company -- I got some 7 <abbr expan="yards">yds.</abbr> of linsey from Cumberland -- that is, it is on the way -- I want my cape lining completed &amp; you may have the balance -- I may let you have it all --</p> <p> I hope Nelly and Anne ar making good progress in their studies &amp; are good &amp; dutiful children -- fearing God &amp; obeying their Mother. I must write to Nelly -- I shall expect her to be able to make me a loaf of bread when I next come home -- when I shall be in her debt somehow -- &amp; Anne shall not be forgotten if she shows progress according to her years -- Also remember me to Mary -- I hope she does well -- Write soon -- Goodbye &amp; God bless you </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
