Saturday June 15th by the order of Gen. Garnett, Lt. Col. Heck started with his regiment from Huttonsville at dark &amp; passed North through Beverly which is 10 miles from Huttonsville, and then turned to the West &amp; followed the Buckhannon Road and encamped at Baker's one mile west of Beverly, where they arrived at near midnight &amp; encamped; &amp; the next day, Sunday July 16, the regiment marched on, passing the top of the mountain at Hart's House by 9 o'clock, five miles from Beverly, and then going on two miles further to near the foot of the Mt, where, aided by Capt. <i>[unclear: Corley]</i>, Col. Heck selected a place for an encampment &amp; the army encamped there at 11 <abbr expan="o'clock">o'clk</abbr> A. M. of that day -- cutting down the undergrowth &amp; pitching their tents, such as had them, the others making them bark houses &amp; rail houses covered with bark. </p> <p> Rich Mountain forms the western boundary of Tygart's Valley &amp; is the water shed between the Tygart's River &amp; the middle Fort Branch of the same, the two streams uniting some 15 miles below Hart's after the Tygart's Valley river has broken through the Rich Mt., when the same range of Mts. passes on under the name of Laurel Hill. </p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
