Mr Kerr starts this evening for camp <del hand="h1">at the</del> on account of the earnest request of his son. I suppose he intends to take some provisions along. but we did not know of his going <abbr expan="until">till</abbr> this evening and so we did not have time to prepare anything to send you. if Grovy would have been willing, even to take it which I dont know for it appears to me as if they always act mighty sly about their going or sending anything. I have not time to write now for I guess they will be along shortly. I have no news to communicate. I hope you are enjoying yourself <u>hugely</u>. Pa has commenced cutting his grass this evening. The men over thirty five are getting home at least a great many of them. Andy Lucas has I believe got his discharge I wrote last friday and sent by mail to gordonsville I wish you would say if you please whether you get it or not. For people bring their letters here without directing them to any place &amp; I dislike the responsibility of sending. I have been sending to <abbr expan="gordonsville">gor</abbr> the last few mails &amp; if they are not received I guess I will hear of it. Well the stage is coming and I must close</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your affectionate sister,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mary</p></div> <!---->
