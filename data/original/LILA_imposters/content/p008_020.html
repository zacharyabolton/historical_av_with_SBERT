We went to their very presence but the result was a failure and the exposure used up a good many, myself among the rest. I came back completely exhausted and have been lying on my back for two days. Added to my previous state of weakness I tell you I felt badly, and all alone as I was yesterday, twenty times did I cry like a child at the thoughts of home and the thousand attentions I should have. Oh brother I never want to spend such a weary day again. I can get nothing that I can eat, and so my strength will not increase here, but, thank the Lord I start for home this evening or early tomorrow morning. Dr. B. is getting things ready now, and shall be three of four days getting to Green Bank to Mr. Franklin Arbogasts and want to stay there a day or two to rest, and if you could send there after me I shall be very, very glad, -- though I know you are busy, for I cannot think of jolting in the stage as my bones and flesh are now. Mr. Arbogast's is 12 miles from John Yeager's on the top of the Alleghany, which is 17 miles from Monterey, so it would be two days drive. Start the 24th or 25th. The two horse wagon would be best, but do as you think best. How I long to see every one on the place, white and black. Give my love to all. I have much to tell you but cannot write more. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>As ever your brother,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.</p></div> <!---->
