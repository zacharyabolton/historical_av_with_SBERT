They are encamped near <abbr expan="Williamsport">Wm's Port</abbr>. This is the lowest point down the river than can be crossed, all the bridges along the river have been burned, &amp; they have encamped there in orders to prevent us from going into <abbr expan="Maryland">MD</abbr>.- Well we don't want to cross over, but we will be very apt to keep them from crossing over here.- They had been crossing over before we came here &amp; had destroyed a quantity of property belonging to secessionists, had entered the house of a widow lady &amp; destroyed her fine furniture.- Our scouts are along the river everyday, &amp; have been fired on twice this week by the blue bellied Yankees on the other side. One of the Waynesborough Cavalry was dangerously wounded in the brest yesterday while on duty near this river, but we got a yankee to pay for him.</p> <p>Martinsburg is a beautiful town, though there are a <i>[unclear: maj]</i> of unionists there, though the secessionists that are there, are just as kind as they can be. I was there yesterday to see some of our men that were at the hospital, &amp; there were about 20 young ladies, the <i>[unclear: pride]</i>, beauty &amp; aristocracy of Martinsburg there in that dingy old hospital laboring to <i>[unclear: promote]</i> the comfort and welfare of the sick soldiers. - <u>Who</u> would not fight when there are such women as these to fight for?</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
