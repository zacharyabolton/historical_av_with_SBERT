This same Sanguine and rather willful temperament has made it difficult for <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> counsel as much <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> done of others especialy even aged experienced and amiable Miss Williams who has been particularly useful to me in advising. I would say for Maj. How that I think him naturally a fair and good man when not hoodwinked. A remark was made a few days ago that led me to think perhaps a letter of this kind might be proper as a meanse of forestalling bad impressions</p> <p>I might send you further explanations showing more fully the cause of my writing this note but do not think it best or necessary</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Scott</p></div> <!---->
