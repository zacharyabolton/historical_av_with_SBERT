Altho' both of the teachers are fully aware of the necessity or at least the great utility of a teacher remaining all summer--yet in consequence of their having so hard a time during the winter they feel to much worn to attempt this additional labor. I think if one could stay;--as to the expense to the A. M. A.--the proposition in your letter could be met--namely that the cost including salary would not be greater than that of going North and returning. I am exceedingly sorry that something cant be done. Isn't there some teacher farther South who would be willing to stop on her way home and remain all summer here! There is a room large enough for one teacher without renting.</p> <p>As to the communication from Richmond which I presume refers to the erection of School House here by the Bureau; (yet the terse note enclosed does not say) if there are any preliminary requirements on the part of Govt to be demanded of the colored people before making an appropriation, you will please inform me that I may ascertain whether the people are willing to do their part. I think they require that the freedmen shall furnish the ground, but dont know, But I am quite sure the freedmen will not be willing a house shall go up on their ground unless we can controll it entirely, at least for a term of years. Shall I go on and ascertain what the people will do?</p> <p>Mr Brackett has given me <u>indications</u> that <u>he</u> intends to try and erect a building here,--and if the AMA intend to build,--would it not be well to communicate with Mr Brackett so as not to conflict with any arrangement of his. But I may have misunderstood the import of your <u>very brief</u> communication.</p> <p>I rather think we shall keep the schools in operation till the 1<sup>st</sup> of June, if it please you--as there is not much prospect of a summer school</p> <p>Does the Bureau give Transportation this year? If so, I don't know but I should like mine from Wilmington N. C. instead of Staunton--will write--but I want to see Bro Beals</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Scott</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.
