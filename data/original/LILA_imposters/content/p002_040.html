I will put it in regular <i>[unclear: course for so intend]</i>.</p> <p>We have no news here of any kind except that which comes from the Valley, indicating the coming of Early's army this way. I was all along our lines on the North side of the River yesterday &amp; saw <i>[unclear: unescaped]</i> war looking down from Fort Harrison to the point of Yankee lines. I was nearly all day within range of cannon &amp; at times in musket range of the enemy, but there was not a shot. The enemy are building within quarters.</p> <p>I fear the <u>Habeas Corpus</u> will again be suspended, but I hope in some modified form. Mr. <i>[unclear: Trenholm]</i> has made a capital impression here socially, &amp; officially &amp; his report rates very well.
