It appears like there has been a stop put to buisness of every kind there is very little doing except what is obliged to be done that is farming. Pa has been ploughing this week. it sets very hard with him. Runnels is still about he has joined a vollunteer company at Brownsburg.

We are all well and have been since you left and we want you to be very careful of your health do not expose yourself rashly if you get your clothes wet try and dry them and above all dont sleep on wet clothes if it is possible to have them dry for as you know it is so very much more injurious to health than when you are taking exercise</p> <p> We would like very much to know what sort of a life you lead in camp What have you to eat and have you plenty of it. great fears are entertained that you will suffer for food so many soldiers and where will bread come from to feed them Who cooks for you or do you have to do it yourselves and <del hand="h1">w</del>how are you camped, in houses in tents or in the open air with the sky for your covering. I would like very much to know who your messmates are. How is cousin John Berry getting along has he got his spirits raised yet or is he still down. I reckon you live in excitement I hope you dont have to live on its so near the city.
