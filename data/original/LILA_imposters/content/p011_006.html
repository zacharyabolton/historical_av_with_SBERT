Jackson at Gordonsville, with wagon, maps &amp;c, so we are obliged to be off early tomorrow morning, and I shall be <i>[unclear: deborred ]</i> the privilege of coming home to see you before I leave, which I am very sorry for, I had hoped to have a days notice of a movement, and then I could have slipped home, but it is too late to think of now, and my horse is not feeling very well either and will have a long ride to make tomorrow. The enemy has made some demonstration towards Gordonsville and Gen. Jackson is moving up that way I suppose, from the order to us. I will leave the pitcher at Dr. Young's so you can get it from there -- I shall miss my clothes some that I left at home, but I may have a chance to send for them, or I will direct you how to send them to me -- I can get along for a time. The cars are not running up to Staunton now -- they are all employed for army movements. I suppose it will not be long until they run again, but I shall find some way to write to you, which I will be sure to attend to. I must go to rest, for I shall get little enough at best tonight -- May God bless and keep you all safe -- do not despond, but trust in him that doeth all things well &amp; wisely, and who ruleth over all.</p> <p> A kiss for my children and my love to all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Good bye -- Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
