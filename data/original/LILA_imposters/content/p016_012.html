They were going to the Army: your pa saw Mr. Snyder on Tuesday afterwards &amp; he said he delivered it to you on Saturday Night &amp; saw you but I did not know whether it was so or not as I waited all last week for a letter from you &amp; have gotten none yet, but as tomorrow is Mail Day I look for a Letter &amp; hope I will not be disappointed, if so I will write on if I get one I will write to you again, I hope that you have been enjoying the Contents of the box that I so carefully packed up for you. Your pa has been to see your grand Ma <i>[unclear: Doke]</i> &amp; has just returned, he saw Charles they were all well Charles thought he would go back this week but I do not think he is fit for the Army yet.</p> <p>I am getting you a flannel shirt knit, but so not know how soon I will get it done. I hope you are not suffering yet for it Let me know how the shirt that I sent you answered, &amp; how you were pleased with the socks. I will send your new shirt when I get it knit.
