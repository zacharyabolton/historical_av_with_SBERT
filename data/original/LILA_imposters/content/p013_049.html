Paxton was killed &amp; J. Addison Bell -- what an affliction for his poor mother &amp; father -- They seem to lose a son in every battle -- they enemy's raid did not do much harm &amp; our <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R</abbr> is again in order -- Hooker made a speech here before the battle &amp; told his men that he had Lee surrounded, had cut off his communication &amp; he had but one days rations &amp; must surrender or starve -- but we did neither -- We have had a severe time, fought in the dense woods &amp; could not do much in the way of pursuing the enemy -- but had to drive them by inches as it were. Hooker had 5 Army Corps, over 100000 men -- I have been up day &amp; night, a good share of the time &amp; am not in a condition to write much -- but will write soon -- </p> <p> Good by &amp; God bless you all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff.</abbr>husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
