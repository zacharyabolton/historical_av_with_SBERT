They are most of them between the ages of six and twelve and have been in school but a few weeks. They have been making very good progress for the short time they have been under instruction + I hope to get them well started before I leave--if have I must. The night school continues full notwithstanding the short evenings and all seem as much interested as during the winter months.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M.
