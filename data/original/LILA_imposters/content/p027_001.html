There are but comparatively a few cases of extreme destitution among them. them, and these are generally confined to the Aged, Sick and Crippled, and those who have very large families of small children. About fifty person have been assisted, by the gratuituous distribution of Clothing, during the month sent here by the <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> <abbr expan="Freedman's">F.</abbr> Union <abbr expan="Commission">Com.</abbr> There is a general complaint among them that they cannot collect their wages when due which of course is a great disadvantage to them, and the only assistance which can be rendered them by the <u>Bureau</u> <u> <abbr expan="Agent">Agt.</abbr> </u> is to draw off their Bills, and put them in the hands of an Officer for collection. And this often results in judgement being defered from one Court to another until their patience becomes exhausted, and perhaps their families suffer for bread.</p> <p>There is considerable suffering among the Sick, for want of proper medical attendance, and I would earnestly recommend the employment (by the Bureau) of one of the local Physicians, to attend to such as are unable, on account of extreme destitution, to pay a Physician. Am of the opinion that one could be employed at a salary of ($25) twenty-five dollars per month, who would attend to all such cases, and to this point I would respectfully invite your special attention.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> with much Respect<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt.</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Servt.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>F.
