Our scholars have increased in number and we think are more anxious to obtain an education than were from the fact their more regular and punctual attendance for the last five weeks. The Sabbath School also is progressing.</p> <p>The prejudices which some of the more educated of the colored people have had are gradually wearing away.</p> <p>We perceive a great improvement in the school both in the teachers and the scholars.</p> <p>On Sunday last we held our first Concert and for a beginning a <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del></p> <p>The recitations were generally correct all appeared interested.</p> <p>One day a little girl said to me please come to our house--Aunt Carrie wants to see you--. I did not know where they lived--but soon found out and went to see them. Aunt Carrie is an old colored woman who has been sick for some years. She told me she could not read but would like to have me read the Bible to her--The request pleased me. I read to her as she wished and promised to see her every week until I left Staunton. So every Sunday morning she looks for me and during the many conversations I have had with her she has proved herself a Christian.</p> <p>The Industrial Class of which wrote in my last will I think prove a success. I have as many girls who regularly attend the class as I can teach. I am very anxious to succeed in this part of my work because of the evident need for some such teaching for some of the girls.</p> <p>I have a class of eight scholars <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> seven of which live a mile from town. They meet in the house of one of their neighbors two afternoons in a week-- The distance provides me with a long walk-- A good change after the day teaching in a crowded school room.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>S H Davison</p></div> <!---->
