I had two or three cases of assault brought to my notice by freedmen about the middle of the month and referred them to Civil Magistrates but have received no notice to attend trials - some freedmen complained that they were often threatened with violence if they went to the "Bureau" - I do not apprehend that much can be done for them under the present restrictions of the "Bureau."</p> <p>I have registered in compliance with Circular <abbr expan="number">No</abbr> 11 <abbr expan="Headquarters">H<sup>d</sup>Qrs</abbr> <abbr expan="Assistant">Asst</abbr> <abbr expan="Commissioner">Com<sup>r</sup></abbr> - in the County of Rockingham one hundred and fourteen couples with their Children and since coming to this County one hundred and seventy (170) couples <ins>additional</ins> enclosed please find a blank form which I filled and gave out in both instances as an incentive to them to come forward and also to make it easier to find their names in future if required - It has been suggested to me that by putting a <i>[unclear: Rev.]</i> Stamp on, it would be a legal instrument for them to retain and with which in case of the husbands death the widow could claim property I think the idea worthy of mention but do not feel at liberty to take such a course without authority.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I have the honor to be Sir,<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obedient Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> T.
