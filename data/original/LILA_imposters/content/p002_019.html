<!----> <!----> <div class="source__opening_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Dear sister</p></div> <div class="source__body source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am almost ashamed to write home, having nothing but <i>[unclear: words]</i> to write of. I dont think the person told the truth that wrote the poem "Man wants but little here below." At least such has not been my experience and observation. I heard that you had got a hat, "with a white plume." What is the shape of it? I have not got my hat or bonnet yet I am rather undecided as to what to get I would rather have a bonnet. If I can get <ins>a pretty bonnet</ins> one for 5 or 6 I would prefer it to a hat. But I am afraid they will cost more than that. I do not know much about the price of dress goods here I have not seen very many yet. I do not suppose they are any cheaper here than in the country store, and they are higher here than in the stores in <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> Augusta. Right nice Mosambiques cost about <i>[unclear: 70]</i> here. Miss <i>[unclear: Pennie]</i> Howard got a lawn for $1 per <abbr expan="yard">yd.</abbr> but it was very fine and nice piece of goods. I know but little about the prices of goods. I expect Miss Lizzie Echard could tell you more than I know. If you can I would like to <i>[unclear: picture]</i> a corset with enough <i>[unclear: swiss]</i> for a new white body. I think it probable though that Mr Andersons <i>[unclear: swiss]</i> is dearer than it would be almost any place else, as I heard he had bought it before goods fell. If you get me a corset, get about <i>[unclear: 20]</i> 20. I dont insist on the corset, if it cost too much. I will try and do with my body. I do not know what about wrappings <i>[unclear: silk]</i> wrapping made <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> be much worn, but I of course dont expect to get any. If you have <i>[unclear: not]</i> need <i>[unclear: that]</i> <i>[unclear: appear]</i> and do not intend making yourself a little sock, I believe I will make one of it if you send it to me. When you send my clothes send my white dress. I do not suppose I will wear it as a dress but will need the skirt for a nice underskirt occassionally &amp; please send my <i>[unclear: swiss]</i> <i>[unclear: body]</i>. If you get me a dress you can just get it as if it were for yourself. I do not expect anything very expensive. I want to confine my wants as much as possible for I certainly am an expense myself, and I feel it. We will have an exam on the whole book of <abbr expan="Geometry">Geom</abbr> next Tues week. I have not commenced preparation for it yet but must commence and study faithfully. There is to be a little concert tomorrow night I dont <i>[unclear: know]</i> whether I will come down to it or no. Ella Allen expects to go home next week. I am so very very sorry I love her so very much, but I know it will be better for her, and I ought not to be sorry. Liddie has not been well for a week, she too expects to go home for a few days. Bettie Echard was to see me to-day. Miss Lizzie did not come up. Mrs Turk coming down next week you had better come along <ins>coming down</ins> to <i>[unclear: see]</i> the <i>[unclear: town]</i> if not only. But I must close, <i>[unclear: have]</i> you write<br> I expect you to <i>[unclear: see]</i></p></div> <!----> <!----> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>[at top of first page] I did not have time to write this with ink<br> I certainly have scratched this down in a hurry<br> Dr Brown preached two splendid sermons for us last Sunday. Mrs <i>[unclear: Edmonson]</i> (Ned's mother) was buried to-day.</p></div>
