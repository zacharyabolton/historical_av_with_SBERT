I hope when these few lines comes to hand they may find you and the baby well and all the rest of my inquiring friends if there be any. I find that there is but few in <i>[unclear: those]</i> days, every man that is now at home is for his self and they take every advantage of them who is now in the army serving their country. I do hope that it will be our time next.</p> <p>Dear Lizza I want you to give me some satisfaction about my rye. I want to know if you have got it all thrashed out if you have not made use of it all. I want you to take care of it and your corn. If you have any you must keep it for grain is a going to be scarce after while. I want to know if you get any thing from Mrs. Ellis or not and I want to know how much you have got from him.</p> <p>Dear Lizza you wished to know what we wanted with so many clapboards. We have a stable to build, large enough to hold one hundred and fifty horses and we have some cabins to build yet, but I don't know how many.</p> <p>I am well and hearty.

Myers has been elected second lieutenant in our company. He is well.</p> <p>Dear Lizza I would like very much to see you and your sweet little boy about this time.
