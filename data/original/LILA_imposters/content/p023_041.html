Hence I was obliged to carry as on hand the check for 300 received in January until I could get the Martinsburg Bank to cash it. If there is any way to avoid this course I shall be glad to know it for it is manifestly unjust that the employees should have to pay this additional tax.</p> <p>I received on Saturday from <i>[unclear: Hank]</i> B.
