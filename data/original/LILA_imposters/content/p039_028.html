Comr.</abbr> to write to you in reference to the school at Waynesboro, referred to by you in your communication to <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> McDonnell of the 20th inst.</p> <p>Referring to the original application of <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <abbr expan="William">Wm.</abbr> C. Echols for aid in erecting that house. I find that he expressly states, in so many words, that the building would be used as a house of worship for his church and as a school house "<u>for all children without distinction of sect</u>." On these terms the grant of $150 was made. It appears therefore that the Methodist Church has the right to the use of the house for Religious worship and that <u>the Public has the right to it for school purposes</u>. Please inform the church of this fact and say to them that the Bureau expects they will do themselves no discredit and their people no harm by trying to make the school in any way denominational. Baptist and Methodist churches have in many instances been aided in precisely the above manner.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Respy</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>R.
