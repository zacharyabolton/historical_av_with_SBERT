Have not had communication with him, but took it for granted that he would supply. If he does not, the best I can do, so far as I can see, at present, is to send a young lady there. I could do that at once, if you thought best, then if none other could be provided you, would have her and she is an experienced teacher and a very good lady. This lady will be at my house probably tomorrow, and must <ins>be</ins> sent to some of the many applicants within a few days. The charitable societies are "hard up." I dont think you will get a man. If Mr. Brackett should supply at all, I suppose he would be glad to be relieved of the support of one teacher. Please reply at once, and I will be governed by your judgement.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Respy</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>R.
