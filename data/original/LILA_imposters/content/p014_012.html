I have had no trouble in having my clothes washed so far. I want you to send me the receipts for making buns those sweet roles you use to make as we have no use for our sugar, and how to cook potatoes cut up under meat and to fry them. I like camp life so far very much. All the cavalry forces we have are concentrated near hear except Robertson who we are looking for every day. I hear that Gen. Beauregard is to take charge of Jackson Corps. God has certainly taken a great man from us. No one hear thinks that his place can be filled. </p> <p>Maggie is looking nearly as well now as when I left. I never knew a horse to become as much attached to any one in my life. I have been offered $800 for her several times. Tell uncle Archer if Pa is not at home to know what Mr. Billy Barwell will take for his brown horse and if he will take $500 for him to let me know as Capt Steptoe wants a horse and cannot get one at any price. There is no news. Never forget to mention him in your letters and tell him to try and get well. Tell Sister &amp; cousin K I don't want such short letters. Love to all.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am your attached son,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Kent</p></div> <!---->
