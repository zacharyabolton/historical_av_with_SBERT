All written words are weak &amp; powerless to express the throbbings of a heart where love has made it home. But all this is useless. I wrote to you from Martinsburg on my way down, <i>[unclear: but]</i> so I was not posted in regard to the Casualties of our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> &amp; more particularly of our Company. I will again endeaver to give you a more full account. Our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> lost 5 killed 58 wounded &amp; some 8 or 10 missing. In our Company we had one killed, namely, Benson Buchanan. Also 10 wounded, only 3 of them are considered bad, namely James Furn, John A. Wilson, &amp; Charley <i>[unclear: McGuppin]</i> Furn, &amp; Wilson are in the hands of the enemy, with John Clemmer who was slightly wounded &amp; left to wait on them. The rest of them have gone home excepting 2 who were so slightly wounded that they would not leave. 4 of the company are missing &amp; doubtless taken prisoners, namely, D.A. Black, L.V. Nupanan, D. A. Spitter, &amp; Franklin <i>[unclear: Carson]</i>. I left the same day that I wrote you before &amp; met with the boys in Nagerstown the night following. They seemed to be very glad indeed, and I assure you I was equally as much so to see them. The first thing that they said after asking me for a chew of tobacco (for which they were almost starved) was, if I got married while at home, of course I told them no, but some of them believe yet that I was. I tell you our boys have had a hard time sure, since they left Fredricksburg. They have been on the march for more than a month, during which time they have not had a change of clothes, they are now both dirty &amp; ragged, &amp; a great many of them barefooted, yet notwithstanding all these things they seem to be very cheerful indeed. We drew up in line of battle this side of Nagerstown &amp; fortified where <ins>we</ins> remained two days waiting for the enemy to attack us but this they did not do, excepting to skirmish a little, &amp; on Tuesday morning about day eight we crossed the river at Williamsport. waiding it up to our shoulders.</p> <p>We are now about six miles this side of Martinsburg in camp, how long we will remain at this place I cant say. It is thought by some the yankees are making for Fredricksburg again, if so we will be on the march for that place in a few days.</p> <p>There is some canonading in the direction of Harpers ferry this evening It may be the yankee Cavalry are trying to cross. The 12<u> <u>th</u> </u> <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> Cavalry had a fight there on yesterday in which Ash Harman it is said was mortally wounded, &amp; left with the enemy. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Strickler &amp; nearly all of his Company were taken prisoners in the late fight. John Muck had his left arm shattered, it was amputated above the elbow &amp; near the shoulder. I saw all the Rockbridge boys a day or two ago. Also Sam Thompson, they are all well. I must stop my scribling for I know you will be tired reading this, if you can read it at all. <u>Please</u> <u> dont </u> <u>let</u> <u>any</u> <u>one</u> <u>see</u> <u>this</u>.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>As ever yours,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony P___</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>let me hear from you soon</p></div>
