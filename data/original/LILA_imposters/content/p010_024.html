We had some 25 men killed and I suppose over a hundred wounded -- we have no means of knowing the loss of the enemy but it must have been considerable -- they carried off their dead &amp; wounded in the darkness that followed the fight Col. Gibbons of the 10<sup>th</sup> was killed Gen. Johnson was wounded in the ankle I have not been able to find out the others -- for we were up, going about, until 2 this morning &amp; then slept 2 hours &amp; were stirring again I have no idea whether we shall follow them or not They were reinforced yesterday before the battle &amp; expect Fremont tomorrow I am well but very tired -- just rode of the battle field -- a sickening sight. God be praised that we won the day. I will write more soon Love to all -- God bless you --</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed Hotchkiss</p></div> <!---->
