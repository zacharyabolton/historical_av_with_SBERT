While I gaze on you epistle my mind wanders &amp; I cannot senter it on no one subject. Now believe me I am going to try to write what my heart shall dictate. You are well aware I once loved you devotedly yes passionately up to the time of our first enstrangement Since then I have never have seaced to love you. But I cannot confine it to the burning love I once enjoyed. Can I help it that I changed, I withdrew my affections at a time when I thought all was lost that was dear to me. Oftimes since then I have tried to be the same loving Willie I once was, but it seems that I have failed Now dont belive that you are forgotten for no other woman has ever tuched a tender cord within my breast. You are in my mind from morning till eve, yes my only desire to live is to perpetuate your hapiness, give your hand to annother &amp; I will <ins>leave</ins> this country wich will be a proof of my feelings for you I am so carless my bright visions of the future may soon fade your mind must have been pushed to an unusual degree of temperment when you wrote I dont belive I could commit to memory all the charges you prefered, I will not attempt to excuse my self of any for very probaly I am gilty of all I spent a Mery Christmas &amp; a plesent New Year, Evry girl that fell to my lot to entertain was flatered to a limited extent So you may term me a cold carless flaterer &amp; of the world worldly my early landmarks have all nearly been erased, what do I live for. My heart says thee while my actions do not prove it you may doubt this writing <ins>put it is the truth</ins> What more shall I say shall I fill this page with loving ephithets or with the sad realities of my changed nature. You once knew me as a devout flolower of our meek &amp; generous Savoir. But alas for a long time I had only a name to live while dead. This may be the sadest letter you ever recieved from me I never intend to hide any of my faults from you. I know not what kind of a reply this may bring be what it may I hope it may have its desired effect. Alas you will say Willie will soon be a ruined youth it may be so, but I hope to the contrary I am certain the intoxicating cup shall never drag me down in its ruinous path of misery. Since I left Augusta The grate I am has called for some of her fairest duels. It seems that the fairest flowers are always smitten first. I recieved a letter some time ago from my darling sister oh how I long for her emprace. Brother C was up to see me last night got here late yesterday eavning &amp; started early this morn. He is looking quite well, dont seem to take it very hard about loosing Bette, mans hard heart is hard to brake Dear Kate I pick up your letter and look at it. Then say I cannot answer it, do not know how to commence so I will wait hoping I may soon see you, when I can answer it more satisfactorily than by writing I expect to make my apperance in old <abbr expan="Augusta">Aug</abbr> Sadurday week will call on you unless sooner prohibited Do not let this uninteligible letter give you any truble. If your hand is given to another before I get down I hope you will let me have the plasure of thaking it once more Bro C told me that J.V. &amp; J.H. was at a party at your house some time ago very good joke on them</p> <p>Please write soon I will promise to try and do petter next time If I have written any thing to hurt your feelings please excuse I remain yours in hope in love &amp; untill death shall us divide</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Willie</p></div> <!---->
