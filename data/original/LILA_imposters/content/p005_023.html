I will come up sometime after Christmass what time I cannot now say but as soon as circumstances will permit. </p> <p>The country is now in a fearful state of agitation. So much so that thinking men believe that a war between the sections is iminent. Should things continue as they are I do not think that any one will venture into the tobacco business at least until near spring. We contemplate holding off until then as we expect that by that time things will have been settled or taken such a turn as to indicate whether the business will be safe or not. Ours <del hand="h1">business</del> being a credit business and being carried on almost exclusively through agencies in the northern states would be the first and longest sufferer from civil war.</p> <p>As you have seen by the papers your own glorious native state has at last determined to throw off the shackels of a government which it would be <u>disgrace</u> for any southern man to submit to. Glorious South Carolina how I wish I also could claim it for my native country. In this city the friends of Southern rights are not idle though we are not making any fuss or parade of our streangth. We could muster with a days notice five hundred good men and true who are determined to maintain our rights. Even though we have to fight in the language of the infamous traitor Douglass "with halters around our necks," Blue cockades are not uncommon here. I have been wearing one for nearly two months and so help me God I intend if necessary to make the declaration implied by it good even with my hearts blood.</p> <p>As to the gun. Trades in guns and horses are proverbally uncertain. Frank when down here saw a gun that he liked as well as mine. And Paul who is very anxious to possess <del hand="h1">my</del> mine has purchased that one with the hope of trading with him. It is as good as mine but Paul like myself has falled in love with mine. He made Frank an offer while down here which pleased him. If you do not object <abbr expan="Paul">P.</abbr> and myself have determined to send his and the boot agreed upon between him and Frank in place of mine. I hope this arrangement will be satisfactory to you and Frank as <abbr expan="Paul">P.</abbr> is very anxious to have my gun. It would not do at this time to send a gun by a negro even with an order as it would get him into trouble. The arrangement for paying suits me as well as any other.</p> <p>I am glad to hear that the baby is better and hope he will continue to improve. I could not get your bill to day but as Paul is anxious for a reply to my propposition I determined to write to day so that I could get your reply as soon as possible. I will get your Bill as soon as possible and send it to you in my next. Paul sends his respects and says times are worse and worse.</p> <p>Give my respects to all and believe me your affectionate son</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John">J.</abbr> H.
