It would convince the whites generally, as well as the Courts that they Freedpeople have rights which white men are to respect.</p> <p>Most cases of refusal to settle with Freedpeople are flagrant attempts to defraud.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Ob<sup>t</sup></abbr> Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr>T.
