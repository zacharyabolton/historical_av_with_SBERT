I'd hoped the brigade had sustained its reputation on that occasion. <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Rhodes <i>[unclear: section]</i> was under the same impression. But when informed of the facts has admitted he was mistaken on the brigade - I also hope you are mistaken. I will briefly state the facts.</p> <p>At the commencement of the engagement we were in the 2nd line on the left on our right resting <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> the <i>[unclear: felands]</i> road. After sunrise we were ordered on the road and placed upon the extreme right advancing over some <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> works behind which lay a brigade - we confirmed our advance over the line of battle where we were <i>[unclear: warmly]</i> engaged some twenty minutes our right being enfiltrated, and forced to fall back some hundred yards when <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> Paxton fell - here we reformed. When <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Stewart ordered me to take command and put the brigade in motion to relieve (as I understood) our brigade who were out of ammunition. I immediately advanced to the relief of the line in front who were gallantly holding their ground with <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> ranks and empty boxes. we continued the charge up the <i>[unclear: hill]</i> driving the enemy from his fortification in rear of the log house a half a mile of Chancelorsville.</p> <p>I do not remember of any troops passing over us or they refusing to move <del hand="h1"></del> when requested or commanded our casualties speak for us, losing <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> there one third of what we took in the engagement.</p> <p>Aside from the above statement of facts, you will find you are mistaken in the brigade. Please favor me with an immediate answer </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>In haste I am sir very respectfully <br>your old <abbr expan="servant">servt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.
