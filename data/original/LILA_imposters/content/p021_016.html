The Mountain air, from which, as I told you I hoped so much, has had anything but a good effect upon me, and but that I earnestly desire to be of yet further use on the cause of the oppressed I should at once ask to be relieved indeed if you have anybody ready to go right to work I wish you would send him here. I am mending slowly now, and hope within a week or so to be in condition for active service. I have never before been sick enough to interfere with my duties and so make a poor patient.</p> <p>Mr Tukey has also been sick and is now, though he is recovering, and with care will be at work next week, Another <abbr expan="Assistant">Assist</abbr> came back sick after a weeks absence so you see that this is not altogether the "healthy region" I imagined it. However we will do the best we can.
