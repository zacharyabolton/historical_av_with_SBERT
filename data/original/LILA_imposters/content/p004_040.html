Stribling Esq<br><abbr expan="Baltimore">Balto</abbr>:<br>Dear Sir!</p></div> <div class="source__body source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>When I was in Richmond in December, I saw a specimen of "Smith's Patent Breech Loading Rifle" at <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> Wises office, and was so much pleased with it, that I requested the Governor to arm my Company with it. He promised to do so provided the Legislature placed means at his disposal for the purchase of arms before his term of office expired. They failed to do so--whether <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> Letcher will carry out <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> Wises liberal intentions I do not know. I think it is the best arm for Calvary and Artillery I ever saw. I compared it with "Maynards," "Colts Repeating Rife," the "Minnie Musket," &amp; "Halls Carbine," and I deem it <u>vastly superior to any of them</u></p> <p>We will have a meeting of officers of 9 volunteer Companies, at my office next Saturday to form a Regiment. There are 3 Cavalry Companies &amp; my own Artillery in the Number, all to be armed this winter. I want them to adopt Smiths Rifle. But as it is not known here, I wish you to send me a specimen by Express at my Cost &amp; Charges, state the price of it so that if I choose I may keep it for myself &amp; remit you the amount; if I conclude not to keep it, I will return it safe &amp; sound by Express to you in a week or two. Send me a few Cartridge Cases &amp; Balls toexhibit.</p> <p>My Object is to get the officers to petition the Legislature to procure us this weapon.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.
