I was rather surprised, when I saw the earth robed in white. I am afraid it will blast my hopes, for I anticipated a fine time on Christmas, <ins>if</ins> I get out of this prison. I expect to leave here next Saturday or whip some of the <abbr expan="Professors">Profs.</abbr> as you know I am a great fighting character speaking ironically. I have not been very well for the last week or two. I had a very bad cold, but I think so much about Christmas, I believe it has nearly left me. I think leap year must be doing its duty, &amp; its whole duty, from the number of weddings you have attended, or rather the number of marriages that have taken place, in your immediate vicinity. I was rather surprised when you told me of J. Rubush's marriage. I hope they will have a happy sail on the Sea of life. Miss R.P. is not married yet. I think the report must have been without foundation. I would be a great <u>looking</u> <u>somebody</u> to get married would'nt I? Any one that is so diffident as I am, should never think of such a thing.</p> <p>I ask pardon for inviting you to the fair &amp; not telling you when it was to be. It was certainly oversight in me, but I hope you will grant my request.</p> <p>Miss R.P. was not there very unfortunately, but there were some others present, who<del hand="h1">ich</del> pleased me very much, but I was <u>so bashful</u>, I did not <i>[unclear: do more]</i> than speak to them.</p> <p>I have never been a visiting but once, since I returned to college, &amp; then I thought every body was looking at me.</p> <p>I intended going a visiting to night, but the snow, has broken my arrangements.</p> <p>How is <u>cousin</u> S.P. getting along at C.C. School. I suppose you have a singing-school there, this winter. I <u>used</u> to have some fine times at that beloved spot, but I declare I don't have them here. But one year longer, then I'll be through, after this I expect to go South &amp; whip S.C. back into the Union. I am opposed to <u>Disunion</u> in lots. I have been wishing all day for a good sleigh. I saw one or two pass by my window. I thank you for ever wishing me success, if I should, by the grace of God, enter upon the mission I spoke to you of, which I wished to be kept secret, for special reason.</p> <p>We have a very good band of students this year, no drinking which was as common last year, as it well could be.</p> <p>Well you must excuse me for this short &amp; badly written letter. I beg to be excused for tardiness in writing. I'm glad to hear that Nicholas is improving so fast.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I remain your Friend,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.P.L.</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I'll send you a ticket to the Anniversary of our Society if I can get one.</p></div>
