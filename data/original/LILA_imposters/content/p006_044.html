I think a great deal about you, your Perilous situation particularly in a moral point of view. The Camp is fraught with dangers more potent than even the Sword of the enemy. let your motto be to "watch and pray lest you enter into temptation". Set your face like a flint against sin; not in your own strength but Look to Christ for strength, to do your duty and withstand the temptations that beset you, in the tented field. Commit your all to Christ, And if you are called to contend, in mortal-combat, with our enemies; do your whole duty, and you may safely trust in Him. Be careful not to expose yourself mor than is necessary, particularly in the night air, rest when you can. Learn all that you can that will be useful. if you have an opportunity to learn horsemanship embrace it you will see good horsemanship I donot know whether you will have an opportunity of practicing horsemanship but if you have put yourself to inconvenienc to have th advantage of training under a riding-master. You are deficient in the art of riding and it is important now while you are young you should correct the defect. I want you to get Military books &amp; studdy the Tactics withe a view of being fitted for any Command in the Army try to know every officers duty then you will know when they perform their duty; and when you are imposed upon It may be that some opening may Occur that you may get an office during your term If not you will be better fitted to act well your part as a private Soldier.
