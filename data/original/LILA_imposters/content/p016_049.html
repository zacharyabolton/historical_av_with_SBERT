Grant still employs himself in reviews &amp; changing his camps -- he has also been digging some entrenchments this side of Culpeper <abbr expan="Court House">C. H.</abbr> on Mrs. Green's land -- The grass here is quite green &amp; our horses are doing very well -- picking up after the hard winter they have passed through most of them are quite thin &amp; look badly. I have been much pleased listening to the songs of a mocking bird that sings every morning at my window &amp; calls around him all the varieties of birds that frequent the place by imitating their notes &amp; "calls" -- it is quite amusing to see a bird come flying up to answer the love call of its mate &amp; as suddenly turn &amp; dart off at a note of alarm seeming to come from an enemy -- The bird is a very plain looking one, but certainly quite wonderful -- I today packed up another box to send home, which I shallsend to Staunton to the care of Maj. Bell--. I enclose the demijohn &amp; one crock in the box -- if any one goes to staunton in the course of two weeks they can get it, but do not borrow any trouble about it -- I sent back nearly all my clothes -- want to take as little baggage as possible so I may have room for something else if we succeed in getting anything. How cheeringly every thing goes on this Spring -- we seem to be favored in everything and if we can only whip the "Army of the Potomac" I think we shall be in a fair way to secure peace by the close of the year -- Mrs. Ewell has gone away &amp; the poor old General is almost disconsolate -- <u>gets up early in the morning</u> &amp; walks about nearly all day -- he is very active now &amp; in fine health &amp; sprints -- we are enjoying the butter &amp; pickles very much -- How comes on the garden -- the stock &amp;c &amp; &amp; especially how comes on my dear little wife &amp; my two babies -- Heaven bless them. It almost made me homesick last Sunday to thing that I was so far from home -- My kind regards to Mrs. Wise &amp; family -- I have been so busy I have not had tiem to call on Mrs. Stubblefield. Be sure &amp; write to me often -- &amp; tell me if there is anything you want &amp; how you get along -- I am so sorry I have to leave you thus all alone -- but our God will protect --</p> <p> Good bye my love &amp; kisses for you all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
