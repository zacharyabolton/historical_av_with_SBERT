I wrote to you from Charlottesville -- we went the next day to Lynchburg on the cars, taking our horses along -- we found the enemy three miles from there &amp; had a little skirmish with them in which young Tinsley of Staunton was killed, our loss very small, in numbers &amp; we drove back the advance of the enemy with considerable loss to them -- our whole corps got up Saturday &amp; we prepared to attack the enemy on all sides Sunday morning, but during the night the Vandals ran away -- we followed them as far as Liberty in Bedford Co. Sunday, 25 miles over a rocky &amp; dusty roadpicking up some stragglers &amp; killed a few in a skirmish -- we kept up the pursuit Monday -- all day -- hot &amp; dusty, an occasional fight with the enemys rear, to Buford's Gap in the Blue Ridge -- the enemy plundering &amp; burning as they went stripping every house of all its provisions, driving off the stock of all kinds &amp; in many cases tearing up the clothes &amp; plundering the trunks &amp;c of the citizens -- we could not get a chance to fight them -- they moved so rapidly -- we sent our cavary round to Salem, by Buchanan, to cut off the enemys retreat through the Mts. &amp; yesterday our weary &amp; hungry men pressed on after them &amp; Ransom with the cavalry got to the Gap which they were passing through &amp; fell on them &amp; captured &amp; brought off 4 pieces of artillery &amp; 5 caissons 140 artillery horses &amp; some 200 <abbr expan="cavalry">cav.</abbr> Horses a lot of wagons &amp; some 150 prisoners &amp; made them burn up some 20 wagons 6 pieces of artillery which we afterwards got -- our cavalry hung on their flanks &amp; rear all day &amp; did them considerable damage, but our infantry could not get up until they had all gotten through the Gap -- for many of our men had had no bread for 3 days -- we had marched so fast &amp;far that the commissary wagons could not get up -- The cavalry has gone on after the enemy &amp; we are all in camp today in the vicinity of Botetourt Springs resting &amp; getting up on our rations &amp; washing My shirt is if anything a shade darker than the ground -- have not had any clean clothes in 10 days, but William is washing now -- &amp; I hope to be clean once more -- our wagons are up with us this morning for the first time since we left Charlottesville -- we have been getting along the best we could &amp; the people have been very kind to us although they have suffered so terribly from the Yankees -- we spent last night at the <abbr expan="Botetourt Springs">Bot. Sps.</abbr> (Hollins Institute) there is no school here now, a fever in the Spring took off 6 young ladies &amp; they closed the school -- one of the Miss Chapmans from <i>[unclear: Lanz]</i> is here &amp; quite anxious to go home --</p> <p> As I wrote to you from C. I expect to see you all soon -- without rendering any <u>military</u> reason &amp; you need not tell any one <u>either</u>! Though I know we shall both be glad to see each other -- I cannot write more now -- so good bye &amp; the Lord bless you all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
