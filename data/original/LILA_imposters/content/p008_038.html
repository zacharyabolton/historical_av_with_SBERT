Hayse. It need not be told you that it was received &amp; perused with great pleasure as I consider it a pleasure to read letters from all my friends, who manifest such a deep interest in the welfare &amp; safe return of our soldiers as you do. I am tolerable well at present, but not as well as I have been. I never had better health than I had two or three weeks ago. Have fattened so much you would hardly recognize me, if I were to meet anywhere away from home. I think you might come down &amp; see us all, while we are living in peace &amp; quietude. The indications for a battle are very faint; according to my way of judging. We will soon be strongly fortified here, and I hardly think the Yankees will attack us so strongly fortified, since they are afraid to "show us fight" in an open field. We had a grand display of the <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> <abbr expan="Volunteers">Vols</abbr> yesterday evening. <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> Lecher was present &amp; presented to each Va Regiment, the Virginia Colors, with a short speech exorting them to never let her be dishonored, while in their charge. All the Generals with in reach, were present on the memorable occasion.</p> <p>The Governor delivered his address, standing upon one of our newly erected forts.</p> <p>The <abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr> is going to have a grand review of the troops this evening, I wish you could attend, it would be something romantic to you especially. I saw some ladies on the field yesterday evening, to see what was to be seen &amp; heard. This part of the country is nearly destitute of ladies &amp; citizens generally, some have united their destiny with that of the Yankees &amp; some with the Southerners.</p> <p>I suppose you have heard that the Company to which I belong, has been detailed as a permanent guard at <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Smith's headquarters.</p> <p>We were detailed the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of Oct. The time passes much more pleasantly in that position than it did when we were with the Regiment, <del hand="h1">withs</del> notwithstanding our guard is very heavy.</p> <p>I've gotten so used to Camp life, I feel as well contented here, and probably better than I would be if I were at home or College. One of my Classmates came down yesterday to see us all. From the news he gave of College I would not like to be there very much. Only one of my Class returned, Lacy from New Kent County. I hope he will have a big time of it. He graduates this year, if he studies pretty hard. You spoke to me something about <abbr expan="William">W<sup>m</sup></abbr> Brand &amp; what I thought of him generally. I have not associated with <ins>him</ins> a great deal since he is in a separate <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> from myself, but from what I have seen of him or even heard, raised him in my estimation a great deal. His moral deportment without a reasonable doubt is impeachable. I have never seen or heard of his association with the gambler, swearer, or drunkard, or rather I should use participation instead of association, for we are all bound by necessity to associate with men of all ranks &amp; classes. To speak the truth, I have never heard of any action in his life, that would cast a shame &amp; reproach upon his professions. I don't know whether this will be satisfactory to you or not. I have asked no one with regards to him, but speak from my own observations.</p> <p>This war I believe is designed to bring out the characters of men, &amp; it certainly has brought out his by this time, &amp; I consider it a good one. I was very sorry to hear of the death of my old schoolmate Miss Sallie M<sup>c</sup>Cadden, and also others with whom I was acquainted, but speaking from your statement with regard to them, their parents &amp; friends loss was their eternal gain. That disease seems to have been more <i>[unclear: fatal]</i> this season, than I've ever known it to be. But all these things must needs be &amp; we should submit &amp; that, willingly. The suffering of our army in the west has certainly been very intense. But I still hope &amp; trust it will be all over by next Spring, at the same time I see the tide of war rising more fearful &amp; terr<ins>if</ins>ying than ever. I have no news to write to you that would interest you in the least.</p> <p>I got some of the cake &amp; cheese you sent to your brother. It was very nice, &amp; accept of my thanks for it. Well I must close, give my love to any you choose, &amp; write to me soon again.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Remember me to be your ever true Friend &amp; Schoolmate</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jno.
