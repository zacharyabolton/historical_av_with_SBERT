Harman came to my room after I came from church &amp; we talked until past bed time &amp; so I failed to do my duty to you -- but you must forgive me this time -- I went to church twice -- Mr. Pratt preaced one of the best sermons I ever heard -- Mr. Guy goes down this morning &amp; offers to carry a bundle for me -- so I send down my dirty clothes that you may have them washed up this week -- I shall be home either Friday or Saturday, for several days (D.V.) I got a letter from Mr. Robinson from Baton Rouge -- he is very well &amp; thinks they will get along better at <abbr expan="Baton Rouge">B. R.</abbr> having as many cadets as they had before the fire -- I dont think he will come to Va. he is afraid of cold weather -- says you must write to him -- The key is in the side pocket -- </p> <p> Good bye &amp; God bless you </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours in affection</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
