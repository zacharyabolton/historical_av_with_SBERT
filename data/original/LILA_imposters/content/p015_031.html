It is hard to have ones cherished desires crushed in a moment &amp; when we thought our joys almost complete to have them suddenly turned to sorrow but such is life -- such is the expereince of everyone &amp; it is sound philosophy &amp; true religion to meet the changes of life with resignation &amp; compassion when we are assured that we have fully done our duty -- so I bid you all cheer up &amp; hope for the "smiling face" behind the frowning providence. I am glad she was met so kindly by Rhett &amp; the others -- so was some sunshine to the stormy day -- I can also imagine the F. has been <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> by some complaints of his poor old fatherwhose heart is unsanctified by religion has no joys of its own &amp; feels restless &amp; complaining &amp; these complaints to F in his condition have almost unhinged him &amp; hence his words &amp; manner -- so I think it may be &amp; a little time will restore him to himself -- Let us fondly hope so -- But I will say no more now -- though it presses sadly on my thoughts amid all this bustle of the moving of a mighty host. How full your feelings were my Dear your letter attests, for you mentioned nothing else save that you were well I have written to you 3 times &amp; sent you some money -- hope they have all come to hand -- I wrote to you last form Bristol we could not catch the Yanks to fight so we have destroyed the <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R.</abbr> &amp; come back to Culpeper &amp; encamped -- I spent last night at Mrs. Wise's her daugthers were well &amp; had gotten along well, but were much surprised that their mother had not come over &amp; had only heard from her by the letter I brought over -- they are very anxious for their mother to send after the stock as they have no feed -- I wish you would tell Reed to send my butter over, our camp will be near Brandy at present -- he can find some one that is coming over to take charge of it &amp; we will pay expenses &amp; send him the amount as soon as we hear from it -- I think you had better buy a few bushels of potatoes of Mr. Geading -- I shall want a few bushels when we go into winter quarters -- I will send you $100 in a few days -- Hope you are <u>getting</u> along as comfortably as your situation will allow -- Much love and kisses for all the family - Good bye &amp; God blessyou all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
