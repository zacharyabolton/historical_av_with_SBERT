I reached here last week confident I should find a letter from you but none has come to hand. Before this reaches you I may, &amp; hope I shall <u>see</u> you. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Flournoy left here yesterday and tomorrow I follow him to Danville. On Saturday I am compelled to return to <abbr expan="New">N.</abbr> York for a few days on business vital to the V.&amp;G.W.<abbr expan="Railroad">R.R.</abbr> which it would take too long to explain on paper. If it be <u>possible</u> for me to get away from Danville on Wednesday night, I will come down to Keysville and Thursday go to Lombardy Grove, spend the night and Friday get back in time for the down train, so as to go on to <abbr expan="New York">N.Y.</abbr> Saturday. But so earnest is my desire to <u>see</u> you, and in person assure you of my unalterable affection, that I mean to do so if it is in the compass of human effort. Our <abbr expan="railroad">R.R.</abbr> affairs are in a crisis so vital to the success of the grand scheme that I have subordinated everything to that. If we can accomplish certain objects we have in view in the next two weeks it will be plain sailing for us afterwards. All this I can explain when we meet, &amp; you will then understand what a struggle I have had between my obligations to the public and my personal happiness. One day with you would be a compensation for weeks &amp; months of work and trouble. Should <ins>you</ins> ever be my wife our happiness is largely involved in the success of this great <abbr expan="railroad">R.R.</abbr> enterprise, for I have a fortune dependent on it. And the very love I bear you has been an additional stimulus to my efforts. Since I parted from you not <u>one</u> day has been at my command. It has been with me like Hood's song of the shirt "Work! Work!! Work!!!" Such a life, unblessed by the love of such a woman as you would be intolerable - but with that reward I am willing to bear it, till <del hand="h1">such</del> such success crowns the effort as will compensate all the labor.</p> <p>Believing we shall meet before this reaches you I will not anticipate on paper what I shall then have to say. I have written to "Sister Lou" tonight &amp; sent her my photograph. I enclose you one, if fate should decree that I may not deliver it in person this week. I did so hope you would be at the Fair. It would have crowned my happiness completely.</p> <p>My darling, if you will let me call you so, be patient with me, for I can not help the delay that has kept me from you so long.</p> <p>Goodbye - God bless you.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Sincerely &amp; devotedly yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.D.
