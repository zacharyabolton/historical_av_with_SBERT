I have a great Deal to tell you but dont know whether I will get through this time or not. In the first place we are all well. The yanks burnt both of our barns with about twenty five tun of hay in them &amp; all of our wheat excep about twenty five bushels that we had carried out. We saved allmost all of our farming utensils. The yanks took all of our cows but too came back.</p> <p>I refujeed over the mountain with four horses &amp; our colts &amp; some old horses we left at home &amp; they tried to drive the colts off but they ran off &amp; came back. They looked through the house but dident take any thing except some sugar &amp; one pair of pants from papa.</p> <p>Their will be suffering times in the valley this winter as the yanks have burnt all of the barns from hear down &amp; all of the mills except one occasionly, all of the barns in this neighborhood are burnt up except two or three &amp; the worst of all every body paid the yanks all of their gold &amp; silver. One thing we never paid them one sent, &amp; if they never come again we will do pretty well. Some people are ruined in tirely. They liked to ruined <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Pence they took of both of his black men that he had bought &amp; five head of horses &amp; all of his cattle &amp; sheep &amp; burnt his barn he dident have a barrel of flour on hand. I tell you he is almost crazy &amp; the worst of all he has to go in the army now he has to go to Staunton to morrow to Start to Richmond the next day &amp; John Grove has to go also &amp; all of the details. I tell you they are <i>[unclear: scraping]</i> things now &amp; I think they ought <i>[unclear: for times]</i> looks pretty squally but we will come out all right in the end. Some people think the Confederacy is gon up all ready as the saying is.</p> <p>There has a great many family <i>[unclear: members]</i> off to the yanks from Rockingham &amp; some men that had fine farms. People from hear down are very much discouraged every thing destroyed. The yanks dident got to John Grove. So all of the barns in that neighborhood are safe. They were at Uncle Jacobs but dident burn anything in that neighborhood. The yanks stripped some people of all of their stock.</p> <p>I must tell you a little joke on Papy. Uncle John went to hall some wood &amp; papy went over toward Mr. Reubushes to stand picket so he could notify him if the yanks were a coming. So Mr. Reubush joined Pappy &amp; they went out to the Keegle town road &amp; was a looking for the yanks &amp; all at once a old yank road up in their rear &amp; asked them what they were a doing there &amp; demanded their money &amp; as good luck would have it Papy hadent but little &amp; he told him to go home &amp; stay thier, but Mr. R. had about five thousand dollars in <abbr expan="Confederate [currency]">confed</abbr> &amp; soime little speace &amp; they robbed him &amp; as they told pap to go he left Mr R &amp; cut out &amp; after he had gon the old yank struck Mr R thre times with his saber &amp; so he put out home to with an empty pocket, a wonder the yank dident take both of their horses &amp; so that ended their picketing &amp; I think it ought as they both might of been killed. Nothing new except everybody so down in the mouth in Rockingham the yanks burnt a good many houses the people in the lower valley will have to leave &amp; go someplace this winter. One good thing almost every body was done seeding &amp; the wheat is up &amp; looks very fine. We hadent sowed as much as we had counted on sowing but we will have to quit so ther aint any to spare to mow. We had sowed some 40 bushels.</p> <p>The people in the neighborhood are jenerlly well. I tell you about that battle that we had in the valley when the yanks whipped our men we were whipped very bad. I never saw such a demoralized set of men in my life a heap of our men deserted some never will do us any more good but our army has bin recruiting &amp; our army is in better spirits than they were two weeks ago &amp; I think we will clean the yanks out of the valley soon. I don't think they will be up this winter any more at least I hope so. It was a bad arrangement to let the Yanks destroy the valley. I dont see how our army is to live in <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> this winter the valley has bin our main support &amp; that is nearly all destroyed. James D. Schreckhise is safe yet at last accounts but the old company that I ust to belong to was all killed or captured except one private &amp; that is <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Sheets. <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Joseph Frey was wounded &amp; ded he was <i>[unclear: dead]</i> three weeks yesterday. That is his third Son for to be killed in this war. George <i>[unclear: Baker]</i> has got back from Fort Delaware paroled as he was wounded. A. B. is still their. Nothing more new to right at this time right soon &amp; a long letter. Let us know what you think of things in jenerale. Give my Respect to Amanda &amp; receive a portion for thyself. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>D.K.
