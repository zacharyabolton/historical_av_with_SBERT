Jackson -- their intentions are not fully developed yet, but the impression is that they will go across the Ridge from New Market -- I should have sent William out today but for that -- if we have to go away get Snyder to kill your pig -- Mr Christian Bear told me yesterday he could spare me $200 -- so if you need any money call on him &amp; tell him I want you to have it -- do not get it unless you want it. He wants Webster's Dictionary &amp; said he would give you a barrel of flour for it -- that is now ten dollars in specie -- I told him I thought you would like the bargain -- it is a good one &amp; you can hide the flour &amp; keep it -- I think -- I hope this will blow by &amp; I got home &amp; get you fixed better. Sandy will finish cutting your wood &amp; I will pay him -- I think you will find Christian Bear a good man to call on if you need any aid -- I had a long talk with him -- I have clothes enough to get along -- so do not be troubled about me -- If I need any I will send for them -- but if any ones come tomorrow send my flannels &amp; shirts -- only by some safe way -- &amp; I do not think you had better look much for a way -- for I can send after them -- Be of good cheer &amp; hope for the best &amp; the Lord protect &amp; defend you all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
