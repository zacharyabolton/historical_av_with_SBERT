Wheat was badly wounded in the shoulder but I don't think it is dangerous I brought him off the field after riding a piece we overtook Fielden Templeton who came with us as soon as we found the doktor he dismounted to have his wound dressed but the Yanks pressed us so hard we had to mount and double quick John got verry sick I was afraid he would faint and fall off if he had the yanks would of gotten him for they were in sight of us after we passed through Winchester I thought he was safe we traveled nearly all night to keep a head of the army then could hardly do it for John was not able to ride fast the army fell back to Fishers Hill that night we got about 1 1/2 miles above Tuesday morning I turned back and joined the command I hope John will have luck to reach home safe when you write please let me know how he is.
