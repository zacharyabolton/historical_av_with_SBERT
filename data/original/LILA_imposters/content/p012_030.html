Lee is within four miles of <abbr expan="Fredericksburg">F</abbr> -- No news of any importance to write. I was much fatigued by my ride, and thought I would be laid up -- but I stood it, and am now better -- wish I had put some pickles in my pockets -- but there is a plenty of cider here and I will drink that until the jaundice disappears -- I have not seen the Gen. yet and do not know what he wants, but will see him tonight and add a few words before the mail closes -- </p> <p>Night. My Dear -- I have seen the General -- dined with him today, and my fate is sealed for the present -- as I anticipated -- he wants a map of the Adjoining country here, so good bye to home and the Valley for the present but I am in hopes that something will turn up so I can come yet -- where there is a will there is a way, and my will is strong enough in a conscience -- I hope we may not stay here always -- but soon get through with it -- All concur in the opinion that this is a hard country and hope we may not have to stay here long - - Boswell is away tearing up <abbr expan="Railroad">R.R--</abbr> and I have not seen him, but will write in a day or two about the eatings -- I got here with most of my crackers and two apples for the Gen -- which was all I expected -- I hope you will patiently await my coming and not "get blue" or let anything trouble you that you can avoid -- our great trouble swallows up all others -- and I hope that we may, in God's good Providence, soon finish this and long live to enjoy that which has been so dearly bought -- at such a sacrifice of blood and treasure -- The Yankee gunboats can not get up to Fredericksburg and the banks are so high they can only fire over one by hugging the other, and it is thought our sharpshooters will be able to pick the men off the decks if they come up for -- Secure for yourself all the butter you make and buy some more too and put it down -- get Mr. Wooster to pack up your pork -- tell him to send his letter to me in one from you and I will attend to it -- Nelson said you could have one of the large or one of the small hogs in the pen at the house -- I forgot to ask you, but you had better have a large one put up with yours and so have enough -- Write very soon -- be of good cheer and the Lord bless you &amp; the children --</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> -- husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
