I hope we will get one by Friday's mail Ma I think we have just c<ins>a</ins>usses to leave this place the state of affairs in the country and some other things I dont like about M<sup>r</sup> White which are not worth while to be mentioned but I will tell you when I come home As I said three have left and more expect to leave, some three or four more will leave this week and those that are here are mean as they can be and none of us like them. Now I hope you have fully determined to let us come. And please send us money to come. Write on Thursday, so it may come up on the train the same day and we will get it on Friday. We don't want to start in the next session so please write by Thursday's mail and let us come home</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Sons</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>George &amp; <i>[unclear: Sam]</i> <i>[unclear: Wils]</i></p></div> <!---->
