Mary said Father and <br> Uncle John were <u>talking</u> of coming <br> to see us. I am very much <br> afraid they will take it out in talk. <br> However, I hope not, but will look <br> for them before long. If they dont <br> come, I hope Emmett will, as he <br> spoke of doing. I expect though <br> he will not be so anxious to come <br> here, as to Manassas. I wish he <br> could have gotten there, to see <br> the whole Army and its chief dignitaries. <br> There is only one brigade here and <br> a few militia, so there is not much <br> to be seen, except a rich and very <br> beautiful country. The brigade <br> (except our regiment) has moved <sic> has <br> moved</sic> about five miles below <br> Winchester. We go to-morrow. <sup>[3]</sup> <br> There is, not yet, a sufficient number <br> of wagons to move all the regiments <br> in one day. We havent been able to <br> find out any thing of the policy or <br> intentions of <abbr expan="General">Genl.</abbr> Jackson. Nor <br> can we get any reliable information <br> of the enemy. One day we hear, there <br> is a large force at Romney and the <br> next, that they have left and are concen-<br> trating near Williamsport: that Loring <br> and Henry R Jackson will attack them <br> in the rear, and we in front: but <br> still we see nothing indicating a <br> movement of any kind. <sup>[4]</sup></p> <p>General Jackson sent Major Preston (of the <br> Institute) his Adjutant General, to <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Lovings <br> Headquarters, last week, but I dont know for <br> what purpose.<sup>[5]</sup> He left the ground covered <br> with snow. That army is having a very hard <br> time, and will suffer this winter, if not <br> carefully provided for. We have had very <br> high winds and cold weather lately. <br> We burn a great deal of wood, build large <br> fires at the doors of the tents, and manage <br> to keep tolerably comfortable. <sup>[6]</sup> </p> <p>If you can send us a comfort, a good wide <br> one to cover us both. Send the boots the <br> first chance. I'm most barefooted. </p> <p>How did <i>[unclear: Tobbin]</i> ever have sense or <br> courage enough to ask that girl <br> to have him, or walk out on the floor? <br> Nobody need ever despair of marrying <br> after that; the most despondent and <br> most often rejected can take courage. </p><p>We expect to be paid off soon for July <br> and August and probably for September <br> and October too. If we get all it will be <br> quite a pile, about $70. The Government <br> is too negligent about paying up. Most <br> of the Company are out of money. <br> Send us the cost of all our clothing, that <br> of each piece. An order has been issued <br> to send for all absentees, who are <br> able to come into service. </p> <p>Will Uncle Andy continue his <br> business in Alleghany? <br> Much love to him Aunt Sallie <br> and Aunt Betsy and all the rest. <br> Has he found a name for his boy <br> yet? Mr. Reed sends his love to <br> Aunt Betsy.<sup>[7]</sup> Why did Dr. Walker <br> resign?<sup>[8]</sup> Is he tired of the service? <br> If you all dont write oftener, I <br> think I can charge you all with <br> carelessness as you have done us. </p> <p><ins>I hope the Yankees wont give us a chance to fight them this winter. If they dont make any more raids into Virginia I think there is a chance of going into Winter Quarters, otherwise not very soon. </ins> </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><ins>Write soon to your son,</ins></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><ins>Andrew</ins></div> <!---->
