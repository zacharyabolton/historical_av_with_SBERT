Up to 434 and day schools to 224 with an average of 147 which would give 450 pupils to 5 teachers each and when Mr Coan comes I shall ask him to consider the propriety of having another teacher sent to this place permanently, as 45 scholars are enough for these small rooms</p> <p>Our S Schools has increased since we received the question books and the divisions among the people have somewhat subsided, (through much reasoning) Last Sunday we numbered 140 scholars and 7 teachers whereas we used to have only 25 or 40 in all</p> <p>The Lord is helping us</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Scott</p></div> <!---->
