My first business with him was in connection with the repairs of the Church. I was chairman of the building committee. Mr Tukey took a job to repair the Church and when it was completed he asked us Eighty Eight (88) dollars. We asked him for a bill specifying items. This he refused or neglected to do, and afterward he told us that if we would pay him about $50 he would call the bill square. The repairs were made from old lumber taken from a Rebel Guardhouse.</p> <p>I have seen Mr Tukey sell clothing. I also saw Mr Scott, the teacher, sell clothing, and afterward he turned into the Church fund about ($70) Seventy dollars from such sales. Mr Tukey turned in no money. I do not consider his reputation for honesty good. Among our people it is very bad. At the time the Freedmen's Court was organized, Mr Tukey directed the colored people to hold a public meeting and elect a representative at Court. We did so and elected Lawyer Fultz who was a well known Union man and one in whom we had full confidence. Mr Tukey objected to his <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> and appointed Mr Dews in whom we had no confidence and after his opposition to the colored people became so manifest he was returned and Mr Risk appointed by Mr Tukey.</p> <p>Have known <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook, never knew him to sell clothing.

I have received money from Mr Scott, the teacher, for sale of clothing. Received none from Mr Tukey. I am Treasurer of the colored church. Mr Tukeys bill against the church was over Eighty (80) dollars. We paid him Forty (40) dollars, and as we had some disagreement, he forgave the balance. The Lumber was old, which Oscar Morris hauled. Part of the Lumber came in the Cars from <i>[unclear: Swoops]</i> Station, and we paid the freight to Mr Tukey. I do not think Mr Tukey acts justly with the colored people. His reputation is very bad. When cases have been tried before him he charged the innocent as well as the guilty with part of the costs and now they seldom go to him with complaints.</p> <salute>Sworn to before me this 4th day of February 1867</salute> <signed>John A McDonnell<br><abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> and <abbr expan="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr></signed> <p><abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Eph.

At the time he was receiving rations for distribution to the Freedpeople. I saw one barrel of Pork and two half barrells of Mackerel consumed in Mr Tukeys family out of the provisions received. I was in the house every day, hardly ever absent. All I saw him issue was Hard Tack, <i>[unclear: Salted]</i> Herring and Corn Meal. I would have known if he issued anything else, as I worked in the room where the rations were. I was employed by Mr Tukey at ($20) Twenty dollars per month. I did not receive any pay the first three months except Ten (10) dollars advanced by Mr Tukey. He told me at the expiration of these months, that he received order to pay me but ($10) Ten dollars per month. I told him I made a legal contract with him for Twenty (20) dollars. He then left me but came back about two hours after and told me he had received another order to pay me twenty (20) for the first month and ten (10) dollars for each of the other two. I took that as I was afraid I should get nothing. While I was employed by Mr Tukey he sent me to tear down an old Rebel Guardhouse. Part of the lumber and boards was carried off by a Carpenter named Edward Johnson, who told me that Mr Tukey let him have it for (1.50) one dollar and fifty cents per hundred. Mr Robert Bichel bought sixteen (16) of the sills. I hauled a lot to Mr Tukeys house, and from that lot I hauled about Twenty (20) loads to the colored church in a Spring wagon. Mr Tukey also used some of the lumber in his house for partitions <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>.</p> <p>I have known him to sell clothing sent him for distribution to freedpeople. His reputation among the colored people is very bad. They do not consider him a Union Man. He is a great favorite with the rebels here. I worked for Mr Tukey four months, for the first month I received twenty (20) dollars, for the second and third I got ($10) ten dollars each. During the fourth month <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> How came here and I signed the payroll and he paid me twenty (20) dollars, according to my first contract. I have good reason therefore to believe that Mr. Tukey cheated me out of ten (10) dollars per month for each of the second and third months. I did not receive rations while I worked for the Bureau. Mr Tukey now employes the son of a Rebel about fourteen years old as a messenger.</p> <salute>Sworn to before me this 4th day of February 1867.</salute> <signed>John A.

Gilmore, teacher of Freedpeople, says, I knew Mr Tukey, boarded with him two months. I do not consider him a friend to the colored people, on the contrary it is generally regretted that he is connected with the Bureau. Jane Brown, a servant to Mr Tukey complained to me that she had been to work for him at six dollars and twenty five cents (6<u> <u>25</u> </u>) per month. She went to work about November last and was paid six (6) dollars and twenty five (25) cents the first month, afterward she received only six (6) dollars per month. Mr Tukey kept back two (2) dollars or Two (2) dollars and a half. Don't know that she ever received the balance. Do not consider his reputation for honesty good. From numerous reports I do not think he acts justly in the administration of complaints brought to his notice.</p> <p><abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cooks office and room was in Mr Tukey's house while I boarded there. Never was out to ride with <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook during school hours, and only rode with him once and then only for about one hour and a half. Miss Levette was out with him the same evening for about one hour. I have heard <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook say he used intoxicating drinks, but I never saw him under the influence of Liquor. His general reputation was good, and he was very much liked by the colored people. He was not in the habit of riding with the lady teachers, indeed that day, (as the sleighing was good) may be said to be the only day on which he took the teachers to ride. On one other occasion a party went to the cave, when the Schools were not in session. Miss Gillespie rode to the Cave with <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook and she returned in the Hack. I rode back with him. I have told you now of all the rides taken while <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook was here. Miss Gillespie did ride with him once at another time____.</p> <salute>Sworn to befre me this 5th day of February 1867</salute> <signed>John A.

Graham, formerly an officer in the 144<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="New York Volunteers">N.Y. Vols.</abbr> says, The colored people or those I consider Union people do not speak well of Mr Tukey. But there is a class of people here who do like him. This class are either those who were in or connected with the Rebel Army. I have been told by John Carter, Lewis <i>[unclear: Queen]</i>, and Julia Powell, (<abbr expan="colored">col'd</abbr>) that they had bought clothing of Mr Tukey. A larger amount must have been sold by him. I have known <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook since <abbr expan="November">Nov<sup>r</sup></abbr> last. He is considered a good officer by the Union whites and colored people, always attentive to his duty. Never heard he sold clothing or any other property. After <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook was relieved here the colored people got up a petition signed by some Eighty (80) person, and intended to present it to <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> Schofield, to have him returned. I have seen these petitions myself. I am now assistant foreman of the Burial Corps.</p> <salute>Sworn to before me this 5th day of February 1867</salute> <signed>John A.

His administration has been perfectly satisfactory to us. I have been settled here only since January 7th I may perhaps say that when I first heard that <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook was to be exchanged for Mr Tukey, I felt that the change would be unfortunate but since coming here I have had no reason to be dissatisfied. From what I saw of <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Cooks administration and I saw considerable of it, it was better that the <i>[unclear: average]</i> of Bureau Officers</p> <p>The three teachers, Miss Ellen A. Leavitte, Miss Sarah Gillespie, and Miss Lizzie A. Gilmore have been employed as teachers of Freedpeople two years at the "Wise Farm" Norfolk, <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr>. They are ladies of dignity, refinement and high moral and Christian character, and among the most efficient and faithful laborers I have known in the field.</p> <salute>Sworn to before me this 4th February 1867</salute> <signed>John A.

Amongst the Freedpeople he has given satisfaction as far as I have heard. Many of them have expressed dissatisfaction at his being relieved last Spring by <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook, they have stated that he was a gentleman always prompt to his business, dealing fairly and honorably in his decisions with only one single instance. As a member of the Court I can say that no costs or fines were ever imposed by that body, and consequently none collected by authority of the Court.</p> <p>From what I have heard <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook was no friend of Mr Tukeys and from anything I have seen <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook had no reason to have unfriendly or wicked feelings towards him. I had a conversation with several of the most prominent freedpeople, amongst whom were <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev'd</abbr> Eph Lawson, Aaron Shovler, John A. Christian and <i>[unclear: Dennis]</i> Harris. They all expressed themselves entirely satisfied that Mr Tukey was reinstated. I presume, they being prominent men, that they represented the feelings of the colored people. I have always regarded Mr Tukey as an upright, honest and moral man in the community. Have not known any improper intimacy between him and the Rebels, his course has been that of a gentleman towards all parties, and by that course he has broke down all prejudice against the Bureau.</p> <salute>Sworn to before me this 4th February 1867</salute> <signed>John A.

I never saw <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook until last summer. I do not consider him a temperate man by any means, know him to keep Liquor in his room. Dont know anything against his moral character. I have known him to ride out with Miss Gillespie during school hours, had her out to ride, so she did not attend school for four hours on one day, on the same day, took two other lady teachers during School hours, one named Miss Leavitte, the other Miss Gilmore. Do not know what his general reputation was. There was some prejudice on the part of <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Cook against Mr Tukey before he left. Don't know why there should be such prejudice. Am acquainted with Mr Tukey eight months here. The colored people consider they lost a friend when Mr Tukey was relieved. Many said they were glad, when he was reinstated.</p> <salute>Sworn to before me this 4th day of February 1867</salute> <signed>John A.

Have been acquainted with him since the 20th of May last. Dont think his reputation for sobriety is very good. Have seen him very often under the influence of Liquor. Dont think his conduct in our house, while he boarded with us was such as became a gentleman. He was once absent nearly two weeks, in the months of August or <abbr expan="September">Sept</abbr>, without permission to my knowledge, and during the same month was gone to Lexington twice withot permission to my knowledge.

The note requested me to call at his house that same evening and was signed F. S. Tukey. I did not know who Mr Tukey was but went to his house. When I came to his house he was standing on the porch. I stepped up and asked him if Mr Tukey lived there. He said Yes - and asked me in then told me it was his practice to invite all Union men who came to town to his house, and treat them as well as he could. I consider him a good Union man as good as there is in town. Have never heard the colored people say anything against Mr Tukey, all the Union men whom I visit say he administers the affairs of the Bureau better that any other officer who has been here.</p> <salute>Sworn to before me this 4th day of February 1867</salute> <signed>John A.
