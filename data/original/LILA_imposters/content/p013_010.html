This will explain why I did not write to you sooner. </p> <p>I have always thought it was your pecuniary interest to have the whole land of M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Cue sold, &amp; I believe that it was the <i>[unclear: course]</i> but calculated to ensure harmony &amp; kind feeling among all parties interested. Nothing but your strong desire to return the <i>[unclear: manni-]</i> <i>[unclear: house]</i> caused me to abandon my position. My opinions however remain unchanged, &amp; were I in your position, I would prefer a sale of the whole. I fear, if you return the home place, you will be harrassed during life, &amp; have a struggle to get on &amp; educate your children. I never thought the home a durable one for you, &amp; were I in your place I would still let it be sold. If it went for a moderate price, you might buy it. if not, let it go, &amp; look elsewhere. Property must fall, &amp; you can do better with this money six months hence. You will find it a troublesome. and in ordinary times, an unprofi table thing to carry on such a farm. It would be better to have a less costly home, &amp; the surplus money in production stocks. You would then be certain of a revenue even in case of a failure of crops. A small farm sufficient to furnish your own supplies, with the balance of your money at interest, would be better in all respects.</p> <p>You had better come up on Monday, &amp; qualify as guardian for your children. Come to my office &amp; I will have every thing arranged so that you will be detained but a few minutes. you can then go to our home to dinner &amp; return, if necessary, in the evening.</p> <p>When you come up, we can talk matters over, more in detail</p> <p>I think <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Bell had better file a bill &amp; let Judge Thompson settle the matters of the estate both real &amp; personal</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Affectionately yours &amp; c</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart">Alex H.
