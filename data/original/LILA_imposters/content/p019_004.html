I have written to you since then, from New Market, &amp; hope my letter has come to hand before now &amp; cheered you up some - I am truly sorry you feel so despondent &amp; take so much "<i>[unclear: though]</i> for the morrow" - I am sure I could cheer you up if at home, but you must "fear not but trust in Providence &amp; remember that the Lord has always provided for us &amp; promises that the seed of the righteous shall never be forsaken" We have been here now three days - found the Yankee pickets at Strasburg, our cavalry, drove <u>them</u> off &amp; we moved some infantry &amp; Artillery to the top of a hill &amp; shelled a brigade the Yanks had on picket &amp; made it scatter every way, then opened on one of their camps &amp; they ran from <u>it</u> pell mell, leaving everything, they then advanced some troops across to the hill we were on, not knowing that we had infantry there &amp; our men met them &amp; drove them back with considerable loss - we captured <u>65 prisoners &amp; killed</u> &amp; wounded a good many - among the killed was Col. Wells who commanded the Yankee force that came up the Valley last winter - we had 22 killed &amp; about 120 wounded - since then no action has taken place, each party looking at the other &amp; wondering what it was doing. The prospect seems bright in every quarter - things get along well at Richmond &amp; Hood has surely made one of the boldest movements of the war &amp; must be successful if the half that is said of his army is true -- in fact we have always gained by taking bold measures &amp; if Sherman is compelled to leave Georgia there will be a great revulsion of feeling in the North -- &amp; peace sentiments will be in fashion again. Connecticut appears to have gone for McClellan -- we are desirous of hearing from the Pa. election -- a lady from the West, who has lately come to New Market, says the West will go for McClellan, &amp; Price is doing much in his favor by occupying the larger portion of Missouri -- I hope you may be able to get some wood for present use -- I intend to get home before long &amp; attend to the hauling &amp; cutting up of a winter supply -- I shall be able to get fodder enough &amp; I will put one horse into my pocket if I can do no better. I am sorry Mr. Geeding got offended, for I thought the government would impress his hay &amp; he would be just as willing to let me have some of it but no matter -- he has done much for us &amp; I have no right or reason to complain of him -- I asked you about Capt Sterrett in my last did he have time to go to Richmond? I do not need my clothes &amp; prefer that you keep them at home -- I am sorry you were disppointed about coming over to camp, but I knew our movements were very uncertain as I wrote you -- I do not know what we will do here -- I will write often -- Write soon -- Love to the children -- &amp; may Heaven bless you all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> Husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
