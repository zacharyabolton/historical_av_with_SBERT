Harlow are in Richmond at the Hospital &amp; that George was getting along very well, at that time.</p> <p>he is there with a first rate fellow &amp; I know if he was to get worse he would either write to me or the Captain about him, though I think it strange that he don't write back to some one of the company. but it seems if they just get away from the company that they never think worth while to write back to let any one know anything about them. I thought yesterday of writing to him but we had to turn out in honor of Old Whiskey Barrrel (Gov Letcher) so I did not write. I think I will write a few lines to him to day, but I have been looking for him to come to ever day for three or four days. Well I must bring my letter to a close, tell Mary that I will write to her in a day or so, Good bye, may God bless you all, </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Aff Brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Bunk</p></div> <!---->
