I have just written to Allie &amp; hope to be able to send it in a few days -- I have told her plainly not to bring her sister with her, for she would not meet with a pleasant reception &amp;c &amp;c -- as I told you I would -- &amp; have advised her to come on by Winchester -- I wonder if Frank has had to go out under the last order calling out all "detailed men." -- Write me. It seems hard my Dear to call out the detailed men, but the next 6 weeks determine our fate &amp; every man <u>must</u> come out for that time &amp; do his duty -- if they do all will be well &amp; they can then go home in peace &amp; stay there with safety -- see what the reserves did at Saltville &amp; so they can do everywhere until this emergency is past -- <u>All</u> must put a shoulder to the wheel &amp; roll on to the end of <u>this</u> campaign &amp; I feel that the <u>end</u> will then come -- Our <u>men</u> in the field have lost none of their <u>accustomed courage</u>, their <u>leaders</u> none of their accustomed <u>skill</u>, but our ranks are depleted by the many bloody battles of this mighty campaign &amp; we must have our lines lengthened to oppose those of the insolent foe that has added thousands upon thousands to his from every household in the North -- The enemy is determined to do all that <u>numbers</u> can do this year &amp; we <u>must</u>, <u> <u>shall</u> </u>, &amp; <u>will</u> meet him with even numbers -- no even as figures tell it, but every as moral courage &amp; unconquerable will tell it -- So say for me, to all that they <u>must</u> cheerfully come <u>now</u>, and in two months <u>all</u> will be well -</p> <p> I have written to Maj. bell to attend to Jordan's case &amp; think it will be properly cared for -- there will be no getting off now I think -- hope so any how -- I have got Charlie here -- had my black horse stolen -- he is doing well -- I may sell him yet -- hope to get some more supplies for you and some things to trade on. I spoke to Reed to see about 20 gallons of molasses when at the lowest -- you can see him -- I shall send William home to cut wood &amp; prepare for winter &amp; hope to be able to come &amp; attend to it myself -- </p> <p> Everything here wears a cheerful aspect, notwithstanding the reverse of last Sunday -- Rosser drove the Yankees down to Fisher's Hill, killed &amp; captured a large number, got hundred of cattle &amp; sheep; wagons &amp; ambulances -- but there the Yankees massed all their cavalry -- on him -- 3 Divisions on two small ones &amp; charged him &amp; compelled him to retire rapidly &amp; his artillery horses were so <i>[unclear: jaded]</i> they could not pull his guns out on the rough road he was on &amp; the enemy captured them, but they got but few <u>men</u> &amp; he reformed &amp; drove them back again -- after they had forced Rosser back they massed on Lomax &amp; served him the same way and with the same result -- Our cavalry all of it that was there -- did its duty &amp; if the thousands that are improperly away had been their it would not have happened -- I trust we shall get an opportunity to retaliate -- Gen. Lee achieved a great success at Richmond on Friday &amp; Mosby played havoc with two trains the Yanks sent up the Manassas Gap <abbr expan="Railroad">R.R.</abbr> They say Capt. Sam Chapman prayed over 50 of the Yanks that he sent to their long home in retaliation for some killing they did at Front Royal -- Sam is the 2<u> <u>nd</u> </u> in command with Mosby -- I am glad Nelly has resumed her studies &amp; I hope Anne has too -- they must be very diligent -- Mrs. Strager here gave me a good warm pair of gloves -- I suffered terribly from cold hands last Sunday -- It is very pleasant now -- Get all your flour &amp; eatables home as soon as you can -- get Mr. Reed to get a Bbl. of flour from Mr. Smith -- for you -- Pleasant dreams to you -- &amp; may Heavenly blessings descend upon the heads of all the "loved ones at home" -- Write soon -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
