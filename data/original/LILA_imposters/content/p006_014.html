Since the action of the convention, handing the state of Virginia over to the confederate states, without the knowledge or consent of the people, like a lot of herds or slaves, the excitement in N.W. Virginia, is becoming most intense, and indeed, in some quarters, terrible. How is it in the Valley? Will the proud and chivalrous sons of old Augusta submit? The clamor here for a division of the state is becoming loud and universal--I fear it will become uncontrollable. What should be done? The crisis demands the the counsel of the wise &amp; the patriotic. May we not ask your advice? I should be greatly obliged by a line from you.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very truly yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
