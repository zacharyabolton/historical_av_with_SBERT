Lawson's</u> handwriting, forwarded by you to Mr. Whipple <abbr expan="October">Oct.</abbr> 8 has been sent here for <u>recognition</u>. Some statements are palpably and some inferentially untrue and did it not reflect upon the present condition of schools and lead to a possible supposition that my application for aid in fitting up the room here was unnecessary, <del hand="h1">I will</del> <ins>should not, as I <u>must</u></ins> say the letter is written by Mr. Tukey and is only a continuation of the <i>[unclear: undermining]</i> operation which the schools here have had to contend against from the same source. In fact, "the house" was rented for school purposes at $25 per month because there was <u>no place</u> in which to teach school as the church building spoken was <u>not even roofed in</u>. Through the influence of Mr. Brackett, seconded by yourself the <abbr expan="Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands">B.R.F.&amp;A.L.</abbr> appropriated $300 in aid on the condition that the building aided should accomodate all scholars in Staunton. <i>[unclear: Promises]</i> were fairly made but when Mr. Bowser, the <i>[unclear: co'd]</i> presiding elder came to Staunton he candidly told me that under no circumstances would he permit the use of the church upper room for school purposes, nor ever <ins>give</ins> an assurance of continued possession of the basement (which <u>only cost $150</u> in addition to the contract) for school purposes if I paid over the $300 which I of course declined to do. The basement has not been <u>fitted up even yet</u> and when the estimable ladies who have left, taught a <u>pay</u> school <ins>after the close of regular session</ins> which of course was small <i>[unclear: compared]</i> with a <u>free</u> school the room was unfit to accomodate any orderly school, but when school was talked of for the winter and I applied for the room the Trustees, induced I expect by the writer of the letter in question, asked $15 per month and would not <u>fix up for a school room</u>. Feeling that after the church had <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> $1,000 from the N. <abbr expan="Methodist Episcopal">M. E.</abbr> conference and repeated aid from the Bureau and Teachers, I proposed to expend $100 in fitting up the room to be occupied <u>rent free</u> <u>for the season</u> which they refused, and took no steps to fit up at all. The parents of the children began to complain bitterly, many claiming they had subscribed their money for a school house, not a church. Mr. Brackett came here and a meeting was called which I attended with him and laid the case so strongly before them that the Trustees were shamed into doing something and agreed to give the room free if I would get them $100 to fit up, which thanks to you, I have obtained from the Bureau and I expect to have the room ready for permanent school on Monday <abbr expan="October">Oct.</abbr> 21. The $60 alluded to was begged I believe in aid of the main building if used for a school but (as I with the $300) they properly refused to give it to a church who would not <u>encourage</u> even a school. The conceit spoken of was got up at great labor by the Teachers and the money raised which was a mere trifle expended for <u>school</u> but not <u>church</u> purposes. The <u>real</u> writer of the Lawson letter did not even attend the concert nor has given a cent or even an hour labor in Sabbath school. The <u>real object</u> of the letter is not to aid the cause of education but to bring Mr. Scott here under <abbr expan="American Missionary Association">Am. Miss. Assn.</abbr> &amp; through him employ Mrs. Tukey and Miss Dunn as Teachers. To accomplish this "financial" desideratum every effort has been made and if fair means were used or good would result I should gladly say "Take the work". We have now 112 scholars registered for Miss Rowells school a number she cannot possibly control but I cannot recommend that Mr. Scott or any one who would bring back the "old regime" be sent to aid her, as the <u>joint</u> work would certainly prove unpleasant and so far unprofitable.</p> <p>I fear my letter to you may offend Mr. Brackett and I trust it will be confidential <u>except</u> in so far as it may affect your opinion of my application for aid, and even by inference reflect upon the active, conscientious and able management of Mr. Brackett or his teachers.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Faithfully yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>Thos P.
