Time is all a besieging force of appropriate numbers needs, &amp; that time has been given in a great measure. M<sup>c</sup>Clellan's reconnaisances have been sufficiently complete for more than a week or ten days, to admit of definite plans &amp; arguments, doubtless now in course of prosecution. Except the battle of Seven Pines, we have read of no engagement near Richmond, &amp; I am satisfied the Yankees have not been idle. I am forced to conclude also that the "Seven Pines" is wholly without other than moral effect. The Yankees were doubtless somewhat worsted, but its <ins>effect</ins> bears such a proportion to the fate of Richmond, as a skirmish among <i>[unclear: picquets ]</i> to an impending battle between <del hand="h1">opposing</del> contiguous armies. I am also so perfectly satisfied that the Confederate <ins>generals</ins> have already done, &amp; are still doing everything that can be done in the premises, as to make that fact an important consideration in my conclusions. If they could have done so, they would certainly have before this joined battle in full force, &amp; thus <ins>have</ins> adopted perhaps the only means of saving the city. Whilst I am writng this may have already been done, but we heard nothing of it.</p> <p>I know you have mourned with me over the losses of our regiment at Lewisburg. My first information was that poor Thompson <del hand="h1">was killed</del> and <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Patton's brother were killed, and that Rand was left lying in the field with a broken arm. These things shocked me greatly, &amp; I have been greatly relieved to learn that my information was not correct. We have though to mourn some <ins>good</ins> men, <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieu<u> <u>t</u> </u></abbr> Tom Mason formely "orderly" of Barker's <abbr expan="Company">Co</abbr> was killed- he was a very worthy man. <i>[unclear: Capt ]</i> Chase &amp; <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieu<sup> <sup>t</sup> </sup></abbr> Johns (formerly 1<sup> <sup>st</sup> </sup> <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieu<sup> <sup>t</sup> </sup></abbr> &amp; orderly) of Lipscombe's <abbr expan="Company">Co</abbr> were also killed, Except one of the privates Chenning) of the Riflemen these are <ins>all of</ins> the fatal casualties I have learned Thompson's <u>other</u> eye was badly shot, &amp; being badly stunned by the Shock, he was left for dead upon the battle field - Rand was <ins>not wounded but</ins> taken prisoner in Mason Matthews house - I am glad of it - he will now at least be out of danger &amp; can see his friends. - The regiment is said to have behaved handsomely, they had the post of honor (the right flank), &amp; drove the enemy before them as far down as Mason Matthews house; the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> repulse &amp; flight of the left made it necessary for them to retreat but they were so far in advance, as to make their escape with great difficulty, &amp; not without severe loss as the Yankees had nearly closed in behind them. I get this information from <abbr expan="Captain">Cap<sup> <sup>t</sup> </sup></abbr> Ruby who has recently written me. You <del hand="h1">have</del>may have heard it long since - I have a warm affection for <del hand="h1"></del> the regiment, &amp; whilst I rejoice over their gallantry I deeply mourn their losses</p> <p>I can tell you little or nothing <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> of news here, On Sunday <del hand="h1"></del> cannonading was heard here. On yesterday morning (Monday) I heard with great distinctness heavy cannonading, very frequent &amp; somewhat continued - We learn the fight on Sunday was Ewell's force with part of Jackson's old command, engaged with Fremont &amp; Rosecrans' forces between Port Republic &amp; Harrisonburg. On yesterday Jackson fought Shield's near Port Republic - Shields came up the Valley from Front Royal on the East side of the South Fork of Shenandoah, &amp; the battle took place on that side - Jackson attacking. To tell the results of these two engagements is a different matter. I hear that the Confederates were victorious in both, - the following are some of the accounts. The rumour before the fight on Sunday morning was that Jackson &amp; staff had been captured at their headquarters (this was false of course) - Sunday evening "Enemy <u>badly whipped</u> took 18 cannon" "Enemy <i>[unclear: do]</i> took three cannon"-<del hand="h1">Monday morning" Ewell whipped Fremont</del> "Enemy <i>[unclear: do]</i>" took every thing Shields had" (Shields army at that time not engaged) - Monday morning "Ewell <del hand="h1">whipped</del> &amp; whipped &amp; routed Fremont"- &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c Monday evening "Jackson routed Shields, Shields retreating &amp; blocking the road behind him" - Last evening late it was reported Fremont was crossing the North river at a ford between Port Republic "The Valley Turnpike, &amp; it is certain that the bridge across the river at Port Republic was burned by <del hand="h1">--- Jackson ---</del> the Confederates - A victory followed by the <del hand="h1">retreat</del> falling back of the victorious army, &amp; the destruction of the only bridge left in the Valley, is certainly not a remarkable success. The bridge you will see by reference to a recent <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>, across Middle river just before its junction with the South fork of Shenandoah river. Ewell fought somewhere along the road from Port Republic to Harrisonburg, &amp; must have fallen back for he would scarcely have burned the bridge behind him. An additional fact is <ins>that</ins> sick &amp; wounded &amp;c are being removed from Staunton by order of Jackson - it is also said that Jackson received a regiment or two reinforements on yesterday, &amp; more are expected to-day. These are reports which have reached me distilled through many brains &amp; lips. You can study them for yourself I can draw no conclusions</p> <p>I have abandoned all hope of receiving any letters from my wife &amp; sister. My efforts to get them aided as I have been by kind friends have been <i>[unclear: unavailing]</i>. My family have not heard from me either. The Federal officer at Charleston burned my last letter which reached them <ins>in February</ins> <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Patton thought the last which I wrote improper &amp; did not feel authorized to send it - on neither side therefore have we received letters for many months. The short letter I have received from my mother who seemed too much affected to write news.</p> <p>My kindest regards to all of your family &amp; believe me very truly</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Isaac N Smith</p></div> <!---->
