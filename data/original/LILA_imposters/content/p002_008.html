I went with Uncle David last saturday after his cattle They have been doing very badly - he has lost two or three. The Thresher has just now come and will finish the wheat this time. We had a <u>big</u> snow last night but it has nearly all melted already The limbs of some of the trees were bent to the ground It was a fine sight this morning. Uncle David has gathered all his winter apples - has about 30 bushels of bellflowers. I expect he will have more than 200 bushels in all.</p> <p>I believe I like Geography the best of my studies Sister likes Arithmetic best. I think Lillie can memorize the quickest but I dont know which can recollect the longest Uncle <abbr expan="David">D</abbr> has gone to attend Mrs Tate's sale today I am at the 27<sup> <sup>th</sup> </sup> question in the Shorter catechism.</p> <p>There are 50 cords of wood hauled for winter.</p> <p>Give my love to all of them at home.
