Hamie &amp; others said the river was too full to ford, &amp; there would be no mail the next day. I did not like for my letter to lay in the Office until Saturday Evening so I did not send it over, but thought I would watch for Mr. Jones in the morning &amp; if he went give him the letter to mail at SpringHill to my utter surprise &amp; great disappointment he left sooner on that morning then he has done since carrying the mail. I was so sorry, &amp; grieved about it that I have not felt happy since, &amp; if Jim had been here I would have sent the letter to you. You must not be angry with me or think that I no longer love you, &amp; if you could only know how deeply I was grieved, &amp; disappointed by you not getting my letter, you would never think unkindly of me. I did wish I could see you &amp; tell how it was. I hoped &amp; looked for you Saturday &amp; Sunday. when the horse &amp; buggy came without you &amp; Magnus, the disappointment was so bitter that I cried all the morning I was lonely&amp; truly miserable, because you did not come &amp; my letter was not sent. I knew the roads were bad, but still I wanted you to come. Oh! how Earnestly I did wish for you to come it seems that I never felt more anxious to see you then this time you did not come, &amp; my heart ached under the disappointment it was so hard. I wondered what you would think of me for not answering your last dear letter, &amp; if you did not come it would be so long before you could know how it was, &amp; all that time would he think unkindly of me I only hope you did not blame me. If I did not love you I should tell you so &amp; not treat your dear, &amp; welcome letters with indifference. Icould not be so unkind to one I had loved so devotedly as I love you. the neglect was not caused by any change in my affection for you. You are the same dear &amp; beloved object of my heart, &amp; thoughts, just the same only if possibly more dear, for the past four days of suffering by not seeing your dear face &amp; what you would think of me by not getting my letter taught me how necessary you are to my happiness, &amp; how keen the anguish would be for me to give you up, &amp; your precious love. I feel in the deepest recess of my Soul that I love you only with a love that I never gave to living man before, &amp; cannot love another as I love you, &amp; nothing but death can take it from you, &amp; then I will love you in Heaven, for I am trying with God's aid to live a life He loves, so I can go to that Land of rest when called away from Earth, &amp; my loved ones, &amp; My daily prayer</p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
