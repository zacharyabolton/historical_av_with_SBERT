After suffering, more than I should be willing to inflict upon you in a communication, or otherwise, I made my escape through the lines.</p> <p>I am a native Virginian, and after the suppression of the Rebellion, returned to Staunton (Augusta County), at which place I became connected with the Bureau <abbr expan="Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands">R. F. &amp; A. L.</abbr> as <abbr expan="Commissioner">Comr.</abbr> or agent, on the part of the Freedmen; and also clerk for Mr. F. S. Tukey, then <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> of that Sub-<abbr expan="District">Dist</abbr>. After the Freedman's Court was abolished by orders I was connected with the <abbr expan="United States">U.S.</abbr> B.C. at Staunton. Upon the completion of the work returned to Richmond where I have attempted to resume my profession (I am a teacher of Music) but owing to the fact of being well known as an uncompromising Union man, having been connected with the Bureau, and having testified before the "Reconstruction Committee" (to which I beg leave to call your attention) I find it <u>totally</u> impossible to make a support for myself and child at my profession on account of the direct and indirect influences operating against the interests of loyal men. Having no means I have no resources but to seek employment in some branch of the <abbr expan="Government">Gov</abbr>.</p> <p>In view of these circumstances, General, I herewith respectfully make application to you for a clerkship or any situation in your gift in your <abbr expan="Department">Dept.</abbr> where I could be useful and derive a support for myself and child.</p> <p>I refer to Mr. F. S. Tukey, <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> in Caroline County, <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Lahea <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> at Farmville, Prince Edward County, and will present the <i>[unclear: endorsation]</i> of loyal citizens of Richmond. I will have certificates from <i>[unclear: Messrs.]</i> Tukey and Lahea in a few days.</p> <p>I take occasion to say General, that I should not have intruded thus upon your time, but for the circumstances of my case, and the <u>urgent</u> necessity of employment.</p> <p>Trusting to the kind consideration of this communication, at your hands,</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am General,<br>With Respect<br>Your <abbr expan="obedient">Obt.</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Srvt.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Wm.
