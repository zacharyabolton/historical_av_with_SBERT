I spent part of the four noon of this blessed day at our little chaple; Thare was a large congregation all seemed to pa strict attention to the word of life; oh how I do wish all our soldiers would become pious men I am sure then our armies would be invincible I sometimes think your brother is trying to be a better boy. I pray I may be right for I hope to see him a true christian I nead not ask you to make him a special object in your secreet communings for I am sure you do; Thare is no news in camp worth your attention. Evrything is quiet as far as I know The wether has been very inclemment for the last two weeks; first snow then rain my darling Kate you said your face could not ware a joyous smile, untill you could behold my face, Cheer up my ever faithfull one I hope the time will soon hasten round when we may meet, But I pray the not to put off smiling untill I come, but rather try &amp; be cheerfull &amp; hapy darling I am sorry that my last letter brought with it sorrow to thy noble heart; God knows I would not purposly give the trouble. Would that I ware so situated that I could say to the idle of my heart lean upon my <del hand="h1">heart</del> arm an I will support the through life with a willingness that would now no end. That dream of yours oh that it was a reality I'me my hapine<ins>ss</ins> would be compleat, Often in my nightly slumber you are by my side &amp; I wake finding my arms around my friend Trot -- oh! Dear Kate I fear you have some clue that will be injurious to your kind sisters hapiness in the future I would be sorry if anything should accur to cause her to be sorry for her change in life. I have heard rumers but I hope thay are al false My wish is that she may be hapy throughout her days, You need not look for me this summer without sickness or the Yanks give me a furlough. The detail I was at home on counted as a furlough I would be sadisfied if I was sure you ware hapy, Abe told me you desired me to direct your letter in the care of your friend Rachel I think we had better continue to direct as we have in the past for if your parents shuld ever find out you were corissponding with me in a secreet way thare anger would be increased against both of us while they do not positivly object we had best write openly dear Kate what can I do to alleviate your troubles, I love you yes passionately &amp; if you think you have ever treated me rong I forgive thee, &amp; will if you will permit love and cherish <ins>the</ins> more than I ever did, I believe my own coldness brought on our troubles about but I believe they will <ins>be</ins> a blesing to us both I am sure it has drawn thee nearer to me, I can only say speed on sweet day when I may meet thee. I must soon close My health is very good &amp; I hope this may find you enjoying the same with ceerfull spirits. Give my love to you sister &amp; write soon It is getting so dark that I can hardly see how to write I have not hurd from Bro. Charles only by your letter Sister is well She desires to know your name I will give it to her in my next letter, Now may the blessing of a great &amp; good God be with you</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>from your true friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Willie</p></div> <!---->
