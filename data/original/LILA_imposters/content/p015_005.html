Of pleasure at hearing from you that you were still in the land of the living, though not well; of pain that you thought that I had neglected you and had written something in my letter that grieved you, some unspoken but hinted at complaint of your doings, none of which things I had intended and it made me know at once that you are sick and all things wear a sombre hue with you. I have written several times, as often as I could find time in the constant marches of our army and yet now when quiet I find myself more busy than before, but I wrote to you a few days ago and the letter is with you before this and I do hope you are all better before now. I want to come and see you with my own eyes; handle your hearty welcome with my own hands, and know for my own satisfaction of the brother love I bear to you and yours and how you are really and truly getting along; how the world is using you and see if I can do anything for you and may be cheer you up some from my constant expectation of good and disposition to draw good out of everything, but enough of this. You know that I feel towards as a brother in all things and wish to say and do as a brother and so shall not give heed to any clouds that may for a time come over the sunshine.</p> <p> We have had an excellent fast day observance throughout the army; had an admirable sermon by Mr. Lacy at our headquarters on the hilltop on a beautiful lawn. A congregation of some 1500, including Generals Lee, Rodes, Johnson, etc. The text was from 2nd Kings 6th 16ths. He administered rebuke where necessary, spared none from the highest to the lowest and drew a fine argument to show that God is certainly on our side because the conduct of our army and people is, in the main right, while the conduct of our enemy is such that a just and righeous God could not approve. He called upon each one for himself to become good for himself, rectify his own errors and so the whole people become good, and then we may ask for God's blessing as his own people. I can but think that good will come to us from this day; good everyway, and from this day we may date the renewal of success.</p> <p> Our men are being nicely clothed and shod and will soon present a nice appearance; a uniformed army. The Commissariat of our army is in fine condition too and today the soldiers had roasting ears issued to them, a barrel to the hundred men, and that much is to be issued daily while the roasting ears season lasts. There is enough to eat. The bugbear of starvation has fled; the enemy has cruelly said that they would starve us and Heaven answered them with blessing our land with abundance. We fasted until a 6 P.M. dinner. We had roasting ears, tomatoes, potatoes, good light rolls, and beafstake, a good enough dinner for any one and so fare the soldiers now while we are resting, and it is well it is so for the times of privation always come when marching and fighting begin, as begin it must, although there are no signs now of any movements and a profound quiet reigns everywhere, the enemy having retired further away.</p> <p> I hope you succeeded in getting in something to eat and do not have to buy at the horrid prices now prevailing. A change must come before long in some way, no one knows how, but it is sure to come.</p> <p> I am glad you advised Miss Allie as you did, but I might have known that you would have given her good advice. I agree with you entirely in your views about what she had better do. I have asked her to come to my house and stay and she is welcome to if she will and will be welcomed there if she will only think so. </p> <p> I hope to hear from you in a few days and then will be able to tell if I can come and see you all and I shall come if we stay here.</p> <p> I fear the change of water has had a bad effect on you all but hope you are getting used to it. Remember me very kindly to the family, Harriet and Lora and Sarah, the grownup family and Elmer and Ollie and Neddy and Styles He the little mischief, has no doubt forgotten me.</p> <p> I wrote to Father a few lines while in <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> My kind regards to Dr. Young. I should like to see him playing farmer. Be of good cheer. Write to me soon. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your affectionate brother,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
