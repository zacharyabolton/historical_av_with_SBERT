I think you are all getting too slack about writing home. we would like to have a letter at least once a week Mr <abbr expan="William">W<sup>m</sup> </abbr> Wright has been home on a furlough. he and his family were down visiting their relations. They called and Mr Wright said you were very well when he left. He expected to start back last Thursday. Henry Wright started Wednesday night to Staunton with his wagon He is to take a load of provisions or clothing to the soldiers in the Western part of Virginia, I suppose. There was also a great many soldiers started from there this week. Mostly Tennesseeans, between 3 and 4,000 for the Western parts, under command of Ex-Governor Wise The Augusta <i>[unclear: Lee]</i> Rifles has gone also to protect our State from her enemie's the thirteenth company from Old Augusta. There is a company trying to be made at Newport, an independant company to go where there is danger or stay at home to be regulated by the vote of the company. It is thought by some that it is most to fair, for of course the greater portion would rather stay at home, at least some, unless they get more patriotic than they are now. There had about 30 joined it the last I heard of it. The militia are now mustered every week. They have not yet been drafted in Augusta I expect if they are there will be considerable additions to volunteer companies <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> <i>[unclear: Hutchens]</i> paraded his company yesterday evening in the little fields of ours back of the weave shop it appears the Newport fields &amp; lots are all in pasture &amp; cant be mustered in. The <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> I think does tolerable well now but the company -when such mustering I actually believe some dont know right face from left. <u>General</u> Sproul was to have been to see them muster but did not come The Newport boys have formed a company, they call themselves Southern Guard so I have heard. We were sowing two days last week at Newport making pants for the soldiers There was a pair cut out and <u>marked</u> for you It was said they were for the Southern Guard but I believe there was pants made in Middlebrook for them so we dont know who will get those that were made at Newport The Ladies have been makeing clothing and tents for the Brownsburg troop who lost their clothing at Phillippa. The wagon started to day It is to be hoped their defeat <del hand="h1">it</del> will be a lesson to our troops to be on their guard. I have no time to write any more as the mail carrier has gone by and I wish to send this to day if possible </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Write soon and often Your affectionate sister</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mary Allison</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>June 18</p><sup>th</sup> <br> The mail haveing gone before this was taken up, I sent and got it again and will write more. We received the letter you sent by <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Hite Saturday evening I did not expect that he would have gotten home so soon and was quite surprised Saturday to hear he had. It is just two months, last night, since you left home. A long two months it has appeared to us. I do wish you could come home on furlough. The signs of the times dont appear to be in favor of getting home for good. I think as you do that some of the militia ought to be in the army especially those that say they can whip five northerners. Last Thursday was fast day appointed by the President it was more generally kept here than such days are commonly kept it was almost as well observed by some as the Sabbath there was very little work doing. How did you Spend the day. Mr Adam Yago is to be married next Sunday if he can get ready to a Miss Deniza Smiley there is some difficulty about it though she is not of age and a certificate is needed from her guardian which he expected with <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Hite but was disapointed I reckon people know now why he was so much against going to camp as I guess he had an idea at the time. From what I hear camp life is not very funny after all at least the substitutes &amp; others in the Brownsburg Calvary think so now I suppose you are pleasantly situated at Sheppardstown if the people there are still as kind as when you went to meet that bogus enemy</div>
