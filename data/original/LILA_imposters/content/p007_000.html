Clarke of Halifax wishes you to send him a barrel of your best Whiskey, care of I. Pannell Shockoe slip Richmond--send the very best--Nothing was said as to price--</p> <p>You have doubtless seen with pleasure that Wm. Stuart has distinguished himself at Bethel. I understand that he was especially complimented in the official dispatches.</p> <p>He is very much in want of a horse. How would our young Brown Mare answer? If she will do, let us give her to him--If she will not, then let us get one that will suit, &amp; send him to William. Get Byers or some good judge to buy one.</p> <p>The weather is awfully hot here. I have rarely felt it so oppressive--We cannot tell how long our session will last--Possibly we may adjourn next week--possibly not for six weeks. I should be delighted to get away.</p> <p>What of Placo? If he comes down, send me a few bottles of best whiskey for my friends here--</p> <p>I have not <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a line from home since I arrived here. The Post office seems to be abominably managed.</p> <p>I paid a visit to Toombs a few nights ago--the other dignitaries, I have not yet seen--I will call on them after a while.</p> <p>Troops are constantly coming on, but not as fast as I could wish--The enemy are in great force, &amp; augmenting their strength daily--We have no news today--There will be big battles before long--one is expected near Yorktown, &amp; there will probably be one at Harpers Ferry or Manassas Gap.</p> <p>My Committee on Constitutional reforms met last night--I think they will sanction substantially, my recommendations with the exception of election of Governor by the Legislature. They prefer the election by the people--I hope before the convention adjourns, we shall have a good constitution.</p> <p>We have a most miserable spirit prevailing in the Convention--a spirit of carping &amp; bitter hostility to Letcher--Such men as Harris, Ambler, Garnett seem disposed to assail him on every frivolous pretext--Their purpose is to organize a party of extreme men to monopolize the offices! They are a sorry <i>[unclear: creed]</i>!</p> <p>I hope you will write some &amp; let me know how every thing is getting on.</p> <p>Love to Sandy &amp; any of my folks who may be with you.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours affectionately</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Alex H.
