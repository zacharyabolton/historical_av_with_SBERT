I conducted a <abbr expan="colored">Col<sup>d</sup>.</abbr> Sabbath school in the village for one year or more, ending at <i>[unclear: X]</i> May but having a white school on my hands found my duties too heavy &amp; was reluctantly constrained to suspend it for the time. The work was an interesting one &amp; about 15 white teachers engaged in it. <abbr expan="Number">No.</abbr> of pupils might be set down at from 40 to 90, average about 50. I am met almost daily by the former pupils with the question when is the school to begin again? The Negro's never have had a school here, except this Sunday school. I <abbr expan="request[ed]">req.</abbr> about 4 to 500 primary &amp; other books from the <i>[unclear: tract]</i> society &amp; other sources, for the use of the school, during its existence the <abbr expan="colored">Col<sup>d</sup></abbr> people did nothing scarcely toward keeping it up. Those who might have <abbr expan="served">serv<sup>d</sup></abbr> as teachers seemed to take little interest in &amp; had to depend on white teachers alone. I think a school here could be a good enterprise - a day school, the whites have no prejudice that I know of against day schools. I know they look with <i>[unclear: approbation]</i> on Sabbath schools as most of <ins>our</ins> young people &amp; some old, took a hand as teachers from time to time.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><i>[unclear: Respy ]</i></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>William Cithrow</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>No day-night or Sabbath school now operating in this part of the county to my knowledge.</p></div>
