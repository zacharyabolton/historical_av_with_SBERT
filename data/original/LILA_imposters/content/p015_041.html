They also got our advantage in position at Kelly's ford &amp; so drove our men from there &amp; then crossed in force as we came back to a line of battle -- about 3 miles from the <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> -- and there we waited all day yesterday for the enemy to come on &amp; although we only had a tolerable position they advanced very slowly, &amp; as Gen Lee did not like the position for a fight and intended to come back to Orange Co. anyhow we broke up camps &amp; came back last night to our old quarters, where I found the Gen -- when I came from home.
