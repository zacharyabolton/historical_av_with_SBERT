S. Tukey, <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst Supt</abbr> Freedmens Bureau at this place it gives me much pleasure to say that I have been intimately acquainted with Mr Tukey for the last twenty years. I was at Portsmouth <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> during the whole of the time that he was <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst. Supt.</abbr> of Freedmen there which according to the best of my recollection was about twenty one months and during the whole of the time was in the service of the U.S. Government and had in my employ about fiftly colored men nearly all of whom drew rations from Mr Tukey and being then as I am now and always have been an ardent friend of the oppressed colored people I was much among them and not only them but all their Teachers and consequently had a great opportunity to learn their sentiments with regard to Mr Tukey, and can say that he was universally beloved and respected by all parties.</p> <p>I left there soon after the surrender (on account of sickness) and went to <abbr expan="Massachusetts">Mass</abbr> where I remained until the first of last <abbr expan="November">Nov.</abbr>, when I came to this place and soon after received the appointment of US Inspector of Spirits and have as in Portsmouth mingled freely with the colored people both publicly and privately sometimes speaking to them of Mr Tukey, and they invariable spoke in the highest terms of him and I never had heard one single word of complaint against him by anyone until <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> <abbr expan="George">Geo</abbr> T Cook was relieved from duty here and nothing since only what I have reasons to believe come from him. I have known since I have been here of a greater degree of intimacy existing between Cook and a Mr. Graham of the Burial Corp and two of the female Teachers then what a sence of propriety would allow and am satisfied in my own mind that these charges against Mr Tukey are malicious and originated with and have been made by <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> Cook or the said Graham acting as his agent, and have been skilfully carried out thus far by a combination of these four persons.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>George W Partridge<br>U.S. Inspector of Spirits<br>6th <abbr expan="District">Dist</abbr> <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr></p></div> <!---->
