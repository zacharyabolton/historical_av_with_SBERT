The day is spent &amp; now, after retiring to my room, I must write you a few lines, though I have not heard from you for some time, owing to my scouting propensities of late, and not being much in camp -- I have been spending two days on the memorable Kernstown battle field, mapping it &amp; the vicinity. It was the first real battle field of The Valley, and, therefore, aside from its other memories, it has a peculiar interest to the dwellers <u>between</u> the mountains. I traced with sad interest the wondrous line of march of one regiment that regarded not the fire of artillery, but went on to its post of duty, and the position of another that met &amp; repulsed the pursuing foe &amp; by one dreadful volley sent a hundred of them to eternity and let but one of its own brave lads accompany them to the judgement bar to tell why it had thus sent them there I gazed long upon the bloody ground where the fight raged so hotly for the possession of the stonewall &amp; where at least 500 Yankees poured out their life's blood for no good reason but a vain effort to subdue us -- but I hope to be able to show you the finished map and tell you of the incidents I have heard from many mouths -- It has been cold and rainy and I have not had a very <u>pleasant</u> time, but I have been well housed at night &amp; well fed and therefore have been better off than many of my companions in arms -- and as I am very thankful to the God of all goodness and grace that his care has been such for one --</p> <p>I today saw a gentleman from <i>[unclear: Moorefield]</i>, an uncle of the Moslin boys, he says they are well, have been working on the farm at home -- Mr. Moslin stays on the farm nearer the Valley as he wishes, to have a good start if the Yankees get after him as he is a cripple -- The paroled Rich Mt. men of Hardy are now gathered at McDowell under the command of Capt <i>[unclear: Momare]</i> Imboden wants to get them for his force -- he has done good service -- he made a dash and destroyed a <abbr expan="Railroad">R.R.</abbr> bridge a few days ago &amp; burned many stores, capturing some prisioners, the Yankees got after his wagons, led by a union man, and took them while he was gone, burning two, but he retook the others. Gen. spoke of him in high terms. He was at my tent a few days ago &amp; brought the Spectator -- it looks oddly -- I shall probably go to Winchester tomorrow if it does not rain, and shall then strike up the Valley again in pursuit of information -- where I may stop is more than I can now tell. I hear many things, once out of camp, about Stuart's going into <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr>, an advance of the Army &amp;c but I do not attach any credit to it, for I only left Thursday noon &amp; all was quiet then -- but good night -- <i>[unclear: D.V.]</i> I will write in the morning</p> <p> Monday Morning -- It is still raining and I am remaining in the house waiting for a change of weather to enable me to continue my ride -- Every thing quiet but the moan of the wind -- and the thought that will intrude as to when the war will end, peace come to us with all our rights secured and each one be permitted to sit down under his own vine &amp; fig tree &amp; enjoy a quiet life -- such weather as this inclines one to such thoughts I have hired the sending of my bundle to Staunton &amp; hope it has gone -- I have a pair of shoes for Allen in my saddle bags -- hope to get them to him soon -- Excuse my short letter -- I am dull &amp; cannot write -- Love to all -- Kiss the babies -- they must be good -- Allen must do all he can -- to merit good shoes</p> <p> God bless you all -- write often -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
