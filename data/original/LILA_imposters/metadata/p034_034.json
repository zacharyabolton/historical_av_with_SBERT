  "summary": "Dewey provides a summary assessment of her early activities as an AMA educator in Staunton. She highlights the tenuous relationship between John Scott and the \"superintendent\" of the black \"Sabbath\" school and explains her desire to establish a sewing class. She also discusses her efforts to create support for the AMA's educational mission through frequent visits to black families in the community. [Davison provides the incorrect date for this letter. It should be January 1, 1869, not 1868.]",
