  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to Orlando Brown, September 30, 1867",
  "summary": "One of the issues Jackson discusses in his monthly report concerns the ease with which white employers defraud free blacks, because blacks are not yet sufficiently educated to keep records pertaining to their employment. Jackson also notes a rise in complaints related to physical assaults against women. The letter also discusses relief for the poor, the ineffectiveness of the judicial system, and the need for religious and moral education among former slaves.",
