  "title": "Augusta County: Malcolm Fleming to Fleming's mother, August 10, 1864",
  "summary": "In this letter, Fleming discusses recent orders, recounts the burning of Chambersburg, tells of recent battle experience, reviews strategy, mentions life in camp, and describes the experience of being captured by \"Yankees,\" after having been turned in by \"the negroes.\" Fleming also writes about encounters with local citizens. Unfortunately, the letter has a large number of illegible words and sections. Nearly everything after the first few paragraphs should be considered \"unclear.\"",
