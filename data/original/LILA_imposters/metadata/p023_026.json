  "title": "Augusta County: C. E. Dewey to Samuel Hunt, January 31, 1866",
  "summary": "Rather than provide a formal report for the month of January, Dewey offers Hunt what she terms a \"written chat about matters + things in Staunton.\" Among the many issues discussed, Dewey elaborates on her large class sizes and the laudable attendance record and behavior patterns of her students. Commenting on Southern whites' changing perception of the freedmen's schools in Staunton, Dewey argues that though the AMA teachers are \"without military protection we have had no trouble + I think the feeling towards 'Nigger Teachers' the little which we have the honor to receive, grows less bitter every day.\"",
