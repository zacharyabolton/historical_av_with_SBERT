  "title": "Augusta County: Oscar J. C. Stuart to Alexander H. H. Stuart, August 8, 1859",
  "summary": "Oscar Stuart's letter to Alexander Stuart conveys very poetic sentiment regarding the death of Alexander's son and the nature of human suffering. He also asks Alexander to relate what he knows about Oscar's two grandfathers on the Stuart side, so that he may confirm the family's stories about their exploits in the Revolutionary War. Oscar Stuart then writes at length about \"sectionalism\" in Virginia and the poor state of national politics in general.",
