  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to John A. McDonnell, April 30, 1868",
  "summary": "Jordan files his first report as the Bureau's agent in Augusta and Highland counties. His initial observations reflect much of what Jackson reported in earlier reports, including the reluctance of freedmen to use the courts to settle claims against their employers. Jordan notes that there is surprisingly little drunkeness in his Division, and that the schools appear to be flourishing.",
