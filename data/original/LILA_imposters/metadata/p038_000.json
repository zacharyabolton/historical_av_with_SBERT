  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to Orlando Brown, June 30, 1868",
  "summary": "In his very detailed report, Jordan states that he tries to avoid the adjudication of disputes involving freedmen in the courts because of the pervasive prejudice in the system. He recommends the establishment of military courts that would have jurisdiction over blacks and other \"loyal\" citizens, so that they would be able to receive fair trials. He also calls for the extension of the Bureau's tenure, and an increase in its powers to work against opposition to the government.",
