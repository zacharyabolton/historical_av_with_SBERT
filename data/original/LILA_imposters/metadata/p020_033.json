  "title": "Augusta: D. C. Snyder to Rachel Snyder, March 15, 1865",
  "summary": "Snyder writes to his wife, telling her that they had to move camp suddenly due to a Union advance towards Staunton. He writes at length about how he is most concerned about her reputation and asks that she have a woman, rather than a man, accompany her if she wishes to travel to Richmond. He asks her to pray that he himself might overcome the disgraceful temptations of camplife. Snyder rants about undeserving officers in the army and suggests that a negative \"revolution\" in moral character is also afoot in the land. He discusses his children briefly and expresses his hope that they can see each other soon.",
