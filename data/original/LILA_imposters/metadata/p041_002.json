  "title": "Augusta County: John Scott to E. P. Smith, January 1, 1869",
  "summary": "Scott discusses the infighting among Methodists in Staunton, arguing that he had initially been ill received by a prominent black minister in the town because he was suspected of supporting a rival congregation. He states that he strongly disagrees with the teachings of this particular pastor, specifically the \"doctrine that now the colored people are free they should become independent of northern aid.\" In the closing sections of the letter, Scott reports that there is \"much drinking among the negroes\" and vows to organize a temperance society.",
