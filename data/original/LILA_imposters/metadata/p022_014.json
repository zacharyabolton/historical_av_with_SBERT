  "title": "Augusta County: William L. Coan to Samuel Hunt, November 4, 1865",
  "summary": "Coan begins his letter with a discussion of his recent journeys to Woodstock, New Market, and Harrisonburg, arguing that a mission team should be sent to Harrisonburg, a community where he claims \"Rebellion\" is \"deeply seated.\" He notes that there \"are Lutheran Churches scattered all along this Valley,\" and argues that a representative from that denomination might be best fit to begin work in Harrisonburg. Excited about the prospect of new schools in Staunton and surrounding communities, Coan exclaims, \"I have seen no place where Educational influences are more needed and demanded than in this Valley. We owe it to the Rebels that we throw in the Northern \"Yankee\" Christian Element here.\" Though hopeful that Northern aid might quash the social injustice associated with \"Rebel\" rule in the Valley, Coan criticizes the \"Bureau\" and \"Mr Beecher\" for \"doing much to encourage these Rebels in their course\" and for \"doing much which tends to discourage the real Unionists at the South.\" In one passage of the letter, he refers to the Shenandoah Valley as the \"Valley of Humiliation\" and a \"sink-hole of Iniquity.\"",
