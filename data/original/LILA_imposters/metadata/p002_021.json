  "summary": "Writings (perhaps a speech) by an unknown author, consisting of reflections about the year 1865 and the feelings surrounding the \"parting of schoolgirls.\" Several large pieces of the paper are missing, including a rough square about 3\" across by 1.5\" high on the bottom left of the first page; this, of course, means a similar section is missing on the second page, which is truly the back of the first. A long strip seems to have been ripped off of the bottom of the final page.",
