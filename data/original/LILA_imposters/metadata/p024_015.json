  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: Emily Rodney to Orlando Brown, April 2, 1866",
  "summary": "Emily Rodney writes to protest her being barred from preaching to the black population of Staunton by Frederick Tukey and the Freedmen's Court. She writes that the people should be free to worship as they choose, and complains that she was not given a proper hearing. The attached endorsement by Tukey states his side of the case, in which he argues that Miss Rodney was undermining the unity of the community.",
