  "title": "Augusta County: John Scott to Samuel Hunt, March 17, 1866",
  "summary": "John Scott begins his missive to Samuel Hunt by acknowledging that he is a bad speller. He apologizes for his imperfections, but he maintains that his frustrations with spelling make him even more eager to correct bad habits in his students' writing. Scott then transitions into a discussion of the condition of his school, arguing that the warm weather will certainly draw students out of the classroom and into the fields, making it necessary to reorganize classes. He adds that the teachers are tired and in need of a vacation, having worked diligently for many weeks.",
