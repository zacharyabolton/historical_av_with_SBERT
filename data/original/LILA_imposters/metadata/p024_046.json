  "summary": "Dews asks for remuneration for the services he has performed for the Bureau in Augusta County. His letter mentions his own loyalty to the Union cause, and the difficulties it has caused him. Dews actual position in Staunton, was as magistrate on the Freedmen's Courts, but attached endorsements to his letter indicate that he received very little money in fees from the court, and was paid by the Bureau at a clerk's salary.",
