  "title": "Augusta County: Henry A. Wise to Alexander H. H. Stuart, February 8, 1869",
  "summary": "Henry A. Wise, former Governor of Virginia (1856-1860) and Confederate brigadier general, writes again to Alexander H. H. Stuart. In a recent letter (February 2, 1869), Wise requested that Stuart confirm the report of a speech recently given by Stuart in Staunton (see the Valley Virginian, January 28, 1869). Stuart's comments appeared to be critical of Governor Wise. This letter is a reply to Stuart's response (February 5, 1869). Clearly put out with Stuart, Wise explains his own actions and warns Stuart to \"seek better company\" the next time he visits Washington, D.C.",
