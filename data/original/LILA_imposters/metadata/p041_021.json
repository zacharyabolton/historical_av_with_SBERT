  "summary": "Alexander H. H. Stuart responds to the recent letter of Henry A. Wise (February 2, 1869), who requested that Stuart confirm the report of a speech recently given by Stuart in Staunton (see the Valley Virginian, January 28, 1869). Stuart supported the \"New Movement\" seeking to accept black suffrage in order to restore peace in Virginia. His comments appeared to be critical of Governor Wise. Also see Wise's response (February 8, 1869).",
