  "title": "Augusta County: Clinton Hatcher to Mary Anna Sibert, May 18, 1861",
  "summary": "Clinton Hatcher uses the laws of logic to excuse his break with etiquette by sending \"Miss Mary\" a friendly letter without first securing her permission. He recounts the last days of his trip away from his home in Loudoun County and comments on Virginia's mobilization for war. He reveals that his community plans to organize a home guard for which he has been offered the captaincy and for which he wishes he could obtain one of her father's pistols.",
