  "title": "Augusta County: Mary D. Williams to Samuel Hunt, March 2, 1866",
  "summary": "In his missive to Samuel Hunt, Williams makes an interesting assessment of the character of blacks in Staunton, arguing, \"Having been conversant with freedmen in other parts of the state I hesitate not to say that the colored people here are not only far superior, by nature, to those in eastern Virginia, but have already made greater progress in knowledge than was made there in two years after their schools were first established.\" In the final paragraph of the letter, Williams praises John Scott for his efforts to assist freedmen in Staunton.",
