  "title": "Augusta: John D. Imboden to John Marshall McCue, February 1, 1881",
  "summary": "Imboden responds with scorn to McCue's suggestion that he put money into a venture to claim $50 million that the Confederacy supposedly stored in Europe. He reminds McCue that the Confederate Government had no money in 1864, and notes that the U.S. Government would no doubt claim the money for itself if such a sum existed. Finally, he suggests that rational businessmen see plenty of economic opportunities in the natural resources of the southern states but would not be interested in searching the \"vaults of a defunct, starved out, naked & ragged psuedo nationality.\"",
