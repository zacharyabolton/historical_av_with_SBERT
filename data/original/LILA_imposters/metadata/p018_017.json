  "title": "Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to Hester J. Nadenbousch, August 10, 1864",
  "summary": "Nadenbousch writes his wife Hester who is despondent over being left alone and without domestic help. He cannot come home and stay because he refuses to take an oath of loyalty to the Federal government and fears arrest. Instead, he has hired an Irish servant girl for Hester, and will send his slave Louise if that does not work out. He discusses moving Hester and the family to Staunton as a third option, even if it means loss of property to the Federals. He cannot get out of Staunton to visit home because of the shifting battle lines. Nadenbousch also discusses financial matters.",
