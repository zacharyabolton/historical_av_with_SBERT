  "summary": "Waldo's first monthly report as the Agent in Augusta and Highland Counties talks about the deceptive behavior of white employers when settling labor contracts, and he labels such practices \"unmanly, ungenerous [and] outrageous.\" He also mentions that almost no preparations had been made to make schools ready to open at the beginning of the fall term because the local black communities lacked resources and outside help was rare.",
