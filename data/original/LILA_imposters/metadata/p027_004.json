  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: Garrick Mallery to Orlando Brown, March 7, 1867",
  "summary": "Mallery reviews and considers the available evidence pertaining to the various accusations against Frederick Tukey. He concludes that there is no firm evidence to point to fraud or dishonesty on Tukey's part, but recommends that due to his lack of organization, and the fact that his reputation has been damaged beyond repair, that to allow Tukey to continue on as Bureau agent would further damage the Bureau's standing in the community. Mallery also concludes that the counter accusations raised by Tukey against George Cook and several female school teachers merit further investigation.",
