  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to R. M. Manly, October 17, 1867",
  "summary": "Jackson writes to Manly about a conflict between the Bureau and its school with the Methodist Episcopal Church in Staunton. Jackson alleges that Frederick Tukey, the Bureau's former agent in Staunton forged a letter and made unspecified claims about the current condition of schools there. Jackson refers to Tukey's tenure as the \"old regime\" and urges Manly not to appoint any teachers associated with Tukey, including his wife. The letter also discusses in some detail the conflict with the church about the allocation of space for a school room.",
