  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: John A. McDonnell to Orlando Brown, December 31, 1868",
  "summary": "McDonnell submits his last quarterly report to Bureau headquarters in Richmond. In relation to Augusta County, he mentions the persistant problems with contracts and the efforts to defraud free blacks. But he also notes the progress made in education, and the decline in intemperance. McDonnell closes his report with some pessimistic observations about the fate of blacks once the Bureau is dissolved. He writes: \"after restrictions are removed the colored people will be again reduced to servitude for a compensation of the coarsest food and clothing.\" He also commends General Brown for his work in the Bureau.",
