When I left home I thought perhaps<br> I would have returned before this; but instead of that<br> we are getting further away and I hope gaining an im<br> portant victory for the Confederacy. Our division of<br> the army was pretty quiet on Saturday and Sunday, but<br> a pretty hard battle occured Sunday evening, to<br> our right, on the York River Railroad about eight<br> miles below Richmond. <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Hills division was the<br> principal one engaged. Early this morning all<br> Jackson's troops crossed the Chickihomany and all<br> the army are following up the enemy; for I should<br> have stated that he was again whipped on<br> yesterday. We crossed the battle field <del hand="h1">on</del> this mor<br> ning! There were many dead and for miles the coun<br> try <del hand="h1">wa</del> is strewn with knapsacks blankets over-<br> coats and various other articles. Squads of prisoners<br> have been coming in all day and probably five or six<br> hundred have been captured. I saw <del hand="h1">five</del> about three<br> hundred <ins>captured</ins> horses and mules this morning. The enemy<br> have crossed a stream fourteen miles below Richmond<br> and blown up the bridge, and heavy cannonading<br> has been going on this evening across the stream.<br> Time is important for them in order to get<br> commisary stores out of the way. If it were not for his Gunboats McClelland might find some dif<br> ficulty in finding a place of rest on Virginia's soil.<sup>[1]</sup><br> We havn't seen our wagons for five days and have<br> lived principally on hard bread and havn't been<br> particular about clean sheets or the abundance of<br> our covering. It is now about sundown and I<br> will stop; but probably add somthing more before I<br> mail it. </p><p> I have just heard that <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Newly will leave the<br> army in the morning and <ins>will</ins> write a few lines more<br> and give it to him to mail. Four of our boys have fallen out <ins>of ranks</ins> complaining; Strickler <sup>[2]</sup>, Two My-<br> nes<sup>[3]</sup> and Meade<sup>[4]</sup> <ins>also Tom White <sup>[5]</sup> </ins> but I hope they wont be much unwell.<br> I suppose you all are engaged in harvesting. Crops<br> are rather light in this part of the country. <i>[unclear: S]</i><br> leaving Gordonsville we have passed through a<br> miserably poor country; sometimes passing for<br> five miles through flat piny woods. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Love to all.</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Affect son Charles</p></div> <!---->
