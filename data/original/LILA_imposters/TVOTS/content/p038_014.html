This is evident from the enthusiasm at the nomination of of Seymour &amp; Blair. Not because of any particular admiration they have for these candidates or any special love they cherish for the democratic party but simply &amp; only by reason of the fact that the Republican party is the friend of the colored race, and the supporter and defender of the Federal <abbr expan="Government">Govt</abbr>. So strong is this conviction fixed in my mind that I believe the mass of the Southern whites would indentify themselves with any party or any people if by doing so they could destroy the Republic and thus accomplish by chicanery or political villainry what they failed to consummate by the sword.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am General<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="obedient">obt</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Svt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jno W.
