I respectfully ask enquiry be made for her husband, or friends, and if it appears she can be bettered by removal before bad weather that transportation or aid toward it, be furnished for Martha and her two children, hence to Winchester.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Your obedient servant">Yr. obt servt</abbr></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thos P.
