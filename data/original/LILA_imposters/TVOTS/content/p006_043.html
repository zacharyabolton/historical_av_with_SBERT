As you had been so kind as to write so regular before and not receiving a word from either you or Charles it was natural for me to feel some anxiety on your account especially as you said in your last letter that you had a bad cold - I feared you were sick and that alone caused me great uneasiness. But as I heard from you I feel more composed and am happy to hear you are well as also Charles - Your letter found us all well at home as also the neighborhood. There is no news of any interest transpiring here now. Every person old &amp; young Man Woman and children being anxious to hear the news from the army of Harpers Ferry and other points. We are full of excitement and prayers are daily &amp; hourly offered for the preservation of our brave soldiers. The Election passed off very quietly &amp; old Rockbridge although formerly <u>Union </u>is now so thoroughly <u>Secession</u> that to find a <u>Union</u> man would be a wonder. There was only one vote in the County for Union and that was <i>[unclear: Zach. White]</i> in Lexington, let his name be <i>[unclear: offered ]</i> to the Four Winds, to meet that contempt it deserves. There was a Pennsylvanian living at <i>[unclear: Millbors Tunnel]</i> by the name of <u>Strunk</u> who voted for the Union ticket and boasted of it, defying the Community in which he lived - he was seized, and well <u>decked</u>, then ordered to leave within 48 hours which prudence and a whole hide prompted him to do by the next evening. There is another in Jail in Staunton - an officer of Lincolns Army, he formerly was tanner at Brattons and then Merchant at Millboro - he left his wife, having married her over about Middlebrook, a Miss Thomas - he came back under pretense of visiting his wife, but for the purpose of a spy - was nabbed - and would have been Lynched - but the Civil Authorities placed him under charge of the troops now stationed in Staunton where he now is. It is not known what will be done with him but it is presumed he will get his deserts. His name is Edward Randolph.</p> <p>Every person is putting his <u>house</u> in order around here so that when called by our Governor they will be prepared to take up arms in our Common defense. Our Crops are looking <i>[unclear: finaly]</i> better than for some years so that Mr. Lincoln will find it about as hard to starve us out as it will be to whip us into terms.</p> <p>I was up to see Sallie on Yesterday, <u>Sunday</u>. Poor Sallie is lying upon a bed of sickness, she is very sick but desired me to send her love to you and also to request you to write to her as she would like to hear from you very much, she has written to you, did you get her letter. I have also written two letters to you and you have never said whether you received them or not. let me know when you write again. <i>[unclear: I recd]</i> your letter containing the ring which was duly appreciated, and had thought that I had mentioned it to you in a former letter. And my Dear son that ring calls to mind another thing that I wish to make inquiry of both you &amp; Charles. It may happen as you both are now about to be engaged in mortal combat that I may never see your faces again and what I wish to know what disposition you had made about your business. Whether you had settled it up before you left home. Your <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> clothing and other property you each of you left behind in whose care have they been placed and what was to be done with them. If it should please an overruling providence to take you from me, being your Mother and nearest of Kin; and who feels more for you than any other person possibly could do. I wished to know where they were, so that in the event of your fall I could take possession of them and so keep them, as to perpetually remind me of my own brave sons. I don't want you to think I am too fast or avaricious to obtain what little you have possessed <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> my dear sons. It is no more than <i>[unclear: what]</i> others have done and being your Mother think that if any person is to have them she ought and if any person could take care of them she could. I therefore wish you and Charles to give me a list of all the things you left behind you: so that if you never return, I may know where to find them and what to receive. And also what business you left unsettled. Tell Charles I am sorry he has neglected to write to me for this span of time, he can write to others. I think his mother is or ought to be worthy of an occasional letter from him at least. When you write I want you to tell me how you are all situated, how you are getting along - and if you are brought into an Engagement to write me forthwith if alive to do so. Abraham &amp; all send their love to you. As well as your friends in this neighborhood. I hope John you will write as often as you can, once a week at least, if you can write oftener it is the only consolation I have, and if you knew the distress of mind I was in by not receiving a letter from you for 3 weeks. I know you would write often &amp; punctual. I also wish you and Charles to send me a lock of your <u>hair</u> I thought I had some but upon examination found I had none, don't forget if you please. Well my dear son I will close hoping to hear from you soon &amp; often. With my prayers for your safety &amp; Gods blessing upon you both I will stop for the present</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Affectionate Mother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M.
