I am also led to believe that the troops are taken from Bath and Highland Counties in which case it would be simply useless to attempt the maintenance of agencies there.</p> <p>In the counties last named there are but few freedmen and their relations to the Whites generally <i>[unclear: restrictive]</i> and <i>[unclear: obscure]</i>. In Botetourt they are in larger numbers and need instruction and protection and I again call attention to the fact that Botetourt County may be best superintended from Lynchburg.</p> <p>Overseers of the Poor are generally unable or unwilling to provide for pauper freedmen and in common with other local authorities appear to be awaiting some supposed action of the State Legislature which may, if in accordance with their wishes and expectations, enable them to exhibit their <i>[unclear: patent]</i> (state) law-abiding proclivities.</p> <p>Partial issues of subsistence are thus rendered imperative, and fuel is now necessary to relieve and prevent great suffering among the poor freedmen in this cold mountainous region.</p> <p>I have received from the Freedmen's Aid Association in Philadelphia a considerable quantity of clothing which I have been and am distributing among the poorest of the freedmen to their sensible relief, returning their heartfelt gratitude to the donors.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Colonel<br>Very Respectfully, Your Obedient Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
