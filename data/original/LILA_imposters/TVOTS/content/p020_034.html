I have left it in Farmers Bank with Mr. Lo. Norvell. I think you had better come here &amp; complete the Moddle &amp; take it <abbr expan="Richmond">Rich'd</abbr> But I have assertained that you can do nothing with the government or any one else unless we can furnish the metal for its manufacture. I can get up a large company here if we can furnish the mettal. So I think you had better go to Oronoco at once &amp; put things through there &amp; then start the gun nearly at the Armory works in <abbr expan="Richmond">Rich'd</abbr> are stopped for want of mettal. Some very wealthy men are anxious to go into the iron business at Orono we get the iron &amp; then we can go ahead with the gun I would have written to you sooner, but have been worked half to death by gen'ls in &amp; around Lynchburg ever since I parted with you. Keep me acquainted with your movements In haste</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly<br>Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>A.
