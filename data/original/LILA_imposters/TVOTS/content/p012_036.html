I doubt not, as the two armies are fronting each other &amp; not more than 3/4 of a mile apart, the enemy on this shore of the Rappahannock &amp; on the bluffs on the other side while we occupy the the first terrace, this side of the river, which is wooded and varying from 20 to 150 ft. above the river bottom, which is about a mile wide, our line of battle is about six miles long, our troops in fine spirits and confident of success -- our Generals, seemingly, trustful &amp; confidant also - - There was no fighting but skirmishing yesterday &amp; artillery, but a tremendous conflict must come today, I feel quite certain. What my fate may be I know not, I can only trust in a merciful God, whose favor has never forsaken me -- and hope for his protection --. May he grant us victory, and may it be the means of of bringing peace to our destructed land --. If it should be my lot to lay down my life for my country's cause I can only hope that God &amp; my country will befriend you and my children, my only legacy, I am sorry to say so, will be a father's blessing, and, I trust, an example they need not be ashamed of -- I will not send this until after the day has passed --</p> <p> I have many articles here that belong to me -- mess chest &amp; utensils - - maps &amp;c -- which Nelson will have to come for if I should fall --</p> <p> God grant I may do my duty to my country and to him -- And may he bless you &amp; ours for his Son's sake </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Affectionate husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
