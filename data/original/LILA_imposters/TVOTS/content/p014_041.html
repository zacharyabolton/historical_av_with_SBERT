I want to hear from my many friends in Frederick- how they are getting along- what they are doing, &amp;c., I have written several letters to my Frederick friends since the Yanks left, but have not received even a line from them. not even sister Becky has thought it worth while to write. And I now hope you will do me the kind favor to answer this by return mail, and tell me how &amp; what you are all doing, &amp;c, I heard that Becky was married; but am still at a loss to know if it is true. Please excuse this short letter, as my candle is almost gone. We are all well, &amp; hope this may find you the same. Give my love to Uncle James &amp; Lizzie, your Ma, and all the rest. &amp; <u>reserve</u> <u>a</u> <u>good</u> <u>portion</u> for <u>yourself</u>. I will try &amp; give you a long letter if you will answer this. Are you most married? I will try &amp; come down to Frederick next Winter. I received the other day a letter from my dear friend Jennie Ritchen of Clarke County. I am anxious to see her. Tell my sister that she is very bashful about writing since she is married. Well I must close- please excuse this miserable letter &amp; return me a letter next mail. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly your sincer friend,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.H.H. <i>[unclear: Frenger]</i></p></div> <!---->
