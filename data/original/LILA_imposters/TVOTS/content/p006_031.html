We are now upon the extreme boundery of the Southern Confederacy with nothing to divide us from the Black Republican despotism but the broad waters of the Potomac. How I wish that we were on the other side and in full march upon Washington. We are in camp at this place constantly expecting an attack. We have thrown out two picket on the river with instructions to fire into man or vessel which refuses to answer hail. I was stationed in one of the pickets last night about 1 O'clock the sentinell called us up on account of a suspissious craft which was enterring a small creek near us. We were in the highest state of exultation at the idea of a fight atlast. I still suffer from my foot but I hope that it will be well soon. We suffer some inconvenience of course as what soldiers do not. But so long as my arm or mylife is necessary it is at the service of my country.</p> <p>I gave all of my valuable papers to Annie to take care of. And feel confident that they are perfectly safe.</p> <p>Hoping all are well I remain your affectionate son</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John">J.</abbr> H.
