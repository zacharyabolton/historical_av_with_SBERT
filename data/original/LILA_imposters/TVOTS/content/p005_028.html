We had for the time, to give way -- <i>[unclear: Gradually]</i> however we gained strength, &amp; now I think the conservative party is in the majority &amp; will be able to prevent any further mischief -- It will now be for the people to decide what shall be the character of the convention to be elected on 4<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="February">Feby</abbr>.
