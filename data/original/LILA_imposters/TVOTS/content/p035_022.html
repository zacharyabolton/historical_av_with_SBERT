It pleases me to have you say you love home pleasures for they are indeed The sweetest of all Earthly joys not many are thankful enough for such happiness &amp; would rather be any where elsethen at home. I know you would be both thankful &amp; happy &amp; prefer your fireside &amp; the society of an intelligent, &amp; loving wife <del hand="h1">wife</del> to all other enjoyments. you would not spend your Evenings any where but at home, reading while your wife sewed &amp; if tired listening while she read to you, with your <u>eyes</u> <u>shut</u> you would forget all the busy outside world, thanking God for the great blessing he had given you.
