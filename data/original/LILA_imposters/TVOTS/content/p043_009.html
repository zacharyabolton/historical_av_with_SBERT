Doak <abbr expan="deceased">dec</abbr>, a deed for which was made by Nancy Doak Rosannah Doak and Elizabeth N. Doak to Robert Doak dated the 12th day of January 1831 recorded in the <abbr expan="Clerk">Clk</abbr> Office of Augusta County Court in D Book No 52 page 505. The Estate held by then was for life and at the death of the last Survivor descended to the next of kin. We do not seek or desire litigation, but only ask what the law entitles us to, and am willing to accept a fair equivalent for the land in question. If you will have the matter properly looked into and get Counsel competent to advise, you will see that our position in the matter is right. Please let us know your determination so we may act accordingly.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Alcinda J.
