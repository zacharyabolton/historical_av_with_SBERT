It is Sunday morning, we have had a sermon, a morning lesson, from Habakkuk &amp; all but myself have gone over to the churches, I remain to attend to anything that may need attention, but all is quiet &amp; in war we are almost in profound peace -- in fact too much of ordinary life is becoming a part of our camp life, and the tendency to amusements is far to prevalent fortimes like these. But there are two sides to this question &amp; much philosophy &amp; some Scripture in the song "Let the wide world wag as it will, We'll be gay &amp; happy still" &amp; the text "There is a time for all things" &amp; "There is nothing better than for a man to eat &amp; drink &amp; enjoy the good of his labor". The Fast day was well &amp; solemnly observed, but yesterday there was a gay picnic, with music &amp; dancing, at Gen. Johnson's <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> -- to which all the officers of the Division &amp; the Corps <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> were invited, all but two or three went from here -- I did not feel like going -could not think so much gaiety right, though I am fond of rational amusements &amp; like the <u>cheerful</u> phase of things. I have been very busy &amp; have much to do just now, as the surveys of the country, from the parties in the field are coming in &amp; I am making copies so we may have a set of accurate maps for our use &amp; this long rest is a perfect harvest time for business, &amp; I cannot <u>now</u> see my leaving time, but shall obtain it before the winter that I mayprepare for it for you, &amp; have things comfortable fixed up -- (D. V.) Mr. Lacy <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> a few days ago a box of the nice English Bibles &amp; Testaments procured by Dr. Haze &amp; I got a set of the Gospels, four pretty little volumes, in flexible black covers, beautifully printed, for Nelly, as she is learning the Scriptures, they are very pretty every way &amp; then the dear child can have the satisfaction of learning a whole volume -- I shall send them when I can safely &amp; I have another set which I shall keep a volume of at a time to read, but send the others to you, in charge for my darling little Anna, whenever she shall begin to learn the Scriptures &amp; I have a nice Nonpareil Testament for My Dear Little Wife, which I think she will like, it is small &amp; plain, clearly printed &amp; has a soft &amp; pleasant cover &amp; I think will add a new pleasure to the reading of the Sacred Volume she loves so well --The weather has been quite cold for several days &amp; I slept cold last night for the first time in a long while, but such is a soldier's life. I have a copy of the Life of Jackson, which I wish to send to you though it is not very good &amp; not very entertaining to us that have read the living Man -- yet it has in it much to interest others -- Gen. Lee is still in Richmond, maturing something I suppose &amp; the cool weather will invite to action &amp; soon the horrid carnage of the battle will disquiet the eye &amp; sicken the heart. "O when will man cease to do evil? &amp; when, O Lord! will Thy kingdom come &amp; Thy will be done on earth as in Heaven -- I heard Harman wish to go home to-day &amp; infer that his wife is in an <u>interesting</u> condition -- Mrs. Ewell is still here, but do not think her presence is very good for the Old gent -- so says the Dr -- the "bold, bad man" as our Capt. Johnson says --</p> <p> I have no news my Dear -- my letter is very dull &amp; I am rather stupid myself so this letter will only be like opening the door &amp; looking at you, or rather letting you look at me &amp; then bowing myself out. Write to me, my Love, if only a little &amp; asking for "Heavenly blessings without Number" for all my little home circle, I will say good- bye </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
