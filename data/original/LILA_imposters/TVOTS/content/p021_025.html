Add those who will probably come, within a radius of five miles, and the adults who will desire to attend, and there will be not far from three hundred (300) pupils. I can furnish School rooms (in the upper part of the Court House now used by me for office &amp;c three (3) rooms) for one hundred &amp; fifty and can soon, as I expect to arrange for at least a hundred &amp; fifty (150) more.</p> <p>The colored people here are anxious that a school may be established, and I heartily second their desire. Winchester also presents a favorable field for efforts in their behalf. There are three hundred and seventy two (372) under 14, and a colored church that will accommodate about half of the pupils. Another church (colored) could be repaired for about $300 -- that would hold the rest, and in reference to which <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Brown has a statement forwarded by me.</p> <p>At Harpers Ferry I found a school of 40 pupils established by Miss Mann (sister of Horace Mann) and taught by her for four months under every discouragement illustrating heroic charity. She is about to accept a situation elsewhere, and was exceedingly anxious that the school should be continued, and would provide a teacher if desired. I promised that the school should continue. The present room will not do for winter, and as soon as I can get an officer to put on duty there, a place shall be provided - with you will rest the responsibility of enabling me to keep my promise.</p> <p>At Martinsburgh and Lexington smaller schools will be necessary as I think, and when I <u>know</u> I will write you.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully &amp;c</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
