I have been a resident of Staunton <abbr expan="Virginia">V<sup>a</sup></abbr> for the last fourteen years by my industry I succeeded in purchasing a lot here in 1861 before I could build on it the Rebel officials took possession of it in 1862 for a camping ground and in 1864 erected thereon a Barracks for their soldiers, which they occupied until the collapse of the rebellion. During all that time I received no compensation for its use. After the surrender of Lee I took possession of it and ploughed the lot up and planted it. I also put there 2,200 twenty two hundred feet of lumber for building purposes in May when the U.S. forces occupied this place they took possession of the building for barracks because <sic>because</sic> it had belonged to the Confederate Government. The result was that every expense and labor in the fencing and lot were lost. <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> T. J. Farnsworth <abbr expan="Assistant Quartermaster">A.Q.M.</abbr> also took possession of the lumber I had put there promising to pay me for it, but never did. Since July the 58 <abbr expan="Pennsylvania Volunteers">Pen Vols</abbr> have used it. The <abbr expan="Quartermaster">Q.M.</abbr> of the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> informed me that he had no authority either to recompense me for its use or give me possession of the lot, since they left I learn that the building has been turned over to the Freedmen's Bureau and as the building remains on the lot, I am still deprived of its use. I enclose herewith a deposition taken before <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Tho<sup>s</sup> Johnson Provost Marshall showing that I put the lumber referred to on the lot and also enclose a letter from <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Clay to the <abbr expan="Quartermaster">Q.M.</abbr> of the 58 <abbr expan="Pennsylvania Volunteers">Pen Vols</abbr> <ins>in relation</ins> to said lot.</p> <p>I am and always have been a Union Man and have been so considered <i>[unclear: such]</i> in my neighborhood. I have never been in the Rebel service nor any of my family.</p> <p>Hoping this will meet your favorable consideration.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr><br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="obedient Servant">obedt Servt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thomas Wholey</p></div> <!---->
