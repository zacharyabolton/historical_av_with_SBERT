Permit me in the commencement of my letter, to express my very high appreciation of the motives which promted you to give expression to those feelings of paternal affection, so beautifully &amp; affectionately set forth in your communication. Time &amp; again have I meditated upon our brotherly conversation in the "Cabell House" and have thanked heaven that such an opportunity was afforded me of giving expression to those emotions of love and sympathy for you &amp; your family which had been locked up in my soul for so long, I can now <del hand="h1">console</del> flatter myself that you canappreciate something of the feelings of that brothers heart, who has for so long been a silent observer of passing events--one who has thought much but said little, because he <del hand="h1">thought</del> deemed it far more prudent to remain passive,-occupying as he did, a neutral position, (You understand my allusions) Had I the time &amp; space to <i>[unclear: dilate]</i> upon this theme I might consume hours &amp; pages, but I must forbear.</p> <p>The late excitement occasioned by the foray of John Brown, &amp; his infamous coagators, is about to bring our school more prominently before the public, Owing to the disturbed state of the public mind &amp; the dangers that threaten the distinction of our once glorious honor, the citizens feeling the importance of fostering the military spirits now aroused, and of giving the <i>[unclear: growth]</i> of the country instruction in military <del hand="h1"></del> on last court day drew up a petition to the Legislature asking an appropriation to assistthem in establishing a military Professorship, in the <i>[unclear: Botelomt]</i> <i>[unclear: snule]</i> Academy,--beleiving that the prosperity &amp; usefulness of the institution would be greatly promoted thereby. which was signed by a number of the most prominent citizens of the county &amp; sent to their delagates, accompanied with a petition from the "Board of Directors," If the petition should be granted, we may expect a large acquisition to our school.</p> <p>9 of our students, members of a volunteer company, in obedience to Executive orders were in public service at Charlestown during the execution of <i>[unclear: Coppie]</i> &amp; Cook. If the said petition passes the Legislature the school will at once be converted into a military school. Wilson &amp; I will uniform &amp; take a regular course of military training. Since the excitement a large company of voulunteers has been raised inFincastle &amp; a Company of cavalry is now being raised, to which I belong I think it more than probable that I will be elected to one of the offices, as I have the reputation of being one of the best horsemen in this section of country, At the public meeting of which I spoke, there were a number of resolutions adopted similar to those adopted throughout the state,--declaring their intention to cut off all trade with the north to preserve the Union if possible &amp; if not to maintain our rights at the point of the bayonet. A number of warm &amp; eloquent speeches were made some were in favor of an immediate secession but the prevailing sentiment seemed to be that contained in the resolution adopted- which you will see in the Richmond papers- I for my part love &amp; cherish the Union, &amp; do wholy &amp; heartly endorse that sentiment of Webster "Union now &amp; forever, one &amp; unseparable" but if this cannot be," I am ready to should my musket at a moments warning &amp; die if need be in defence of my country's rights.</p> <p>I am sorry that the black does not suit you as a riding animal. I had not noticed anything like <i>[unclear: sting-salt]</i>, However I only had her 2 days before you got her &amp; of course did not have an opportunity of judging of her imperfections. Barefoot is regarded by several judges as being much older than she was represented to you She has been worked several times but did not work gently, Owing to the state of the roads &amp; the small-pox in Lexington I gave out my trip to Augusta, &amp; would certainly spend my holydays with you all, if the rail road between Charlottesville &amp; Lynchburg was completed. Nothing would afford me more pleasure, than to spend a week with you all. When that road is finished I will tavel that road home altogether it being the quickest &amp; much the most pleasant.</p> <p>I was in <i>[unclear: Sursterdam]</i> last week they are all well, but Lizzie &amp; Aunt Margaret are contemplatinga visit to Augusta next spring, &amp; will stop &amp; see you all on <i>[unclear: their]</i> way Aunt Lizzie often speaks of the pleasant visit she had at your house, when you were living in Staunton, Miss Mannie Turner &amp; Mr McDowel will be married next Thursday. Our school is still flourishing &amp; is in public favor, We have 36 scholars now (30 classical) &amp; expect an acquisition the first of <abbr expan="February">Feb.</abbr> We are now boarding at <del hand="h1"></del> Glasgow's, a very nice place indeed, have every thing that is necessary for our comfort.</p> <p>Give my love to sister Liz &amp; the children &amp; remember very kindly to Mrs Wills &amp; <i>[unclear: write]</i></p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Billy</p></div> <!---->
