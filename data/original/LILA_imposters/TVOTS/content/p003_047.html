I hope this bright morning, finds my precious husband &amp; dear little son quite as bright &amp; happy, particularly as the time is fast approaching when we must meet, a kind Providence permitting. Do take good care of yourselves, &amp; come as soon as it is possible. In my hurry to finish my letter yesterday I forgot to remind you of the whale bone split for my corset, which you must certainly get, if you can. Also, Donny's fishing hood, from behind the clock or on the mantle piece some where, &amp; I want you without fail to bring Mama as many duck eggs as you can, she is so anxious to have the Poland duck. Don't forget my cape at Mrs Staffords, &amp; Read // my first letter over, &amp; see that every thing is attended to. Mama joins in best love to you, my precious, &amp; dear little soney. Write what day to expect you.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your own fond wife,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Liz McCue</p></div> <!---->
