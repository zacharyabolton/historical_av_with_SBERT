We are preparing for another examination. What I would give if you could only be here to attend. This term has been what my teacher calls a "picking up term". That is we have been reviewing the lower branches, such as Grammar, Mental arithmetic &amp; Geography but which are in fact what I consider the foundation of a good education. Do you not agree with me? Miss Kellogg my dear good teacher has convinced me that I can be just such a lady as I wish to be and I am aiming to become a <u>brilliant</u> and accomplished young lady, although it is quite far off to anticipate <i>[unclear: this]</i>. Do not think me egotistical when I say that I shall be really <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> at the end of this term to think how much I have accomplished in nine months. There are fine girls in my class in Mathematics at the end of the term we will have finished Practical armithmetic, Mental arthimetic, Algebra &amp; one Book on Geometry, and be examined publicly on all of them. Miss Kellogg says she is very proud of us. I have <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> attended a series of very interesting lectures delivered by Rev. Dr. Leyburn on the Holy Land every one acknowledes him as very gifted and talented. I am perfectly charmed with him he has a kind and pleasant word for every one. Dr Petrie's health is very feeble. <u>Miss Essie</u> is quite well she asks about you very frequently. I see very little of Aunt Jennies family I am so constantly employed at school (very frequently we are compelled to attend school on Saturday) that there is little time left for visiting. I do not think they realize that dear cousin Joe is dead at times they seem very distressed while at other times they seem to forget. It is indeed a sad thought that we never shall see Cousin Joe on <u>earth</u> again, but we have the hope of seeing him in Heaven a brighter and happier home that his world of sorrow and temptation. Friday is my birthday. I shall be fourteen years of age, four years more to go to school and then we shall have to make a tour of travels through Europe. It would be <u>so</u> pleasant for you and "<u>Cousin Sophia</u>" to join our party. Father has concluded not to sell our place he has had an offer of ninety thousand dollars, but he declined this. Cousin James I wish to seek a favor of you Will you be so kind as to get me Gen. Jacksons <u>autograph</u> I have commenced making an <u>antiquarian</u> book. A gunboat is to be launched tomorrow. I am afraid we cannot attend as our teacher forbids unless we have finished every lesson by noon. We have a very difficult lesson for tomorrow, so I shall have to content my self with staying in school, I have much more to tell you but time does not permit. Do please write me a long letter soon, and tell me all about "<u>Cousin Sophia</u>" If it was not so very late I could write a very long letter. I never felt so much in the humor of writing Good Night Dear cousin and accept the prayers and best wishes of your devoted cousin</p> <p> M. W. Pollard</p> <br> <p> Cousin Katie and all of our little household join me in love to you. As it is not quite time to go to school I will write a little more. Mrs. Gen Johnsons is now in the city attended by <u><i>[unclear: ten]</i> men and sixteen horses</u>. three or four of the General's staff are with her every one called them Mrs. Johnson's staff. I became acquainted with two of them Lieuts Hampton and Washington. I saw them out at a picnic. It has been quite gay here this Spring since people have made themselves foolish about "Mrs Gen. Johnson and her staff" There are two charming young ladies residing in Montgomery who were originally from <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> they are twin sisters it is very difficult to distinguish one from the other. they always dress alike they are the Misses Smith. I wish you could know them. Well I suppose you are weary reading this unentertaining letter so I will close although I do so with reluctance. Again, I ask you please write very soon and you will greatly oblige </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours affectionately</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M.W.P.</p></div> <!---->
