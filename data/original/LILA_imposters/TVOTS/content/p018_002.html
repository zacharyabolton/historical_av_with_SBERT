Bell wrote to me &amp; said he had sent my bundle home -- I am glad it got safely there -- We left Strasburg last Sunday morning (today is Wednesday) met the enemy under Crook, (Hunter having been displaced) &amp; defeated &amp; routed them &amp; have pursued them across the Potomac at Williamsport -- capturing several Hundred, killing &amp; wounding a large number, captured some wagons &amp; caissons &amp; caused them to burn over 70 wagons -- they went in great confusion &amp; rout &amp; our infantry, some of it, marched 30 miles that day -- we had a hard rain at night which made it too dark to pursue &amp; so the wretches got away -- but they got a good threshing &amp; that too in the Valley where they had so misbehaved -- I saw Mr. Trotter &amp; he gave me an account of your troubles with Jordan -- glad they are over, but do not like the way it had to be done -- I hope he may get his deserts -- I have reported him to the enrolling officer at Staunton &amp; hope he will do something for him &amp; his son -- but do not say anything about it -- We had a fine rain Sunday night -- &amp; it kept on until noon on Monday I tell you it did a vast amout of good -- I hope you had a rain too -- &amp; that things are growing -- I have not heard from you for some days but hope to hear soon. I am in excellent health -- but get very tired marching as much as we do -- but I like it better than lying idle in camps -- We are now destroying the <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R</abbr> -- 5 days after they got it started -- send me a new list of little things you want for I have lost the one you gave me -- Excuse my short note -- for the courier is going -- Love &amp; kisses for you all -- Write soon </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
