I pronounce the charge utterly false. I can as I think satifactorily prove to you by all my near neighbors and men of as respectable moral characters as any in the county. I have also an old blackman who has been living with me for the last twenty years who will testify that I have never abused him in any particulars, on the contrary my great fault has been our indulgence. The boy last year done very badly. He got to running about at night + frequently not getting home untill late in the morning+ then would be so stupid as to he unfit for work. He frequently rode my horses without my knowledge or consent + for all. . . </p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
