I received the 2 papers sent me by some one of your town &amp; seen the Presidents Proclamations marked &amp;c &amp;c. I regret to learn the children have the whooping cough &amp; hope they will soon be well. you might get out now if they were well. I have written to you so much about coming out that I hardly know what to say more</p> <p>But let your understanding be this If you think it adviseable to move out, &amp; can make the arrangements to suit come on at any time you can. that is to come right &amp; comfortable and at any time you can before you move send out anything you can that we may want here. James Thomas might take some things to his house anything you may have bought &amp; want out get him to call &amp; see you</p> <p>We want some cups &amp; saucers yet &amp; cream jugs - white stone ware. I think we have most every thing else to start with. we will still want some sheets, pillar slips comforts &amp; Towls and a few small spoons. I think we have enough of large spoons. in fact we can use anything in the way of house fixtures and anything you may have send on, we can use it. We want Axes, butcher knives &amp; some knives &amp; forks but can start with what we have of them</p> <p>We will want any quantity of groceries &amp; spices we can get, Candle Moles &amp; Wicks, every thing here is scarce We have plenty furniture &amp; Mattrasses plates &amp;c but as to other fixtures you can judge what we will need. we will do with as few as can but if have a surplus can dispose of them to advantage here</p> <p>So at anytime you can get important articles in this way you get them. Collect all the money you can. I wrote you where to get fund<sup>s</sup>, which get when needed See Moses as I wrote him and you he can assist you</p> <p>I forgot to give you an idea of our house it is quite a large building built of brick of an L form 5 stories high has some 75 rooms &amp; the finest dining room I know of close to the rail Road but have but 3 trains a day here fine large stabling &amp; out buildings every person is wanting the house open. I do wish you <ins>&amp; the children</ins> were here with me it would be so much pleasanter than this way I think I could sell out now at $75000<sup> <sup>00</sup> </sup> seventy five thousand making 150,000<sup> <sup>00</sup> </sup> fixtures &amp; all</p> <p>If you cant get out <ins>soon</ins> I will try &amp; work along until you can come. you have never wrote me as to how you were whether allright or not why dont you write me about our private matters I am so anxious to hear from you and write so often &amp; you never write me al all Sometimes I think you want to take these friend<sup>s</sup> advice to you last summer to save the property <i>[unclear: Deoxxxx]</i> but I hope you will not be that cruel (but enough of this write me soon and say how you are &amp;c &amp;c &amp; how the little ones all are &amp; all about our private matters &amp;c &amp;c-</p> <p>I want to get 2 lace stockings for my leg &amp; will enclose a measure of the size &amp;c now who is the best person to get them for me Mary Kelley could get them but would prefer getting some person else. Could not C M Shaffer be got to get them you see him &amp; get him to get them for me They are knit out of silk <i>[unclear: gum]</i> thread covered with silk &amp; knit close like a stocking and to come up <ins>well</ins> to the thigh I wan two so I can have a change I did get two in Richmond but the gum was so old that it broke &amp; one is now almost worn out And if could get two good ones they would last at least one year &amp; be a great comfort to me See Henry he no doubt could get them readily &amp; will do it</p> <p>I learn the mill is taken possession of I do not know whether at a rent or not but can<sup>t</sup> you in some way get a rent for it: get Henry to do the best he can in the premises</p> <p>John I suppose is scared to death again he seems to be uneasy about the land &amp; what I owe him. I think he would like to have a deed trust on it which might save the property some &amp;c You think over the matter and write me what is best to do and in the meantime say to John he need not fear about what I may owe him he will not lose it I think I have plenty here to pay him if all else is lost but will be glad to secure him if can do it right tell him I will write him &amp; see what can be done in the matter</p> <p>Kiss the children for me and remember me kindly to all friend<sup>s</sup></p> <p>By the way remember me to M<sup> <sup>rs</sup> </sup> Baker &amp; tell her I would be glad to see her</p> <p>My love to miss Jane if you come out bring her along Schoppert &amp; family are well</p> <p>Tell Miss Jane to write to me if you cant &amp; to write if you do</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>As ever yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M<sup> <sup>r</sup> </sup> Nobody</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I enclose a pattern of the size of lace stocking before it is put on leg: a shade smaller or larger will make no difference <ins>rather smaller than larger</ins>. they are gumalastic &amp; will stretch Let them be about the general size of this pattern length &amp;c- if not so long no matter. I want two, 2, of same size in fact would not object to having 4. I find my other leg is getting somewhat the same way but quite slight yet This makes me feel like quitting service entirely &amp; coming home &amp; try to take care of myself Get Henry, Moses, or C M Shaffer to get them, or Mary H could get them but prefer a man getting them Shaffer would be the best person if think it prudent to ask him do so Or W</p><sup> <sup>m</sup> </sup> Riddle could get Dorsey to get them you know how all act toward my interest you can tell best who to select They will cost I suppose about $15 to $20 apiece. If you have not the money to spare ask Moses to loan it to me I am quite tired of this life &amp; sometimes almost determin<i>[unclear: d]</i> to quit pointedly &amp; work my way homeward. I am not fit to be in service &amp; if would not be asked to take an oath I might quit &amp; come home Most anytime What do you think of it (say)</div>
