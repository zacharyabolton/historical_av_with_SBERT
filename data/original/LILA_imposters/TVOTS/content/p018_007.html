M. quiet in camp, having moved back here, 11 miles from Martinsburg, this morning, starting about 3 o'clock, I have had a good sweltering nap in the shade &amp; now will write &amp; answer your queries first, for fear I may forget it. I wrote to you about Gen. Ramseur's fight, about which you are so uncertain in yours of the 20<u> <u>th</u> </u> &amp; gave you the particulars &amp; have since written to you about the battle of the 24<sup>th</sup> at Kernstown &amp; our pursuit of the Yanks to Martinsburg. Friday we went to the Potomac at Williamsport &amp; crossed over &amp; made a demonstration, our sharp shooters going up to Hagerstown, at the same time the cavalry crossed higher up &amp; is now on a raid into the Cumberland Valley &amp; Westward Mosby crossed also towards Frederick CityI am glad your package come safely Yesterday I sent you, to the care of Maj. Bell, a small box containing a set of cups &amp; saucers, 1/2 doz tumblers, some pepper, allspice, ginger, nutmeg, soap &amp; a set of new &amp; novel Reading Books for the children, they are beautifully illustrated &amp; will be a source of information &amp; amusement for the children -- I did not see any other books there worth getting for them -- I could not find any tea &amp;c, but may yet, as I desire to get them much -- I know you need them. The Red Book is a capture of Mr. Robinson's near Washington -- take care of it. I have asked for Indigo often &amp; could not find any. Sell your butter unless you need it yourself, for there is no way of getting it to me &amp; you can use it to advantage. I want a full pattern frock coat from my cloth &amp; then, if there is enough left for a pair of pants you may make them from your pattern, if you have time -- I am in no need of them now as I gota very good pair from the <abbr expan="Quarter Master">Q. M.</abbr> in the Spring &amp; have 2 pairs with me. The overcoat is Mr. Robinson's, but I have conditionally bought it, take care of it &amp; keep the moths away from it -- I think it is very pretty too -- I am glad the Brandy got home, was fearful it <abbr expan="would">wd</abbr> get broken. Use the socks as you please -- I am wearing some of them that I kept - use them for yourself. I wish I had kept some <abbr expan="handkerchiefs">hdkfs</abbr>. I ame delighted that Nelly is doing so well, &amp; writes her compositions without help -- . When I spoke about your letter of the 12<sup>th</sup> being filled with "Hunter" I meant an account of Hunter's Raid &amp; its sad consequences. <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> Hanger took up my horses &amp; he will get them into pasture. I spoke to Mr. Geeding about pasture when at home &amp; he agreed to take one horse, I now send 2, after the lapse of 2 months, instead of one. I shall get Anne's shoes the first chance. I will send you some <abbr expan="Post Office">P. O.</abbr> Stamps in a few days. In your letter of the 20<sup>th</sup> You speak of being quite sick but say Dr. Hamilton cured you -- I am very much obliged to him for his attentions to you -- hope I may be able to reward him. In the letter of the 25<u> <u>th</u> </u> you say you are all well I am glad you have an opportunity to aid the soldiers some -- but hope you will not be made sick by your attentions to them I shall have to get you a pair of spectacles if you say so -- though it will seem odd &amp; make <u>me</u> feel old too, I am sorry we are so far off that I cannot send William up to help you -- Don't work out of doors so as to injure your health -- Cannot Mary be made by Capt. Sterrett to do more of the out door work she is old enough &amp; strong enough. I am very sorry for Mrs. Bear -- hope she is better now &amp; may get over her great loss, at least become reconciled to bear it with Christian resignation I am willing to let Allie <i>[unclear: Hanger]</i> have use of the benches - there are a good many of them in the "Hall" now -- with the condition that they are not to be cut up -- You may let Nelly take Music Lessons if you think she will be properly taught &amp; I do not wish to send her to <u>any</u> school if it can be avoided -- but you must use your own discretion -- you have the burdens &amp; cares of the family &amp; I do not wish to add to them -- There is a good deal in the reading books I send for her to study Grammar -- You might put her into French when you think best. I am sorry Anne gets along so slowly, but hope <u>time</u> will aid her -- I wish Nelly could study Botany, Words, but it is too late in the season now -- Write often my Love -- Kind regards &amp; Heavenly blessings for you all -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband --</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
