But I have not heard a word from home since I left nor feel any ways uneasie about it, for I know Maggie will write when she has an opportunity nor I have never since I have been in the army for I have always considered it my duty to write to her 2 or 3 times to her once. But to acknowledge I do wannt to hear from her &amp; <i>[unclear: Warler Elmer ]</i>all that I have on earth to care for Bell you seemed <del hand="h1"></del> what inclined to think I ought not become dissatisfied in the Army &amp; he contended I know that I just as mutch to care for as any other man &amp; I know that I have the same priviledge to hire a subscribe as they that has done so &amp; more over I love my Wife &amp; child as mutch &amp; will do as mutch for them as any other man &amp; would love to remain at home with Them as well as as well as any other man, &amp; I dont know how soon I may be with them &amp; again I may not see them till the war is over. for this reason I have been appointed Assisting Quarter Master of this regiment 14th till it is organized &amp; then I have the best of nine chances out of ten for the appointment of Capt. Q.M. and if I am pleased with it &amp; get the appointment I will <ins>remain in servise</ins></p> <p>Bell you wannt me to write to Pete I would do so with pleasure but know it to <ins>be</ins> useless to do so for I have written to Jacksons several times &amp; none ever reached ther destination. Well I must give you the <i>[unclear: points]</i> of the Brigadier General <i>[unclear: A.G. Jenkens]</i> Briggade in the first plase we were ordered here in Campt a Camp of <i>[unclear: instruction]</i> every thing disarranged every body dissatisfied &amp; no nothing you may <ins>say</ins> but all I have to say about it is in the plase of it being a Camp of instructions it a Camp of <i>[unclear: diserfaction]</i> at the best no rules nor nothin as I have said. The Company that have <i>[unclear: going short]</i> at all times in the <ins>day</ins> &amp; night they even spent by volleys &amp; do just as they pleas &amp; one hundred Yankeez could come &amp; rout the hole Camp.</p> <p>The weather is very rough &amp; bad we had a very pretty snow last night it fell about five or six inches deep but there was enough for a foot of snow it rained all day yesterday &amp; consequently it melted. Bob Love is improving very fast I think will be able in the cours of a <i>[unclear: couble ]</i> of weeks to join his Company &amp; several others are sick, but I still remain the same old seven &amp; six. I have no neus of importance of war to communicate. So I will have to close for the <del hand="h1">pleasant</del> present.</p> <p>Give Miss <i>[unclear: Clemmins]</i> <i>[unclear: my]</i> respects &amp; Mr. <i>[unclear: Brarey]</i> <ins>my</ins> regards &amp; ask him how his arm is get, &amp; weather he is ready to take anothe fish or not, tell him to hold himself in reaching at all times that I may be there any day to fish &amp; till then the hook I thought I had lost I found in my Coat afterwards &amp; write often &amp; direct as follows</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Lt Jos.
