The boys have all arived here at last except one. I came all the way on Saturday. I stopped in Harrisonburg and tried to get my self a pair of boots but did not succeede. I was at all the shops in town and could not find a pair of boots to fit me. I came on to Bridgewater and met with no better success. I had my measure taken their for a pair stick down <i>[unclear: Kip]</i> boots, and I expect to get them tomorrow morning by the mail. he charges me five dollars and a halfe. I asked the price of the same boots in Harrisonburg and they said they could not make them for less than 7 dollars. Beaver and the boys from down the valley came Wednesday. I found but very few here when I got here and had a lonesome time. But every thing is started on right now. I payed Mr. White my book bill this evening and took his receipt. It was quite a military day in Harrisonburg Saturday, there were two companeys parrading the Horse company and the Rifle Company they made quite a show, and I thought went through the manouvers very well. The horse company was receiving their arms. Beaver tells me that the arms for the New Market Cavalry is on the way. They are to be sabres and two of Colts Navy revolvers. I think it is time that they should arm the volunteer companies of the State. As in all probability they will be called out in the spring. Secession is on the increase here, I have heard men say in the last few days that they were strong secessionist, who before Christmas were quiet submissionist. I think the time has come when submission can no longer be withstood, and we should claim our rights, if not in the Union we must - out of it. The North will hear to no compromise, and the South will not submit to an unconstitutional party. Write soon. My love to all.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Son,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>C.C.
