He said he was sleeping in the same room with two other persons, one of them in the same bed with him all men <i>[unclear: grown]</i> &amp; <i>[unclear: stout]</i> there were other men sleeping in the same house all in the employment of the man of the house - That after 12 o'clock at night he went out in his night clothes to see about the horses of which he had the care, upon going out of the house he saw a free negro man whom he knew very well coming out of the Smoke house, with a piece of bacon in his hand - that he stood still &amp; presently the negro returned &amp; went again into the Smoke house &amp; carried off another piece of bacon that he then saw the negro &amp; M<sup>c</sup>Mullen come out from behind the Smoke house with each of them a bag of bacon upon their backs - during all of this time the witness said he stood perfectly still &amp; did not make any noise <del hand="h1">Th</del> he then returned to his bed and said nothing to any of his fellow lodgers - the next morning his employer missed his bacon - but now Painter remained as dumb as an oyster upon the subject of his midnight discovery - &amp; never said any thing about it for eight days although his employer was making every effort to discover the thief.</p> <p>McMullen I have known for several years - &amp; he has always borne the character of an honest man of steady habits &amp; very industrious His family are poor but of proverbial honesty in Bath County - You no doubt remember M<sup>c</sup>Mullen as the driver of the stage from Lexington to Goschen for several years &amp; know some thing of his character - Knowing him as well as I do - I can not believe him Guilty of the charge preferred against him by Painter - I hope and <i>[unclear: trust]</i> you may grant the prayer of his poor wife, and believe that the act will not in any degree weaken other sanctions of our criminal code</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Robert">Ro</abbr> L Doyle</div> <!---->
