I will avail myself of your <i>[unclear: generous]</i>. &amp; I feel, very efficient will in securing to me my restoration. I suppose none of the bills passed at the late session, although I have not yet heard, and it may be <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> to renew the application at once. &amp; I beg if you think so, that you will <i>[unclear: put]</i> me in the Docket for earliest action, as also the name of <u>Dr. Stribling</u></p> <p>My original application was made more than <i>[unclear: five]</i> months ago <u> <i>[unclear: instance]</i> </u> of the military authorities of this state. &amp; I believe this Dr <abbr expan="Stribling">S</abbr> of <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> were of the earlier problems from this quarters. They were warmly recommended by <i>[unclear: Gen ]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. I understand &amp; <i>[unclear: forwarded]</i> by him, but having no "engineer" in Washington, they were probally "pigeon holed". Some months ago I had them renewed, they were recommended by <i>[unclear: Genl]</i> Mumford, Wickham, Mr <i>[unclear: Steams]</i> &amp; others, leading Republicans of Richmond. &amp; presented by Senetor Willey, and since then in the lower house in several shapes. - My name was put on a house bill in the Senate with others &amp; in that way was sent back and has I fear perished.</p> <p>There is opposition to me before the Richmond Committee, I understand. The reason <u> assyned </u> is that I was nominated to preside by <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> <i>[unclear: Fontenius']</i> friends at the late R.R. meeting. That by accepting the nomination I put myself in opposition with Republicans who were for <abbr expan=" General">Gen</abbr> Wickham. This is an <u>assigned</u> reason &amp; <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Wickham condemns it, and is one of my best friends. I have reason to believe that the opposition is in part from this place. Mr <i>[unclear: Fullz]</i> is chairman of Republican committee - <u>to be <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del></u> &amp; apprehends if I get eligible I may be in his way. Curse him! I dont want it. I refused it twice from Mr. Pierpont. Another enemy is Mr. Ally Gene Bowden the reason he will not give but certain records missing the rolls in Richmond will show. I was chairman of a joint Committee of the Legislature to visit <u> <abbr expan="Williamsburg">Wmsburg</abbr> </u> &amp; investigate abuses in the Lunatic Asylum. His family were deeply <u>implicated.</u> <i>[unclear: He]</i> was promised that when his brother was a candidate for the Legislature he (the Ally) offered the offices &amp; interests of the institution to those who <i>[unclear: meld]</i> vote for his brother - &amp; the result was that those who did not so <u>vote</u> were either themselves or their friends who had places turned out, this was the testimony. He appeared before the Committee afterwards &amp; moved to have the testimony offering him stricken out because he was not a <u>party</u> to the record. &amp; I overruled his motion- was sustained by a unanimous vote. &amp; he ceased to speak to me. &amp; now wants his <u>revenge</u>.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <i>[unclear: Hus. ]</i></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>N K Trout</p></div> <!---->
