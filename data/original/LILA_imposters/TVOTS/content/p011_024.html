A.P. Hill being in the rear. The enemy attempted to fall upon our rear last night, with a strong cavalry force, but they "caught a Tartar," finding us ready for them, &amp; were repulsed, we taking some 15 prisoners, at one point, and they attacked at another point &amp; met the same fate -- we have taken some 350 of Pope's Cavalry, now, some officers that we shall hold as hostages for the treatment of our people by Pope -- (<del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> here we were ordered forward &amp; away from my seat under a tree) I resume my writing on a hill top, in full view of several thousand of the enemy cavalry that have been drawn up all day in the hot sun, -- while we are maneuvering to take them, have been sitting round here all the evening -- trying to find out the enemy's position 4 P.M. the battle has opened -- &amp; we must <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> on -- it is about 6 miles west of Culpeper <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> -- Sunday 6 A.M. -- the firing has opened again We had a bloody day yesterday -- as desperate a fight as I ever saw -- but we drove the enemy away from the battle field, took 12 leads of ammunition, 1 large piece of artillery, some 400 prisoners, one <abbr expan="Brigadier General">Brig. Gen.</abbr> &amp; a good many officers. The fight continued until 9 P.M. Our Gen. Winder was killed &amp; we had a good many others killed &amp; wounded -- We lost a good many men &amp; killed &amp; wounded large numbers of the enemy most of which they left on the battle field. I can write no more as the Gen. is about to start again &amp; we will have another bloody Sunday. Providence has kindly blessed our arms &amp; spared most of us -- May He still be near us. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> my barrel. Send this &amp; let the rest see it. I will write this evening May God bless you all </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
