And indeed it was a rich Treat to me. It gave me a great deel of pleasure to peruse it line by line; Every Word was Interesting and cheering to me, For I must confess, it <i>[unclear: arrived]</i> in a very good time, for I was very much down in the mouth about The fall of Atlanta. Just before, I had been raised to the very highest pinnacule that imagination could place a man, on the peace question. With the hopes that, Atlanta could hold out This camppaign, but alas! all my bright visions of peace was blasted. My hopes of the pleasur of meeting my old Freinds as a Freeman and enjoying my self as of years gon by, in there company. then, to give up all, I admit it was too much for me, but your cheerfull letter cure meto brighten up againe, and bring back the old cheerful smile on my pug. I Soon banished all despondency, and now, I am Just as hopeful as Ever, and about the Same old <i>[unclear: Sort]</i>. I heard Good news from Georgia <del hand="h1"></del>. Soon after, I heard that Hood had Whipped The Yanks good.</p> <p><i>[unclear: Well]</i> miss Mollie our Division had a Smart little fight on the 3rd at Berryville only 3 Brigades was engaged, the other did not get up in time We fought 2 corps of Yankees, charged their Brest Work &amp; drove them out &amp; held them untill We left the 3rd day. the Yanks would not fight. So we Would not Stay any longer, our loss was very small considering the great advantages the Yanks had over us. We had to charge through a open field of half mile under a heavy fire but our whole loss was only 175. our Div was all the troop there. the Yankee paper admit a loss of 300. We Just cleaned them up. I was a spectator of the whole It is an <u>awful</u> <u>Grand</u> <u>Sight</u> but <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> is somethingfascinating about it We came back to Winchester on the 5th. I found the Stonewall Brigade in camp in Sight of our camp of course. I had to go over to see the boys. I found them all well &amp; in fine Spirits. all hopeful of speedy peace. the old Brigade is gon up the Spout. very few of the old boys here. It was here, that I learned the Whreabouts of Your Bro John. Oh, I know it must have taken a great load of uncertainty of the minds of your family. I know I felt very much released. For I did not know if he was dead or not. I am Truly Glad it was no Worse God grant he may be permitted to return to the bossom of Those That love him. I Should love to see John. I hope to meet him in Solon. I Wish I was there now. I know I Should enjoy myself <i>[unclear: finly]</i>. I think I may get hom Some <i>[unclear: tim]</i> this year. This is a Beautiful Country Oh, I Should love to live in this County. Well Miss Mollie I had a good laugh at the <abbr expan="Sergeant Major">Sergt Maj</abbr> When I told him what you wrotehe is such a modest young man, it made him blush. he is perfectly carried a way and if you send many more such messages to him he will go up the Spot. but I have not much fears about you &amp; his Lordship <u><i>[unclear: getting]</i> married</u> for this reason. he is so very diffident and your shiness of man; Will make it a matter of impossibility to get up a match With out calling in the Third person &amp; of course that Will be my self, of course, and of course, you Will find out that I will do all in my Power to brake up the match as I have an Intrist in your future Welfare myself. Perhaps more than you dream of and can't bear the idea of the <abbr expan="Sergeant">Sergt</abbr> <i>[unclear: carrying]</i> of the prize, for then I should go up the spout, But If We <i>[unclear: Come]</i> up the Valley, I shall bringe him along, &amp; Will give him a fair chance I Will stand off &amp; Say Nothing, but Will keep an Eye on <u>him</u>, <u>haha</u>. <u>Now don't</u> you go <u>in Love with</u> <u>him</u>, hahaYou spoke of some young lady in Mt Solon going to take a <u>Hu</u>sband but did not say who the fortunate Genl was, or (unfortunate) as the future Will Show) you Wish to know if I was like the rest of Man kind. I have a poor Opinion of the ladies faithfulness to man Well, Miss Mollie, I Will be Candid. There are some few women in the world who are devoid of a particle of love or honor, but thes are very few but all Women have loved Somebody I do not look upon the whole class of Women &amp; being heartless, becaue one has Jilted me. If I am so unfortunate to place my affections on an object &amp; and I find it is misplaced why I must just do the best I can, &amp; not curse the whole human race for what that woman done, no I will not do that for I Love the Ladies; I could not think what young Lady you <i>[unclear: spoke]</i> of as my sweet heart. I did not know Iwas so fortunate as to have one, for I have been a long tim since I had a sweet heart. I Will Come up and find out who her Ladyship is. I know I shall be perfectly happy in her Love. I will trust her. I have <i>[unclear: quite]</i> a marry tim with my <abbr expan="Sergeant Major">Sergt. Maj.</abbr> I <i>[unclear: hav]</i> got him all Right.

I know it is wrong but Miss <u>Mollie</u>, I must have something to pass away the tim.
