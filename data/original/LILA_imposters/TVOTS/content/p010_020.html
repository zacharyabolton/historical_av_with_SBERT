They buried Frank Emmitt and young Harman at Mossy Creek today -- Mr. Brown is complaining some. I want Mose to get my horse &amp; bring him back -- I write a note to Nelson about him [tho' EXPAND TO though] Aunt Margaret is well. I will write to you very soon. See if I left my white <abbr expan="handkerchief">hdkf</abbr> at home, I thought I dropped it there. Send me the gloves if you have fixed them. If there is any authentic news from Jackson &amp; army write to me by Mose. If Nelson is not at home see that my Leather halter is on my horse &amp; have my saddle, blanket, &amp; bridle all on my horse. If Cy paid for putting on a shoe give it him. I suppose I shall soon be home again -- Good bye &amp; God bless you </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
