We lost about 36 killed &amp; had 300 wounded at the battle. The enemy retreated that night -- rapidly. We have buried about 30 of their dead -- they carried some off -- and had a very large number of wounded They abandoned some here -- We took a Col. and several prisoners yesterday -- Our men are weary but in good spirits. Young Harmon of Mt. Solon was killed. Col. Gibbons of the 10<sup>th</sup> was also killed -- Send this up for them to see at the Upper house I am enjoying excellent health -- Hope you are all well -- this country is a scene of desolation. Living scarce. I shall want to get some butter, pickles and crackers from home if we stay here long -- I will write.
