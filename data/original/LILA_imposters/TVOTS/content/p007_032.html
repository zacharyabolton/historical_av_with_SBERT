I am sure you have heard from me before now and are relieved from apprehensions -- I am faring finely now -- mess with Capt. Lilley's men &amp; have a good suit of clothes given me by them when they chose me an honorary member of the company. We have provisions that were sent us from Augusta &amp; then our mess has a good cook in it. I am sorry you have so much concern for me, because it wearies you out - tho' I am as much concerned for you &amp; my darling children -- but but have not as much time to brood over it being in the whirl &amp; excitement of camp life &amp; in the midst of stirring events that <u>attract &amp;</u> at the same time <u>distract</u> the attention The men are gathering in slowly -- some 6 or 700 were taken prisoners but they have been released on their parole of honor we are informed and will be here today all except Col. Pegram who was a U. S. Army officer &amp; him they have taken to Ohio as a prisoner. Gen. Garnett was killed &amp; his army is now on the way here by the way of Hardy <abbr expan="County">Co</abbr> -- having had a desperate fight, lost most of their baggage and had a few hundred killed, inflicting a considerable loss on the enemy -- The men that came through on parole yesterday say the enemy buried 137 of their men &amp; 27 of ours after the Rich Mt. fight -- they say the enemy had 20000 men there while we had but 1800. I do not want anything now except another flannel shirt &amp; you need not send that unless I send for it. You may send me 3 collars &amp; my wollen vest if you have a chance. I saved a plenty of socks &amp; drawers &amp; got a new pair of shoes &amp; shall get an overcoat from the <abbr expan="public">pub.</abbr> stores I shall write to you often &amp; when I know what I shall do myself I will tell you what to do. I am acting as the Adjutant of our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> now -- The stage goes in a few minutes -- I am getting used to sleeping on the floor &amp;c write often I get all the news by Nat. Tyler <abbr expan="Editor">Ed.</abbr> of the Enquirer Love to all my sweet wife &amp; kiss the babies for me. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
