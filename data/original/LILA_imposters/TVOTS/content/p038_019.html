I do not blame you for not coming to Staunton. I did not think you would come for I know it would not sute you to pay Staunton a viset at this time I think I know your reason for not coming and if it is what I think it is I dont blame you for not coming I would rather you would not come all tho I would like for you to come. I often think of the plesent walks we had last summer and the plesent Evenings we spent to gether they ware endeed happy hours to me. I have often sat alone and pictured to my self the plesent walks we would have this summer in Staunton and the plesent Evenings we would spend in Each other society but alas that can not be unless your Pa mooves to Staunton which I hope he will do and then it would be much more plesent to visit you at your own home. I know you are anxous to come Staunton my love. I think it would be best for you to pospone your visit untill you moove here which hope wont be long. I am very sorry to informe you that it will be imposible for me to pay you my regular visit next Saturday if I live I will be down Saturday a week I am sorry to disapoint you my love but Business prevents me from going. Dr Arthur told me that he was coming down with me Saturday a week I will let you know for surtian in my next letter if he is coming. oh how much I would like to See you this morning my love one who I love with unchanging Devotion of heart &amp; soul and one who I love more then all others on this Earth</p> <p>Ella was taken very sick on Yesterday She is much better this Morning. I hope your Ma is Entirely recovered. My love to your Ma &amp; Pa love to all</p> <p>I send a loving kiss to you and all the love of my heart my love is only for you my love God Bless you Goodbye</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>David H Evans</p></div> <!---->
