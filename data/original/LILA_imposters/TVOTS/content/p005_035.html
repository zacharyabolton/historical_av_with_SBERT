Watts paid me Twenty three dollars on acct of the order from you to me on him for your Share of the Comission on the sale of the Hunter Farm According to my Calculation he should have thirty two or three dollars. I could not get him to pay any thing untill he got a small note of mine which I refused to pay, unless he took up the order from you upon him which he did. And would not agree to pay any thing more The last Bond of mine for the purchase of the Hunter farm is due and Churchman wants the Money, I have refused to pay the money untill the deed is made, As I[t] dose[sic] not suit me to do so untill some time in march And Write to you to say that I know[sic] hope it will not be convenient for you to sign the deed sooner than march next. Major Watts said to me to day that he would send the Deed over to you Our Friend john D. is out for the Convention. We hope to put him through // Baldwin, Sheffey, Baylor, W. H. Harman &amp; Stuart are out also. Sheffey &amp; Stuart are two timid for me. I am for going out should matters not be satisfactorily settled before the 4th Febuary[sic]. We are all well &amp;c you will rember[sic] me to your Family</p> <p>Yours &amp;c Sincere Friend</p> <p>Wm. J.
