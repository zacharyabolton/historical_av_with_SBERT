I am sorry I am not at home now to help to make you comfortable for the winter -- call on Mr. Wooster to do any jobs you may want fixed up &amp; I hope I may at least get home for a short time during the month -- Can you spare me the little trunk -- traveling one?, and is it in good order, lock &amp; all -- I want it for my clothes &amp;c -- want to get rid of one big box to make room for my little mess box that I have written to Nelson to make for me -- give him one of the locks in some of the book case drawers to put on it, if they will suit. My Dear, I will tell you what I want in my box -- so you can put them up in your own nice way -- as no one else can -- 1<sup>st</sup> some 10 lbs. of butter in <u>well salted</u> lumps or prints -- have it <u>well</u> salted and you can roll them up in something and I can put them into one of my buckets here 2<sup>nd</sup> then about a gallon of pickles -- they will have to be put in a stone jar -- (I told <abbr expan="Nelson">N.</abbr> to get 3 for you if he could find them) 3<sup>rd</sup> then about a peck of dried apples &amp; peaches , half &amp; half -- in separate bags (buy some more peaches like these if you can -- a half bush.) 4<sup>th</sup> 2 qts of dried corn 5<sup>th</sup> a peck of sifted corn meal -- well dried -- 6<sup>th</sup> a half peck of hominy, from Mr. Bear -- 7<sup>th</sup> A few dried berries, if you have any to spare. 8<sup>th</sup> chink the spaces with some very hard baked &amp; beaten crackers that can stand keeping -- 9<sup>th</sup> If you can as well as not, get the tin can I kept corks in, it has a cover, and fill it with lard, for our bread, and then add, if any room, a link of sausages for <abbr expan="Boswell">Bos</abbr> -- I will write to or about getting the box ready and sending it, to me, you fix the contents -- Have Mr. Wooster dress the cloth nicely -- full it well &amp; &amp;c for I must have a coat from it before long, tell him to do his best, and the big knife shall be his as soon as I can send it -- Do you want Allen again, or what do you wish in the way of servants -- it is time to be thinking about them -- write me and I will write to those that have &amp; fix it -- Keep the Osnaburg -- I want some for some camp stools as well as for my coat -- use what <u>you</u> want</p> <p> All is quiet here -- we drove out the gun boats the other day -- &amp; peppered them well -- the Yanks are thick on one side of the river &amp; we on the other -- The pickets have a talk now &amp; then. One of the <abbr expan="Yankee's">Y's</abbr> asked one of ours if Jackson had resigned -- he <i>[unclear: answered]</i> yes. Why? <abbr expan="said">sd.</abbr> the other. Because Banks, his <abbr expan="Quarter Master General">Q.M. Gen.</abbr> had failed to supply him lately with stores, was our picket's reply &amp; &amp;c. Kenney has "biles" again -- is flat of his back reading -- The weather has been cold &amp; bad, but looks better today. Shall I send for the Examiner again, or would you prefer some other paper -- the <i>[unclear: time]</i> ends with the year -- I hope not to impose so many labors in another letter, it is too bad to put so many things on you, but we must all bear &amp; endure many things in this horrid war -- only the Lord grant that it may speedily end and peace and liberty again be ours -- Write to me soon -- very soon &amp; I will remember to write often -- Kiss the children -- I will remember &amp; write to Nelly before long - May God bless &amp; keep you all in his merciful care -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> -- husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
