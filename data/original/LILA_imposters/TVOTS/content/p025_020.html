The Grand Jury, who commenced their session on the 4<sup>th</sup> inst., failed to find any inditement against Dooms, and he was therefore discharged.</p> <p>The plea in favor of Dooms at the preliminary hearing, was, that he was obeying the instructions of the stationmaster, who had instructed him to keep the platform clear of the Hotel porters, that the platform was the property of the Rail Road Co. Such a plea could not have covered an assault upon a white person.</p> <p>In my opinion the action of the Grand Jury in discharging <u>Madison Dooms</u> from accountability was an act of gross injustice and the case from its <i>[unclear: prominence]</i> should receive attention, the jury having literally given the white man permission to knock the negro down without fear of molestation.</p> <p>The Corporation Attorney informed me that he furnished the jury with the law <u>and</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>know</u> how they came to act as they did.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir, <br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt.</abbr> Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Geo.
