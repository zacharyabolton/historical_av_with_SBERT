You asked me if I missed you much yes indeed that I do miss you I sometimes think that I cannot get along without you but I trust my sweet cousin that we will soon meet again and be happy once more.</p> <p>I went to see Mrs Mcclung and enjoyed myself very much she would make me eat some cake that she had they were very nice she said when Miss Mattie came she intended to send for me to spend the day, I have also been invited twice overat <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Baldwins but I could not go the first time on account of the weather and I was taken with the measles and I have not been out of the house since I only wish you could have seen me my face was as red and bumpy as possible &amp; I was the ugliest <u>mortal</u> that you ever beheld the eruption has not left me yet but I hope to be able to go down to school on monday I went down to the table yesterday for the first time for two weeks you cannot imagine how glad I was to get out of my room once more.</p> <p>We have had nothing scarcely but rain ever since you left but the trees are all blooming and every thing looks very fresh and pretty I often wish that I could be at Pleasant Grove withyou and the children and hear the birds sing. you must give my ablest love to the boy and tell them to write to me you must kiss the little baby X Lisa X <i>[unclear]</i> a great many times for me and tell <i>[unclear]</i> that her cousin Aurelia wants to see her very badly too and I hope it will not be long before I will have that pleasure.</p> <p>You spoke dear cousin of my flat it did not make the slightest difference for I can with the greatest difficulty get along without it until you return.
