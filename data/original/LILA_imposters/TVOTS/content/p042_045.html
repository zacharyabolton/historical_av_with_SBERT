Think of it, this is the <u>fourth</u> letter, at long intervals, since I have had a reply to one of mine. Just three weeks ago to day I parted from you, and that night wrote you from Keysville, and that is the only letter to which I have <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> a reply. Couldn't you have sent me a little note from Laurenceville? I wont scold. I never scold, but if you could know with what avidity I read every word you write me, and how anxiously I look forward always to hear from you, I am sure you would admire my pa-tience and my philosophy.</p> <p>My darling is all the world to me now. I love my children as dearly as any father ever did, and they are as lovable, but there is in the human heart a capacity to love that is not gratified by mere paternal affection. A large part of my life has been one of the deepest and tenderest love for woman. I <u>know</u> how glorious it is to be master of a woman's whole heart, and to feel that she is mistress of mine. Long years of the purest pleasure in that holiest of all earthly relations husband of a true and noble woman, has taught me that outside of it, there is little worth living for. When I first met you I was almost indifferent to the world. I did not know that it any longer contained any one whom I could love again, as I had loved in the past. Ere I had known you three days, I saw that I had found a woman at whose feet I could lay my whole heart, and then my anxiety was to know how I could win yours. You know how earnestly I labored <del hand="h1">the</del> to accomplish that result.</p> <p>Providence favored my suit &amp; you gave me your young &amp; noble heart. Ever since I have felt how blest I am. I feel the pain of separation every day, I am sure more keenly than you, because the wreck of my happiness that has occured more than once in the past, has prepared me by a bitter experience, to appreciate the infinite pleasure of the Constant <ins>presence of</ins> <del hand="h1">pleasure of loving</del> one's heart's idol. But as a certain period of separation is inevitable, I long to alleviate its pain as much as possible by frequent communication with you. And had you a daily mail I would write to you every night. Therefore you must pardon me for complaining a little at your long silence. When you are at home again, please, as you value my happiness, never let a mail leave without bringing to me a letter from you - a long sweet letter - or if that may not be, even a little note will be prized.</p> <p>When you are my dear little wife I may spoil you, if petting can do it, for I feel that the debt of gratitude I owe you for making me so happy can never be paid off by all the endearments I can bestow on you.</p> <p>This week I will probably know when I may expect to return to <abbr expan="Virginia">Virg<sup>a</sup></abbr>. I expect <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Flournoy tomorrow. Indeed he may now be here, as I wrote urging him to come on yesterday, or as soon afterwards as possible. I suppose our company affairs will require me to spend some weeks of the winter in your County &amp; Brunswick. If so <u>where</u> would you advise me to make my head quarters? especially to spend my Saturdays and Sundays? Do you know any pleasant place in Mecklenburg where I would sometimes be a welcome guest? I will be guided mainly by your advice.</p> <p>I have not a line from sister Lou sisnce her first short &amp; hasty note and not a word from Sis Ella - will quarrel with them.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>With love to all, I am always yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.D.
