I heard of a house in <abbr expan="Waynesboro">Waynsboro</abbr> 12 miles off &amp; rode there on Sunday but it had been sold to Smith &amp; <i>[unclear: Dallinger]</i>. I rode out 7 miles yesterday to see a property but could not get it. I have joined a gentleman here in the purchase of a large Hotel property here at thirty thousand Dollars $30,000<sup>00</sup> Said to be one of the finest stands in the Valley it is a large building &amp; is at the Rail Road all say it is quite cheap It is now occupied as Hospital at a rent of $3600<sup>00</sup> <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> year &amp; cant be got now. If it was furnished &amp; conducted now as Hotel would make I think $100,000<sup>00</sup> <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> year Hotels here charge $8 <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> day &amp; but little to eat There is no chance now to get a portion of it to occupy. You pave the way to move out when I can get a place See if you will be allowed to bring out all your things &amp; Then put up all the fruit you can if you have to get <i>[unclear: packin-]</i> to put it in &amp; make full preperations with everything needed for a long time so that if can move out that you will be prepared Get your self &amp; childred plenty of clothing &amp; material &amp; get several pairs of shoes each some too large &amp; get Freddy plenty shoes &amp; boots get some of M<sup>r</sup> Snyders &amp; some at James Hills or elsewhere so that persons will not know your preparations. if you get some coarse goods &amp; shoes for the blacks make these arrangements &amp; perhaps by this time the Valley will be open &amp; there will be no difficulty in getting out &amp; if should not get out of course the preparation would not be amiss have the hogs fattened as I directed &amp; if <ins>you</ins> should come out have Henry S. to Kill &amp; put up plenty of Pork for us this fall Save all your bacon &amp; lard Bacon here 150c beef $1. butter 175 a $2. lard 150 a $2<sup>00</sup> Boots $40 to $60 Shoes $20 to $40<sup>00</sup> they are not scarce but every person seems to be <i>[unclear: --ing]</i> Make every arrangement necessary to come out &amp; live on what you bring except bread meat &amp; butter &amp;c-- Teams would have to be gotten there to come say to woodstock &amp; there reload an other teams Billy &amp; James <i>[unclear: Chennowith]</i> &amp; Kneadler I think would come &amp; John with carriage with you Moses might have wheel fix<sup>ed</sup> on our carriage perhaps he would come out there with you. Thomas or Staub must furnish <ins>you with</ins> funds funds I have learned that H Thomas was sent off &amp; imprisoned but can<sup>t</sup> learn if correct if so I feel concerned about the mill property</p> <p>Try &amp; write me &amp; let me know how things are and if you will be allowed to move out, if come, bring Jane or Mary C. along <del hand="h1"></del> M<sup>rs</sup> Schoppert is living here in <i>[unclear: --ns]</i> &amp; well she is exceedingly anxious for you to come here, and if can get a house to suit will try &amp; all get together it would be best to bring say 2 cows &amp; it will be necessary to put some careful person in our house also the house Moody lives in I suppose he will not keep house longer Aug &amp; Peggy would move in the home property. If I can I will get a house already furnished in that event our furniture need not be brough except bedding if this can be done you could buy a team &amp; get your uncle James G.'s large wagon he said he would sell it to me when I was there. In fact One team, One carriage &amp; horses might all be bough as there would be nothing lost in such a purchase as they could be sold here readily at an advance on cost I can<sup>t</sup> find a farm here yet for sale</p> <p>In short arrange all your matters &amp; have them in train to move out here so that when it suits all will be ready to move out with plenty of every thing you <i>[unclear: need]</i> but don<sup>t</sup> move without communicating to me first Unless you mistreated &amp; have a very unpleasant time there in that event pull up stakes &amp; move on out &amp; notify me as soon as can I wrote several letters to you lately &amp; no reply try &amp; give me word Send a letter to John or some one for me You need not sign your <i>[unclear: name]</i> for fear it might be intercepted I will know who it is from O Some one can certainly send me a letter say how the mill is, how the children get along how you are all provided for whether interfered with in any way or not I don<sup>t</sup> ask any information as to the troops &amp;c remember me kindly to the children tell them to be obedient &amp; good also to all enquiring friend say how you get along for help God bless you all</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours ever</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Nadenbousch</p></div> <!---->
