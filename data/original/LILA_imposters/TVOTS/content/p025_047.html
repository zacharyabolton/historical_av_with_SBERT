Tukey, late clerk in this office. The prisoners had for their Counsels Alex H. H. Stewart, <abbr expan="Esquire">Esq</abbr> - the evidence against them was mostly <ins>given by</ins> freedpeople, they were committed by the Magistrate and their Counsel having waived an examination at the September term of the County Court, they were remanded to Jail and now await the session of Circuit Court in November next.</p> <p>The fact of their guilt seems from the evidence to be quite evident. I do not think they either will, or ought to be cleared if crime is to be punished.</p> <p>In answer to the assertion that there are many Colored men in Jail, I will state that there is but one, besides the two named in this letter -- confined at present and he is a perfectly worthless man.</p> <p>As to the "reign of terror", although overdrawn, I think there is more foundation for the assertion than there should be. A black man, to live peaceably must be very careful the whites seem very jealous of them, and any show of impertinence or independence, in so many instances leads to blows on the parts of the whites - they say a Colored man must keep his place, and not be setting himself up as a rival to the white, instances of blows and abuse are quite frequent -- the Colored people generally submit quietly, as resistance, they are well aware, is perfectly useless.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt</abbr> Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Geo.
