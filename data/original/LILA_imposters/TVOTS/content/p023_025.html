I thank you very much for it. It would afford me great pleasure I know to attend, for I am a dear lover of music &amp; like to see young people enjoying themselves, &amp; I doubt not you will have both good music &amp; much true enjoyment on tomorrow evening. But my duties here are such that it is impossible for me to leave <i>[unclear: home]</i> at this time; I have an appointment to preach at Mr <i>[unclear: Ind.]</i> R. Berry's tomorrow afternoon.</p> <p>Permit me, my dear friends, to say a word or two of earnest counsel to you, for I feel a deep interest in your welfare. Just one word in a general way.</p> <p>Always in all circumstances remember that you have characters as young ladies to maintain, &amp; never permit yourselves to compromise in any way the gentleness, modesty, &amp; kindness which should ever characterize the true lady. But especially never compromise in the least your christian character. You are the professed followers of the blessed Savior- always remember that, &amp; act accordingly.<br> The highest, &amp; most precious ornament of a true lady is genuine piety.<br> Live near to Christ then, my dear young friends - study diligently your Bibles - be faithful in prayer &amp; in the discharge of every Christian duty. This need not, &amp; should not mar a single pleasure, or make your faces less bright. Be cheerful- live ever gay - but let your cheerfulness &amp; gaity be that which becometh <del hand="h1">&amp;</del> followers of Jesus. Let <del hand="h1">y</del> not your gaity be boisterous or frivilous.</p> <p>May the blessed Savior bless you richly, &amp; enable you to gr<del hand="h1"></del> grace in the knowledge of the Lord &amp; Savior Jesus Christ.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am your sincere friend &amp; pastor</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>L.
