Shortly after receiving your letter of the 25th March, I joined the 1st Reg. Cavalry and was detailed at once at Genl. Stuart's Hd.Qrs. in the Quartermaster's Department of which Major Fitzhugh, former Adjutant Genl. of Gen. Stuart is now chief. And since have been actively engaged in purchasing horses &amp;c.
