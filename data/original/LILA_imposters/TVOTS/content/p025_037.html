I once thought it was Mr. <i>[unclear: Jn]</i> Ryan but remembered he only sent me papers containing some communication written by himself. I've at last concluded it must be you. If so, I sincerely thank you. Truly do I appreciate such evidence of your esteemed remembrance. And most earnestly do Iwish that the power were mine to repay your kindness. perhaps that pleasure will yet be mine. I hope so from my heart. I may some day meet with the one you love best. Then will be one of my opportunities to compensate. With deep &amp; sincere respect &amp; wishing that your future may be ever prosperous, &amp; happy I am</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly Your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mary A.
