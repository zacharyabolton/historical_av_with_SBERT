But I have an opportunity to send a letter <u>North</u> by a gentleman who has been working here for some time, but is going home, &amp; I sincerely hope he may be permitted to mail this letter to you.</p> <p>Dear Mollie, there has been many sad changes since last I wrote you, my heart aches as I think of them, but I try to submit without murmuring, for I can not but feel that it is the Lord's will, that our once prosperous &amp; happy nation must be divided; and where peace &amp; happiness, once Shed their smile to gladen the hearts of the people, now <u>civil war</u> is devastating our land. It is very sad to think of, but you know, dear cousin, as well, perhaps better than I do, the state of our beloved country. But do not let us despair, we are in the hands of a merciful God, &amp; he will surely work all things to-gether for our good, &amp; his own glory. His ways are mysterious.</p> <p>I suppose, dear Mollie, that you have not heard from Cousin Will since the war commenced. He is in Virginia, at Norfolk, a city about two hundred miles from here, I have not heard from him for some time, the last I heard of him, he was well.There has been no fighting where he is yet, &amp; I hope there will be none. I wish I could see him, nothing would afford me more happiness. He has promised to come as soon as he can.</p> <p>I know where Will is, and can hear from him some time; But <u>where</u> <u>is</u> <u>cousin</u> <u>Tom?</u> Oh! how unhappy I have been a bout him since I received his last letter, which was in May. If I could feel sure of his safety I would be <u>so </u>happy. I know where ever he is, &amp; in what ever circumstance he may be placed, there is One who ever watches over him, when human friends are of no avail I have looked at his picture many, <u>many </u>times, since I heard from him, and read his letters again &amp; again, while tears of anguish flowed from my eyes, as I thought of the probbability of never hearing from you all again. But I hope, dear Mary that there is a brighter day ahead, &amp; the time may soon come when our correspondence will recommence not to be stopped by any national calamity. I wish you had sent me <u>your</u> picture I hope some day to see it, &amp; not your shadow merely, but your own dear self. What a happy day that <u>would</u> be!</p> <p>Tell dear Aunt not to be unhappy because Cousins Will &amp; Tom are in opposite parties. Tell her, cousin Mollie, that I would try to console her but I know not how. I can only pray for her Her situation is one of peculair Sadness, &amp; I would that it were in my power to administer to her consolation, but I can not I am too weak &amp; ignorant, I fear, to comfort her, but I pray the Lord my console her in her affliction. He is able &amp; willing to comfort her. There has been some changes in our family since last I wrote. Sister was married the <u>Fourth of July</u>. She married Mr. Williams I beleive I wrote some thing about him to you or cousin Tom. He would say, "she did remarkably well." He is not <u>very</u> wealthy, but he is an honest &amp; industrious man, esteemed by all. I know they would send you some message or perhaps write, if they had know that I intended to write to you, but I did not know it myself until nearly eleven o'clock to-night, &amp; as their home is some distance from mine I could not go to see them. I will send their love to you (all) any how. Unfortunately mother is away from home to-night also. Give her love to Auntie &amp; tell that she often talks about her.</p> <p>I must stop for it is getting late, &amp; I am a fraid I will not wake in time to send this down. Excuse me, dearest Cousin, I intended to write you a long letter, but time will not permit it now. Give my love to Cousin Tom, and tell I often think of him &amp; long for the time when he can write to me again, I miss his and your letters more than I do any of my other correspondence I would give any thing to receive one of your'<del hand="h1">s</del> or his' long &amp; interesting letters. Remember, dear Mary, if I should never hear from you again, I shall ever feel the tenderest affection for you, &amp; deepest solicitude for your happiness. All send much love, Do not forget to give my love &amp; a kiss to your youngest brother. If it is in your power, dear Mollie, write to me. A letter from you would give me more happiness than I could express.</p> <p>You wrote to me once a bout being a Christain. Do you still love Christ &amp; his cause? Are you striving to please him? You have my prayers in your behalf.</p> <p>Good bye dearest Mary, if- if I never hear from or see you while living, I hope to meet you with the redeemed &amp; blessed above. Tears are blinding me, I am compelled to stop<br> Remember me in your petitions, cousin.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am, and ever shall be Your fond &amp; loving cousin</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Sue.</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.<br> Henry sends his love, and says that he is sorry that your picture did not come.
