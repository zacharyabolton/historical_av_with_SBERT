(No 351), and to make the following report.</p> <p>When I was at Staunton, the last of April, Mr Jackson informed me that the authorities were <u>willing</u> to support their own poor, but that their means were inadequate. Concerning the want of clothing, I respectfully refer to enclosed copy of a letter received from Mr Tukey in March last, which is the only communication referring to clothing ever received from that Sub-District. No application for a supply has ever been made to me by either Mr Jackson or his predecessor. In regard to Rations: I have the honor to report that the office of the agent at Staunton was furnished with a copy of Circular No 32, from your Head Quarters, series of 1866, but that no Estimate, as therein required, has been received at this office for that Sub District since the month of January last.</p> <p>Mr Jackson has been directed to make application for such supplies of Food and clothing as are necessary to prevent suffering.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very respectfully, General<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obedt</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Servt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John A.
