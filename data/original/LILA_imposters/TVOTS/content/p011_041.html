They have allways had books here untill this year and I don't no why they have not gotten them this year. Tell Ma to send me my gray Roundybout as we will not get our uniform for a month yet and perhaps more.</p> <p>I reckon you think I spend half my time writing but I think so much of home and the dear ones there that I cannot help writing. I would give so much to see you all to day. Tell Brother Jim and sister that they must not give out their trip to Natural Bridge this fall as it would disappoint me very much. </p> <p>I am rooming now with Rough Griffin son of Dr. G of Salem and like him very much. About one half of the boys here are very nice boys the other half are perfect roudies. When you write let me know how you are getting along on the farm and wheather uncle Archer has heard from his horse and write me how Nanny looks. Pleas dont let any one hack her about. </p> <p>We are not regularly started with our studies yet will get straight by next week. I received Sisters letter last week the other day and was delighted to hear from home &amp; to hear that Grandpapa &amp; Uncle M had improved so much. Give my best love to uncle M. &amp; Aunt Liz when you see them and tell them that I regretted not seeing them very much. What horse will Jimmy Armistead get.</p> <p>Tell Sister I have been on guard twice once on police and once on fatigue. I dont mind police guard much as I dont have to stand long at a time but fatigue guard is very hard duty. You have to stand 2 hours at a time and then you are off 4 and <i>[unclear: on ]</i> 2. You are put on guard one morning at 6 and come off the next at 6 but that exempts you from drill or any other Military duty and from your studies also but I will not have to go on that kind of guard for a month yet. The other kind of guard does not exempt you from any duty whatever.</p> <p>Pleas send me the papers when you send the books as I have only heard that there was a battle at Manassas and one in Kentucky and that is all I know about it. I have made on Algebra this week 10 1/2 3 being the highest mark and I missed one day the day I was on fatigue guard. I consider the mark very good as I never studdied algebra before and don't understand how to work by letters. I dont know what I got on my other studdies as our marks were not read out to us in French and geography but I hope and trust that they are good. I would like to do well here as it is such a great thing for one to do well here. </p> <p>They say no one can get furlough here unless they have been here 6 months. 6 months sounds longer to me now than 12 years did before. It is a sad thought to me to think of 6 months. Write me all the news when you write as I dont hear a word now. Tell uncle Archer to write to me and let me know how much copperas he is making a day. Write me how everything is going on the farm. Tell brother Jim I will write to him next but he must not <i>[unclear: want]</i> to receive one before he writes. Is he gaining his strength rapidly or not. Tel him that the Bridge will pay any one for coming to see it. I didnt have time to look at it well I only stopped long enough to get my breakfast.</p> <p>I feel very sick at my stomach every morning getting up so soon and drilling an our before breakfast. We get up at five and go down to roll call having from 3 to 5 minutes to dress and roll up and strap our beds. We go to tattoo at half past 9 and the roll is called again then we have half an our to fix down our beds and undress. Tell Ma I all ways take time in that half our to read my bible. Then the lights are tapped out and if there be light burning after the drum qits beeting the orderly of the room gets 5 or 10 demerits for it &amp; one of the boys in the room are made orderly every week and is responsible for any noise made in it and if any nois should be made in the room during study hours the orderly is reported for it and gets from 3 to 5 demerits for it or if any thing in the room should be out of order or out of place the orderly is reported for it. The inspectors of rooms visits 3 to 6 times a day.</p> <p>Give my love to all at Cousin H<i>[unclear: Hues ]</i> &gt; and at aunt Sarahs. You all must write often. Give my best love to all at home.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I remain as ever your attached son,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Kent.</p></div> <!---->
