Their operations were attended with the discharge of pistols and also by cheers or yelling, which of course occurring as it did almost in the center of the town aroused almost the entire population.</p> <p>On yesterday I addressed a formal communication to the Mayor upon the subject who has informed me that every effort is being made by the Civil Authorities to ferret out the guilty parties in the matter, who I am assured will be brought to punishment and the operations of the Klan suppressed at once.</p> <p>The colored people are very much excited upon the subject and but little is needed to bring about a serious state of things here. I would also remark that I have reported the facts to the Military <abbr expan="Commissioner">Comr</abbr> for this Division also.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr><br>Your <abbr expan="obedient">obt</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Svt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jno W.
