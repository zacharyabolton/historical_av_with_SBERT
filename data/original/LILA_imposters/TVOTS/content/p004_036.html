She emigrated to Ohio last Spring, with no intention of <u>ever</u> returning. Does it not make you <u>weep</u> to think that you have forever lost the services of Lucy &amp; her "<u>Catnip</u>". As she has <ins>always</ins> been a necessary <u>institution</u> in your Domestic affairs, I see no other channel for you in the future, than to "shut up shop" and discontinue the Business. Tell Liz. that I have some idea of paying her a Visit about the first of the new year, &amp; that if she will make her <u>arrangements</u> to that time, that I will carry with me some Catnip, &amp; that you &amp; I will put her thro all the phases of Lucy &amp; the Catnip.</p> <p>I know of no one whose services as nurse could be had, except your Aunt Ginnie Martin -- she is a fine woman &amp; an excellent nurse, but I do not know whether she could be induced to go so far from home. Sarah is quite smart, but is slightly afflicted with the same epidemic under which <i>[unclear: Liz.]</i> is labouring.</p> <p>No news of interest. Times are Dul &amp; weather cold. There is considerable War Spirit in this country. We are seeing in the Harpers Ferry affair, the legitimate consequences of the <abbr expan="John">Jno</abbr> Letchers election -- that result justified Old Brown &amp; friends in believing that a Majority of Virginians were ready to join them. The Democracy are responsible for it, &amp; should be held so, for all this slavery agitation they have kept it alive for years. Elect Millard Fillmore President, &amp; I would guarantee that before the expiration of his term all would be quiet. I would like to see Wise, Seward, Douglass and a few others Hanged as high as was <abbr expan="John">Jno</abbr> Brown.</p> <p><u>Why Dont</u> you come over. all Well. Love to Liz &amp; children</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>C.
