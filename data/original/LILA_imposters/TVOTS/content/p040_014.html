I was thankful to hear of your safe arrival home. how much I did miss you my love &amp; I wished with all My heart that you could have staid longer with me but while you were riding home I was here thinking of you &amp; loving you. I was disappointed to read in your dear letter that you cannot come Saturday but I know you would enjoy your self much more to be here when we can be with each other &amp; not so much company to divide our time with. I know I should, my thoughts will be with you my love. I shall miss you sadly it will be the first Sabbath for me to spend at Mountain Palace without your dear society I shall not know what to do with myself without you my love it will seem lonely here in my new home next Sabbath not to see you, but I must wait &amp; if we both live you will come next week the time will be very long to me in passing away. I will love you &amp; think of you every hour &amp; wish I was with you who I love so devotedly. Hamie was delighted when I told him that you had commanded pay from Mr. Stanley for the loss of his whip. he said "you were the business gentleman to please him." I was very sorry to hear of Mr Johnson's &amp; Hoge's loss by fire but glad it did not extend further &amp; others made to suffer. fire is a dangerous element one cannot be too careful with it. My dear papa has been trying to improve the <u>beauty</u> of Mountain Palace since his return. I do not know what you will say about it when you come Have you seen my discarded King Louis the fifteenth just to think that I should discard a King for your sake. I love you more then all the crowned heads in the world or their fashions I will not wear any thing you do not admire. I love you &amp; love to look well in your dear eyes if I please you I do not care what others think or say of me I wish always to be just as you want me to be to you in dress as well as in disposition. I love to please you &amp; I want you always to give <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> if I wear what you see is not becoming I thank you for it because I know that your taste is fine &amp; artistic &amp; I love you the more for being so.
