I want you to have David Parrack subpoenaed and send it me and he will accept it; I would rather the case could be put off until warm weather, but I will go at anytime. I was mistaken about Mr A Beard knowing anything <ins>write to me</ins> about that horse it was another one that I had sold that Beard knew of, and you need not have him summoned again.</p> <p>Beard talked with Allen since he was summoned. Allen said he did not expect to get rid of paying for the horse he only did it to get time out. Beard asked him if he would take 60$ <u>now</u>, he said he did not know whether he would or not. If you can see Mr Beard and get him to talk with Allen, he can get enough out of him to show that he is just trying to cheat me out of the horse, Allen himself is not good for the debt but his security is good and if you will help me to get the debt I will pay you a good fee</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>you &amp;c</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M D Vines</p></div> <!---->
