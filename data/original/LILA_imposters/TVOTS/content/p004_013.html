I have not much of interest to write only I have been on the sick list for some few days &amp; desire your sympathy.</p> <p>Give my respects to Miss Mat and Sister. Sorry to hear that so many ladies are going to get married in that neighborhood, &amp; in fact <ins>in</ins> all vicinities there is nothing but marrying going on: pity the poor wretches that are left single.</p> <p>Have you any singings in your respective places, like you formerly have had, this winter? I have been in some charming meetings of the kind. I have had a splendid time attending singings this winter in New Port &amp; other places.</p> <p>Ther is nothing like having big times on Pisgah's big hills. You asked me to come down on valentine night to have a drawing. I suppose you had a splendid time of drawing. We dad a drawing here, (at Mrs Hull's) some few strangers came in, &amp; we passed off the time very merrily. But I neither sent nor received any valentines.</p> <p>Why are you not going to School this winter? or have you got your diploma. Just come up &amp; see me &amp; my family; I tell you I am just training the young ideas how to shoot.</p> <p>The Turkeyhoe's must be prancing about like wild Turkeys. They have no business coming over here &amp; taking all the South River gals away. Glad to hear that Miss Rachel is rising in the world &amp; in the estimation of the young <del hand="h1">gals</del> gents. Does Lucian still go to see you yet.</p> <p>Did Mr. Munroe get any Valentines this year to give about?</p> <p>I get very few letters. I wish the girls would all send me a box full. You must excuse this short letter of not much note. I wrote in a hurry; so I conclude with many wishes for your health &amp; happiness. Good evening.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your Friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Angus</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Oak Hill Va</p></div>
