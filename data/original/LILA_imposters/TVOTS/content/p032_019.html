Estaline was sold to Richmond in 1862 by James E. Carson, a slave trader. Her father (Abraham) has heard indirectly she is still in Richmond and he is anxious to find her and have her come to his home where he can take good care of her. Perhaps enquiry through the schools may lead to her discovery.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="obedient servant">obt servt</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thos P.
