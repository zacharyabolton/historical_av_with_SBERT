Two weeks ago I was sufficiently recovered to come to this place. I am now well and will return to duty in a few days. Mary is with us. Her health is still very delicate. She read your letter of July 28<sup>th</sup> &amp; answered it at once. This week I <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> your letter of July 14<sup>th</sup>. I am endevouring to carry out your request but doubt my ability to accomplish anything. I have written to <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Wise invoking his aid &amp; hope it will be more potent than my efforts. Some of your friends have been killed since your capture, though I believe none with whom you were very intimate. <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Lang &amp; Thornhill were killed below Winchester week before last. Poor Lang we shall miss him greatly. George &amp; Jimmy &amp; <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> McPhail well at last accounts. The 18<sup>th</sup> won the distinction of a special report from the Division Commander a few days ago for gallantry. I would say more if it were not contraband. Ma was to see me in Staunton. All were well at home. I effect to see them next week. I have laid aside a Salem letter for you which I suppose will "keep" till you get back.</p> <p><abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Massie of the Institute is here &amp; sends his regards to you. His brother Rodes is a prisoner. If at Johnson Island make his acquaintance. I shall endeavour to get Mary to winter in <abbr expan="South Carolina">S.C.</abbr> or <abbr expan="Georgia">Ga.</abbr> for her health.</p> <p>Give my kindest regards to Ginnevan, Ervin, Warden, Makely, Re<del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>, <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Imboden &amp; all other friends with you. I spend many an hour thinking of you all and hope ere long a general exchange may restore you to your friends. Mary writes in love to you. Russie, Frank, &amp; Jennie are all at school at Mr McPhail's.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your affectionate brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John.</p></div> <!---->
