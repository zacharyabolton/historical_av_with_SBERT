We are still at Parson <br> Rude's 5 miles below New Market <br> on the fine Steinberger Farm. <br> I tell you it is the finest <br> farm I ever saw the land <br> nearly as level as a floor. <br> We have two houses to stay in <br> &amp; plenty to eat so you see <br> we are getting along finely.<sup>[3]</sup> I do not know what our force <br> is not more than 6 or 8 thou <br> sand. I am afraid we will have <br> to fall back farther. Our compa <br> ny was filled up yesterday with <br> the Rockbridge Malitia 52 in <br> number they are very nice men <br> Charly McClung<sup>[4]</sup> is among the <br> number a very pleasant man<br> we scraped up kin but I do <br> not know how much, I expect <br> he is all you know any thing <br> about, we had an election <br> of officers this morning <br> which resulted in the election <br> of Hue White Captain Strickler <br> First <abbr expan="lieutenant">Lieut</abbr>, Sam Lile 2nd <br> &amp; James Culton 3d one of the <br> malitia<sup>[5]</sup> I think they will <br> make very good officers <br> but I am in hopes by June <br> we will have our Captain <br> back by that time<sup>[6]</sup> if all reports <br> are true about the late fight <br> in Mississippi but I am afraid <br> there is some mistake about <br> it I have no doubt we get a <br> great many prisoners but I don't <br> like the thought of falling back <br> again and I regret the loss of <br> <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Johnson for I think he <br> was an excellent officer, we get <br> no papers and cannot get the <br> particulars but I am in hopes <br> we have defeated them badly <br> though our loss is very heavy <br> now is the time for the South to <br> act if we delay, now we are <br> gone but I will never give <br> up as long as there is a ray of <br> hope, I don't believe there is <br> any chance for them to whip us. <br> We are both very well. I like <br> the service very well though it is <br> right hard but I think every one that <br> can go ought to. Give my respect to <br> aunt Elvira and to every body write soon <br> for it takes letters so long to come. love to <br> you and all the rest. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>from your nephew</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Moff.</p></div> <!---->
