Jackson &amp; he wished me to continue to work for him on the map -- the duty by which he had assigned me, but he had not the power to assign me any rank and could only keep me at work as a common soldier, and I had not the least inclination to be changed to such a duty as that I was discharging from a higher rank &amp; then only to be classed as a common soldier, so I had concluded to come home &amp; try and go to Richmond and secure a place in the regular engineer Corps, by the appointment of the Pres. but Jackson thought I would accomplish my end better by going to see Gen. Lee &amp; get him to recommend my appointment -- so he gave me a very flattering letter to Gen. Lee &amp; after working until Thursday noon in Monterey I packed up my tent &amp;c &amp; left them in Mr. Stevenson's care &amp; I came over to the top of the Alleghany in an ambulance that was coming over -- saw all the boys that were there encamped, for a few moments -- Capt. Lilley had just got his banner back from Staunton where they sent it to be fitted up -- as it got somewhat rumpled during the retreat -- and I also ate a tomato that the Capt gave me -- it was capital -- then I found Dr. Butcher, who had kindly agreed to bring me in his gig to where Lee is -- the Mingo Mt -- at the head of Tygart's Valley River -- &amp; so we started on down towards this place at 4 pm -- he brought me 8 miles, to his brother in law's -- F. Arbogast's -- where I was treated splendidly -- ate &amp; slept gloriously -- the 3<sup>rd</sup> time I have slept in a bed since I left home -- lots of blackberry pies, eggs &amp;c she served us to -- her husband -- (we did not find Mr. A. at home.) is Captain of the Militia of Pocahontas - - and they are kept as scouts in Cheat Mt -- Mrs. A cooks all the provisions for his company -- she is a whole souled woman -- they have some chubby children -- they made me think of home -- Dr. Butcher lives at Huttonsville and he had to leave there when we came through -- his wife was sick -- had just been confined -- he has 4 children there -- one of his little girls had come over a few days before for a visit to her aunt here -- and now she is cut off from her mother -- she was close to her father all the while he was there &amp; felt very badly when we left today -- The Dr. heard from his home a few days ago -- the Yankees had taken all his books -- horses grain carriage &amp;c and they have sent away, in irons every Secessionist they can find, tho' they invited a good many of them to come back &amp; McClellan wrote to Dr. B. to come back, but as soon as they got any of them back they shut them up -- quite a good many got away lately -- they say there are not more than 8000 Yankees in W. Va -- and they are very much scared -- many of them are sick -- after they heard of the battle of Manassas they sent home the 8 bands they had at Beverly</p> <p> We come on this morning towards this place, passing through to Green Bank, where I saw <i>[unclear: Donaghe]</i> &amp; Francisco -- two of the C. <abbr expan="Cavalry">Cav</abbr> -- who had been out to Cheat on a scout -- we stopped at Mr. R. McCatchen's for dinner -- a cousin to Bob that used to go to school to me -- by the way Bob is a Union man &amp; is now at Beverly -- married to a woman that ruled him into such a course -- There were some 20 sick at Mr. McCatchen's &amp; the old lady was seeing to them all -- she is the only angel of mercy I have seen &amp; Miss Ewins at McDowell is the only other one I have heard of in all this <abbr expan="North West">N.W.</abbr> country -- more of the men have died for the want of nurses &amp; proper diet than any other cause -- the women here flee away from the army instead of coming to its aid &amp; cheering up the men by their presence -- there are enough of them here but they seem to think it indelicate or beneath them -- or something -- I do not know what -- to take care of the sick soldiers -- there are a great many sick here -- I can hear them groan here where I am from the upper story of the tavern which is converted into a hospital -- We met with an accident and shall be detained here part of tomorrow -- a wagoner was driving heedlessly along &amp; did not turn out as he ought and we had to get on a bank to avoid his wheels -- and that threw all the weight on one wheel &amp; it broke down -- every spoke broke -- but we pounded it together &amp; walked the last mile &amp; got here just before night -- there are 3 Regiments here -- one from <abbr expan="Georgia">Ga.</abbr> a <abbr expan="Tennessee">Tenn</abbr> -- <i>[unclear: one]</i> under the command of Gen. Donalson --the one that ran for Vice Pres. &amp; one Va -- there are some 8 or 10000 with Lee, 28 miles from here -- where I hope to get tomorrow -- then I shall know what I shall do. I hope you got the sugar &amp;c I sent you &amp; hope they were acceptable -- try &amp; keep in good spirits &amp; get along the best you can &amp; I hope I shall soon get home &amp; get all things arranged -- write to me to Monterey -- for I shall go back there in a day or so -- we expect a battle in Tygart's Valley every day -- Any quantity of love for you &amp; the children -- remember me to Allie &amp; other enquiring friends </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Truly Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.

Lilley presented me with a pair of Green flannel waist bands -- wide they are very nice &amp; comfortable -- write often -- I will send you some money or bring it early next week -- I cannot find any thread above No. 40</p></div>
