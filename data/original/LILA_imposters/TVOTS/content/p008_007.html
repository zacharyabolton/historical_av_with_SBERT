Indeed I do owe you many thanks for your punctuality in writing and for your long letters; they assist very much to relieve the monotony of camp life, but even that reason for appreciating them is small when compared with that of cultivating the friendship of one whom I love so much, though a recent acquaintance. But "time is measured by heart throbs not by figures on a dial".</p> <p>I am sorry that I am compelled to write with a pencil. I know that in going so far it must become very dimm, but it is almost impossible to procure ink and pens which will write, so that it has become an almost universal custom in the army--and I believe with soldiers at other places to write with a pencil.</p> <p>We are now encamped about six miles from Leesburg, eight from home and about half that from the enemy. At preasant we are living next door to a cornfield and of course live very well, as the owner is a patriotic Southerner and has given us full permission to pull and eat. Besides this my cousin and myself have a nice little box in one corner of our tent which is usually plentifully supplied with provisions from home. So you see as we have a private tent, made at home for us we live quite pleasantly and do not stand so much in and of your sympathies as you supposed. All this is very fine but I can't tell how long it will last we were ordered this morning to pack our knapsacks and be ready to march at a moment's warning, so by to- morrow we <u>may</u> be down on the river without either tent or bed other than one blanket. We have one company of howitzers attached to our Brigade, two of the pieces are here with our regiment and the other two have been down on the river for the last three days during which time they have fired upwards of a hundred rounds and killed a good many of the Yankees. One field officer was seen to fall dead after a fire on yesterday. When we cannot get provisions from home our fare is so bad that it is almost impossible to eat it unless near starvation. We can get enough grease by skimming the coffee to oil our boots, and the bread is much worse than the coffee. War is unpleasant, we all wish it over, but nevertheless I have seen very few soldiers who will not volunteer again when the time of their enlistment has expired.</p> <p>You ask if I do not think a just God will forgive those who kill the enemies of the South. I believe we need no forgiveness for ridding the earth of such as in defiance of justice and religion attempt to <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> the chains of slavery upon our glorious country. I think I could say like Pendleton after pointing his guns, "God have mercy on their sinful souls, and may this volley kill a thousand; fire boys". Indeed I long to begin the march to Washington. Thousands of Marylanders would flock to our standard if once we could cross the river. That ever brave little state has already sent over many to assist in the defence of Virginia's Soil and when fighting in their own land in defence of their homes how many more might we expect to join us. Kentucky alone has <i>[unclear: deceive]</i> me and acted the coward. The degenerate sons have disgraced their illustrious sires; may they soon repent and turn. Tennessee the old "volunteer state" has not changed and the Yankees will find that her sons are as brave now as when in Mexico the retreating <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> formed behind them. But I fear I shall weary even you with writing about the war; few persons would have had the patience to read even this much.</p> <p>We heard not long since from our Orderly Sergeant, who was taken prisoner in the battle of Manassa, he is confined in the capitol and treaded very kindly.</p> <p>I know you <u>cannot</u> wish more heartily than I do that I could be in Augusta once more. I know, with <u>you</u> for a guide and companion, I could never weary of rambling over that beautiful county. I am devoted to horseback riding and then with such company--it really makes me dissatisfied with camp life to think of its depriving me of such pleasure as that. But Bobby Burns says that "man was made to mourn" and the best way to obviate the necessity of always wearing a long face is to learn to bear disappointments with resignation.</p> <p>I received a letter from Chum a day or two after I last wrote to you and wrote him a long one in return.</p> <p>The evening you last wrote I was not on duty. I do not remember the dreams of that night but I can assure you that among my sleeping and waking fancies no form, oftener ads joy to the picture, than that of a lady in Mt. Solon. Two nights after you wrote I was on duty. I was very unwell and it was a dark, rainy night. No soft moon smiled on me, as I relieved the weary sentinels, to remind me of an absent dear one; but the dismal pattering of the rain accorded with the dull aching of my head and the despondency of my spirits. Then I could hardly believe any one <u>cared</u> <u>for</u> me, even now I can not imagine any one dreaming of <u>me</u>.</p> <p>You say that "you would freely die to save the life of one soldier". Who is that happy <u>one</u>? I will not tell. Confide in me. Does Georgia number him among her brave sons? From wherever he may hail he is the most fortunate of men. There is the drum for Battalion drill and Dress Parade so you must excuse me for two hours. </p> <p>Well Dress Parade is over at last and although supper is ready, it has not enough attraction to make me postpone any longer the conclusion of my little "chat" with you. The Battalion Drill is the hardest thing we have here, and as left guide of the company I have to notice all the time as the Major has an especial spite against me and is always trying to find some fault if possible. One of my great objections to camp life is the total disregard of Sunday. In fact our Sunday drills are generally the hardest for then we have so many visitors that the officers try to show off and nearly kill us in the attempt. You speak of the difference between Northern and Southern treatment of private citizens. This is especially marked in our Regiment, we are encamped at present in a union neighborhood, where most of the inhabitants are abolitionists and yet although secessionists have been robbed and driven from their homes only a few miles from here we take not a cent's worth without offering the cash for it.</p> <p>I shall write to you as often as possible that is if I do not think I could weary you. And please remember at the same time that <u>nothing</u> can give me greater pleasure than receiving your kind long letters as frequently as possible. An ambrotypist came to Leesburg last week and I was able to get a picture to leave with Ma if I am killed. I have been wishing for some time to get a good one for her and although this is not very good it will serve to recall to her mind how I looked as a soldier. Now you see I have written you the longest letter I have mailed for a long time and written punctually too, So you will greatly oblige me by following my good example.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>And believe me ever to <u>be</u> your <u>most</u> devoted and <u>unchanging</u> friend,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Clinton</p></div> <!---->
