I will now give you a brief history of our fight on monday, in which we suffered more severely than in any previous engagement. I will not say any thing of the fight on Sabath (as we were not in it) excepting early in the morning, our artillery repelled the enemy that were attempting to cross at Port <i>[unclear: Republic]</i>, after which the attack was made in our rear upon <abbr expan="General">Gen<sup>l</sup></abbr> <i>[unclear: Euel]</i>, he fought them hard nearly all day occupying the field at night - the loss was heavy on both sides. On monday morning we crossed the river &amp; proceeded down in the direction of Swift-Run Gap, our Train Crossing &amp; taking the Browns Gap road, we had not proceded far untill our batteries commenced shelling a piece of wood in which the enemy were encamped. Our batteries were soon responded to by the enemys, it was not long untill a <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <i>[unclear: my]</i> <i>[unclear: regiment]</i> on <i>[unclear: across]</i>. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> to support a <i>[unclear: battery]</i> which position we held for some time. We were then ordered forward (to meet the enemy who were advancing on our left) the 7<sup>th</sup> Louisiana being on our right, we had not proceeded far untill the firing commenced which was kept up for some time, our men fighting most nobly. <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg.</abbr> after <abbr expan="regiment">Reg.</abbr> of the yankees came up untill our men had obliged to give way, not however untill their ammunition was nearly exhausted. It was just about the time that our men commenced falling back that your Cousin James fell, he fought with as much bravery as ever did any man - he was in the act of loading at the time. John <i>[unclear: Bonbeck]</i> fell about the same time. Our reinforcements came up pretty soon &amp; it was not long untill we had them to use a vulgar expression, "schedadling". we pursued them some 6 or 8 miles taking some 300 prisoners. We also took <i>[unclear: 6]</i> officers of their best Artillery - <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut</abbr> McKeny &amp; myself took your Cousin James' &amp; <i>[unclear: Brukicks]</i> bodys &amp; carried them some distance up the river thinking that we <ins>might</ins> get an opportunity of sending them home - but the yankees came up on the opposite side, &amp; we were obliged to take them down the river further, we then concluded to bury them which we did as best we could. Our <abbr expan="Regiment">Reg.</abbr> lost 4 men killed &amp; 78 wounded. Our company 2 killed &amp; 12 wounded. Thus ended one of the bloodiest battles that we have witnessed. We then fell back to this place where we are perfectly safe. The Yankees are falling back it is said [next section written upside down at top of page] I think there is no doubt but we will be in the valley in a few days again, &amp; may yet be able to drive the invaders from off our soil. I shall expect to hear from you soon.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours in haste</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony Pastor</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>please dont show this miserably written sheet</p></div>
