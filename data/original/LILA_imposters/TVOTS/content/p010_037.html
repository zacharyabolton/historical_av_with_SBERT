We left Fredericsburg last friday and got to Culpeper to day. We are now camped on the road that leads to Sperryville Some think that we are going to the Valley and from there to Maryland &amp; Pennsylvania but I have no Idea myself where we are going all that I know is that I think it very probable there will be another battle near the Old Manassa fighting ground as the Yankees have all fallen back that way You should have been along to hear the cheering done by the men as they came in sight of the blue ridge many of them had not seen it since last fall when we crossed over from the valley. I must now close as I have not time to write we are cooking three days rations and I suppose the march will be resumed in the morning</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>nothing more but remain as ever your brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thomas M Smiley</p></div> <!---->
