I have instructed him to request of <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Clay the continued occupation of the rooms in the Court House until the decision at <abbr expan="Headquarters">H<sup>d</sup>Quarters</abbr> of the <abbr expan="Department">Dept.</abbr> could be made known, and I have respectfully to request that the upper (third) story of the Court House at Staunton may be reserved for the use of the Freedmens School, if it shall be found necessary to restore the other portions of the buildings to the Civil Authorities for their exclusive use.</p> <p>When I used the same rooms as offices in August and September last, I was personally cognizant of the fact that there was no desire for their use by the Civil Authorities, and that <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Clay gave unrestricted use of the portions occupied by him whenever desired for the purposes of the Civil Authorities.</p> <p>The <i>[unclear: wings]</i> of the building were at that time solely used by such authorities and the Central portion in question, if vacated by the Military Authorities would under ordinary circumstances seldom be occupied by the Civil Authorities oftener than once in the week, and for a part of that day.</p> <p>I am also aware that there is not another building in Staunton which can be used for that School and I respectfully protest against the destruction of an enterprise fraught with untold benefits to loyal freedmen, as distinguished from the <i>[unclear: converts]</i> to amnesty who now want possession of these rooms because they are used for that School.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am, Colonel &amp;c</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
