There is much difficulty in <br> getting a pass and means of conveyance <br> to the army and having procured the <br> former should have gone to Jackso <br> ns division to day, but for the heavy <br> and constant rain that have been <br> falling. I shall go tomorrow if poss <br> ible. It is not possible to get a sub <br> stitute in for Charles <sup>[2]</sup> until something <br> decisive has taken place betweeen the <br> contending armies, Jackson is <i>[unclear: move ing]</i> and fighting every dayâ€” this con <br> stancy of action precludes the possib <br> ility of getting in a substitute. The <br> news from the army is of the most <br> thrilling and complicated character; <br> the enemy is still unbroken and <br> formidable, and disputing every <br> inch of our advance with the <br> energy of despair. Our loss in killed <br> and wounded is frightful.<sup>[3]</sup> It is re <br> ported that Jackson was very seve <br> rely cut up yesterday in an effort <br> to storm the enemies batteries. He <br> finally succeeded but at great <br> loss. Our army commands the fla <br> nk and rear of the enemy but <br> the admirable order of the latter <br> leaves it much to be feared that <br> the crisis is yet to come. There has <br> been no Bull Run on this awful <br> field. It is quite a mistake to <br> suppose McClelland yet whipped, <br> the bloody catastrophe has yet to <br> come.<sup>[4]</sup> You may expect to hear from <br> me again as soon as I see the boys, <br> and should it be necessary to telegr <br> aph you I will do so. Mean <br> while write me by return <del hand="h1">m</del> mail if you wish me to remain <br> until I can get a substitute <br> received in the place of Charles.<br> If I find any misfortune has bef <br> allen him I will bring him home. <br> I have not heard anything of Mr. <br> Read with certainty no of Samuel <br> Brooks. I hope to be able tomorrow <br> to give you certain information <br> with regards to them. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Schyler">S.</abbr> Trible</div> <!---->
