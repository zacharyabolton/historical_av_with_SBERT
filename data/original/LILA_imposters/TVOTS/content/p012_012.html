Sidney -- they had buried old Mr. Hyde that day -- he got thrown from a wagon &amp; hurt. Dr. Moorman was buried the day before &amp; a Mr. Ross was brought home that day -- Charley was at home, he has been exempted on account of health, but is uneasy and longs for the excitement of camp life -- wants to go on some light duty -- he is now in very good health &amp; is fat. Miss Charlotte is about as usual -- very kind &amp; got me a nice supper &amp; breakfast -- Sheffey is tall and thin &amp; looks badly -- They have servants &amp; every thing seems to move nicely - - Mr. R -- lives in Staunton &amp; does not often get home except for a few hours -- he is in the Stable business at the Va. Hotel -- I came Friday to Peale's at the cross roads from Harrisonburg to McGaheysville -- had a very pleasant evening there -- where we put up when we left <abbr expan="Harrisonburg">H-g</abbr> and went to Conrad's Store The people have many surmises as to the object of my passing along taking notes -- &amp; I heard many strange reports -- One that I had selected a hill near Dayton for our winter quarters -- that report had spread widely. I could hardly make them believe that I only wanted to make a map of the country -- they suffered so much from the Yankee invasion of the Valley that they live in constant dread of a repetition of it and interpret everything that looks like a backward movement as ominous of danger -- they say Jackson is now where he was last year at this time -- therefore he will run the same round for next year; that is their logic -- </p> <p> I found it quite hard to take the weather again, after two days rest &amp; housed by a warm fire &amp; was quite chilly the first day, but got more used to it the second -- had a slight attack of diarhaea, but "the remedy" in the bottle checked it, and I am feeling very well now -- as well as such a raw and disagreable day will allow one to feel --</p> <p> I hope you did not get the blues badly after I left -- you must not get into such bad habits -- for I may be able to make short trips home every now and then, but if they depress as much as they enliven, or perhaps more, it wont do -- So cheer up and keep in good spirits -- the war must &amp; will end before long, one or two years more at the most, and if a Kind Providence spares our lives we may hope to again enjoy the blessing of peace, and with a keener relish from having experienced the evils and privations of a horrid war --.</p> <p> Write to me soon, I expect to get to Camp in one week -- not much before, as I have quite a round to make -- God bless and keep you all Kiss Anna &amp; Nelly for Pa --</p> <p> Good bye </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
