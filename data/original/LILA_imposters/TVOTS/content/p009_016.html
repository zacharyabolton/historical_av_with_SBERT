I like him very well, wish he would have stayed all day, so I could have heard him talk all more about you, he kindly offered to carry a letter to you. He preached for us yesterday morning, and if he preaches that way in camp he is sure to do some good. Please become well acquainted with him and always go <u>to meeting</u>. You have not written dear brother since you left us, wont you write me a few lines soon? I fear you did not enjoy your visit home much. did you. Sandie has been here for a couple of days went up to Rockbridge to see Lida. Cousin John is sick as he sent after him as he wants to come home. Saturday evening six girls and six gentlemen left here to take a ride. I was in the party and we almost froze to death we had to get off at some person's house &amp; warm ourselves. When Sandy came home he told a tale about Ashers coming home I went down to the cars two evenings in succession to meet him. The second evening we met Cousin Will who had come up from Richmond and he said that he had been down to see the boys and they were expecting a fight so he advised Asher to stay until it was over. He has the furlough though and can come home when he wants to. It is so terribly cold today. I wonder if you are warm enough. Has Fred returned to camp yet. rather has he reached there. I do hope you whipped the Yankees good this last time.</p> <p>Sisters children have been quite sick (Allie &amp; Lewis) poor little Leslie is still so. They have the whooping cough also. Sister Lizzie and her boys get a long very well. They do not go to school. She (I think she said so) teaches them at home. Mag &amp; Margie came out here for me to go to Mrs. Opie's but as the young preacher was here I would'nt go. I knew Mary Opie was not at home too. I told them so but they did not want to know it.</p> <p>Did you read the books you carried with you. Mrs. Forest &amp; Jennie L are going to try to get North as far as Washington. Jennie said she would take a letter for me so I'll honor cousin Mab so far as a letter will go. <del hand="h1">Maggie told me if I would carry a letter</del> I stayed with <del hand="h1">Marge</del> Aunt Nancy last night &amp; we had a fine breakfast this morning. Tommie if you ever want those three dollars I asked you for Xmas send me word and you shall have them. I never intend and never so intended spending them. I only asked for them to keep you from spending them in some useless thing which you would not want. Perhaps some day you'll need three dollars <u>little as it now may seem.</u></p> <p>Ma spoke to Mr. Maury as though he had the charge of you telling him to take particular care of you. he said he was very young himself. I wish you could come home and have a nice time. and a nice long furlough.</p> <p>Lewis writes home frequently I believe. I wish you would do so too my dear Tommie.</p> <p>Pa got two hogs and Ma is busy making sausage and cutting them up. don't it seem queer just to have two hogs at a butchering. We killed our <u>poor</u> little calf Friday which was a great distress to Nellie. I have written rather a longer letter than usual. and now my distress is where I will get an envelope. I really cannot raise but one and that has a United States postage stamp on it.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Good bye now my dear brother please write soon to your sister.</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Addie</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Really if someone is not going down to the Cavalry I cannot write to you for I do not know what Post Office you are near.</p></div>
