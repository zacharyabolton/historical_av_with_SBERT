I hope that you will forgive my negligence and I will try to do better in the future. I am happy to inform you that I am now enjoying good health since I have been in camp. We have good times here now. All are in good spirits, have plenty to eat and good cabins to stay in and not much to do. The Guard duty is not very heavy now. We are only required to furnish Four men for guard per day. I have not seen cousin John Baylor since I received your letter but he is well and looks as fat as a "pig." James Cook is well he was in our cabin this morning but I did not see him. Lewis Dull is well and in good spirits he sends his respects to you all. He is a good soldier and a good companion but not worth a cent to "cook," but it would not do to tell him so. <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> John Lambert has not returned to camp yet. I have not heard from him for some time. Our men are nearly all here now.</p> <p>While I was writing the other side, Corporal Zimmerman came into the captains cabin and drew a pint of "Summerdean" and of course for politeness I did not refuse to taste but you need not be uneasy about me getting tite for I do abhor a drunken man. "Liquor" demands an enormous price here now and there is a great quantity of it used here.</p> <p>There is nothing more that I can think of that would be of interest to you therefore I shall come to a close. Give my love to all inquiring friends and a portion to yourself. Write soon, Direct your letter to -</p> <p>G. E. Crist Company J 52<sup>nd</sup> <abbr expan="Regiment Virginia Volunteers">Reg.
