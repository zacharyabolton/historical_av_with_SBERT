Mr Willgar as the teacher in charge of the school, charges $125 <abbr expan="cents">cts</abbr> per month for a scholar he boarding himself, which I think very reasonable for these times. Willgar is an Englishman by bearth, he is a man of good education, reads well, writes an excellent hand, strictly reliable, a member of a Christian Church, and I would say he is the man as he has the confidence of the colored people of this neighborhood. He is a poor man, makes his living be days work. I fear unless you procure some funds, or assist, he will be the <i>[unclear: loser]</i>, which will be hard on his family, but I hope for better things, I understood you to say that Wm H Willgar should come well recommended, and that you would like for me to sign it in my official character, that I will do if you desire it at any time, if you will send me a farm, or if you wish it, you can get the many respectable men in this neighborhood to <i>[unclear: sign]</i> it I superintended a sabbath school last summer and they numbered 66 old and young, all anxious to learn to read, I suppos the school will be resumed next summer, I do hope that you will be prompt in attending to this matter, so we may know what to depend on. They are poor and in want of help and through me they ask you for help.</p> <p>please let me hear from you soon</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>yours respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Wm W Montgomery</p></div> <!---->
