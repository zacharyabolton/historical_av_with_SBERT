We left our old camp 5 miles below Winchester on friday the 21<sup>st</sup>, crossing the <i>[unclear: Massanutten]</i> Mountain at New Market. We then marched up the river towards Swift Run Gap to the ford near the "Columbia Bridge" (which was burnt by <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Ashby to prevent <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Shields from cutting off our forces in their retreat from Winchester to Port Republic) where we crossed &amp; proceeded to the Blue Ridge, crossing into Madison County about 12 miles from the Court House and on the road leading directly to Gordonsville. We are now about 16 miles from that place on the road leading from Madison C.H. to Orange C.H. and about 1 mile from the former place. We have travelled over 100 miles being on the march 6 days. I must say that I have never passed over such a country before &amp; hope I never shall again. Some times we would travel for two miles &amp; not be over one hundred yards from where we started, I mean in a straight line. We were one whole day crossing the mountain, &amp; then didn't get over. lay one night in the mountain amongst the rocks &amp; brush with no covering. Save what could be made of oil cloths &amp; blankets it being to rough to pitch tents. rained all night. what you think of that? Well I have no news, so I will have to confine myself to <u>nonsense</u>. We seen some right pretty mountain <u> lassas </u> who did not seem affraid to show their <i>[unclear: lincy]</i>, &amp; then we saw some that were most intolerable ugly, have not had the pleasure of seeing any of the Tucahoe Galls around camp yet. Think I shall walk out after I get rested &amp; see if there are any to be found &amp; it may be that I may get a good dinner by the operation. by the way just cook there. John &amp; James Beard have just come in with a fine lot of persimmons so I will have to stop &amp; eat a while &amp; then finish. Well I have eatten my satisfaction of them things for <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> my mouth <i>[unclear: ain't]</i> more than half as big as it was &amp; I firmly believe if I had eatten a while longer I woldn't have had any <i>[unclear: attall ]</i>. I will now give you some idea of the prices we have to pay for our little nicknacks. Apples the size of <i>[unclear: milled]</i> walnuts sell at a 1$ per day. Half moon <i>[unclear: pris]</i> with two cherries in 75 cents a piece, other things in proportion. <i>[unclear: Passed]</i> from two four dollars per <i>[unclear: quire]</i> Envelopes <i>[unclear: 1$]</i> a pack. So you see how we poor soldiers have to do, &amp; under go.</p> <p>I have heard nothing said about the Yankees since we came here, dont know whether they are still advancing or not. Our whole army is on this side of the Ridge, making preparations to meet Burnside in his advance upon Richmond, which I suppose from all accounts will not be long. My impression is that we will go to Richmond before long some of the troops it is said are going off on the cars now. well I must bring this to close, as I am too cold to write any more.</p> <p>Give my love to all enquiring friends &amp; <del hand="h1"></del> a larger portion to yourself. excuse all mistakes <i>[unclear: burn]</i> <i>[unclear: when]</i> you have done</p></div> <!----> <!----> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.<br> Direct to Gordonsville when you write again &amp; if we are there I'll get it &amp; if we go on it will follow.
