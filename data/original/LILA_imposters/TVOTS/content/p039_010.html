If I should live to write again it will not be from the hills but <u>mountains</u>. The grand &amp; glorious mountains where I can breathe the pure fresh air of <i>[unclear: Virginia]</i>. I have your dear &amp; welcome letter of the 5th I was so sorry to read that you were not well my love &amp; I am truly glad that you are not going to ride again in the night air. I hope you never may have to do so. it is not good for your health &amp; then it is not safe for you to ride after night. I always feel so anxious a bout you. Do you not think you would improve very much if you were to be more moderate in smoking I do certainly believe you would feel better my love I have never said a great deal to you against the habit as you seem to enjoy smoking so much &amp; I do love to see you enjoy any thing. but it would be best for you if you could only smoke occasionally or not at all. I was so sorry that you left last Monday without your breakfast &amp; I did not get to give you Goodby. I did wish you could have staid until sunrise. I felt lonely all day Monday after you were gone I missed you sadly my love &amp; always do when you leave. my home has lost its dearest happiness when you leave it. I wish from my heart that you were here to night. Oh how glad &amp; happy I shall be when you come &amp; spend a week with me in our new home. it will be so sweet to have you there to stay more than one day &amp; night &amp; I shall try &amp; do all I can to make you happy &amp; feel at home. I hope we shall spend many very delightful &amp; happy hours with each other at Buffalo but you must promise me that you will not ride after night. your health &amp; life are too dear to me not to be anxious &amp; unhappy when I feel that you are exposed to danger in the lone hours of night. I shall be ready to go up with you next Sabbath if we live &amp; will remain in Staunton a few days then I can have the dear privilege of seeing you often while I am there. how I do love to be where I can see you. I can scarcely wait for the time to come I am so anxious. Hamie has just arrived &amp; tells me you are well again I am so glad to hear it, &amp; that you are coming for me if you live early Saturday evening. May God guide you safely here. I love you with all the deep unchanging devotion of my heart &amp; Soul &amp; ever shall while I have life. No one on all the wide Earth is so dear to my heart as you are my only love. I can never tell fully how much &amp; how devotedly I do love &amp; cherish every thought of you. I love you only of all in the world. All send love. I send a loving kiss to you &amp; a hope soon to be with you. May God bless you my love. This last letter to you from Mt. Solon says Goodby. Come my love I want to see you Oh so much. I love you only</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mollie Sibert</p></div> <!---->
