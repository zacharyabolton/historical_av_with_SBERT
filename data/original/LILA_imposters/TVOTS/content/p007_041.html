Heck, I write to you to ask that you will have our regiment reorganized as it was before, by having an exchange of prisioners with the Lincoln government, if posssible, that our Captains and privates may come back to the regiment, as they all desire, and that we may again be put under the command of Col. Heck- who had and still has the respect and confidence of all who were formally under his command and whose conduct, in trying circumstances, was worthy of all praise, and his last act before the surrender, urging another attempt to escape and showing that it was practicable (and it was proven to have been so by the fact that soon after he did so he did escape) proves that he was worthy to command.</p> <p>I am sure that you will endeavor yourself more than ever to a large number of the best men of Augusta, Rockbridge, Pendelton, Highland, and Upsher if you will grant as yours did and the power you have in the matter, in reorganizing a regiment that was a credit to the state when complete and in active service, and that when broken by the fortunes of war has kept up its own organization, and all of its members have kept immaculate the honor of the state in the midst of insubordination and misconduct on the part of other regiments. Therefore with the most confidence we ask this favor of your excellency.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours most respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Jedediah">Jed.</abbr> Hotchkiss, Act.
