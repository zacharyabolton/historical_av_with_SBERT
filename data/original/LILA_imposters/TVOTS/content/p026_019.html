We would also open schools at Waynesboro and Brownsburg if we had suitable rooms for them.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Respy</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>N.
