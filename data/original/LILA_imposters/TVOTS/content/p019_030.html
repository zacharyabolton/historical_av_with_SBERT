Mr Spencer said he would take it down on one of his wagons for us. Mag says to write as soon as you can about the cloak cloth and let her know the price she wants the real cloak or beaver cloth if you can get it she says not to go over $125.00 per yard but for my part I had rather you would not to any expense about mine unless you think you can get a bargain there is twelve <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> of this cloth and it would not take more than 7 1/2 or 8 <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> off the beaver cloth, if you do get it send it by some reliable person, the cloth looks very well now but Mag is affraid it will stay so long. We wrote to you monday and I suppose you will get it before you receive this one I wrote in it for some white flannel 4 or 5 <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> if you can get it I will be very glad I cannot get any here there was some in Staunton but it was very coarse and looked like it was mixed with dark wool. Pa is here they are all well except cold he brought a few apple over and we will send them to you. More Paxton's family have nearly all had diptheria they are getting better now. we are all well. I believe I have no news to write. write soon. <ins>We directed the box to you in care of Tyler &amp; son.</ins> Mag received your letter yesterday she says she is going to look for you home in a few days. Hannah says she will write to you in a few days.
