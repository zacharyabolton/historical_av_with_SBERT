Jackson. Our encampment is a very pretty one, in a beautiful pine grove, on the bank of the Shenandoah River. The surrounding country is exceedingly beautiful rivalling any in natural charm that I have ever seen.</p> <p>I felt sad when we left Winchester. although it is a very corrupt place in my estimation still there are a great many there who ar true and loyal to the South + it was hard to leave them to the mercies of those who have no hearts to feel even for themselves or others. Some were laughing + some crying as we came through town + there were many sad partings too - Two companies in our <abbr expan="regiment">reg'mt</abbr> were principally made up in Winchester, + these were forced to part with those near and dear to them.</p> <p>They were compelled to have mothers + sisters + wives, + little ones, who were all they had on Earth to love, + leave them too, without a hope of seeing them again + no prospect of hearing from them. I had to cry myself when I came through Strausburg. The doors + pavements were filled with ladies old + young + even the little children were weeping <u>forced</u> to do so by the tears of their Mothers + Sisters. Such scenes are romantic, but I envy them not their feelings, when they feel themselves cut of from their friends + left to the tender mercies of those <u>black hearted traitors</u>, who are strangers to mercy. <i>[unclear]</i> there is a time of retribution coming a time when we can relieve the broken hearted + lift them from the dust into which they have been trampled by the unhallowed foot of the oppressor.</p> <p>Our last stopping place was between Woodstock + Edinburg; we stayed there one night. It was the most romantic place I ever saw. Right on the edge of a high cliff on the side of the Shenandoah River. The cliff is on one side of the turnpike + the railroad on the other side crosses a deep chasm on trussel work 130 feet high. I will send you some Spruce Pine that I got there. I must write some to your Ma.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.R.M.</p></div> <!---->
