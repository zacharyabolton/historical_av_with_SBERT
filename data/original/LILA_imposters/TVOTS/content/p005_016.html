I did this for two reasons--first because I thought it was right--and secondly because I found it would be a difficult matter for <u>me</u> to spare the 500$ from the source I expected--or rather a doubtful matter for me to get it. Your father mentioned the stringency of money matters with him--and did not see <i>[unclear: well here]</i> he was to do it. I then proposed to advance $250 and that he should advance a like sum. He at once agreed to do this. The money to be sent you one day this week before I leave. We parted with that understanding.</p> <p>On yesterday I was down street a little while &amp; met him again--He told me that after going home he thought over the matter--and as tight as money was withhim he had determined to lend you the whole amount himself--not as a Loan as I had proposed, but as an <u>advancement</u>--That that sum would do you more good now than would the amount hereafter--I told him I had no doubt of it and approved heartily what he proposed to do--So this matter is off your shoulders--I also named the Alec. Wills matter to him--but that is out of his power--and I cant see how that can be arranged--I wish it could for it would make you $600 very easily--But you will have to let it go unless you can strike some old fellow with money who will advance it and divide profits with you.</p> <p>I have been unwell more or less ever since I came home--and for the two last days confined to the house with the same complaint I had in <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>--It got a great deal worse--On Friday I sent for Dr. Baldwin who has put me nearly all right again. I hope by tomorrow to be entirely well--</p> <p>I found a letter here awaitingme on my return from <i>[unclear: Mr. McPhail]</i>. We leave for Kentucky on next Thursday--the 11th.</p> <p>If I can get my matters fixed up tomorrow I will go to <i>[unclear: Charlotte]</i> on Tuesday--If I fail in this I will not leave till Thursday morning and then meet Mr. McPhail in Lynchburg Thursday morning.</p> <p>All our folks are well--With love to Coz. Liz and the children, I am as ever</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.
