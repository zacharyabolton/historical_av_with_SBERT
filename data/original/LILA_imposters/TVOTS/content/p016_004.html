Knowing that there was now one at Granmas to attend to your wounds as they had been attended to. But I hope, that you have met with some kind friend there who will wait on you well. We are all tolerable well now but Abram &amp; Christian have been very sick. Abram had the dyptheria last week he is not able to do any thing yet so I have been very busy you may know waiting on them. I would have like to have come to have seen you if I could have done so before now. I received the package from Miss Mary Baylor after you left with the coat &amp; buttons also <del hand="h1">from</del> a letter from her, stating how you were &amp; that they missed you very much, was the last account that I had from you. Miss Mary is a very nice girl &amp; I do not know how you will ever compensate for <del hand="h1">your</del> her kindness to you. I am in hope that <u>God</u> will reward her for her kindness towards a soldier. I received a letter from your brother John last week he was very well He wanted one flannel shirt badly. I have it ready for him now. I sent him since I came home one <abbr expan="pair">pr</abbr> slips one shirt &amp; 1 <abbr expan="pair">pr</abbr> socks. He wrote to me he did not want his pants until later in the season towards Spring. We heard on yesterday that the old <u>Stonewall</u> Brigade was in Staunton. I hope it is so, so that, I can send him a box of provisions &amp; his shirt. I have it all ready for him.. Charlie your coat is done &amp; finished yesterday ready for you to wear. I would like to know if Granma is going to give you a pair of pants or not, if she is I will not make yours now, for I will run short myself. I have to give Jonnie a pair, I would like to know how you are to get your coat, I think you had better try to come after it as I would like to see you very much. Give my love to your Granma &amp; to Edgar's girls, tell Uncle Kemp he must save my ham of meat for me, that it is a long time a coming but it will be mighty good when I get it. Write to me very soon Charlie as I am very anxious to hear from you. I am looking for a letter from Miss Mary this week. The family all join in sending love &amp; accept a portion from your mother. Come soon nothing more but remain your Mother until death,</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>M L Roadcap</p></div> <!---->
