I have been over the ridge to Culpeper <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> to see Gen. Lee, and had to come back by the way of New Market, a long circuit, but necessary for safety, as the enemy was along the base of the Ridge and rapidly advancing, though I hear that they have fallen back now. I was on the battlefield of Cedar Run, a portion of our army was encamped there. The evidences of the hotly contested field are plain to be seen. I enquired for Grinnan at Culpeper, and it was said he was in prison; for what or where I did not learn. I suppose he has been taken by a conscript officer, as he has not been on duty since he got well. Our army, that is Gen. Jackson's corps, is still in the lower end of the Valley, and I hope we may stay here, as the best check we can have on any advance of the enemy. We are skirmishing occasionally near the Blue Ridge, and we have taken a good many prisoners. 120 went up to Staunton a few days ago, and there are some 150 here today. It is said the enemy has been destroying everything before it, turning up the cornfodder in the fields, where they advanced in Loudon and Fauquier Co's. I do not know how true it is. I hope to come up soon. I must rest my horse. I wrote to you to keep my coat and boots until I sent or came. I hope you have got them, especially the boots. The crop of corn is fearfully short where I have been, and not much wheat sown, but I hope there will be enough. Buy some potatoes if you can. This is charming weather. I hope you have been able to seed a good deal. Put in all you can. My love to all the family. Write to me. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff.</abbr> brother,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
