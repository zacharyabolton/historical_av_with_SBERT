Oh I do indeed love you more &amp; more every hour of my life. I feel that I am sinning by giving to you the love of both <u>heart</u> &amp; <u>soul</u> I sin because I think more of you then of my God which makes you my Idol. I know this should not be &amp; my most earnest prayer is that God will moderate my affection so it will receive His holy blessings &amp; smiles.
