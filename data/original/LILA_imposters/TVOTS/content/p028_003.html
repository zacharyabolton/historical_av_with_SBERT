On account of scarcity of funds the Society will be obliged to discontinue its labors the last of June, for the present season. There are several important places by Bloomsbury, Waynesboro, New Market and Port Republic where there have never been schools. We have some teachers who are so accustomed to the climate, that they would stay through the summer and open schools at these places if they could be supported. If the Bureau would aid to the amount of $20.00 twenty dollars per month, <ins>(for each teacher)</ins> with what the people themselves could do, we could start several new schools during the Summer.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Re'y</abbr> Yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>N.C.
