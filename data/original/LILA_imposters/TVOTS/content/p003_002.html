I have written books and papers here connected with my congressional life, and if I had I am not aware that any would furnish any evidence on the subject to which you allude.</p> <p>Of one thing I am certain and that is that I never felt any unfriendly feeling to the South, and that no act of mine, public or private, ever indicated it.</p> <p>I perceive the Richmond Enquirer has published an article, containing a <i>[unclear: pretinched]</i> extract from some remarks of mine, as to printing a petition in reference to the abolition of slavery or the slave trade in the district of Columbia in 1835. I have cut the extract from a paper and herewith enclose it. I can not say whether the extract be true or false, but admitting its truth, I am made to say that "<u>I disclaim most unequivocally now and forever any desire on my part to interfere with the rights or what is termed the property of citizens of other states</u>."</p> <p>That I expressed this sentiment I have little doubt if I spoke at all--and really I don't see anything in it like abolition or unfriendliness to the South.</p> <p>But I am utterly opposed on any condition whatever to writing any letter now for publication; and I generally decline all answers, believing that no good but much harm results from letter writing by candidates. My friendship for and confidence in you however, has induced me to depart from the rule and I regret that I am not able to refer you to something you desire.</p> <p>I send you however the leading Cass paper in this State, the Albany Argus, by which you will perceive that Mr. Giddings at the late antislavery convention at Worcester denounces me in common with Cass and Taylor.</p> <p>My official engagements are so pressing that I have little time for private correspondence but I shall be most happy to hear from you often.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Sincerely &amp; Truly<br>Your Friend,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Millard Fillmore</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Hon A.
