He dined with us to day, and desires me to say that he will not return, until he can realise a pocket full, and that the finding of this new bed of mineral, will detain him three weeks at least over his alloted time He is in <u>jubilant</u> <u>spirits</u>, and has invited Nan and myself to visit the mine this week: he has five or six miners, and is throwing outthe mineral beautifully. Nan will answer your letter very soon, she begs to be remember'd to you. Sadie, Min and Ellie send a kiss. Rex &amp; Miller have removed their <u>entire</u> <u>stock</u> of dry goods &amp;c, in the store house on this place, over the creek. Will is as much devoted to his store as ever, and is as <u>lively</u> as ever.</p> <p>There have been several weddings around us since you left, Nan attended quite a large wedding party at Fancy Hill, and expects to attend one at Botetout next week. We have been confined pretty closely to the house, the roads have been too heavy to make riding plesant, and as to walking--you know how much we do of that.</p> <p>Our Sewing Machine has proved a treasure, and wehave been kept pretty busy with it, and have accomplished a great deal with it. I have been writing several letters, and I believe ought to write as many more this evening, so as I have nothing very interesting to tell you, will make my letter very short. Nan will write you after the wedding of next week is over. Much love in which Nan joins from </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Emma W.
