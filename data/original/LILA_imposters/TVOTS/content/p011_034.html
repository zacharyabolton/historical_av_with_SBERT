Marched again<br> on 16th to a point five miles beyond<br> Orange <abbr expan="Court House,">C.H.,</abbr> and in sight of the Yankee Camp<br> and remained there four days drawing and<br> cooking rations almost every day so as to<br> keep three days provisions on hand.<br> Yesterday we again took up the line of<br> march and advanced towards the enemy,<br> our route being to the right of the railroad,<br> and encamped near a little town called<br> Stephensburg. This morning <del hand="h1">morning</del> we took<br> an early start—crossed the Rail<br> Road at Brandy Station and are now within two<br> miles of the Rappihannock. The enemy are<br> on the further bank for the purpose of<br> preventing or retarding our advance, and<br> considerable cannonading has been going<br> on across the stream. The Yankees retrea<br> ted from Culpeper <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> yesterday lea<br> ving twelve hundred wounded men. A cavalry skirmish occurred yesterday, in<br> which sixty prisoners were taken and the<br> Yankees routed. Most of the dwelling hou<br> ses along the road have been deserted by<br> the whites and left to the fate of war.<br> The country down here is generally flat<br> and poor, but in the neighborhood of Or<br> ange <abbr expan="Court House">C.H.</abbr> are many splendid fields of<br> corn, which continually tempt<br> the soldier to trespass. Our cavalry and some artil<br> lery have succeeded in crossing the river<i>[unclear: .]</i><br> Our cavalry have just captured twenty<br> five Yankees and two Ambulances. <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr><br> Lee is here in command. <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Stuart and his Cavalry are here.<sup>[2]</sup> </p><p> I sent to Waynesboro last week by Mr Da<br> vidson <del hand="h1">$2006</del> $206.00; $94.00 for Andrew<br> and the remainder for myself. You take your<br> pay out of it, and as I am not getting<br> home very fast will have to make the<br> trade in pants we spoke of, which<br> will leave me in your debt—$21.00. I<br> would like to have the pants by the<br> first chance you have of sending them.<br> Mr. Hill declines going in as a substitute<sup>[3]</sup><br> and I have heard nothing more of the<br> man of <abbr expan="Second Regiment">2nd Regt.</abbr>; dont think he has ever<br> returned. Saw James White <sup>[4]</sup> a few days<br> ago; said Andrew was looking quite thin having been reduced by scanty fare. I sent<br> the little sword I spoke of to Waynesboro<br> by Harry Arnall, who is discharged. Please<br> say in your next <ins>letter</ins> whether you got the money;<br> disliking to carry it—I thought best to<br> send it even by indirect means. On Mon<br> day All our wagons were taken from us<br> except enough to have cooking utencils<br> and officers baggage and our mess box<br> es thrown out and bags substituted. So<br> we have to tote our little all on our<br> backs, which with gun cartridge box<br> and haversack containing three days<br> rations is quite burdensome.<sup>[5]</sup> Four or<br> five boys broke down yesterday. Tom<br> White Jno and Henry Myres are in a very<br> fair way of getting transfers <del hand="h1">of</del> to Cav<br> alry.<sup>[6]</sup> I forgot to say that James White<br> told me that there were two men in his<br> company who would probably be discharged<br> who might be got as substitutes.<br> I will soon need a hat and would like<br> to have a pocket-ink stand and penn holder<br> if <del hand="h1">they</del> this can be bought. Will also take one<br> of your homemade pocket books if you<br> <del hand="h1">can m</del> have an extra one or can convenient<br> ly make one. Andrew had better have<br> his knapsack as small as possible, they can be drawn here. Suppose I may think of this as Aunt<br> Mary's<sup>[7]</sup> bridal day, if so, may it be an<br> era of happiness in her life. </p> <hr> <p>Got your long looked for letter<br> this morning. Tell Andrew and Mary I wish<br> they were as good at writing as promising. We<br> are still near the Rappinock, not crossed yet<i>[unclear: .]</i><br> A considerable amount of cannonading has been<br> going on and some picket firing. Hoped the Yan<br> kees leave last night. How much <i>[unclear: more]</i> pleasant<br> it would be to be tasting Aunt Ma<br> ry's wedding cake then eating hard crackers<br> and listening at the whistling of <del hand="h1">that</del> cannon<br> balls, but it is all for the best. <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Long<br> street is on another road.<sup>[8]</sup> I dont think<br> there will be much <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <ins>fighting</ins> just now.<br> Would be very glad if Andrew could change his<br> branch of service or get a substitute. Three<br> men were shot last Monday as deserters.<sup>[9]</sup><br> One by the name of Andrew G. Riddle of Augusta<br> and an other, Mr. Layman, most probably a <i>[unclear]</i><br> Waynesboro. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Love to all at home<br> and at Uncle Ben's <sup>[10]</sup> Your affectionate Son,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Charles</p></div> <!---->
