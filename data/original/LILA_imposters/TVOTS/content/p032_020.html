I have been depending altogether upon Mr. Brackett to supply Staunton with teachers. Have not had communication with him, but took it for granted that he would supply. If he does not, the best I can do, so far as I can see, at present is to send a young lady there. I could do that at once, if you think it best. Then if none other could be provided, you would have her and she is an experienced teacher and a very good lady. This lady will be at my house probably tomorrow, and must be sent to some of the many applicants within a few days. The charitable societies are "hard up". I don't think you will get a man. If Mr. Brackett should supply at all, I suppose he would be glad to be relieved of the support of one teacher. Please reply at once, and I will be governed by your judgment.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Resp.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>R.
