It appears that merit and ability afford no guarrantee for success, but that the greatest blusterer is to be the man.</p> <p>Your friends all know that you was the man, not only for your district, but for the whole state, and it is a public calamity that the country cannot have the benefit of your services in the next Congress.</p> <p>I understand that Judge C. Member from your county is making great efforts to concentrate the consolodation vote in his favour for the Senate. A friend told me that he had seen a letter from Genl. Mahone to a member saying that if he had the selection of the next Senate it would be Judge C. and it is upon that letter that the forces are being collected.</p> <p>I have been so much occupied with the State Fair and other matters that I have given but little thought to the subject myself. Know of nothing discouraging, my <abbr expan="friends">frds</abbr> say they are sanguine, but no one can tell how it will go. I should be pleased to hear from you occasionally</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Your friend">Yr frd</abbr></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.
