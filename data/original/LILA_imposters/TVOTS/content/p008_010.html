We were very much indebted to <abbr expan="Captain">Cap.</abbr> Baldwin, for making our time as pleasant in Richmond as it was <abbr expan="through">thro</abbr> his politeness &amp; attention, we were able to see the manufacture of war instruments, from the percussion cap &amp; minie ball, up to the Dalgreen gun &amp; rifled Cannon. Ellen had a very pressing invitation to spend her time in the country a few miles down Jame's River, and I was very near availing myself of it &amp; pay a visit to Manassas on Saturday, which would have <i>[unclear: enabled]</i> me to see the great fight of the 21st. But having no suspicion that another battle would have followed so soon the one of the 18th, &amp; not having heard from Home and the cotton gathering season with in a few days, I unfortunately left on Saturday morning.</p> <p>We had a long tedious trip to orleans -- so much detention from long trains of Cars loaded with Soldiers, that we were detained in Bristol all day on Sunday, and <i>[unclear: delayed]</i> another day in Loudon from a wash in the road caused by the horrid rains I had seen fall for some time. The Battle of Manassas had preceded us of course, and the war fever was raging along the road in N. Orleans and at Home, with ten fold more violence than when I left.</p> <p>I found a Boat in Orleans ready for the mouth of the Red River, from which plain we took steps for Alexandria, and reached home within two hours of three weeks from the time I left. I found the crops of corn &amp; cotton any thing we would desire--the first enough to bread us for two years in a pinch &amp; the latter promising an abundant yield. But for the last two weeks we have a <i>[unclear: suspicion]</i> of rain that rarely falls in our Summers--bringing in their <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> too, two of the most destructive pests that the Crop is subject to--Boll worm &amp; Cotton <i>[unclear: pitter]</i>. Several of my neighbors are now complaining that their crops are half eaten up. I see very few in mine yet. We have also had Typhoid Fever all around us, but have escaped yet, <abbr expan="though">th'o</abbr> Robert thinks we had two cases among the servants while I was about. We have had &amp; are now having a great deal of little <i>[unclear: fever]</i> among our field hands, only lasting two or three days, but interferes very much with our Cotton picking. One planter on Bayou Bocuffe had forty to come in on one day.</p> <p>The War Spirit is not abating, but burns as brightly as ever, Companies are mustering or passing down <i>[unclear: every week]</i>--With a voting population of about 1400 our Parish has sent of eight companies &amp; now raising a Battalion of Horse. Our Wives &amp; Daughters are busily engaged in Knitting socks &amp; making flannel under clothing for the army in Virginia--all the latter article has been exhausted in our Town &amp; we had to send to orleans for a supply, and the sewing machine &amp; the busy fingers are going from morning till night. I believe our women have more Patriotism than our men, and the latter would flag sometimes but for the former--not for love of Country, but for want of energy--but the Ladies give them no <i>[unclear: rest]</i>, it is go ahead with <i>[unclear: things]</i> here <i>[unclear: &amp; forever]</i>. This war with all its ills of losses &amp; suffering &amp; blood is better for us than <abbr expan="would">wd.</abbr> have been peaceful separation.</p> <p>There are many here on our confines, many in Texas &amp; many of our French Creoles, who never go from home, &amp; have heard perhaps of Virginia Maryland &amp; <abbr expan="North">N</abbr> Carolina, but know no more about them &amp; care as little as for Canada or Cuba--This war will bring them all in contact--Bull Run &amp; Manassas-Richmond &amp; Winchester--Blue Ridge &amp; Arlington Heights--the by paths &amp; crossroads will be familiar as their own Prairies &amp; Canebrakes--they will fight too side by side &amp; eat together &amp; lie down together--&amp; many will become familiar &amp; go down to their childrens children, where they fight their battles or <i>[unclear: gain]</i> by the fireside-- <i>[unclear: Who has brot out too]</i> the character of the <i>[unclear: Raw]</i> from whom we have separated a People who for generations, for love of money &amp; gain, had <i>[unclear: concealed]</i> a perfidy, hypocrisy and bloodthirstyness unequaled in the history of civilization. I doubt whether races ever change their organic nature--the Catacombs of Egypt have revealed the fact that the negro is the same formation to day that he had three thousand years ago, and the Yankee is the same now that he was in the time of Cromwell, hypocritical, <i>[unclear: agrarian]</i> and hating of other <del hand="h1"></del>--It is the same now that it was more than two hundred years ago--the Saxon against the Norman, the Puritan &amp; Cavalier, and at this time Mason &amp; Dixons line divids two Races as different, as the Irish &amp; the English, the Gaul &amp; the German.</p> <p>As well might the Indian &amp; the White man live together as equals as the Southern &amp; the Yankee. The Huguenot is the same now he was in the time of Henry the 4th brave, faithful &amp; religious &amp; the Cavalier the same bold, <i>[unclear: unchanaged]</i>, high toned gentleman, as when he fought &amp; gave his life for Charles the 1st.</p> <p>I wish the separation had been in an earlier day of my life--I <abbr expan="would">wd.</abbr> like to live to see the South have a fair &amp; untrammeled start in the race of Peoples, for I think She is destined to be as far superior to all others as the <i>[unclear: Caucasian]</i> was to the Mongol &amp; others.</p> <p>With a climate comprising nearly all the degrees of the temperate zone, from the region of the apple to the orange; from that of the hemp to the wheat, to the cotton &amp; sugar, with mountains containing all of the minerals of the world, to the plains covered with cattle in countless herds, with an excess of surplus of Cotton Sugar &amp; Tobacco alone of 300000000 and a people as brave &amp; chivalrous as the Romans in the height of fame, why should we not be the greatest people in the world?</p> <p>Could there be a more significant sign &amp; more illustrative of the two races, than the horrors of the present Northern cabinet--Abraham, Simon, Gideon, Solomon, Caleb, and Hannibal--five parts Puritan &amp; one Affrican. I hope our patriotic women may be able to clothe our whole army with woolens for the winter--it would be an honor that no other nation <i>[unclear: can]</i> attend to. The South can loan to the Government 100 <i>[unclear: millions]</i> of cotton, the half of the Crop, without any inconvenience to them, and do this as long as the war lasts, &amp; make the interest by a direct tax with out a murmur.</p> <p>Our <u>Thunderbolt</u> is expected to leave Orleans this night, &amp; is to receive the <i>[unclear: fire]</i> from the <i>[unclear: forty-1st]</i> <i>[unclear: Mississippi]</i> &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> as the <i>[unclear: proper]</i> down to try <i>[unclear: her]</i> strength &amp; capacity of resistance. She is entirely ironclad with a proboscis of iron, and a Cannon of 120 lbs ball, to fire when she <i>[unclear: strikes]</i>.</p> <p>We shall be hard up here for coffee &amp; bacon by christmas, if the ports are not opened before that. Texas with her beeves can supply the meat, but the want of coffee will be a great trial to the patriotism of the Girls--They can dispense with everything but rice, coffee &amp; chickens.</p> <p>Henry with the whole family is very anxious that you would let Sandy come out in the fall spend the winter with us, we have an admirable Teacher &amp; he would get the advantage of early rising as he has Scholars up by candle light in the winter. Mrs. L. &amp; the Girls <i>[unclear: desire]</i> <i>[unclear: to be most affect]</i>, remembered to you all.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> &amp; truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>L Luckett</p></div> <!---->
