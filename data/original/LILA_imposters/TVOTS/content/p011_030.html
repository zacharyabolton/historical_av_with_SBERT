Longstreet &amp; a host of men &amp; I suppose we shall make a big move now -- I have been working very hard &amp; until quite late, as I have not been able to write you a long letter, as I intended -- but now while we are lying by the road side, waiting for the army to move on, I will write you from under a tree My barrel came, but, poor me, the bottom fell out of the pitcher &amp; the butter all melted &amp; greased the potatoes before they were cooked &amp; they have since taken the rot and all gone to corruption -- The bread was excellent -- I gave a loaf of it to the Gen -- who is very fond of light bread. The onions go finely &amp; I carry them, while on a march to quench thirst they do it admirably. I wrote to you the day after the battle of Cedar Run -- there was no fighting on Sunday -- we held the Battle field, gathered up our wounded, buried the dead, collected arms &amp; watched the movements of the enemy -- we had about 900 men killed &amp; wounded &amp; I see by the late northern papers that they admit a loss of 1500 killed &amp; wounded. It was a very hard fought battle and I felt very thankful that I escaped unhurt. Monday morning the surgeons of the enemy came out under a white flag to carry off their wounded -- who were still on the field -- &amp; just after they got them a large cavalry force was seen advancing -- Gen. J. E. B. Stuart (Cavalry Maj. Gen. -- the noted one) who was in our front -- sent word to them that if they advanced any further he would seize their ambulances -- and -- "Either respect your flag &amp; go back, or come on -- It makes no difference which" They said -- (<i>[unclear: Bugard]</i>, the Yank <abbr expan="Cavalry">Cav.</abbr> Gen. in command) that they would go back until they could see Gen. Pope &amp; they then asked for a truce until 2 P.M. which was granted, &amp; they came &amp; gathered up their dead &amp; wounded while we kept gathering arms upon the same field. When they first came on, one of Siegle's staff began to gather arms too &amp; one of our officers told him that was contrary to the rules of a truce &amp; he got mad at it, when an officer of his own army came up &amp; wanted to know what he was doing &amp; by whose order -- he <abbr expan="said">sd</abbr> he was one of Gen. Siegle's men &amp; was gathering up those arms by his order -- he the cursed him &amp; told him Siegle had better send some one there that was not a d-d fool --. The fellow succumbed &amp; went off -- Many Yankee officers came to the field &amp; they &amp; our men conversed freely -- Many of them were quite sick of the war -- They asked to have the truce extended to 5 P.M. -- which we granted -- We then sent back our baggage train &amp; came back that night, unmolested, to near our old camp. Since the battle a good many deserters have come in from the enemy -- 12 at one time -- from Western Va -- they say that many of them intend to desert -- even whole Regiments -- Gen. Jackson paroled these men &amp; let them go home. One of the 5<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> in the fight was met by 3 Yankees -- he had lost his bayonet &amp; had no cap in his gun -- he clubbed his gun &amp; knocked one of them down (here he stopped --) &amp; what of the other two, said the Adjutant -- Why I ran away from them as fast as I could -- There was quite a scene at the preaching which Gen. Jackson ordered day before yesterday: he had been to the 5<sup>th</sup> <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> to preaching &amp; was coming back, passing by the Brigade of Gen. Taliaferro where Mr. Ewing was preaching -- Gen. T -- says, in the midst of a splendid <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> -- but at sight of the old Gray Cap coming down the road the men all broke &amp; rushed to the road side to cheer the Gen. as he passed -- leaving Mr. Ewing in amazement in the height of his eloquence. Gen. Taliaferro says he intends to have Gen. Jackson arrested for disturbing a religious meeting &amp; a Presbyterian one at that! We took 19 wagon loads &amp; one car load of arms from the battle -- Gen. J. says that is the best way to get arms -- to go &amp; take them. Capt Lilley behaved gallantly in the action -- he seized to colors of the wavering regiment waving it in advance of them rallied them &amp; hurried them on to the fight -- Andrew Newman behaved well too &amp; was wounded in the leg -- Esq. Gamble lost his right arm &amp; one of the Korncofe's of North River his leg -- Grady, son-in-law of <i>[unclear: Humpheys]</i> was taken prisoner it is said -- There is quite a commotion in the 1<sup>st</sup> Brigade as to who shall command it now that poor Winder is no more -- the officers some time ago united in a recommendation of <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Harman, at the earnest solicitation of his brother, for a Brig. Generalship -- from mere charity they say, of course not expecting him to command them -- but as soon as he hears of Winder's death they (His friends) press his case at Richmond &amp; produce this recommendation as evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup> Brigade wants him -- thus caught, the officers back out &amp; send a counter petition that they do not want him -- &amp; ask to have Baylor made Brigadier &amp; so it goes -- My bottle of ink came safely -- &amp; says the welcome word on it that you are well -- It will be of no use to send any more provisions till you hear from me, but write through Maj. Bell &amp; I shall get it -- I will write as often as I can There is no telling where we shall go to, but our faces are Northward &amp; we are moving -- I have money but do not see any way to send it -- so get the check cashed that I gave you if you need any before I send to you -- I will send the first opportunity -- Any of the men around you will cash the check --</p> <p> May God bless &amp; keep you all -- I hope to come home, if spared after this move -- Tell the children to be good &amp; remember their Pa -- Tell Allen I hope he will be a good boy &amp; do what is right -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Good bye -- Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> -- husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
