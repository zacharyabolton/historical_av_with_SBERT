After giving Kent an opportunity of seeing the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> I recommended him to join the Wise Troop, now commanded by <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Steptoe who promised me to take Kent into his mess with him. I consider him second to no man in my <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr>. In every way a gentleman he looks after his men &amp; sees their wants are supplied. Your noble boy I am sure will do well and you may rest assured that any assistance that I can give him will be cheerfully rendered. If he needs anything at any time I will see that he is provided for. <i>[unclear: For the]</i> cavalry have to carry all they have on their horses and have but few wants.</p> <p>I think we will have an active campaign and hope the vandals may soon be driven across the Potomac again. With my kindest regards to Mr Langhorne, Lizzie &amp; all of the little ones believe me very truly </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thomas T.
