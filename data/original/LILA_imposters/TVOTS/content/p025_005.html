It would give me more pleasure to acknowledge in person the sincerity of my thanks, &amp; <i>[unclear: tender]</i> appreciation with which I received, &amp; will keep this <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>, but beautiful, &amp; expressive token of your valued remembrance. I cannot deside which I most admire, its <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> fragrance, the rich variety of its huesor the artistic arrangement of the entire collection. All are alike admired, &amp; enjoyed as a gift from you I love flowers, but <i>[unclear: more]</i> especially when they come to me culled, &amp; arranged by esteemed hands. With the beauty &amp; fragrance of your gift, there came a regret resting like a blot upon each flower, &amp; bud, a regret that its loveliness will so soon perish, that I cannot keep it always fresh, &amp; blooming as now. The faded remains, &amp; remembranceshall be min, pointing back in future years to the bright days when I enjoyed your friendship. May the pathway that God has marked for you to tread bloom with flowers of unfading beauty, &amp; happiness. And may the fair &amp; tender hands of her you select as your wife gather for you flowers without thorns &amp; lead you onward to Heaven.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very truly<br>Your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mary A.
