Your petitioners without undertaking to give their opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner (not having heard the evidence) represent that M<sup>c</sup>Mullen so far as they can learn has always borne an excellent character &amp; proved a good Character before the Court he is extremely poor &amp; has a wife &amp; two small children who were entirely dependent upon his Daily labor for their support &amp; who must in the event of his continued confinement be reduced to rely upon the Parish for support.

Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask that, in view of the former good character of this prisoner &amp; of the extreme poverty &amp; suffering which must befal his unfortunate young wife &amp; children Your Excellency will exercise in behalf of Many that Discretion which the law has vested in you &amp; grant to this unfortunate man a pardon.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>William Craig John A.
