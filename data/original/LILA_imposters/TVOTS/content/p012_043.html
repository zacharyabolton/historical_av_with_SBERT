Lee now to have it approved -- I hope he may get it. I reckon my letter about my box did not get home in time to have it get back to Staunton -- I have not heard anything from you about it, and so take it for granted that it did not reach in time. I am doing very well though, on bread &amp; coffee -- now &amp; then a little potato soup -- think my health is as good as ever it was -- though I am working very closely, hoping to get a respite for a few days that I may come to my own sweet nest for a few days of this rapidly passing winter. If you have not sent my eatables &amp;c, let them rest until I write again. I have not been able to get any washing done since I left home -- </p> <p> Yesterday 14 persons, in good circumstances, but refugees from destruction, from Fredericksburg &amp; Port Royal, staying in an old house near here, sent to be a morsel of food -- they had not a single thing to eat -- </p> <p> Harris goes this moment -- so good bye and God bless you </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
