I sent to Winchester a large bundle for you of Calico &amp;c -- I do not know how many yards, but a good many -- I want you to save enough of some piece for William to have a dress for May and one for his child until I write , any how -- I intend to buy more for him if another opportunity offers, as he has the money &amp; you can then use all I sent you as you see fit -- you may be able to trade some of it for other things you need, price being made equal to price -- You may make me two shirts from such as you prefer -- and I will buy myself some more if I can find them. I hope you will find the goods such as please you -- I had to select them in a hurry &amp; had but little time to make choice -- if there are any other little things you may want let me know of it &amp; I will try and get them for you in the course of our marches. Our success has been complete, no opposition, the enemy moving off as we advance -- &amp; having only militia to oppose to us -- they are preparing to oppose us two miles to this side of Harrisburg -- but I do not know where we are going now -- but am quite sure the enemy is much alarmed -- The Gen. sent word to the clergy to have their services as usual, as no one would disturb them -- so some of the churches were open today, and the preachers, though nervous, prayed for their country in peril and their friends in danger -- they also prayed for the strangers that were among them, some of them prayed for peace -- We have had a very pleasant time so far, an abundance to eat, and in variety, our men getvegetables from the people -- onions especially, and they are very good for them.</p> <p> I am extremely anxiously to come home but the calls of country and duty forbid, but I hope we may soon end this, and rest at home in peace again -- </p> <p> One of the preachers here prayed that God would bless those he was in the habit of praying for -- we told some of them we hoped they would meet &amp; pray for Lincoln as he needed praying for -- The Lutheran preacher was very sensible -- the <abbr expan="Presbyterian">Pres.</abbr> preacher prayed for the dear ones <u>we</u> had left at home -- I hope our success may continue as it has begun &amp; the movement has been a very fine one, admirably conducted -- and eminently successful -- The weather here is very pleasant -- but we had quite a hard rain day before yesterday. We occupied a house night before last which the family had run away and left-we fared very well there and found many good things there -- our army likes this country very well -- and O what a relief it will be to our country to be rid of our army for some time, I hope we may keep away for some time and so relieve the calls for supplies that have been so long made so long upon our people. Good bye &amp; may God bless &amp; keep you all safely and may you be kept in health and abundance -- Write to me often and some of them will surely reach me. I will write to you as often as I can -- Kiss the children for me --</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
