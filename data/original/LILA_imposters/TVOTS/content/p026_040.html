Graham of the U S Burial Corps has been making himself very active in this matter, and as he has been making himself very <del hand="h1">prom</del> officious among the Freedmen in regard to these complaints the inference I draw is that the whole thing is done in malice and for the purpose of injuring Mr Tukey.</p> <p>It may be proper for me to add that I have always been a Union man and have no sympathy with Rebels whatever and have been much persecuted by them during and since the war.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> J.
