Staunton is entirely without any provision for schools, although they have had flourishing schools there heretofore. They have a good school room and are exceedingly anxious for a teacher. In accordance with instructions from Mr. Kennedy to send you to some one of the many places that are without schools, I have <i>[unclear: debated]</i> that as the very best of them all. It is a delightful town, with society and religious privileges, and has a most excellent Bureau officer - Mr. <abbr expan="Thomas">Thos</abbr> P. Jackson who will be to you all that you will desire in the way of sympathy and aid. The Association will expect you to collect, in some form, from the people enough to pay your board. Mr. Jackson will advise with you in that matter. You will report in person to him and he will provide you a boarding place. You had better go there on Saturday of this week if you can and send me an account of your expense for travel, which will be but slight.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>R.M.
