The enemy are now in the valley at Harrisonburg - their advance guard - but I do not think they will move very rapidly upon Staunton, for fear of being flanked by us - and we hope soon to be able to do so - that our force will allow us again to give them battle and by the blessing of Providence drive them from our homes. </p> <p>Of course the people seen in great trepidation in Staunton and the accounts of the panic, on Friday and Saturday last, were exceedingly ludicrous &amp; amusing -- women &amp; children &amp; negroes &amp; especially the men &amp; more especially the office-holding men - Quartermasters &amp; Commisioners were seen running to &amp; fro through rain &amp; mud begging &amp; hiring passage to some other point of safety - It is said that the Virgin<sup>a</sup> Hotel was so completely deserted as to require it to be closed up - and all this panic when the enemy was at least 30 miles from them. I feel very anxious about Father &amp; Mother &amp; <del hand="h1"></del> I advised father to leave mother &amp; may at home - but I heard they were all going to leave. I am almost sorry to advised at all - Trusting in a kind Providence to look over &amp; take care of them I hope that it will be His pleasure to restore us all to our homes with liberty &amp; peace &amp; happiness smiling upon us &amp; hearts full of gratitude for His mercy &amp; goodness - It is a hard matter to give up home to the ruthless <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> of an enemy seeking our destruction and the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> wisdom of God can alone see why it is done. Let us submit &amp; pray for his blessing to restore us to him soon again &amp; in His own good time. I forgot to tell you before that I have been promoted to the Colonelcy of the 5th Regt by its unanimous vote - But for the gratification of being thus restored to a position of which I was deprived so unjustly 12 months go I do not know that I should not decline the honor conferred &amp; shrink from the great responsibility it imposes - It is no pleasant thought to have the care of the lives of 800 to 1000 men - I will use every effort to look after them - to be a father &amp; leader - and I beseech you and all to pray to Heaven to give me the ability and assistance necessary for so hard a task &amp; so responsible a position - I will have a fine regiment - one that loves me &amp; will do everything I can to make it a pride &amp; noble defence of the country - I do not like to say how you shall send your letters - for I do not know - send them however to Maj Gen Jackson army - Dear Lottie when shall I see her - I trust she is still improving - I will soon be allowed to see her father - the enemy are fast drawing their coils about Richmond &amp; within them I fear you may come - If so remain at home &amp; act as many of our noble women have done &amp; you need fear no harm for God will protect you - Oh when will this avenging sword be drawn &amp; wielded in the cause of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> - It cannot be that our cause is not just - It cannot be that we have so sinned as to be worthy of destruction - No it cannot be - He may be scourged <i>[unclear: &amp; we deserve it - we may be to the last extremity,]</i> but if we rely upon God &amp; do our duty the result will be our success. </p> <p>The result at Yorktown I trust will be in our favor - a great success there would be glorious for our cause - It would almost put a stop to the War - I feel much confidence in the result as we have noble Generals &amp; brave troops to rely upon.</p> <p>I am not so well as usual - though not sick - my liver is torpid and I fear it may result in dispepsia or jaundice - I will go into the field tomorrow and will be considerably more exposed than I have been - but will take care of myself. I am in a considerable strait about my mess and have written to McBell to buy me a full set of everything and bring a good cook. He promises to be with me &amp; he will be very useful - He is now at home making arrangements to send off his cattle &amp; everything - &amp; will be back in a few days - write me a long letter - love to all - Kiss Lottie Remember me to Jacques - </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am still your husband,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>W.H.
