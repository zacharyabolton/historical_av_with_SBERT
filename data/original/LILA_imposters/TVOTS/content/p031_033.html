H. Evans,</p></div> <div class="source__body source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your dear &amp; welcome letter reached me by last night's mail I was so glad to hear from you if your letter was brief. I did not care for that it told me I was not forgotten by one I love more then all the world. Yes I think of you Every hour of my life separation does not bind my thoughts I am here, but my <u>heart</u>, &amp; thoughts are with <u>you</u>. Oh! how much I wish I could see you to night. If I was in Staunton I should be satisfied &amp; happy for then I could see you often. Those who are dear to me I love to have near me your separation for one day is more then I feel willing to submit to. This is my parental home &amp; should be the dearest spot on earth to me, &amp; here I should love most of all to stay. It was all this to me once. I still love my home dearly &amp; its beloved inmates, but I love you more then parents, sisters, brothers or home. I never believed that I could love any man more fondly then my dear, kind, &amp; affectionate father. my eyes fill with involuntary tears when I think another &amp; that other a stranger has supplanted his faithful &amp; treasured affections in my heart. It does not give me pain to know this truth of my new love for another, only a gentle sadness tinging my new found happiness, for I do yet love my noble father with a deep &amp; undying devotion &amp; my sacrificing Mother. I love them all but love you best. You will not believe me. Never think again that I was loving, &amp; <u>trying</u> you on <u>probation</u> as you once told me, for had you not been all I wanted you to be, true, noble, &amp; upright, I should have loved you still. my ambition &amp; not my affection would have been lessened. You may perhaps think I do not understand your peculiar nature but I do, &amp; admire &amp; love what may seem a riddle to those who cannot understand you. Let that be as it may I care not, for all I love best, admire &amp; love Mr. D. H. Evans. They know I love you &amp; they esteem not for my sake but for your own I wish you could see me spining with my hair real <u>chignon</u> style. I find that floating curls &amp; trailing skirts are not convenient for spining, but only suitable for the parlor &amp; promenade. I'll hurry sure enough, for I'm anxious to get back to Staunton. Ma says after I'm through with the yarn, I must help to make winter carpets for the floors, then do the sewing for the children before the snow storms come. I think she told you last Sabbath that I might go after I did the spining. Well I look for my holiday about Christmas if I live. I hope to see Staunton before then, as I don't know what I shall do if I do not. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a long letter from dear Ella yesterday evening. she wrote for me to come back. that she can't live without me. I "must not let Mt. Solon's gloomy skies find me from her, &amp; her boy "I want her to miss me but not sadly as <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> we were parted forever, for if I live I am going back to stay awhile with her again before long. My good papa &amp; Hamie left us this morning for California Furnace. I feel doubly lonely since they are gone. May God bless them, &amp; send them home soon. I miss papa so much &amp; so long. dear Ma seems so lonely &amp; sad when her husband &amp; son both leave. I must do a daughter's part &amp; try to cheer up her drooping spirits. Rennie is <u>still</u> in Bridgewater with her darling <u>little</u> <u>David</u>. happier with him then with all others. When are you coming down? Oh! I do want to see you more then I can write, or tell you. it seems weeks since I saw you last. I would love to see you even with your <u>arms</u> <u>folded</u> &amp; your <u>head</u> <u>bowed</u>, &amp; not <u>look</u> <u>at</u> <u>me</u> when I entered the room until I spoke to you. your meditations were so deeply absorbing that you would forget one was near who loved you with all her heart. I thank you for the kiss you sent me &amp; in return send you one warm from my <u>lips</u> &amp; <u>heart</u>. Write soon my greatest pleasure now is to read &amp; answer your letters. I know you will be punctual. There is this difference between us I speak &amp; write all I feel &amp; you do not. Lula is well &amp; happy. Ma &amp; all send love to you. I send love &amp; many kisses. Take care of your dear self May God bless &amp; protect you is my daily prayer. Write to me soon Goodby.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mollie Sibert</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>My friend Mr. Sam Ferror came in just as I finished this letter.
