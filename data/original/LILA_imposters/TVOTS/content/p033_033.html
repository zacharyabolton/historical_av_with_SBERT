Evans,</p></div> <div class="source__body source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your dear, &amp; twice welcome letter of Tuesday came safely. I was so thankful to hear that you were well. If I had known last night that pa was going to Staunton this morning I would have written to you by him. I thought of you so often Sunday night during your lonely ride, &amp; did wish that I could have been with you. I went off to myself just to think of you after you left. I love to think of you always. How much I want to see you to night. It will be such a long &amp; weary two weeks before you can come again. I wish that important day wasalready here so you could come &amp; just to think I cannot see your dear face until 9 O'clock &amp; then we must meet in the presence of others &amp; only shake hands with no warmer greeting for two days I don't like to think of it. Ada &amp; Hamie M'Fall are not going to wait on Rennie. she <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a letter from Cousin David to day. he will bring a lady, &amp; gentleman with him you myself, &amp; those two will be the only attendents. Pa objected to H. M'Fall. I was sorry on Ada's account but it can't be helped now. I wrote to Ella by pa this morning before D. Sibert's letter came &amp; told her Miss Link was not coming so <u>brother</u> <u>David</u> wrote in his letter of Monday but now he writes that he has asked another lady&amp; so we can do nothing but let them come. I objected to this last arrangement but it did no good for he had already asked the lady. I only hope we all shall have a happy time. Cousin David wants us all to spend Wednesday night in Bridgewater as their Minister will preach that night a special sermon for the Groom, &amp; his attendants so he wants us all to go to church can you stay? I hope you can if you do not, I will come home with you, for I would not care to stay there without you were with me. The two Miss <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> were married this morning. Several other lady friends of mine are to be married in a few days. I hope they will all be very happy &amp; so they can be if they <u>will</u>. I wish I was with you nowI would be happy too. Mr. Estell called in twice this week but I was too busy to see him. you see he is still in Mt. Solon he has heard that it is Rennie who is to be married, &amp; not Miss Mollie. I do not care about seeing him any more Rennie sends thanks for the buttens <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> they were the kind she wanted. I enclose <i>[unclear: 25]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> It will be so long so long <i>[unclear: befor]</i> can come. sometimes <i>[unclear: I]</i> feel like I can't wait. I love you so truly &amp; so devotedly that I want to have you near me or I am not happy &amp; contented my only &amp; greatest joy &amp; pleasur is to be with you who I love with all the strength &amp; devotion of my heart &amp; entire nature. Yes I do indeed love you &amp; only you. no man in all this world can ever take my heart &amp; all of its deep &amp; fervent love from you. I have yours <del hand="h1"></del> they are truly yours my heart, &amp; its love shall never belong to any but you while I have life, unless you yourself refuse to have them &amp; even then I will still love you. Write to me soon I love to read your dear true letters I read them over more then <u>3 or 4 time</u>s I read them Every day till hear from you again, or see you. I do want to see your darling face so much God bless you my heart's best, &amp; only love. Goodnight. I send love &amp; a kiss to you. I love you with all my heart.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Mollie Sibert</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Ma, Rennie, &amp; all send love to you Write soon I love you Oh! so truly</p></div>
