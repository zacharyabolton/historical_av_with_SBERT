My Motto is <i>[unclear: Nil desper audiem]</i>. I am Still hopeful of the election of Bell &amp; Everitt or some one of the antirepublican tickets, and if the worst comes to the worst and Lincoln is elected their will be neither Secession or disunion. Such a consequence would be of a piece with the Madness &amp; folly of committing suicide for fear of dying. Let us wait for an <i>[unclear: overt]</i> act (which I verily believe will not be committed by Lincoln or his <i>[unclear: allies]</i>) and cling to our glorious union as long aspossible consistently with honor safety &amp; liberty, for in disunion I can foresee woes innumerable, no remedy for our grievances but rather as aggravation of them all, in short the greatest calamity that could befall not only the <abbr expan="United States">U S</abbr> but the cause of free government throughout the world. We shall have a grand whig rally here tomorrow. Baldwin &amp; Stuart will address the mass meeting.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Very respectfully<br><abbr expan="your friend and obedient servant">yr fr &amp; obt st.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>Lucas P.
