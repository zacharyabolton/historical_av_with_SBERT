You said in yours that you had come to the conclusion that I had forgotten you from the fact that you had not received a letter for so long from me. Now I must say in all candor that this is exactly my notion about you. for I full confident that you were due me two letters at least. But I shall not fall out with you about that. As you may not have gotten them. Well I must tell you we have had some very hard times since our battle, in the way of living some times entirely out of meat &amp; bread &amp; laying in an old field where the sun was hot enough to cook an egg &amp; nothing but muddy creek water to drink half the time. But I am happy to say that we are fareing much better now. We are in a nice grove &amp; have very good water yet we have to go almost a half mile for it but that is nothing to what it is sometime.Well I must give you all the news I can on this half sheet as paper is very scarce. We are now about 9 miles from the junction toward Halifax Courthouse - how long we will be permitted to stay I am unable to say <u>n</u>ow. I have no idea of where our next move will be to, <i>[unclear: unless]</i> it be to Washington, however it does not become <ins>me</ins> to say anything that <del hand="h1">might</del>I don't know. One think I feel very confident of &amp; that is that I dont think we will have another attack at this point soon. I must hasten on as I <ins>have</ins> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> other letters to answer this evening. One to your Cousins Annie &amp; Hannah &amp; one to Cousin Hollie &amp; Sallie Harris. So you see I'll be Right busy. But one thing is <ins>in</ins> my favor. I haven't but one &amp; half sheet to write on &amp; it wont take long to do that. I dont know what we will do now. we cant get any thing of the kind here at all. I hope you will not <i>[unclear: quit]</i> if you should not get an answer to your next. I will <i>[unclear: certainly]</i> write every opportunity <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> before one with a great long fall on waiting to your Cousin Annie. he looks so sour that sugar would hardly melt in his mouth. Enough of that. John &amp; Sam Thompson are both well. The health of our boys is pretty good, with the exception of two or three cases <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> of fever, one of measles &amp; 1 mumps, none dangerous however. I had thought of getting a furlough this week, but they have shut right down on giving them however I hope it will not be long till I can get one.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours devotedly, in haste</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Frank</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.
