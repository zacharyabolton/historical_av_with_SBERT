Jones killed, Gen. Stefford mortally wounded &amp;c &amp;c. the 2<sup>nd</sup> Corps fought them some 5 miles S. W. of us on the plank road -- we on the same old turnpike that passes through Chancellorsville. Sedgwick's Corps was in front on one side. Burnsides crossed to our front late yesterday, &amp; today we expect the most terrible battle we have ever had -- God be praised for our success &amp; with his help we have to do even better today -- all things are ready for it. I am still unhurt but very tired. The field of the <i>[unclear: damage]</i> is an awful one -- Good bye &amp; God bless you </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
