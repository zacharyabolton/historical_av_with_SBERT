Freddy goes to school and is doing well he writes to little Mary &amp; I suppose he gives his news. I do wish you were all here, you would have to suffer some privation of your present luxuries but upon the whole might be as pleasant I hope that <ins>it</ins> will not be long until we can be together constantly. I have hoped to hear from you for some time but I suppose the lines are held so strict that letters can not pass. but you must write me by every oppertunity you have &amp; let me know how you are getting along &amp;c &amp;c. I can hardly think of having to spend this winter without you, but I fear we cannot better ourselves now. If the way is open long enough for me to go I will be sure to be down if able to travel &amp;c I have been trying to sell out here, and can sell for a large price but to exchange the money for such as can be used there I would get so little that it would not justify the sale. I am still watching for oppertunities &amp; when <ins>one</ins> offers that will pay well I will quit this business immediately</p> <p>We are doing a considerable business here now our receipts are from 1000$ to $2000<sup> <sup>00</sup> </sup> <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> day, but the expenses are equally heavy Flour $200<sup> <sup>00</sup> </sup> to $280 <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> Barrel Beef $2 <abbr expan="per">pr</abbr> pound but we get plenty of supplies</p> <p>As to our business there, you have managed so long &amp; done so nobly that I need not interfere, but just let you continue to manage as you think best I only regret that I cant be with you &amp; relieve you from all these troubles which you were unaccustomed too as when I was at home I tried to relieve you of all outdoors management. I hope you have fully recovered your health. I fear you give yourself trouble about business matters which sometimes unnerves you &amp; makes nearvous &amp; delicate try &amp; take all matters smoothe &amp; easy do what you can &amp; let the rest pass by. I suppose Mary B. is still with you &amp; not doubt she is great help to you If she is now with you &amp; suits you, try &amp; keep her, remember me kindly to her. I suppose the little girls are now going to school. don<sup> <sup>t</sup> </sup> let them be toomuch confined allow them as much recreation as you can</p> <p>The election is over &amp; I suppose Lincoln is again President for four years what result will be from the new election we know not but I hope a speedy peace will soon be brought about Lay in full winter supplies &amp; dont stint yourself in anything there is to be had. I have a lot of money for you such as you can use there, which I hope to get to you soon I will continue to get all I can of that kind of fund<sup>s</sup> that you may have plenty under all circumstances As to the furniture of M<sup> <sup>rs</sup> </sup> It is but just and right to keep her things under the contract. They were not worth More than that amount of such money at the time we got them. but in view of her being a very poor &amp; needy persons &amp; I think well disposed, I would let her have her things <u>Just make her a present of them</u> it will be little or nothing to us and perhaps will be best in the end</p> <p>As to Wolff say to him that I owe him no money in any way The things I bought of Hamilton I paid him &amp; H for &amp; I have nothing to do with him in the matter and say farther to him that if he interferes with you in any way whatever in the matter he will regret it as I am not always from home. I have saved him from one <u>ducking &amp; tar &amp; feathering since the commencement of this war &amp; this is the thanks for it</u> you may let him read this paragraph for himself.</p> <p>I cant think of any matters now of particular interest to write you. take good care of all &amp; may god ever bless &amp; protect you</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>good night</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John Quincy Adams">J Q A</abbr> Nadenbousch</div> <!---->
