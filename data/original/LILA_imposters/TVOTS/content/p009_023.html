I would have answered it sooner, but we were expecting to move our camp every day &amp; I thought perhaps that it would be some satisfaction to you to know where we would be <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> in the future, so I put it off untill the present. Well I suppose I can tell you where our winter quarters will be now. We are encamped about 3 Miles from Winchester, on what is called the "<i>[unclear: Pear]</i>town" road. We have been engaged for two or three days putting up huts. not withstanding this is the Sabath, a great many of our men worked all day at them. some building, some chopping &amp; others dragging loggs. All seem to be anxious to get in to their new homes. I have nothing much, worth relating about our trip to Bath &amp; Romney except to say that we had a hard time of it. It rained &amp; snowed nearly every day during our entire march - wich was about 26 days. But I suppose Buck has given you all the news worth relating. from the time he joined us in Romney up to the present; so I'll not trouble you with it again. I was greatly in <i>[unclear: hopes]</i> that I would get home soon to see <u>you</u> &amp; all the rest of my friends but it is a settled fact now, that this privilege will be denied - unless I reenlist. Well I think I can stand <i>[unclear: through]</i> my time out. &amp; then I will make a strenuous effort to get there. With this, I will close for the present hoping that I may <u>still</u> <u>hear</u> <u>from</u> <u>you</u>. Yours truly.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>In haste</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony P.</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>excuse this short note as it is the half of my paper &amp; I have two other letters to answer.
