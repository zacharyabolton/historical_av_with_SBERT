As to any enjoyments they are many &amp; various consequently I will not endeavor to enumerate them. I have had some pretty hard times since I came down. I have marched over 100 miles since leaving Winchester Thursday morning Jan <del hand="h1">29</del> 30. We had to march yesterday morning and I didn't get time to finish your letter. We marched 8 <abbr expan="miles">mls.</abbr> yesterday &amp; are now 5 <abbr expan="miles">mls.</abbr> from Winchester on the <i>[unclear: Pughtown]</i> road. We are in winter quarters, are yet in our tents, but will continue building our cabins tomorrow. I think it probable that we may have some rest now for awhile</p> <p>We left Romney on the 23rd. It rained all the time we were there &amp; was very muddy &amp; disagreeable. Romney is a very nice town I suppose in time of peace, but it is overrun with soldiers + abused now. There are a few pretty girls there; some of were very kind to me &amp; others were more <u>"union than secesh"</u> I think.</p> <p>There are several pretty churches there &amp; a good many nice private residences &amp; also a very commodious Court House, though the Yankees have torn the floors &amp; every thing from the inside of the Court House. </p> <p>The Federals left a great many things when they "vamoused" from there. I could have gotten a number of trophies but had no way of taking care of them. Its the most mountainous regions between here and Romney I ever saw. There are 8 mountains between here &amp; there &amp; The Pastures about Burnissis Springs is a paradise to the be best part of Hampshire County. The people of some places can look up the chimney &amp; see the sheep &amp; goats on the hill side above. There are some children out there that never saw the sun. </p> <p>The Yankees have burned all the houses for 20 miles in this side of Romney. But I guess they won't burn any more soon</p> <p>Write to me soon. Direct to Winchester. In care of <abbr expan="Captain">Cpt.</abbr> H. J.
