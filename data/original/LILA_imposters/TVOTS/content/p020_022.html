I am exceedingly anxious to have the full causes of your troubles not that I could feel that I would be able to soothe <ins>you</ins> in the least but I would be very glad to know all that in any way gives trouble or displeasure to my dear &amp; ever faithful friend Kate. If the secret of your discomfort is not too profound I will be much gratified to know all about it, with a promise never to divulge it to any one. well for a change of the subject I will give you a little of the news of the day. it is generally believed that our Government is about to send commissioners to confer with the Federal authorities preparatory to coming to some terms of peace. may the blessed Lord grant that they may be able to come to some honorable terms of peace.</p> <p>The weather is extermely cold. we have a perfect ill harvest just at this time. well dear Kate you will have to excuse my short letter. please dont think I am getting careless about writing, for I assure you that nothing gives me more pleasure than to write &amp; receive a letter from you for you are the only constant &amp; faithfull correspondent I have. I hope when I hear from you again that your letter may be teeming with good news, &amp; that you my dear darling sister Kate may be your self again with my tender regards to the loved ones at your home with much love for you dear Kate</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>believe me to be your affectionate &amp; ever loving Brother</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Robert</p></div> <!---->
