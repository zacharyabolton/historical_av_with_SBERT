If you could have read my heart, &amp; known my disappointment you would only have been pleased, &amp; not disappointed, nor would you have blamed me had I told you why I did not go then. It was not that I thought people would say any thing, for what could they say about me riding with <u>you</u> nothing at all &amp; who's business would it have been but yours &amp; mine? I am one who does not care what the world says, or persons think of what I do when I know I am right <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> I know it would have been right for <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> horse back jaunt with <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> but the holy Sabbath, but <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> reason I did not go. I will tell you <del hand="h1"></del> the truth why I did not, when you come Saturday a week, &amp; nothing but the truth then you will say you did me wrong by thinking asyou did I knew just what you would say about it that was why I cried it grieved my very heart to have you misjudge me when I <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> it &amp; you will say so when I tell you <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> the world was against you knowing <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> do it would not keep me from giving <del hand="h1"></del>, or from loving you, no I would only love you the more, &amp; go with you the oftener if that was the case, but it is not, for all speak highly of you who know you. I would neither Thank, nor respect the person (if my own dear father) who would come to me, &amp; say one word of unkindness against you, I could never esteem them again, nor would I have them for a friend, that is my way of doing for those I love I don't like any one who says any thing about them that is not just. If I could see your heart, &amp; read there that you truly believe <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> was not what you said that kept me <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> riding, it would lift such a heavy <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> my heart. I would write you why I <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> but I would rather tell you so I could <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> you, &amp; have your answer from your mouth you will laugh &amp; call me <u>vain</u>. Ma told me to tell you that when you come she will tell you her self&amp; so will I, it will not make you angry for you will then know why I said it was for your own dear sake that I did not <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> I loved you so truly. This <del hand="h1"></del> talk to you now but I will <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> go <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> when you arrive, &amp; will tell you <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> did not go to church whilst <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> &amp; that was for your sake too, as you shall hear I know you will not love me less but love me more then Ever. bless Ma she has been talking about you all day, says, she is afraid you are in your store with no fire to warm you this cold damp day. Oh! how much I would love to be with you to day I feel so lonely, &amp; unhappy. If I could see you now I would tell you all but I must wait til you come which will seem ages to me two weeks Ma says you must come then, if you don't come in a buggy just so you come, if you come in a conveyance of your own we will if we <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> go to Mossy Creek church. I will not <del hand="h1"></del> then indeed I will not I love <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> you &amp; I do not go with any gentlemen <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> not since I loved you.

I could not rest for thinking of whatyou said. I went off to my self to cry &amp; grieve after you left <del hand="h1"></del> not told you the truth when you <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> never do so again but will <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> will understand &amp; <i>[unclear: no]</i><del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> I was so anxious to put <del hand="h1"></del> from you in the subject that <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> Friday's mail to <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <u>Eve</u>ry <u>thin</u>g for I am <u>tru</u>e you <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> f<u>ea</u>r to love &amp; t<u>rus</u>t me, so long as <del hand="h1"></del> God's help.
