Beware; O Beware how you bid Gods Spirit depart from you God says "My son give me thy heart" Do not be surprised that I am anxious about your souls salvation and I am not the only one that feels deep solicitude for you Your dear Mother said to me the The night you left home If I only had good evidence of Thomas being a true Christian It would make parting much easier Her language expressed the very feelings of my own heart towards you My daily prayer is for your souls salvation And I feel assured that your parents and other friends are praying almost without ceasing for you We all know your path is beset with temtations and dangers such as you were a stranger to at home and this fact has awakened a deeper solicitude in the hearts of your friends for your souls salvation and can you be indifferent yourself I hope you are not But I have no evidence that you are not careless about this important matter Just take Christ at his word He has said "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the Son Shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him" Do you ask what faith is Simply believing the love God has to you But you will perhaps say I can neither repent nor believe of myself I know you cannot But Christ is exalted a prince and a Saviour to grant repentance and remission of sins and He has promised the Holy Spirit to them that ask him Your Mother has headach to day Your Uncle James was not able to go to church to day Try and write a little every day if you have leisure Monday morning Some of the people are sending eatables to their friends and we would like to send you something if we could Tell us how you are situated How you sleep whether you have tents to sleep in and what you get to eat and what you would like to have sent to you</p> <p>and now before I bid you farewell permit me once more to entreat you to come to Jesus, and make an unreserved consecration of yourself to him, He will receive you if you do Remember you cannot do without Christ you must have a better righteousness than your own Come to Christ and he will clothe you with his righteousness He is his peoples righteousness Sister Ann sends her love to you May God in infinite mercy preserve you from all harm and in due time bring you home in peace and safety is the prayer of your affectionate Aunt</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Farewell</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>E Martin</p></div> <!---->
