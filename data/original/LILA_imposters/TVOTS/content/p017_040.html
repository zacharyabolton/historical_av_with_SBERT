I have written a number of letters home since I last heard some or all of which I hope you have <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> ere this.</p> <p>I rode out Friday to find poor Robert's grave. It is in a very quiet place, not on the battlefield, but at the foot of a walnut tree near the house of Mrs Starke. He is buried beside <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Terrell. The lady at the House said she intended to have the graves enclosed as soon as it could be done. Cousin Lizzie &amp; every one else seem to think that the <del hand="h1">body</del> remains had better not be moved until the are to be taken home.</p> <p>I have never experienced such a blow as <u>his</u> death; I could do nothing for several days. I loved him to the exclusion of nearly all else, and that he returned my devotion in full measure, I well know. He alone had my confidence and he alone never blamed me. I had feared his fall for I knew how brave he was and any one who has seen the rain of death missiles on a battlefield will wonder more that any escape than that any particular one was killed, yet I had hoped he would escape.</p> <p>When I saw him in the army, we had a great deal of conversation, he seemed to have no fear of death at all, and said he was ready and willing to meet any emergency; still he would talk of what we would do after the war. Poor dear boy, I have often said and felt, and now, more than ever, that if I saw death coming towards him I would gladly push him aside and plant myself in his footsteps that he might be saved rather than I. I would gladly have fallen in his place. He used to put his arms around me and tell me how much he loved me and show me the mug that I had given him years before &amp; how he had <del hand="h1">left</del> held on to it &amp; prized it. <del hand="h1">above all</del> And to think <u>he</u> was killed, it was <u>too too</u> hard. He told me much of what he intended to do for you &amp; that I must attend to his matters if he should be killed &amp; carry out his plans as far as I could. Which I shall certainly do. The day that Dr Brown got word that the body had been found I was not at congress, nor the office. I did not feel like work &amp; had paid a man to write the proceedings for me. Dr B. only had an hour &amp; a half's ticket and in that time could not find me, though he looked for me. I had gone to a friends house for rest &amp; have quiet. As soon as it is practicable I will have the body taken home.</p> <p>I will go home as soon as possible. I had fully expected to have gotten off today, but my business keeps me here. I have suffered more with neuralgia for the last six weeks, than for many <del hand="h1">weeks</del> months past. And lost time in consequence.</p> <p>I rejoice that the Yankees did <i>[unclear: harm]</i> so little home, though they have been such a scourge <i>[unclear: with]</i> lately. I had <i>[unclear: enclosed]</i> the daily Enquirer the set of some two months ago &amp; supposed it was going, but it seemed the neccisary direction had been lost. I found the Sentinel had been stopped, but had it continued. I started over to Chimborazo Hospital yesterday (Sunday) to find John Wright, but had to turn back, not being able to walk over. I went up last night &amp; saw Dr Voden, surgeon in charge of one of the Divisions &amp; he will find him if he is there, and tell me this evening. I will write immediately, if he is found.</p> <p>John Humphreys is in Albemarle. Tell William I will write him today or tomorrow.</p> <p>I grieve to hear of Mary Lou's sickness, do hope it will be of short duration. I have done all in my power to get a letter to James, but it is impossible to do so. I will write to some friends North &amp; tell them that he is in <abbr expan="Fort">Ft</abbr> Delaware. I can send letters through to persons living North, but not to a prisoner of War.</p> <p> <del hand="h1">With usual</del> </p> <p>I hope Father has recovered his strength ere this. With much love to all</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Yours">Yrs</abbr> affectionately</div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>F.W.
