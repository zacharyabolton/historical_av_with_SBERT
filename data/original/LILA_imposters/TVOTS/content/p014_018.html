I was taken with pains in my head and back and then in my arms and legs that I could not help myself. I was taken Sunday night. I have got so that I can sit up and write. I received your most kind letter Saturday. I was truly glad to hear from you and to hear that you was well and doing as well as you was. I hope when these few lines comes to hand they may find you and Willie well.</p> <p>I seen William Offlighter and Hiram Coyner last Saturday. They was well. They have got back from Richmond. They are in the brigade guard house. They have been courtmartialed but they have not heard their sentence yet. They told me that Castle Thunder was the worst place that they ever seen, but they said that they got plenty to eat. Hiram said that he expects he will have to go back to Castle Thunder again.</p> <p>We get plenty to eat now. They have raised our rations. We <i>[unclear: get]</i> one pound and an eight of flour and a half a pound of bacon and some sugar and some peas. We can do very well on that. We are camped at the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> old place yet but I don't know how long we will stay here. I don't hear of no moves at this time. I received that petition that was sent to me. I showed it to the Capt. and to the Col. They both said it was very good.</p> <p>Tell your pap that if he comes down to bring me some tobacco. Tell him that he can get in camp without any trouble. I would be very glad to see him. Mr. Able is well. He comes to me nearly every day to see if I get a letter or not. If you see any of them tell them he is well. Give my love to J. M. D. and J. D. B. and all the rest of my inquiring friends. Write soon. May the blessings of God rest upon you all. I remain your affectionate husband until death.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>H.H. Dedrick</p></div> <!----> <!---->
