While I am convinced that these Courts cannot as a general thing be entrusted with the class of cases alluded to yet this month I have no instances to report wherein any injustice was inflicted upon a colored person by reason of prejudice &amp;c neither has my attention been called to any complaint coming from a colored person reflecting upon any authority vested with the power of regulating or instituting proceedings in criminal or civil cases.</p> <p>Every effort is made by me to bring about peaceable &amp; just adjudications between all parties i.e. between white and colored and between the colored themselves, thus preventing useless expense and unnecessary risks to the freedmen -- This line of policy saves much unkind feeling between the races and has evidently contributed <i>[unclear: vastly]</i> toward bringing them to a more just comprehension of each other.</p> <p>The Criminal Dockets bear evidence of a marked decrease in crime as among the Freedmen and I hear of but few instances of theft and disturbances of the public peace complained of as being perpetrated by this class.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am General<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="obedient">obt</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Svt.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jno W.
