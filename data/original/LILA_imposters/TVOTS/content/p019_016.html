Jennie went to her father's last friday and has not yet retruned. I went with her, was at church friday and saturday. She and Becca expected to go down the country this week but I think it is doubtful whether they have gone yet as yesterday was rainy, and today is cloudy and cool. Jennie told us to open your letters if we received any in her absence. You spoke of needing your overcoat but did not say whether we should it, if we have a safe opportunity. I do not know that we will have an opportunity unless we box it up and send by express to Camp Lee. You also spoke of a pair of boots but did not tell us to get them made. I believe Rowe is not yet able to work, and if he was we would not know which leather to take and I reckon Rowe has not your measure. Uncle Henry did not get home but M<sup>r</sup>. Black saw him in Staunton on saturday, he said they <ins>about 400</ins> were sent up to Staunton under guard and kept there under guard left camp <del hand="h1"></del> about one oclock saturday. We have not heard from them since, being kept under guard (M<sup>r</sup>. Black said) was right galling to the men but they had to submit. Theydid not like to be put with and treated as deserters, and shirkers. Uncle H sent up the veil you sent, and I sent it to Jennie on monday. We are all doing the best we can. Alex stays with us and helps Alfred. There has been some cider made at the mill Alex attends to it, Aunt Mag refused to let people make it at first but when she found that he could attend to it she did not hinder. M<sup>r</sup>. Decker was here last week, said he wanted to saw a stick this week for something about M H Mill, but has not come on yet to do it. Mr. Taliaferro sent <i>[unclear: some]</i> word the other day that he wants all the plank that is at the Mill, that he will haul some sticks in place, he knew I was writing to Uncle H. at the time and wished me to write about that, which I did, though I told Alex I thought doubtful if he <ins>Uncle H</ins> knew any thing <ins>or much,</ins> about it and I thought it was your <del hand="h1">understanding</del> intention for him to have it, so I thought I tell you and when you write you can say something about it, if you think necessary. Are there many of your men found for light duty and assigned to heavy artillery are you drilling any or learning how to fire your guns. I suppose from what you say in your letter that <del hand="h1"> <i>[unclear: men]</i> </del> <ins>you</ins> sometimes have to go in the trenches as well as mind your guns. I believe I have no news to write when you please try and give us all the news you can Take good care of yourself, keep in good spirits. Put your trust in God, and I pray God to bless cure accept and take care of (preserve) you, and bring you home in His good time may that good time be soon.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Believe me to be your affectionate Neice</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Hannah</p></div> <!---->
