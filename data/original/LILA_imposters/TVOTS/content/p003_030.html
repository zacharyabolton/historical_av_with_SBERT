He complains of having <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> much illtreatment at the hands of Mr. Sneed, and appears greatly distressed and dissatisfyed. Among other things he says, he is not regarded at your house as one of your negroes but as belonging to my Fathers estate. Whether there is any truth in what he says I am entirely unable to tell. Permit me to say however as a matter of feeling, that he is an old man, that he was a favorite negro of his old Master, on which account I think as much <i>[unclear: --nity]</i> ought to be extended to him as the nature of the case will admit barring the question entirely as to whom he may belong, if it is agreeable to you, I am willing that he may stay here upon any terms that may hereafter be considered right and equitable. If you do not approve of this, the negro is here and you can take such steps as you think fit in the matter. I have advised York to return home, He <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> refuses to do so. I have written the above very reluctantly because it was a case in which I was really at a loss what to do. I hope you will not think it an offensive interference in your affairs as nothing is farther from my intention. Let me assure you that all I have said in this matter is in a spirit of friendship and <ins>in</ins> accordance with what I believe would be the wishes of our Father on this subject. And who, if he could be permitted to witness the present state of things between us, and the means by which it has been brought about, would deplore it with grief and anguish which would be inconsolable.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Affectionately <abbr expan="yours">yrs</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="John">Jno</abbr> G.
