Now wouldn't you like to see my letter to her? or at least know its contents? If I thought it would make you really jealous, I would send you a copy, for I like to see a jealous woman sometimes. But as a copy would be very long I will give you the substance. I wrote to tell her how much her poems were admired by several literary people to whom they were submitted. I had to tell her what each one said, about each little poem (three in all) and as they said a great many pretty things - and I wished to say some pretty things too it made a long letter. Then I had to tell her where I meant to have them published. Then the news &amp; gossip of <abbr expan="New York">N.Y.</abbr> took up a page or two and then I told her that I had made up my mind to get married soon and wanted to know what she thought of it, with her peculiar notions on that old institution matrimony. I told her if she had been a marrying woman, as she ought to have been when I first knew her, she would have caught me before I ever saw my other sweet heart who is now to be my wife - but the gig is all up now - it is too late. How often will you kiss me when we meet for telling you all this?</p> <p>When Miss Parke's Poems come out I will send you a copy. They are mighty pretty.</p> <p>Here I have been running on without telling you I have been sick all day. Took Cold Saturday night, &amp; have not been to my office since. Getting better and hope to be out to <del hand="h1">day</del> morrow as usual.</p> <p>Am going with Jennie &amp; Russie to see the Black Crook on Thursday night. Wish you were here to go with us. By the way I dont think I have mentioned before that the ugliest old maid I ever saw, who has $300,000 in her own right is making the way easy for me if I am matrimonially inclined that way. Previous engagements out of the way I dont think the three hundred thousand would be an equivalent for the ugliness. She lives on Long Island and gives the most pressing invitations to come out often &amp; see her, &amp; spend my Sundays there!</p> <p>I am now a little hopeful that I will get back to Richmond next week, not to return to <abbr expan="New York">N.Y.</abbr> for a long time. I want now to direct my labours to the Country between Danville and Norfolk for several weeks.</p> <p>When you write to Sister Ella tell her I am as mad as a hornet at her long neglect of my letter. She has not written me a line.</p> <p>Bless your little heart how I do want to see you, and put my arms around that little waist till you pant about it, and then kiss the panting lips till they smile.</p> <p>I wont write you any long letters till I get another from you. All this love making on <u>one</u> side won't do. You must say a little bit of it yourself. Now good night.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Give my love to all, and believe me as ever devotedly yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>JD Imboden</p></div> <!---->
