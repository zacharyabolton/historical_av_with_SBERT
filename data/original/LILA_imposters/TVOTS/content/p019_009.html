Indeed I have nothing of interest here to write you. I come out safely after taking a very active part in late fight at Saltville. <abbr expan="General">Gen</abbr> Burbridge U.S.A. was punished <u>very</u> severely for bringing his mixed white &amp; Blacks in the vicinity of Saltville where we <u>Reserves</u> could strike them a blow. Let it be said "never more" that the silvery haired men &amp; the beardless &amp; downy cheeked youths of old <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> will not fight. They have of late made their own record &amp; the faithful Historian, &amp; future generations will give them a high place in the annals of their country.</p> <p>The fighting for the Season in this country is over, &amp; I have accepted the appointment of"Medical Director &amp; Chief Surgeon of the Reserve &amp; Local Forces of West &amp; <abbr expan="Southwest Virginia">SW.Va.</abbr>" &amp; have established my Head Quarters at this place &amp; am on duty.</p> <p>"I am in fine health, hoping when these few lines come to hand they'll find you enjoying the same God's Blessing."</p> <p>I have just read a letter from <abbr expan="Brother">Bro.</abbr> Gabl. &amp; Daughter Mollie giving account of depredations &amp;c of the Yankees. <u>They</u> now know &amp; feel what I knew &amp; was made feel near four years ago-- only they have never been made suffer from the vandals as I have suffered. They have not felt &amp; known what it was to mourn over the loss of a darling child-- the victim of a wicked relentless foe. But enough. God is just &amp; merciful-- &amp; the day of Retribution for the wicked ones who have stricken so many hearts &amp; laid waste our beautiful &amp; once happy country is nota far distant. Let it come-- I repeat it let it come-- God speed it. Amen.</p> <p>Remember me kindly to your parents &amp; Sister-- would like to see you all. With fraternal affection be kind enough please to remember me to Sammie &amp; Mat. I wrote Mat a letter &amp; enclosed it to you-- She never answered it, or if she did, I never recd. I love her very dearly, <del hand="h1">but</del> &amp; it distresses me because she neglects me. Suppose she got mad at me because Sammy foolishly <i>[unclear: did]</i>. I never wantonly abused or wronged or injured any one.</p> <p>I remember very pleasantly our delightful Boat ride-- I remember your kindness &amp; affection towards me. I will not forget it or cease to remember you kindly &amp; <abbr expan="affectionately">affly.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="Your">yr.</abbr> cousin,</div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Andrew R.
