I mess with my old messmates Trotter, Abny, Grever, Hatten Britton &amp; two Ruebushes, they all say it will not do to brake up our mess while the war lasts hope that may not be long. Tom is well he was unwell for a week or two. This march has improved is health greatly John has been unwell for a day or two but is getting something better Hunter is very unwell I think he is theatend with the fever. Capt is right unwell I think he was sent to some private house today Jake is getting quite well again he got along better through the campaign <del hand="h1">better</del> than I expected he would The boys will all recruit up now I hope. I suppose your cous Kate is married before this Oh how much I would like to have been thare I know I could have had my own fun I wish them much hapiness through this changing wourld of ours. I recieved a letter from John B dated the 8th he did not now what day it would come off I hurd that John was to be a waiter. I was surprised to hear of your cous Fannie getting married. Mr Baker is from Winchester is he not; I had thought that Capt Burke was waiting on her if so I suppose she gave him the slide.
