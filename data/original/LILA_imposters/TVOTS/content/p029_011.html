You evidently mistake what a ration is--a ration is the allowance to an adult for one day, or to two children one day. Supplies for 10 men 10 days would be 100 rations. so 10 children 10 days =50. Please correct it in that particular.</p> <p>Second-You are directed to make your report <u>correspond</u> with the <u> <i>[unclear: Prvv]</i> </u> <u>Returns</u> <u>sent in</u>. If you afterwards issued to more than <i>[unclear: one]</i> drawn for they must not be repeated. If they are your report will not agree with the Commissary's abstract which he makes up from the <i>[unclear: Prvv]</i> Returns received.
