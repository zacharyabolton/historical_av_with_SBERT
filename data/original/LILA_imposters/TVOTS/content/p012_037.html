I hope you received it. At the time I wrote the battle was raging. And as soon as it was finished I rode along the lines to ascertain how this day was going. The firing was incessant and grand. By the time I reached our left where Jackson was engaged, the enemy were repulsed and driven with great loss into Fredericksburg and under cover of his heavy batteries over the opposite side of the river. I spent the night with Bud James. The next day we confidently expected a reversal of this fight. And I again rode along the line of battle. The enemy were drawn up in large forces and in sight; but the severe punishment he had reseived the day before deterred him from pursuing the attack. Thus the two armies remained all day Sunday and Monday. Monday Afternoon the enemy asked permission to bury his dead, which was granted. Monday night he hurriedly and quickly withdrew the slain army across the Rappahannock leaving some 200 or 300 of his dead unburied. Yesterday morning I rode over the battle field and counted in our place fifty five dead bodies, lying dark and cold. And almost naked. A most ghastly experience. They had been carried to some spot for burial, but their inhumane friends had left that duty unperformed and under cover of the truce flag vacated their position - So ends the Battle of Fredericksburg which I suppose Burnside will claim as a great victory. Prisoners said that he ordered a renewal of the attack on Sunday Morning, but could not get his men to come up to the scratch. His Generals remonstrated with him that it was impossible to carry our position. And then the On to Richmond is again delayed. Last evening Jackson's Corps moved towards Port Royal. And one now believes that place and Fredericksburg shows what the enemy are about. I have not heard. -- Changing his base I suppose. </p> <p>It is bitter cold to night, but very comfortable in our tent. A little stove keeping it warm, but not as comfortable as by your side. No other place can be. I cannot lay down much. I miss you. how I long to be with you again. but alas I fear we can not be much together again until this war closes. And when will that be? God only knows -- Could you see Mrs. Hall soon <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> may send word to Mr. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> that his brother is well. <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>Mr Ratliff reached camp safely -- Give love to All. Kiss <i>[unclear: my]</i> little ones for me. And for my <i>[unclear: sake]</i> endure the <i>[unclear: privations]</i> of your situation as wonderfully as possible. I shall take care of myself. And get word to you again as soon as possible. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Ever yours</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.H.
