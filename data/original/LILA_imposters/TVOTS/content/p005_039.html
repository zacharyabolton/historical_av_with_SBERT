I can in a few lines tell you where I stand, I am in favor of a united South, first last and all the time, whether right or wrong I go with the South. I am anti- disunion and anti coercion, but the union is dissolved and what's the use to shut our eyes to the fact, if we cannot reconstruct let's all go together peacibly if we can, forcibly if we must. for we have but one and the same destiny, one and the same interest, then what's the use to deny the true state of the case, and fool &amp; cheat the people by singing hozanahs to the union when there is no union! I am called a <u>fire eater disunionist</u> &amp;c &amp;c, but I dont care what they call me, I am going to say what I think and believe, and let consequences take care of themselves.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Hoping you are well<br>I remain<br>Yours Truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>G.
