John be careful of your moustache, <u>goatee</u> imperial &amp; whiskers if you do go. I could not bear for you to write me that one of old Abe's men had deprived you <u>of a part</u> of them.</p> <p>Putting all jesting aside John, I fear you will have to go. How much I dread it. I entertain the hope that we will only have a <u>brush</u> &amp; all will be restored to peace &amp; harmony again. What a state of affairs! Our quiet Union the envy of the old countries roken in pieces - First <u>one</u> corner &amp; then another, scale by scale. Not by one unanimous &amp; universal crack, as if done by men blindfolded, but inch by inch here a little &amp; there a little with their eyes open to its awful effect. I am not a great hand on "politics" but <del hand="h1"></del> my "war" calls forth my every sentiment &amp; <i>[unclear: exerts]</i> my every nerve. My <u>beau</u> (Mr. Hill) was to see me on yesterday &amp; asked me what I thought of <u>him</u> going. I told him I would be sorry to see <u>any</u> of them going &amp; particularly him, yet if he was needed in defense of his country, to go certainly, that if I was a "wife" I should say so, &amp; would upon no account <u>of mine</u> have him stay. He gently laid his arm around me &amp; did what a certain cousin of mine did, by the name of Berrie, when on his buggy the Sunday before I left home for Nelson, &amp; said <u>that</u> you have the right spirit, &amp; I love you. Right broad assertion I think, don't you. He told me to tell you that if you ventured a challenge you had better be cautious or you might get "suck in." Never mind, John I'll be your "second" &amp; then he will be afraid to hurt you. I thank you much kindly for your papers, I feel like I am again in old Augusta when reading them.</p> <p>Do not disappoint me in coming over this summer for many of the girls are anxious to see you &amp; I am as anxious to exhibit you.</p> <p>I'll kiss you for the "bouquet" of flowers when we meet. You are a good boy. How I envy <u> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> </u> her chance in receiving an offer from you. I think your conversation with her on cousins marrying was right severe. I'll pay you when I see you for what you said about <u>me</u> "crushing" your prospects. You scamp you.</p> <p>I was a anxious to hear whose houses were burnt on Mt. Solon &amp; could not <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> you told me.</p> <p>My school is very good. I have made $40 clear since I saw you. I do not know how much longer I will teach after July, perhaps until Oct. Can't tell until after the "war." John I am so much obliged to you for attending to my "note" for me. Hope to be able to remunerate some day. We expect to have a pic-nic some time this summer. Will you come over - John write soon if your letter is necessarily brief so I can hear where you are. The rains have played havoc with us on this side of the mountain too. The river is <u>very</u> full I came near being drowned once. The horse got swamped &amp; I had to wade out. Came near "going with the tide." Lignora the lady with whom I board sends her love to you &amp; says she believes that you &amp; I are courting, if not engaged. Write soon to your cousin.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Rush</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Julia is always fretting &amp; talking about John says if only she could see him sends her love to you.<br><br>dont forget to write.</p></div>
