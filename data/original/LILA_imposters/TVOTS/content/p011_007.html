Thursday we came on through Charlottesville, across the S.W. Mts. on <abbr expan="which">wh.</abbr> Monticello is situated and then on nearly along the line of the Va. C.R.R. and spent the night with the Rev. Mr. Boyden, next neighbor to <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> C. Rives -- we were very kindly treated by him -- he is pastor of an episcopal church nearby; a beautiful stone edifice, one of the neatest I ever saw -- We heard in the night that the Yankees were near Gordonsville, but find today that they are still some distance away, though threatening this direction -- Our cavalry brought in fourteen of them today, that they took. Gen. Jackson has not yet arrived, though I supposed he soon will -- The troops are coming in and some of them have gone out on the Orange and Alexandria Road -- the Cars went up to Staunton today, the first time for several days, so I suppose you will get the papers again now -- We are on the hard fodder line now -- some of the troops have not been fed for 24 hours as they were brought up on the cars and their supplies came by wagon -- or rather their wagons had to come up to them over the common roads. I saw young Blair, James today, some one of the boys had stolen his boots and he was barefooted -- so I found a pair of old shoes and gave them to him --</p> <p> I do not know what is to be done --There are all sorts of extravagant stories in circulation -- some say that Jackson is to have 80000 men and go to Pennsylvania by the way of Harrisburg -- and some that he is to go to Washington &amp;c &amp;c. But I do not presume to know anything about it as yet -- though I doubt not he will be allowed to have his own way -- You will see all the news there is, in the papers. I will write to you often, and you can write to me through Major H.M. Bell who is now the chief <abbr expan="Quarter Master">Q.M.</abbr> at Staunton. You can keep my clothes until I write to you where to sent them. My Love to all God bless you and keep you safely -- </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="Affectionate">Aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
