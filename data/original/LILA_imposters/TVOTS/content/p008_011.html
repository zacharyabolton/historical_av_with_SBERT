Do me the favor to write me if it will be necessary to impress additional transportation if I can send you 6 to 8 wagons &amp; teams <i>[unclear: along]</i> belonging to the Confederate States.</p> <p>I desire if you can do so, that you will demit the teams impressed to be returned as fast as I send out state teams to take the place of them. Capt. Hull, Quarter Master at Greenbrier River says his horses are suffering for corn &amp; it cannot be supplied from that county. He also wrote he wanted a large quantity of clothing of various sorts, which I sent to the Quarter Master General. He <i>[unclear: answers]</i> me that he has a very small quantity of clothing &amp; that Capt. <i>[unclear: Hull]</i> does not make a requisition allowance to support that. It would be well for a regular requisition to be put in for what clothing is required for any portion of your command, as winter is approaching &amp; the <i>[unclear: county]</i> you are now in <i>[unclear: requiring]</i> comfortable clothing &amp; c. Please tell me &amp; I will get any article that can be had, that is necessary for your command.
