I can give you no definite idea as to where we will be located on the return of the Command. We are looking for orders daily to take the Train to the Command and I am of opinion we will be returned to the neighborhood of Staunton. I cannot therefore tell you which I think the best route to take in case you come out. It may be several weeks before the Cars run to Staunton and it may not be more than a few days as I do not know the extent of damage done the road. But I suppose they will run up as high as Charlottesville soon. I will write you again as soon as opportunity occurs. Do what you may deem best about coming out and act accordingly.</p> <p>I want to see you so much and hope the opportunity may occur during the Summer to get home and see you all. Tell Johnny I have no way in the world to send him the Tobacco. Can't he take you to Orange <abbr expan="Court">Ct.</abbr> House to the Cars and then he could lay in a Box for you and himself also? If you have the opportunity lay in a good supply to trade for such work as you need. Kiss the dear little children for me and remember me to all the family.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>In Haste I am As Ever<br> Your <abbr expan="affectionate">Aff.</abbr> and Devoted Husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="D.
