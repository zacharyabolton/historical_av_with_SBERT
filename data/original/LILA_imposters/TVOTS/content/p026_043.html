I left home the next morning &amp; reached the city on the same evening &amp; was surprised and disapointed to learn that you had returned home. Being home for several days &amp; not engaged in <u>settling </u><u>accounts</u> between the two states, I have turned my attention to the <u>general</u> <u>race</u> for <abbr expan="Governor">Gov<sup>r</sup></abbr> that is likely to take place in the spring. Many of our friends in the Legislature prefer you for <abbr expan="Governor">Gov<sup>r</sup></abbr> &amp; with our Conservative friends on the South Side of James River you are decidedly their choice. Fayette McMullin is in the field &amp; says he will be at your next court in Augusta. <abbr expan="General">Gen<sup>l</sup>.</abbr> Thompson or <abbr expan="General">Gen<sup>l</sup>.</abbr> Mahone will be the regular <i>[unclear: Secesion ]</i> Candidate. Our friends here are inclined to put you, myself &amp; Nelson in the field &amp; if your Townsman &amp; kinsman <del hand="h1">was</del> <ins>were</ins> out of the way, there would be no difficulty about the success of the ticket. Nelson is willing &amp; anxious to go on the ticket for Attorney <abbr expan="general">Gen<sup>l</sup></abbr>. I learn that <abbr expan="Governor">Gov<sup>r</sup>.</abbr> Boreman has appointed companions to meet us. Would it not be well for us to meet here on Wednesday the 13<sup>th</sup> of March. &amp; if we agree upon any satisfactory basis of settlement <abbr expan="Governor">Gov<sup>r</sup></abbr> Pierpoint can convene the Legislature &amp; fix the question of the payment of the States interest on the public debt, which I learn will be adjourned till <u>we</u> make our report. I had a long interview last evening with Alexander Mosby, who has taken charge of the <i>[unclear: Ticking]</i> &amp; who prefers you for <abbr expan="Governor">Gov<sup>r</sup></abbr> &amp; is very desirous that you should become a candidate for the office. Nelson &amp; I will pursue any course you may adopt. I shall remain here till Wednesday at 2 oclock. Write me fully either here or at Home -- Posts Slow.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>In haste yours Truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><abbr expan="William">W<sup>m</sup></abbr> Martin</div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>NB -- If we dont meet in March I would prefer July or August as I shall be in court during the spring months &amp; the month of June.
