I got to the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> Saturday the 9 and would have writen yesterday but the mail was carried off before I new it. I wrote to you once from Columbia and again at Ashland. Tell Ma I am a better hand to take care of my self than she thought. I flanked the Yankees until I got across the James <abbr expan="River">R.</abbr> and please don't be so uneasy about me in the future.</p> <p> <i>[unclear: Col]</i> M &amp; Judge say that they think it best for me to join the Wise Troop for three very good reasons. 1 that <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Steptoe is willing to take me in his mess. 2 you can get nearly twice as much for your hors to eat as a general thing in a small Company than you can in a large &amp; when they issue corn you get a bag for each company and if the company is small you get as much more. 3 and best reason you will fare better in that line your self. You can buy any thing you want from the government at their price with his consent.</p> <p>The mail is about to leave and I must close. Love to all the family &amp; Cousin Kate. Direct your letter to Orang <abbr expan="Court House">CH</abbr>. </p></div> <!----> <!----> <!---->
