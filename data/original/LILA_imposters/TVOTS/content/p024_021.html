I always feel sad, when I think of those who <u>once</u> were <u>our brother</u> associates; but they are gone, &amp; their graves, we can not but think, are the monuments of living spirits, whose bodies have assumed originality. There is a time for sadness &amp; a time for pleasure; &amp; of the former, we ought to be submissive as possible, knowing that it proceeds from afflictions, bereavements, &amp;c. inflicted for our benefit.</p> <p>I have often wished, Midie, that I was a good <u>Christian</u>, not that I could only be better contented here on earth, but that I might be triumphant of Life in death; but why yearn, when there is a <u>way</u> of inheritance?</p> <p>Your advice is wholesome; &amp; is the the path of duty; but how many, like myself, know, &amp; do not (no <ins>re</ins>ference to you.)</p> <p>I suppose the inclemency of the weather, prevented, or made it unpleasant for your singing; my fears of such on Friday changed my intentions: as I have been partially an invalid. Was inde<ins>e</ins>d very sorry to hear of the misforutnte of Miss McC. - learned she was badly hurt. I indeed sympathize with her, although knowing that she is in good hands, &amp; will be kindly wa<ins>i</ins>ted upon. So Billie is a changed boy - in what respect? fallen from the standard of moral rectitude &amp; integrity, or withdrawn from the precedents to conjugal relations? Excuse inquisitiveness; ha! 'tis all in fun with me. I imagine misplaced affection, with marriage, would be more than miserable; how many half loved marriages take place, in that one or the other commit themselves by word or writ. You say you have much to tell me; as I do not now know when I shall see you, you must write me. As this day adds another year of my life &amp; about the Anniversary of the surrender, so I feel in a bad mood for writing, have no news, more than peace is declared, War at an end, poverty reigns, &amp; new spring goods in abudnance at A. H. Come over &amp; see the latest agonies. My true &amp;c. E.A.S. sends love to <u>you</u>, (my <u>highly</u> appreciated) she is recovering from a very bad cold; she knows not to whom <ins>I'm writing</ins> but suspects, &amp; said give the above: - truly private, all this, Midie, I wish. As there is a meeting of the Overseers tomorrow, may send up this to Mr. Fauber, to give ot your Pa.</p> <p>Let me know if you can when is the last of your singing, as I want to go over, if possible. Jno. Wright &amp; Sisters were well, when last heard from. Well did you get any April fools? I was fortunate this year; <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> no chips for dinner.</p> <p>Do you send any Valentines these times? Saw a very nice one not long since, that had been sent to a fellow; in hand-write, resembling yours so much, that it in my mind, was your identical. I however did not tell the fellow that I knew; as telling him, would be telling on self. ha! ha!!</p> <p>Hee appeared very anxious to find out even if he was playing ignorance. I think you &amp; J.S.S. got the thing up. Tried at first to lay the blame on me; but he made nothing.</p> <p>Love to all &amp; much for yourself.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your true Friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Angus</p></div> <!---->
