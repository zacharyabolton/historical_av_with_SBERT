Weller Lieut. Kenny Lieut. Lindsay Davis (privates) Gilliott and Stogdale None in our Company was hurt we all got back to our old Camp on the 7th of May safe and sound five were killed out of our regiment and seven wounded altogether The biggest fighting was done about 13 miles above Fredericksburg they say our men charged Out of their breast works three lines deep They say that the ground looked blue with yanks and our men killed about three to one The Yankees acknowledged they lost about thirty thousand killed missing and wounded about the same that our men estimated their loss at some say our loss was about nine thousand killed missing and wounded the Yankees papers put ours at pretty much the same They say we got about nine thousand prisoners and that the Yankees got about four thousand of ours They say old Joe fallen back from the river here at Fredericksburg no signs of a fight here now where Old Joe will make a break next god only knows They say he is very much depressed Well he ought to bee I wish he would dry up and go in his hole As I have written a letter to you before this concerning the fight I will quit writing about fighting One great loss to our Country is our beloved Jackson he died on the 10th being wounded then taking the pneumonia it soon took him off </p> <p>The weather has been pretty hot here for a few days the leaves are pretty near as large as they will get wheat looks well through here what is not very much been put out through here John Craun and John Hale arrived here yesterday They say things are a great deal forwarder here than in Augusta Adam H Craun has been elected second Lieutenant in our Company Jacob H. Craun is out of the Guard house Old Mike took all out that was of good standing deducted their wages during the time of their absence The morning of the fight Old Mike said all that would come out and go in the fight would be released A great many come out all the boys belonging to our Company come out except Sandy Frasier and Donner Donner aint to blamed being sick All them that would not come out were sent to Richmond to be court-martialed we have no guardhouse now which makes duty lighter upon us The boys are all well except Luther A Misner Stephen D Elliott and George M Crist they are complaining a little We drill twice a day now for exercise We have good times now I dont know how long we will stay here Whenever the heshians make a break we are ready for them One thing I must acknowledge fighting is not very Pleasant work the worst is going to it but when one is in to it once and fires a few rounds he becomes less excited I hate these infernal bums that the Yankees throw at us they make such dreaded, noise they make one believe they are going to hit him if they dont come near him I will have to close write and give me the news from old Augusta This leaves me well and I hope when these few lines come to hand they may find you all enjoying good health </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Adam W Kersh</p></div> <!---->
