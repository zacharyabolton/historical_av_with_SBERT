I hasten to reply.</p> <p>First let me express great satisfaction your Statement of facts affords me. I was slow in believing that the veterans once commanded by our beloved and the departed Hero, the Immortal Jackson, could or would ever falter in the discharge of their duty. </p> <p>I will briefly state the the occurrences of Sunday May 3<sup>rd</sup> in order that you may understand <u>why</u> I reported to <abbr expan="Major General">Maj. Gen.</abbr> R.E. <i>[unclear: Rodes]</i> that I had passed over <i>[unclear: Jones']</i> <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr> and a <u>part</u> of <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Paxton's. Having been in the advance Friday and <abbr expan="Saturday">Sat.</abbr> our Division was placed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> line on Sunday. Soon I was ordered to advance to the support of our 2nd line. Arriving at the enemy's first line of breast works at a <i>[unclear: dary]</i> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <i>[unclear: crisis]</i>. I found behind this line a large body of troops 3 <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> sometimes 6 deep. I immediately halted my <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig.</abbr> &amp; told these troops the order was to advance. Directed them to move forward, that I would support them. Not a man moved. I then enquired what troops were there. Several men answered "I belong to the Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>" I asked for <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Paxton, whom I knew as a brave man and true. They could not tell me where he was but stated he had moved to the Right. I then moved on to the right, asked again about 75 or 100 <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> from the men I had just questioned. As above, what troops they were lying in my front. I was answered "We belong to the Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>" I hastened on to the right. About fifty <abbr expan="yards">yds</abbr> further to the right when I found an Officer in Majors uniform. In answer to my questions he told me that he belonged to Jones <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig.</abbr> that <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> Jones was not there and that <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> <i>[unclear: Garnett]</i> <abbr expan="Commander">Comd.</abbr> of the <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr> had been killed. The troops on his right were those of Jones' <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>. These troops I urged to go forward. They did not move. The crisis was <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del>. A general advance of the whole line I knew had been ordered. Therefore I ordered my <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr> forward over those of <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Jones' and <ins>over those who told me that they were of the Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr>.</ins> and my officers &amp; men have been under the impression that they ran over Paxton and Jones Brigades. I am happy to correct an impression which does injustice to the Brigade called after the Immortal "Stonewall", which I will do most cheerfully by having your letter published to <i>[unclear: the very]</i> troops at Dress Parade.</p> <p>The number of men who said they belonged to the Stonewall <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig</abbr> I do not know. I take it they were rather lost from their <abbr expan="regiments">regts.</abbr> &amp; were skulkers or were other than they represented themselves to be.</p> <p>I have sent to all that I have always deprecated all miserable jealousies between troops from Sister States <i>[unclear: contending]</i> for a common and glorious cause and this matter has been spoken of by me with caution and regret. In order to explain any terrible loss more than 1/2 of the force carried into action I conceived it to be my duty to report to <abbr expan="Major General">Maj. Gen.</abbr> Rodes that though frequently sent for <ins>after my <abbr expan="Brigade">Brig.</abbr> advanced to come to my assistance</ins>, and twice by myself ordered forward, the troops <ins>I had passed over</ins> refused to drive the enemy from a gap on my right flank, from which position he was pouring a destructive <i>[unclear: enfilading]</i> fire into my line by which I lost most of my men.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Col Very Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>S.
