The decree directs my client to be paid out of the first money in hand &amp; before any investment of funds, but Mr. Davis has not carried out his "trust" in as much as he has recd. more than enough money to pay me, but has otherwise invested the funds.</p> <p>Poor Virginia!!!!!!! it makes me feel bad to call her "the mother" of anything--except such miscreants as Bolts Carlisle Stuart--Coleman--fit sons of the now degenerate "Mother"--</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Covington [Carrington?]</p></div> <!---->
