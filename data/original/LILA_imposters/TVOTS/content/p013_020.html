I have had very little<br> opportunity to make the inquiries you<br> wish. I have been on road detail<br> to day (making corduroy road to<br> Guinney's<sup>[2]</sup>) and have to go again to<br> morrow, so you see it will be<br> impossible to go to Guinney Station<br> before Monday, if indeed I can go then.<br> I suppose you were led to believe, that<br> large profits could be made on skillets<br> from having <ins>heard</ins> us speak of having to pay<br> 12 or 15 dollars for one. If you could get<br> that price, it would pay very well, but<br> I do not think you could get it; unless<br> you could get them to the different<br> brigades of the army and sell them there,<br> in which case, I think they would bring<br> 12 <abbr expan="dollars">dols'</abbr>. The sutlers <sup>[3]</sup> of regiments do not<br> buy them at all, so far as I can hear, unless<br> they get orders for them. As for the<br> Sutlers at the Station, I can not speak<br> positively, but think they act in the same<br> way. The day you went up, McKee <sup>[4]</sup> failed<br> to get one, but got the promise of one soon, if<br> he would leave 10 <abbr expan="dollars">dols</abbr>, his name etc, which<br> he would not do. However I am of the<br> opinion that you might sell them there<br> for 8 dollars apiece, in lots of 20, or 30,<br> and it might be as many as 60.<br> I think there would be no risk in you<br> staying a few days, at the Station. But you<br> know there is no accomodation there, and no<br> place to keep them. I got the box that night.<br> It was a treat, I tell you, but you will know that<br> after the sight of it. The coffee is delicious.<br> McKee got his furlough next day and started<br> in about an hour. John D. got his too,<br> and went Monday. I want you to send me a<br> tin plate by him. If you buy skillets, you<br> ought to do it at once while the army is<br> lying quiet. A good many soldiers have been courtmartialed<br> in the brigade. Several were publicly whipped today, and<br> four others <i>[unclear]</i>.<br> <ins>Haven't heard the sentences of the Killians<sup>[5]</sup>.</ins> </p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Andrew</p></div> <!---->
