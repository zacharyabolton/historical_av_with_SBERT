It swarms with very great typograhpical errors -- many of which you must have observed. The greatest of them <del hand="h1">in</del> connects in changing <u>foibles</u> or the not horrible word <u>follies</u> in the sentence; "Undoubtably he had his foibles &amp; his faults" &amp;. I have requested Sandy to correct <u>that</u> in his paper, &amp; and that alone out of a hundred, some of which pervert my meaning.</p> <p>I have sent a clean copy to the <abbr expan="Richmond">Rich.</abbr> Whig, with several additional paragraphs, &amp; and a number of smaller additions <ins>&amp; some vital changes</ins> throughout the piece. If it appears in the Whig, I would thank you to read it there (if you <u>can</u>) &amp; then give me your candid opinion of it <u>as a delineation of Jo's character</u>. I think it paints the man to the life. If the coloring is rather warm, I agree with Macaulay that the best portraits have something of caricature -- making up in <i>[unclear: impessureness]</i> what they want in fidelity.</p> <p>Is any trait omitted? Is any thing awry? Please run your pen through any <i>[unclear: usage]</i> &amp; word you think ought to be struck out, &amp; write me any additions. I want to make the thing as perfect as possible.</p> <p>I intend of course to send copies to our friends in California, &amp; if they approve it, to submit the piece for De Bow's Review (De Bow having requested me to write for it.)</p> <p>I would like to have Aunt Martha's opinion, having the highest respect for her literary taste. Present her with my kind regards.</p> <p>I am sorry I did not retain the sketch to retouch at my leisure. I wrote it in two days <u>currente calarro</u>, &amp; I hurried off to Garter. I had just <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> a letter from Cornelia giving me the particulars of Jo's last illness, &amp; enclosing a copy of the proceedings of the San Francisco bank &amp;c. She returned from Europe last spring. Her health is delicate but she thinks improving. I have incorporated in my sketch nearly all the information she gave me. I do not know what the surgical operation was, but I <u>guess</u> it was for the <u>piles</u> -- an hereditary disease in our family -- I mean my father's. Pa is quite well for a man of 76.</p> <p>By the way, permit me to introduce to you Briscoe G. Baldwin the 3<sup>d</sup>, a fine boy of mine, just a year old. Please introduce him also to your family &amp; to Aunt Martha.</p> <p>I have only two children by my present wife -- both boys -- the oldest Charles Cornelius Cyrus -- 7 1/2 years old.</p> <p>I hope to be in Staunton in a few weeks.</p> <p>Favor me with an early answer.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours very truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>C. C. Baldwin</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.: Among the typographical errors alluded to, let me note the following: In speaking of my ever-revered mother -- the best human being I ever knew -- I described her as </p><u>refined</u> -- not <u>retired</u> -- I said Jo's life was <u>un</u>eventful -- not eventful -- that his <u>instincts</u> were all chivalrous&gt; &amp; -- not his interests -- that he was fond of field events &amp; horse-racing -- not <u>some</u> racing -- meaning racing horses along the road -- that in conversation was well-<u>informed</u> -- not well-expressed -- that his tales were all <u>natural</u> -- not rational -- that there was no cant, bigotry, or intolerance about him -- not <u>intemperance</u> &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c <br>Among the addenda in the Whig, are these <i>[unclear: thoughts]</i>. <br>His sense of the ridiculous was very keen, &amp;, when his blood was up, old Sam Kasm himself could hardly excell him in sarcasm, ridicule, invective, and denunciation. X X X <br>He was an original, adventurous, &amp; and intrepid thinker, even to audacity -- I go on for ten or fifteen lines. <br>His highest ambition was to be a chivalrous high-toned gentleman, spotless &amp; reproachless; next and accomplished lawyer &amp; a<del hand="h1">n</del> <ins>learned,</ins> professorial &amp; philosophic jurist; &amp; then a justified scholar &amp; an eloquent writer &amp; speaker -- a backwoods Lord Broughkam as he would have expressed it. We <ins>are</ins> inclined to think that he would have preferred the jures intellectual <i>[unclear: sermon]</i> of Marshall as <u>the</u> great Constitutional and philosophic jurist of America, even to the effulgent glory which emblazons the name of Washington. <br>I beleive this is strictly true. In all his letters to me he was a better lawyer than any thing else &amp; that his highest ambition was to be a great jurist. <br>I may show you some of these times portraits &amp;c drawn of you &amp; Mr B in strong contrast in some respects. Neither of you had any better friend in this world -- Excuse the trouble I give you.</div>
