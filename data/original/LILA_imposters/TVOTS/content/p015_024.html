We are now laying in line of battle, about 14 miles below Orange <abbr expan="Courthouse">C. H.</abbr> on the Rapidan river. Came here yesterday evening. Since which time we have busily engaged throwing up <i>[unclear: fortifications]</i>. The Yankee Cavalry are visible on the opposite side, they have made no attempt to cross since this day one week ago; this being the day they drove our cavalry out of Culpeper. Our line is at present about 15 miles long, the enemy has some three places of crossing. If they should attempt to cross at either or all of these places, they will meet with strong resistince I assure you, as we have a very good position.</p> <p>Your letter dated Sept 4<sup>th</sup> came to hand a day or two previous to our leaving camp; the envelope was torn all to pieces, and was probably read more than once before it was handed to one, but if it was it dont matter.</p> <p>Since I commenced writing the Canons has commenced firing &amp; I should not be surprised if before this time tomorrow we will have bloody times here. A detail is just starting back to the wagons to cook rations <i>[unclear: Mr McEllence]</i> has been with us for more than a week. I heard him preach two sermons since he came into camp. he is staying with the 25 <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> in the end Brigade.</p> <p>In refference to the wedding you spoke of - had not heard one word of it untill I received your letter. I then made some inquiry &amp; after some time found out the Chap, well "that gits me sure" - you said for <u>half</u> <u>cent</u> you would give your opinions. Now just give it <ins>in</ins> your next &amp; I'll give you twice that amount.
