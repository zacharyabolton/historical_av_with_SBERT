I dont remember. I never heard anything of the trouble between Capt. S. &amp; Dr. H. -- I am sorry for it -- What was done. I will write to Nelly in a few days -- We are still here, but may move soon -- My store holds out well -- enough for a month more at least. Mr. Phillips sent me 500 soups -- I told you of them they are very nice -- but not of red -page two- pepper &amp;c -- it only takes 30 minutes to prepare them. I hope he will remember the seeds -- I will try &amp; remind him some way -- before long -- We finished the apple butter last night &amp; you would have laughed to have seen <abbr expan="Boswell">Bos</abbr> scrape the dish -- he says it was as good as preserves. We have a joke on him from last year, a man where we staid said he "ate preserves like it was apple butter", so he has the name of Preserves now &amp; then -- Yesterday finished a map to accompany the Report of the battle of Winchester, <abbr expan="which">wh.</abbr> the Gen. pronounced "beautifully executed", &amp; Col. Faulkner "remarkably accurate".</p> <p> The mail goes soon -- I will write more very soon -- Write me soon, good letters, they are if short &amp; excuse <u>this</u> short one -- I am very well, thank God.</p> <p>Kisses &amp; love for all at home </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
