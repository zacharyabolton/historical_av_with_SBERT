I am sorry I cannot do so, but as I returned from Richmond on Thursday I cannot go back again so soon.</p> <p>I went down on last Monday to call Stuart to account for his denial on Friday of what he had said to Harmon &amp; myself. At Gordonsville I first saw his apology of Saturday morning, but kept on to the city. When I got there I found that there was but one opinion in regard to the matter, and that was that Sandy had said inconsistent things, that he had either lied on Friday or on Saturday. Gov. Wise, O. J. Wise, Lt. Gov. Montague, Wm F. Gowan &amp; several others with whom Harmon &amp; I conferred, said there was no need of our pressing the matter, that he (S.) had wholly acquitted us of all imputation &amp; we might drop it <del hand="h1">the matter</del>. But on our own <i>[unclear: hook]</i> to make the matter perfectly clearwe addressed Sandy a little <u>billet doux</u>, asking his attention to the published report of his remarks on <u>both</u> Friday &amp; Saturday, and to say in reply exactly what we were to understand he meant in respect to us. About midnight we got a reply which was a square <u>back down</u>, and exonerated us from all possible imputation. I intended making a publication of this correspondence, and also a more complete statement in detail of what he had said the evening he mentioned the "plot" to us, and to have accompanied it with the letter of another gentleman to whom he made a similar statement <u>nine</u> days <u>after</u> his conversation with Harmon &amp; myself, and said unqualifiedly that "there was a plot on foot, and if it succeeded, one of the first acts of the Convention would be to change the organic law of the State, and turn Letcher out of office &amp; put Gov. Wise in his place." The gentleman to whom he made this Statement furnished it to me in writing, and another man in public life sent me word, that to him the samecommunication was made, and if it became necessary he would testify. So that I should have had <u>four</u> witnesses against him on the fact he denied to Wise in the Convention. But on consultation with Gov. Wise &amp; the other friends I have named, &amp; numerous outsiders, the universal opinion was that we ought not to publish, that the public already understood that Sandy had lied, and that being down in the mud it would unmagnanimous and unmanly to gouge &amp; pummel him. We have therefore simply filed away the documents for safe keeping &amp; future use if circumstances require it. I shewed the correspondence to scores of persons before I left <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> &amp; here since my return. The idea you mention that my defeat had anything to do with this matter is absurd, for the conversation occurred before either Stuart or myself were candidates, &amp; not being in any sense <u>private</u>, was communicated to Douglas &amp; many others <u>the same night</u> 13th January, and was talked about by us in the City all the next day, &amp; no doubt Stuart heard of ourspeaking of it before we came home from <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> &amp; before either of us was a candidate. By the way he left the impression in his response to Wise that Col. Baldwin was present at the conversation. He takes all that back in his letter to us and says he only meant to say <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> <abbr expan="Baldwin">B.</abbr> was <u>in the City</u> at the same time, &amp; being his <abbr expan="brother">bro.</abbr> in law the probabilities were that he would have mentioned the matter to him! but did not. I wish I could be with you in <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> You will soon be disgusted with the submission feeling that pervades the body of the Convention. Gov. Wise is the only real living embodiment of the true spirit which should animate Virginia at this time. I told him in <abbr expan="Richmond">R.</abbr> the other day that I delegated him to represent <u>me</u> on the floor of that body, as I have no immediate representative there. John we are going to have fearful times here in Virginia. I am afraid we shall have a war amongst ourselves. I have made up my mind that if <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> submits to the dishonor of standing by and seeing war made in the Seceded states, I will leave <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> I am persuaded that a majority of our people here are ready for that. I am not and never will be. We must have <u>immediately</u> the constitutional guarantees of the Crittenden plan <u>at least</u> or go with the South. If these are refused, and <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> <u>submit</u>, I never will. I shall go to Florida or Louisiana, take my family &amp; cast my lot there for life. I will <u>write</u> to Gov. Wise whilst you are in <abbr expan="Richmond">R</abbr>. Mary writes in love to you and yours. She is a red hot Southern Confederacy woman.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J D Imboden</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.
