Such is not the case, their transportation being insufficient for their ordinary wants, leaving the business of the Bureau to suffer through their helplessness. One wagon is needed at each of the three principal points in this District, viz Winchester, Staunton, and Lexington.</p> <p>I have also respectfully to request action upon the requisitions previously forwarded as the articles therein required are now very much needed.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am, Colonel<br>Very <abbr expan="Respectfully">Resply</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>WSH<br><abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> &amp;c</p></div> <!---->
