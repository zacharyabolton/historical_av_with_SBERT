The old people don't like to have a church Choir sing unless all "<i>[unclear: Professers]</i>" They are so religious that they cant sing educational songs, and yet can fight and devour one another. </p> <p>The short nights have obliged us to drop our last 5 night schools and our average has been light for the same reason but the work is none the less important. </p> <p>We have had a public "Exhibition" by the scholars <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> could not have been excelled by any white school at the north so far as the Declamation is concerned. </p> <p>When we look back 8 mo.
