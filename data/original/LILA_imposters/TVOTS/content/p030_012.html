S. Lacey Agent in charge 7th Sub-<abbr expan="District">Dist</abbr> of <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> with the information that I have repeatedly called on C.W. Oltman and demanded payment of the entire $8.50. He acknowledged the correctness of the account and each time promised to pay it as soon as he had gotten money which he was then expecting. These repeated promises were the cause of my delay in returning the papers as I had hoped (over) to enclose the money with them.</p> <p>Oltman is a foreigner and has no property here, nor are there any means of recovering the money by force as I have now good reason to believe that he neither has any, nor is there any due him by anybody in Lexington.</p> <p>I understand he expects to get a position in Washington College and, if he obtains this his salary can be garnished.</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.W.
