Qrs.</abbr> with much care and that we have quietly pitched our tents and gone to work on our maps, so it looks as though we might stay here for some days at least. The Yankees picked themselves up yesterday and left Madison <abbr expan="Court House">C. H.</abbr> and the vicinity of the Rapidan and retired beyond Culpeper <abbr expan="Court House">C. H.</abbr> having, no doubt, got notice that Jackson was moving towards them, and Pope, after all his boasting, is none too eager, I will warrant, to meet the victor of many fights.</p> <p> My clothes came to me on Sunday, quite unexpectedly, but very acceptably, though I was disappointed in not finding a letter in them -- for I wrote from Staunton and also the day I got to Gordonsville -- but I suppose you overworked yourself fixing up my clothes and had no time to write --. I will write again soon -- Direct to Gen. Jackson's <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> near Gordonsville. I am very well. May God bless you all -- write very soon </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your <abbr expan="affectionate">aff.</abbr> husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
