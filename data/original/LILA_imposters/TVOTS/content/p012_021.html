We are now camped at the same place we were at this time last year four miles below Winchester on the Valley turnpike We came here on Monday. We received orders to move above Winchester on sunday but on Monday morning we got orders to go below Winchester four miles and take up Winter quarters so we are now in our quarters for the winter unless the enemy chase us away. We have no tents although we expect them shortly I do not know how we would get along without tents as winter has already set in with us there was a considerable Snow here last friday and it is now cloudy and looks as if it would snow to night. There has been considerable fighting along the mountain lately. D H Hill had a skirmish with the enemy last week at Castlemans Ferry in which the enemys loss was forty killed, and one hundred wounded; and not a single man on our side injured. We also took several hundred prisoners, at Harpers Ferry lately, they are now in Winchester under a strong guard. It has been reported here that One division of the enemy; numbering ten, or fifteen, thousand men threw down their arms and refused to come on confederate soil to fight; but said that if we would go to invade them they would do their best fighting. I would not care much if they were all like this division refuse to invade us. I heard a few days ago that there has been a wedding close to you, John M<sup>c</sup>Kenny, &amp; Hannah Berry Lieutenant Carson got a letter last week in which it was that they were married and on a bridal trip to Giles County. Tell Mary that I think it is pretty near time she was writing as I have not got any word from home since I started away three weeks ago. I must now draw my note to a close by asking you to excuse all mistakes bad writing &amp;c</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Give my love to Aunt Ann, Uncles Jamess family and all other enquiring friends also receive a due share yourself from your affectionate nephew</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Thomas.
