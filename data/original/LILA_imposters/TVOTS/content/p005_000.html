I am anxious to see sister mary and her big <u>boy</u>. I have but little news to write, poor Sallie Douglase was buried on last Sunday at Tinkling Spring. I wanted to go down, but George McPhail came over from Greenwood and I could not go, all the people are well on the meadows, I have purchased a lot. and am engaged in building a house, I bot from Mrs. Warden just above the Academy lot, and will put up a small house three rooms below &amp; two above with a Kitchen in the basement, I will build it of brick, as it will make a warmer house and cost butlittle more than frame, and when I get it finished you &amp; <abbr expan="cousin">coz.</abbr> Liz &amp; family must not treat me the way I have treated you, but must come and see me, though our house will be small, I hope it will contain large hearts. that will ever be glad to receive a friend.</p> <p>John we received your letter addressed to our commitee, and in reply will say that you are laboring under some misapprehensions in regard to the order, "You say that you do not think it fair for you to pay after leaving" but you forgot that you could not have entered any other lodge, or become a member, without having a visiting card from this lodge, or having taken a withdrawal card, for one year and renewed the same at the expiration of the year. So you see that you will have to pay up or the lodge will expell you for <u>non payment of dues</u>. Mr Patterson tells me that in January before you left you gave him two dollars, all that you ever paid, Your case will be disposed of at the next Lodge night, Thursday next, and I wish you to inform me what to dofor you, in the premises.</p> <p>Mr Bill Crawford has spoken to me concerning a claim he has on you, for the hire of a negro and requested me to write to you concerning it. I hope you will come over with your family this Spring to see us all as it seems I will not be able to come to see you as I have often promised.</p> <p>Give my love to all</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>In haste Yours Truly</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><u>GW.
