Unfortunately for me, these parties who make the statements were, with two exceptions, out of Town when <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> McDonnell was here. I therefore take the liberty (in self defense) to forward them to you.</p> <p>The statements, as you will see, are nearly all from US Government Officers, and those that are not are from reliable Union men, and with two exceptions are from men who were here during the whole of my former period of service, and consequently I think much better qualified to judge of my conduct that several who have given their testimony on the other side, some of whom were almost entire strangers to me, and not only me but to the whole community.</p> <p>I also beg leave to refer you to the <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> James Mitchel who came here early in the Spring of 1866, as a Preacher, under the Baltimore Conference, <abbr expan="Methodist Episcopal">M. E.</abbr> Church, and remained until about four weeks ago, when he went to Richmond and (I suppose) is now a local Preacher there. Mr Mitchel is an <u>Illinois</u> <u>man</u>, and was for several years commissioner of the American Colonization and Emigration Society, under the <u>lamented</u> <u>Lincoln</u> at Washington D.C.</p> <p>I regard it as somewhat important that you should see him and talk with him face to face upon this subject, and hope you will be avail yourself of the opportunity to do so if it is in your power.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr>, with much Respect<br>Your Obedient Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Frederick S.
