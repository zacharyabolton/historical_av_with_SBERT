Sole goes down this morning &amp; offers to take my satchel so I send it -- I will have to put off my coming to the week of the S.S. Convention -- for I cannot come next Sat. &amp; then too -- I had made arrangements for you to come here a week -- thinking the fine weather would last &amp; then come down with me -- Col. Harman said he would give you a free ticket &amp; if it moderates &amp; gets warm again I wish you would see if you cannot get someone to stay with the children -- &amp; you come up here for a week, by way of variety &amp; then go back when I go. The prospect now is that W. W. Walker a stump speaker, <abbr expan="Methodist Episcopal">M. E.</abbr> Preacher, Ci devant Prof. &amp;c from Westmoreland Co. may be elected <abbr expan="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr> as a reward for party services -- Ruffner went down last night &amp; wanted me to go &amp; I had a ticket offered me but did not think it would pay considering the exposure after so much warm weather -- If you can come write to me &amp; send down to Capt. Sole to the Va. Hotel &amp; he will send the stage for you &amp; arrange all -- . I have only a moment to write -- Nelly's letter came &amp; I will reply -- Love in abundance for you all -- Don't expose yourself </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Your loving husband</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.
