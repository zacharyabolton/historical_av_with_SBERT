D., has suffered very much. We have <i>[unclear: seen]</i> fourteen of our company since the fight commenced killed wounded &amp; missing Lieut. Edmondson, Baker, Williams, Fields (Charles), and Miles are the killed; Jones, Dulaney, Andy &amp; Frank <i>[unclear: Cabrier]</i>, Schwartz &amp; John Sanders wounded, Sanders very slight &amp; Jones I don't suppose will get well. Keale, Henry and Pendleton missing. I feel very thankful that I have come off safe so far. Dear sis I would write more but have not time to do so &amp; this is all the paper I have.
