I recieved your letter on the eve before the battle of the fifth while we ware cooking rations I was truly glad to hear from you. I was wounded on last thirsday the 12th a flesh wound in the right arm near the sholder I have no doubt but you will expect me to give you a full account of the casualties of our company on that day but I am soray I can not I was wounded about nine oclock &amp; went back to the field hospital &amp; got my wound dressed &amp; stayed thare untill twelve oclock; when all that was able to walk ware ordered back to some other hospital &amp; thare was none nearer than Loeusa C.H. I beged them to let me stay untill the fight was over but they said I could be of no use &amp; would just be in the way Capt Dempster advised me to go on to some hospital Sam A Lightner Mays &amp; Hight, ware wounded &amp; came home with me all slight wounds; Lightner wounded in the right hand Mays in the left side &amp; Hight on the right sholder Jake was safe when I left him he was with me after we fell back from our breastworks &amp; I dount think our Brigde went in any more that day I have not the least doubt but many of our boys ware taken prisoners; The enimy massed thare troops in front of the second Brigade &amp; at daylight charged the second &amp; drove them from thare breastworks &amp; following them closly captured many. By having that gap open thay soon attacked our Brigade in front flank &amp; in the rear. The front line was deperesed &amp; a grate many of our boys jumped over the breastworks &amp; took after the Yanks capturing on of thare coulars Colonel Funk then told us if we did not get out of thare we would be all captured. Then we commenced retreating to our second line of works &amp; while I was crossing the field I was wounded I am very thankfull to the great &amp; good God that I came out so well the air seemed filled with the laden mesangers of death I do not know whethar Brother John came out safe or not he was on the skirmish line &amp; when the enimy advanced he fell back on the left of the Regt.
