I am well, only a pain in my back and side. Willie has been very sick with the Cholera Morbus. It weakened him down considerably, but he is now as mischievous as ever. I have had the same complaint that Willie had, but I have gotten over it.</p> <p>It is a cloudy disagreeable day today. It has been raining here today but it has quit. I tell you Dear Henry my thoughts were fixed on you all them cold snowy days last week. I don't know how you poor fellows can stand it. I know you all have a hard time out there in them cold cotton hats. I expect they will be many of you sick that haven't been.</p> <p>Tears came twinkling from my eyes when I came to where you said that you came out on a hill and seen the Laurel Spring hollow and saying to yourself how soon could I get home if I was there. But I hope if it is gods will that you will be nearer home than that hollow before long. Dear Henry no one knows how bad I want to see you. No one knows how bad it is to be from each other, only those that have tried it. But one thing I do sincerely hope that you may never volunteer again for no one one knows how bad I want you to be in peace at home again.</p> <p>I got a letter from Jack's wife and she wasn't very well. She expects to be confined soon. Jackson and Harry are in the army. William is at home on a sick furlough, he is getting better. I suppose Shenandoah has got a right nice little town on it chiefly of white houses. Tell me in your next letter how many regiments there are out there besides Baldwin's. I received the fifteen dollwars you sent by Meyers. He came up to Lewises. Amanda has the mumps but she is better (little Cate had them too). She sends her best and kindest respects to you and cousin William Diddle and to the rest of her friends out there and tell them their kindness were welcome received.</p> <p>I was sorry to hear that you was so cold when you was writing and that you all was so cold. I hope if it is for the best that it will soon be pretty clear warm weather.Who did you send your <i>[unclear: coat]</i> and letters by. I haven't got them yet. I don't know whether <i>[unclear: Mary]</i> has got hers yet or not. I seen her yesterday but I forgot to ask her. Tell Uncle Will that she and the children were all well. Mother and pap are well. pap tried to get us two calves over at old Gray's sale but they were too unreasonably high and he didn't get them.</p> <p>Tears came in mother's eyes as I read her your letter. Pray a great deal dear Henry and never forget god who is <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> who has give you health, that you have been spared so long. "Pray without ceasing."</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>From your wife M.E.D.</p></div> <!----> <!---->
