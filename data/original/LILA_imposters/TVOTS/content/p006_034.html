After waiting two <br> weeks, Mr. <abbr expan="James">Jas</abbr> Davidson of this place <br> came home from Richmond, bringing <br> us word that the Governor would not <br> call us out under any circumstances.<sup>[1]</sup> <br> Saturday night <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Nelson received <br> an official answer from S. Rafael French, <br> Aid de Camp to the Governor requiring him <br> to ascertain the consent of the parents <br> of the boys and to report to the Governor, <br> and he would then "decide the matter." <br> By the same mail <abbr expan="Professor"> Prof.</abbr> White received <br> a letter from Greenlee Davidson (son of the <br> above and clerk in the Executive department) <br> telling him to ascertain the consent of the <br> parents of the boys, and that the Governor "would <br> order us to Harpers Ferry or the Manasas <br> Junction"<sup>[2]</sup>. A good many of the boys <br> had gone home. They have been written <br> to, to return. The parents of a few of the <br> boys will keep them at home, but we <br> have been getting some recruits to fill <br> their places. There is no doubt but that <br> the company will be filled out, in a day <br> or two. We are drilling four times a <br> day. Recitations suspended. </p> <p>The captain ordered us to get flannel <br> shirts or jackets. We have no coat.</p> <p> We are out of money and would <br> like to have some this week if you can <br> send it. The County Court appropriated <br> $25,000 to equip volunteers, allowing $25 <br> per man. An effort will be made to <br> have <del hand="h1">ou</del> the remainder of our uniform<br> knapsacks paid &amp;c -paid for out of this <br> fund. Some of the court object to it, <br> because we do not all belong to the <br> county. We have heard a great many <br> reports about the fighting at Hampton<br> Harpers Ferry <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>, but they are too <br> favorable to our side to be believed. <br> I heard this evening that 7 houses in the <br> upper end of Waynesborough were burning <br> yesterday as the cars came by, couldn't <br> hear whether it was by accident or had been <br> set on fire<sup>[3]</sup>. In consequence of so many boys <br> leaving, the Faculty has called a meeting <br> of the Trustees, next Saturday, to graduate <br> the Senior Class and suspend College. <br> Whether the company goes or not it is <br> not probable we will have any more <br> College duties this session.<sup>[4]</sup> </p> <p>We will write again as <br> soon as we hear from the Governor. </p> <p>I would like to have two new pair <br> of woolen stockings. <br> William &amp; I both want a new <br> strong cotton shirt. We have one <br> apiece, our sleeping shirts which <br> have never been used. You need <br> not send them here, as we will <br> go to Staunton and most likely <br> by Waynesboro of which we will <br> give you notice. Has Ma gotten<br> home? and has she improved?<br> Write to us soon. </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>As ever your son,</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Andrew Brooks</p></div> <!---->
