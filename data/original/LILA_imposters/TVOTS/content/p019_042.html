I am up stairs in our room with little fire &amp; so cold that I <abbr expan="cannot">cant</abbr> write with a pen so you must excuse pencil. It is one of the coldest days we have had this winter. I received your kind letter several weeks ago (or rather it came here for me) as I was at Moore's at the time I spent two weeks (wanting two days) there. They nearly all had diptheria very badly. Marie had it so badly that we did not think she could live at all, but they are all well of it now. So you see my brother you will have to take off the two weeks I was there waiting on the sick folks. When I came home I spok of writing and Ma said for me to wait until Pa would start your apples to you, so you could be on the "look out" for them but I have waited, and waited, long enough for that, so I have concluded to write now as there is no probability of getting your apples off for a few days. Harry is away working on some public works, will not be home before next week, if then. We can't haul away any thing until he comes to drive the wagon I hope you will excuse your "little Sis" for not writing soone as you will see I had to battle with circumstances, but enough of this. Ginnie and Charlotte were over at <abbr expan="Old Providence">O.P.</abbr> last Sabbath They are all well there. Ginnie has been over there a good while, and will remain until about Christmas, then she will come over and stay with us awhile. Henry is at home now, came home on a Twenty-day furlough, to attend to his buisness. I wish you could meet with such luck as that, only to get a longer one and come home to stay. Gordons &amp; Pegrams Divisions were ordered to Richmond a few days ago, and Brother was seen in Staunton on his way down. I feel very uneasy about him. He has never been home since he left the 18<sup>th</sup> of <abbr expan="October">Oct</abbr>. If you can we would like for you to ascertain something about where he is &amp;c and if any thing should happen him to let us know. We know not what a day nor an hour may bring forth. We will try &amp; send you a barrel as soon as we possibly can. I was truly glad to hear that you were so fortunate as to get in with <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> H. and did not have to go the field of a action hope you will remain there. Write soon and let us hear from you, and if you know any thing about Davis. Sarah Margaret and <u>all</u> send their love to you. Please excuse this horridly written letter as I am in a great hurry, and am cold. May the blessings of our Heavenly Father ever be with you is the prayer of your sister</p></div> <!----> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Phebe A</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>You must not think that it was through neglect that I did not write to you sooner for I had the inclination often I will have to close as <abbr expan="Robert">Robt</abbr> is most ready to start Your Sister Annie</p></div>
