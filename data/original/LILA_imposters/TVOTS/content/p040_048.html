It is true these words apply more particularly to the uneducated, yet there are those whose inteligence and wisdom in connection with <ins>their</ins> experience should have made them good Citizens, that vie with each other in the exhibition of their animosity.</p> <p>Much difficulty has been experienced in the collection of claims for the freedmen this month on account of the demonstration of this feeling, and on several occasions, it was only with great effort that <ins>I</ins> succeeded in maintaining the respect of the office, and impressed upon their unwilling minds that the Bureau closes no sooner than <abbr expan="January">Jany</abbr> 1<sup>st</sup> 1869. ---- The freedmen seem to dread the future already and many complain of their fear and anxiety, not on account of any bodily injury, but for the proneness on the part of their former employers to delay or <ins>their</ins> refusal to settle their accounts.</p> <p>I find large numbers, both in town and country who are suffering for want of clothing and but for the timely arrival of relief through this office, much misery would have been experienced before the dawning of Spring. All Clothing sent to this office for distribution has been issued yet many were not served who were really in need of it.</p> <p>The School at Staunton is in a prosperous condition &amp; is daily increasing in numbers. Thoese in the Country continue backward on account of the scarcity of good material for teachers.</p> <p>Concerning Intemperance, there seems to be no observable change among the freedmen.
