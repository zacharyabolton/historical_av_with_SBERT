And believe me it was read with delight - as it was the first, &amp; the only one, that I have received from any source, since Brother was down, so you may well imagine how eager I was to get some news, especially from one who I believe to be a friend if nothing more. I have little <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> news of importance to write you at present. I believe I gave you all the particulars of our late fights in my last letter. We are encamped within a few hundred yards of the Cave at present, have been here for several days. I often think of the time we were at this place, &amp; of the appearance that some of our crowd presented on their way from the Hotell. Alass; one of our crowd is no more, he has gone the way of all the living. But we trust our loss has been his gain. <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Thompson &amp; Lady were with us yesterday &amp; today, preached for us at the Artiller Camp on yesterday, had a good Sermon. To day he listened to <abbr expan="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Dabney who preached in our <abbr expan="Regiment.">Regt.</abbr> Joining with him in prayer he left for home this evening &amp; can doubtless give you a full history of camp life.</p> <p>I walked out this evening to see some of my friends &amp; accidentally happened on Mrs Brownlee &amp; Cousin Pitt they were at the 25 <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> I saw John Mines Tom McClure &amp; several other of our old neighbors. they all well - <abbr expan="Samuel">Sam<u> <u>l</u> </u></abbr> Lightner started for home this evening he <ins>looks</ins> very badly indeed.</p> <p>Well I must close for the present, as <ins>I</ins> know you are tired of such stuf. If you all care any thing about us poor soldiers, just pick yourselves up &amp; come down We will take great pleasure in handing you around. We may stay here for some time yet, &amp; we may leave any time. Old Jack only gives us a moments warning. My love to all &amp; receive the same.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Yours in haste</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Tony Pastor</p></div> <div class="source__postscript source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>P.S.
