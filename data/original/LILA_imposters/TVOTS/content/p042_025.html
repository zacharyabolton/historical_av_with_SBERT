Jinks" at the close of the entertainment -- You all looked over the paper to see if "Pa" had any "notice" and know what the "Salons" are doing at Richmond -- news that we will get at 9 P.M. tomorrow -- I intended to send you a Valentine, but as you could not get it today I thought best to keep it until I come "a courting", which will be ere long. I had a letter from Mr. Effinger, dated the 10<u> <u>th</u> </u> -- I only conclude you are well from a P.S. which says "I met your daughter on the street yesterda, she was looking very well &amp; as charming as usual" -- I <u>suppose</u> that was Anne on her way to school. I have been intending to reply to Nelly's excellent letter every day since it came, but I have the pen in my hand so much during the day that I dread to take it up at night -- then I am so deeply interested in some scientific books I get here &amp; that I cannot even see elsewhere, that forget the claims of duty in my desire to get the benefit of treasures I have longed to handle &amp; read from my very boyhood -- Now, My Dear, don't be jealous of the old books -- for though I may go with them to "dream land" I am sure to come back to my daylight senses and wish for the "<i>[unclear: living]</i> epistle" in my home casket -- I have just been, tonight, to Dr. Sampson's lecture on Palestine, Egypt &amp;c -- it was deeply interesting -- I would have given much if you could all have heard him -- he has been all over <u>"the lands"</u> and speaks of what he has seen -- I don't know whan Anne &amp; Stiles would have done if they had heard him tell how the little boys in Egypt climb up by the tails of the buffaloes to get on their backs &amp; he said the buffaloes do not even say "Shoo fly"! He had the dresses of the people of Egypt &amp; dressed up as a boy &amp; he looked exactly like the pictures of Arabs in Lynch's Dead Sea -- He spoke of the observations of Herodotus -- saying he was a wonderfully accurate observer &amp; writer (By the way I think Nelly would find a good deal that she would like in that old book -- she will find it in my Bohn series) -- Dr. <abbr expan="Sampson">S.</abbr> had bits of mummies, images &amp;c -- he lectures two nights more -- he preached last night, at the college chapel on "sincerity the basis of Christianity" -- a very fine discourse very suggestive &amp; learned -- Mr. Holland preached or rather lectured to the Cadets <abbr expan="Young Men's Christian Association">Y. M. Christian Assn</abbr> the Sunday night previous on "What will he do with it" -- i.e. the soul, body &amp; spirit given to a young man, what will he do with them -- . This is an interesting feature here - so many able lecturers are brought here &amp; they have so many here that can &amp; do lecture -- But I must stop this garrulity, for I see the bottom of the page -- Gen. Lee says the "young ladies must come up and spend some time with them" -- I have had some fun with Allan about a young Alabama widow here -- . The weather continues very warm, too warm -- I am very well -- I hope you have heard from Ma before now -- how is she -- I heard from Ellyson -- they are well -- So far as I know my prospects are tolerably good at Richmond -- I <u>think</u> it now lies between Mr. Ruffner &amp; myself -- if no chance for him I get his vote &amp; vice versa - More anon -- Write to me -- A kiss just here, for birthday </p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Love &amp; a blessing for you all -- As ever your loving</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Jed.</p></div> <!---->
