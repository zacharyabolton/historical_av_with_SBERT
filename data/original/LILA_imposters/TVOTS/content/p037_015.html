The appropriation was for forty dollars. The account rendered for material amounting to about that sum (thirty nine 48/100) it is useless to forward for payment this account for services, which is accordingly herewith returned. I presume it is a matter of indifference to Washington which account is paid.</p> <p>Mr Jackson was only authorized to expend forty dollars, and if Washington on his own responsibility expected more, he must expect to lose it.</p> <p>The purchase vouchers will be immediately transmitted to Richmond for payment.</p> <p>This appropriation was granted in answer to an application made by Mr. Jackson <abbr expan="March">Mch</abbr> 9th ult. and was subject to the conditions mentioned in the application, namely that the Trustees should guarantee the use of this building for a schoolhouse for colored children forever. Before advancing the money you will please see that this condition is complied with.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am, Colonel<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obdt</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">St</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John A.
