I telegraphed to <abbr expan="Brevet Brigadier General">Br Brig<sup>d</sup> Gen'l</abbr> Horace Neide the information that a freedmanm had been shot on the evening of sunday the 7th inst. by a law Student at this place named J. C. Johnson -- it seems, from what I can learn that Johnson was in company with a colored woman, named Milly, a freedman who was nearby was accused by Johnson of watching him. The freedman, viz Patrick Thompson denied that he was watching Johnson, some words passed, Johnson went off and borrowed a pistol came back and called the negro a damned son of a bitch at the same time discharging the pistol he had borrowed at him. Johnson immediately turned and walked away, Thompson at first did not know that he was shot, but after Johnson disappeared in the darkness the freedman placed his hand upon his side and exclaimed I am shot.</p> <p>This occured about 8 <abbr expan="o'clock">ock</abbr> P.M.</p> <p>The ball entered the body of the Freedman below the fifth rib and passed downwards severing the intestines and lodging in the abdomen. Thompson died on the day following (Monday) between the hours of twelve and one <abbr expan="o'clock">ock</abbr> PM.</p> <p>Owing to the indifference and want of energy manifest on the part of the civil authorities Johnson was not arrested, on the contrary it seems that every facility was afforded Johnson to enable him to make his escape, notwithstanding the general opinion of the public pointed to Johnson as the guilty party, a citizen of the town cashed a cheque for him, before bank hours, and he hired a pair of fine horses at the livery stable connected with the Lexington Hotel, and a freedman was sent to drive the horses for Johnson to Goshen, (a railroad station on the <abbr expan="Virginia Central Railroad">Va.C.R.R.</abbr> some twenty miles from this point) and then to return the horses to the Hotel at Lexington.</p> <p>Johnson started at 1/2 <abbr expan="past">p</abbr> 7 or eight <abbr expan="o'clock">ock</abbr> in the morning (Monday) so you see it was not necessary for him to steal away, but on the contrary he was allowed to go off in good style and in broad daylight, and according to all reports armed with a pair of revolvers and a bowie knife.</p> <p>When Johnson's guilt could be concealed no longer, a warrant for his arrest was placed in the hands of the town sergeant, but he was for a long time unable to obtain a horse or any one who would consent to accompany him.</p> <p>Finally he secured the assistance of a one legged Englishman (with two horses) who consented to accompany him. Several parties attempted to dissuaide the town sergeant from pursuing Johnson, stating that Johnson was well armed and would resist any force under six men.</p> <p>Owing to the difficulty the town <abbr expan="sergeant">serg't</abbr> met with in obtaining horses and a man to accompany him, he was unable to start in pursuit of Johnson until about 8 <abbr expan="o'clock">ock</abbr> P.M. of the 8th inst thus giving Johnson twelve hours start.</p> <p>Now sir, if the above facts are not sufficient to prove that the mass of the people were not desirous of bringing Johnson to justice, the fact that two men were allowed to start in pursuit of him, one an old man of small stature, and the other a man with only one leg, (while Johnson is a man six feet tall and stout in proportion) I think is conclusive evidence that the pursuit if such it may be called was only a sham.</p> <p>And I am told by reliable white men who reside here that many of the citizens express a hope and desire that Johnson will not be caught.</p> <p>As his trial will only add to the expenses of the county, some again seem to think it would be well if a few more were shot.</p> <p>This is the second man who has been shot in cold blood in this place during the past two months.</p> <p>I trust troops will be sent here in a few days, as it is quite evident the civil authorities cannot keep the students and cadets in subjection.</p> <p>Should you desire a copy of the evidence aduced before the corroner, I will obtain it and forward it to you.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am Sir<br>Your <u> <abbr expan="obedient">obdt</abbr> </u> Servant</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>G B Carse<br><abbr expan="Brevet">Bt</abbr> Colonel and <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst Supt</abbr> Bureau of <abbr expan="Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands">R.F. and A.L.</abbr></p></div> <!---->
