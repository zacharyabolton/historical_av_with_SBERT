A most melancholy duty devolves upon me, to have to communicate to you and <abbr expan="through">thro'</abbr> you to our other friends whether now in Arkansas or elsewhere, the death of your much esteemed young friend and my <u>much</u> <u>loved</u> cousin Miss Evaline McCue after a brief illness on yesterday evening (Wed) at twenty minutes past two oclock, of typhoid fever, at this her <u>home</u>, surrounded by her loving friends, consisting of Father, step- mother and three brothers &amp; five sisters and other relations and connexions. Living as I do some what remote, over twenty miles in an opposite end of our county, I was summoned by business to our county seat, when I heard of her illness, and immediately came to see her and Providentially as I can but regard it, for I do not know how I could have born the idea of her death without the opportunity of a personal knowledge of the circumstances attending it. I arrived here on Tuesday evening when I found her in that situation despaired of by her physicians and suffering no doubt extravagantly at then as throughout her entire ilness without a murmur, or complaint. 'Twas difficult for her to speak, yet she communicated her feelings by intellibible <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> to the interrogatores of her friends when she could not speak and her conciousness remained to the last moment. <abbr expan="Though">Tho'</abbr> not a professor of religion, yet her whole walk through life had been an example even a reproof to many Christians, and during her illness in the interviews a neighbouring minister had with her, her expressions of acquiescence in the will of her heavenly father and resignation gave every reason to believe that she is now enjoying the smiles of a merciful redeemer--To one of the interrogatories propounded to her by the minister as it regarded her hope for the future she replied "I know there is no hope except in the Lord Jesus".</p> <p>A more lovely character than that possessed by our young friend it has never been my good fortune to meet with. She possessed a well balanced mind, firm, decided and prudent steadfast in her friendship when she formed the object or which the feeling of friendship bestowed was worthy of it. She had improved very much in the interval elapsed since your acquaintance with her, and independent of the advantages she enjoyed by an intercourse with her friends in Ohio, and a very agreeable and interesting journey from Ohio, home by the way of the Lake<sup>s</sup>, the Fall<sup>s</sup>, and the Eastern cities, she had employed her time at home, except that portion assigned to theSociety of her friends to reading, and the most of this of a solid and judicious character--Few possessed a more refined caste, and sensitive modest and retiring, yet with a native dignity and reserve that kept at a distance those with whom she had no desire to form an intimacy but yet appreciated so fully, her position as a lady, as treating one with becoming respect. She made friends every where she went. She endeared those who had known her longest to her by hooks of steel.</p> <p> Beautiful as she was when you saw her, she was even more so at the time of her death and now while her cold and inanimate form is lying in state in an adjoining apartment, it would be difficult to picture to yourself a more beautiful immage--Why my fair Friend, the loveliest picture of that <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> ideal of pictures the "Madonna" it does seem to me does not possess more symetry of proportion or beauty and expression of features than does her lovely face--Last evening as the last rays of the departing sun shown across her face, and added to the angelic expression which it bore, it would have been no stretch of immagination to have conjectured her a seraph from a bright world.</p> <p>It is an inscrutable Providence that has removed this bright, this pure and spotless being from us to that Heavens she was so fitted to enjoy, just entering as she was in the thresh- hold of life, and possessing all those elements in so remarkable a degree that blended in her life, constituted her almost a perfect character.She alluded often to our trip to Ohio and the meeting with your party on the Ohio river and the pleasure enjoyed in the intercourse with you--'Twas only a few nights before she became ill, that she entertained her two sisters until quite a late hour in detailing the incidents that occurred on the Ohio river and during our stay at the Burnet house. She was deeply attached to you spoke of you frequently and nothing but a sort of antipathy to writing, prevented her from commencing a correspondence with you.</p> <p> Miss Nannie, I have after a brief interval been in with some friends to night (Thursday) to look again at the lovely Oh most lovely form of my <u>dearest</u> cousin and one of those friends was M<sup>rs</sup>. Van Lear who came up this evening a distance of nearly twenty five miles <abbr expan="through">thro'</abbr> a pelting storm to look for the last time on the much loved form of her attached relative. She also speaks of you all often and would be much gratified to hear of your welfare.</p> <p> Will you please to communicate to the rest of your family this mournful intelligence, as well also to Miss Hough and Miss Buckner and be assured of my sincere regard and respect--and convey to each of your friends my kindest wishes for their welfare.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>With sincere esteem your friend</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>J.
