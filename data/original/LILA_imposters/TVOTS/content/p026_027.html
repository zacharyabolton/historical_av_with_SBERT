Some by Refferees and some are still pending settlement. The White Citizen seem to think that the Black Man has no right to complain of his wrongs, no matter how grievous they may be he must bear them all in silence, and if he ventures to make them known it is a heinous offence for which he must be brutally knocked down and beaten with the first thing that can be gotten hold of.</p> <p>This is the rule. I am glad to say that there are honorable exceptions to it, and am inclined to the opinion that the old prejudices are slowly wearing away. This is manifest more particularly in their general demeanor toward the Colored Schools, and Teachers than in any other way, for both (I think) are treated with more respect than they were one year ago.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>I am <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> with <ins>much</ins> Respect<br>Your <abbr expan="Obedient">Obt.</abbr> <abbr expan="Servant">Servt.</abbr></p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Frederick S.
