You speak of getting a transfer to M<sup>c</sup>Clanahan's Battery. I would be glad indeed if you could as I would much rather you belonged to that Company than to stay where you are. You remember that last night you were here, you asked Frank if you could get <i>[unclear: away]</i>, but as in rather a joking manner and he took it as such and did not give you a decisive answer, but after considering the matter next morning, he thought you might be in earnest and told me to tell you to come on if you had to go off service, that he would be very glad to have you as a member of their company and to tell you to be sure and come on, that they would take on members. So you see that you need not be uneasy about getting in if you wish, unless they have closed down <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> since the <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> I owe him a letter soon and I will write and ascertain all the particulars about it, whether you can get in or not, but I almost know you can, for Eddie Brownlee is going to start to that Company Thursday. Becca, Ginnie, Marie McCormick, Eddie Brownlee, one of his sisters, and probably Amanda Miller are going to start down to the neighborhood of Churchville Thursday. All going on business but Ginnie, and she is going to her Aunt Sallies on a visit. Af coarse she will bring your cloth home but her principal object is to pay <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> relatives &amp; friends a visit. She has been over since last Friday and is quite well. The <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> and <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> <i>[unclear: Parreiah]</i> came over with Ginsife Friday &amp; <del hand="h1"></del> with us <i>[unclear: big]</i> night stayed for preaching Saturday &amp; went home that evening. We had John, Sam Lightner, Charlotte, and Aunt Jane that night. Sabbath evening we had Rev. W<sup>m.</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Clure Rev. Dr. Thompson &amp; wife, General R. D. Lilly Mr. John C. Echard Aunt Jane &amp; sisters family. <abbr expan="General">Gen'l</abbr> Lilly, Mr. Echard and sister left the sisters stayed all night. Cousin Robert came with me from Church &amp; stayed until nearly bed time and was compelled to go to Staunton early next morning. Ma says to tell you that she will send you a barrel with some supplies and your overcoat by Mr. Thomas Shumate who is going down to Richmond next week if he will take them, and she can still ascertain you are there. Write as soon as you get this and let us know whether you can possibly get a transfer to McClanahans Battery and will be coming to the Valley &amp; then we will know what to do, whether to send it to Richmond or whether to wait until you come to the Valley. We want you to write as soon as ever you get this and let us know. Ginnie wrote to you a few days ago. I guess you have received it before this. She would have written now but is very busy fixing to go down the country. We received a letter from Davis at Staunton he was well.
