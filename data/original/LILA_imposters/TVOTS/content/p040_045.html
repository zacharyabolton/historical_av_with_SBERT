The charts are not mounted or varnished nor on pasteboard but only on thin sheets of paper, and there are but two numbers 1 and 2.--and perhaps--a doz. of each no. (which was more than was needed all of the same kind)--Now the maps, an excellent set are only marked $16.00 all mounted and with cloth back etc.</p> <p>These charts should not cost over $4. by <u>any means</u> and probably <u>not that</u>. You may wish to correct that.</p> <p>Please inform Mr Smith that as the month is nearly up, I shall need <u>Blanks</u> for Monthly Reports <u>very soon</u>.</p></div> <div class="source__closing_salutation source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>Respectfully</p></div> <div class="source__signed source-letter__field" data-v-76abe5ae=""><p>John Scott</p></div> <!---->
