  "title": "Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to Hester J. Nadenbousch, April 20, 1864",
  "summary": "Nadenbousch writes his wife with the good news that his resignation has been accepted and he is out of the army. He will come home as soon as he is well and able. For the moment, he will not because he does not wish to take an oath of loyalty to the Union. He tells his wife not to worry about confiscation of their property, as everything will be sorted out after the war. He expresses the opinion that the coming campaigns will decide the issue and asserts that Confederate forces are in good shape and highly motivated by such issues as the enlistment of black men in the Union army. He also sends messages for his children.",
