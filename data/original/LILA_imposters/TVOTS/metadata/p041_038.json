  "title": "Augusta County: John Scott to E. P. Smith, March 9, 1869",
  "summary": "Scott expresses his desire to act as a religious advisor to the people, exclaiming, \"I have enough to do with my school duties, but when I see how much these people need instruction from the Bible rather than a religious 'Pow-wow' over it - I long to help them. And while the intent and nature of my mission is such as to make it my duty perhaps to do this in some way--yet I have not in this place said scarcely a word in any religious meeting except the Sabbath School.\"",
