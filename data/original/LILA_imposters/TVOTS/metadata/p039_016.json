  "summary": "Waldo reports the condition of schools in Staunton and Waynesboro to McDonnell. In this report, he clarifies some of the conflicts over school room use in both towns. He finds it unfortunate that the community \"would sooner prefer that their children should remain uneducated rather than 'defile' their church by its use for Educational purposes.\" Waldo also describes a sectarian conflict between the black Methodist and Baptist congregations in Waynesboro over the use of a building.",
