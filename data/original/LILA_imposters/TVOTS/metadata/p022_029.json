  "title": "Augusta County: John Scott to Samuel Hunt, November 25, 1865",
  "summary": "Concerned about Hunt's opinion of his demeanor, Scott writes to explain why he may have looked disheveled while meeting members of his teaching staff in New York. He also apologizes for his poor spelling skills. He discusses the biases of Southerners in Staunton, stating, \"I am frequently attacked by men of southern principle, in regard to the propriety of educating the Freedmen; the justice of the institution of slaver, etc. and although I have never commenced a discussion with any upon this subject, or conversed with any but apparent gentlemen, yet I have had to meet much prejudice both against the work and against those engaged in it from first to last.\"",
