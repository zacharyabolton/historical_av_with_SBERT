  "title": "Augusta County: Annie A. Dunn to E. P. Smith, March 7, 1867",
  "summary": "In response to AMA administrators' request to relocate to Goldsboro, Dunn argues that she cannot teach in another community as she is \"a Widow, and twelve hundred miles from home, the only relatives I have in the south are here, and I cannot make it appear to my mind that it is my duty to leave them to go into another State among entire strangers and still farther from home.\" Apparently, the AMA sought to remove Dunn from her position in Staunton because she had \"given testimony concerning other Teachers\" to \"an Officer authorized to take it.\"",
