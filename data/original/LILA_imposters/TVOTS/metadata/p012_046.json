  "title": "Augusta County: Tony Pastor to Annie Harris, December 28, 1862",
  "summary": "In this letter written soon before the army set into winter quarters, Pastor describes light losses in a recent battle as compared to huge (over 15,000) casualties on the Union side. He discusses his ideas about northern morale and the Lincoln government. He also is happy that the Rockbridge Cavalry has been dismounted since he believes they have contributed little to the war. He later mentions that there are no alcoholic drinks around.",
