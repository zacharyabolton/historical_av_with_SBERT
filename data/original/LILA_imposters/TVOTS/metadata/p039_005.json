  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: John A. McDonnell to Orlando Brown, October 10, 1868",
  "summary": "McDonnell submits yet another quarterly report for the 9th Sub-District. His assessment of the situation in Augusta County is largely positive, although on a more general note, he comments that the news of the Bureau's impending cessation of operation has been met with much regret among the black population. McDonnell expressed doubts about the ability of the law alone to protect recently bestowed rights from the influence of local prejudices with means of enforcement.",
