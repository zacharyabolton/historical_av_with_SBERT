  "title": "Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando Brown, May 5, 1866",
  "summary": "How writes to Brown before what appears to be his resignation from the Bureau. How proposes a reorganization of the Sixth District due to conflicts with General Terry, the Military Commissioner for the Valley. He suggests that two counties be placed under the jurisdiction of West Virginia, where much more progress has been made in terms of laws protecting the rights of free blacks, and further splitting the district into two parts, one of which would be commanded from Staunton. His letter constantly alludes to conflicts and misunderstandings between the Bureau and the Military Commissioners.",
