  "title": "Augusta County: John Scott to Samuel Hunt, April 18, 1866",
  "summary": "John Scott asks Samuel Hunt whether funds collected from local blacks for clothing distributed by the AMA should be used to reimburse Mr. Hunt or whether those funds should be used to help pay off rent for a church Scott had acquired and turned into a schoolhouse. He says he is concerned that leaving the matter unresolved over the summer might allow the \"secesh negrohaters\" in Staunton to take the schoolhouse from the AMA. He also mentions that local blacks helped raise money by putting on a concert in town, and that they had arranged to have a fair on the first of May.",
