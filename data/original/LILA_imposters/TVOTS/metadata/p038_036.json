  "summary": "Manly recommends that Corliss (who is apparently interested in a teaching post) go to Staunton, which is currently without a teacher because the agency which supplied them last year is unable to do so again. Manly highly recommends Staunton as a pleasant place to live, and points to the relative prosperity of its African American community.",
