"My ole man wa'n't settin' out on

a whittlin' a piece er cedar, wid his
ole pipe in his mouf a smokin' en a
lookin' atter, en a tekin' keer er de
t'ings lak he allers wuz afo'. I had a
turerble gnawin' in my stummuck
time I seed he wa'n't out dar, but I
thunk de gnawin' wuz fum de skeer
'count er de s'pishun whar popped up
in my th'oat dat mebbe my ole man
mought be in dar sick, en dey hadn'
le' me know nuttin' 'tall 'bout hit.
I stooped down, tromblin' all ober jes'
lak a Guinea pig's snout, en feelt
un'neaf de step fer de key,—but de
key wa'n't dar lak hit in gen’ally wuz.
Den I got up en tuck holt er de knob
er de do' en wuz a gwine ter tu'n hit en
g'long in, but de knob wouldn' budge.
