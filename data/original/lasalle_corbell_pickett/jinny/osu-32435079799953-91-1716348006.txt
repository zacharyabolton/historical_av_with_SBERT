*The laws of the State authorized immediate execu-
tion of the death sentence in cases of insurrection or re-
bellion. By the law, John Brown could have been tried,
convicted and executed all on the same day. He was
charged with conspiracy with slaves for the purpose of
insurrection, treason against the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia, murder in the first degree. His counsel, Mr. George
Henry Hoyt, of Massachusetts, plead for him, and John
Brown declared he was too ill to go to court.
