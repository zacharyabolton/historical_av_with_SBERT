DE OLE OX KYART
en dat ef a libin' soul ez much ez
totches wun er de boxes er peeps
thoo de cracks, er eben down ter
queshuns 'bout w'at's insides any er
'em, dat all de t'ings will tu'n fum
w'atsumeber dey is ter ashes en sin-
duzes en dar won' be nuttin' fer no-
body w'en Chris' mus comes sho-nuff."
This alleged threat of Santa Claus,
which was only the bill of lading, that
Uncle Charles, my grandmother's
foreman, took out of his hat and tragic-
ally unfolded and waved at us with
one hand while with the other he
fiercely grasped the steer yoke, was
more potent by far than the fear of
being "hooked er trompled ter def,"
so we slunk away and contented our-
selves watching with wonder-eyes from
our respective distances.
