""
"de gre't house ter Mammy Borry's
cabin."
"You would better shut your finger
up then," suggested his mistress, "and
not be in such a hurry to speed the
parting soul of your poor little wife."
"I ain't in no hurry, Missis," he
replied, "but I'm aimin' ter be raidy
fer de een', kaze I ain't gwine let
nobody else do de las' ack fer my ole
ooman.
So night after night Uncle Charles
would stand at the head of Mammy
Borry's bed with his outstretched fore-
finger pointed at her eyes, watching
the dying face, ready "ter do de las'
ack fer her," while "ole Missis "
would sit by her side and read about
the loaves and the fishes, her favorite
of all the chapters in the Bible.
