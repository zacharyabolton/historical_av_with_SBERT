A CHRISTMAS VISTA
Looking back through the long vista
of years I recall the shifting scenes of
the first Christmas which impressed
itself upon my baby mind, and of all
the mystic and unexpected delights
which make up the blessings of child-
hood.
Christmas had dawned upon a calm
world, spirited in white. Tall and
tiny ghosts, ghosts of rosebushes and
tombstones, of trees and violets, stood
as dazzling sentinels in the unbroken
paths of this lamb's-wool earth, peace-
fully smiling to a perfect heaven-all
snow-capped and bejewelled with crys-
tal fringes and anon glistening with
green trimmings beset in myriads of
sparkling diamonds; all shimmering
and shining in the wealth of down-pour-
ing, golden-glowing, sun-kissed rays.
