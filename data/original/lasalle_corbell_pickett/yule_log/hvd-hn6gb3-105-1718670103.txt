DE BRIDEGROOM

"Dat wouldn' do Ligey no good'm;
dat wouldn' bring 'im back ter life
ag'in-nar'm. I don' mean no dis-
respec', but 'deed'm, I don' know
so much 'bout all dat restress en
cryin' en prayin' lak you say. Co'se
we all wuz 'bleeged ter be sorry 'bout
de ax'dent dat keep de bridegroom
fum gittin' ter his own weddin', en de
bride, she wuz sorry 'long wid de res'
er us; but den, ag'in, a nur' t'ing,
w'en you come ter t'ink 'bout hit, de
bridegroom wa'n't no blood kin er
her'n, nohow."
