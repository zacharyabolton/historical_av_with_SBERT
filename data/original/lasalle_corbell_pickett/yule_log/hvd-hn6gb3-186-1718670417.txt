PICKETT AND HIS MEN
BY
LASALLE CORBELL PICKETT
(Mrs. Gen. George E. Pickett)
IN THE THIRD THOUSAND
One of the most fascinating pieces of biographical writing
that has recently been published in this country.
-Review of Reviews.
She writes without bitterness, and her sympathy with
the Southern cause and its leaders does not lead her into one-
sided estimates of the war as a whole.-The Chicago Record.
Has its peculiar charms.-New York Times.
It contributes materially to our knowledge of Pickett, the
man, and strengthens the impression, always cherished in the
South, that his magnificent courage was united with a heart
of womanly tenderness and a character in every way lovable.
-New Orleans Picayune.
Told with a fire and style that carries the reader along
despite himself, and makes him imagine that he lived, for the
time being, among the famous personages and the great
events that are recounted.
New York Tribune.
She makes no timid apologies in deference to changed
conditions, but at the same time she writes in such sweet
temper that her work throughout breathes the violet aroma
of complete reconciliation.-Atlanta Constitution.
Size, 6 x 8%½; Binding, cloth, stamped in gold;
Pages, 439; Price, $2.00.
