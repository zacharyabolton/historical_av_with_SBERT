EBIL EYE
II
course pursued was the direct opposite.
The will was not perverted; it was only
drugged with some strong ethic poison
and rendered powerless. However it
might silently strive for the right, the
wrong was consummated.
Having once fallen under the ma-
lignant influence, it never recovered its
erect attitude. Through all remaining
life it was in chains, and there was no
hope of relief except that death might
shake the power of the Evil Eye. All
the glow died out of life as the roses
die when the frost falls suddenly on a
blossoming garden. All the radiance of
hope fades away as the light of the sun
is blotted out by the storm-cloud.
the garden rose may bloom again when
June kisses the earth with her warm
lips. No flower will ever again blossom
But.
