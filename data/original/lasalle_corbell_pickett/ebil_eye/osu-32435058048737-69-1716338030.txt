nebber rob hits own nes'.
Yet 'pear lak
I kyan' he'p feelin' in my breas' dem
onstreperous wuds, dat
"Dough all er us knows who's pullin' at de bits,
Lak de lead mule dat guides wid de rein,
Vit somehow er 'nudder de bes'es er us gits
Moughty sick er de tuggin' at de chain.'
"In spite er all my onras'lessness er
sperit at de tejiusness er de tuggin', I
knows dat all er we-all's hopes, en all er
we-all's happiness comed ter us dat dark,
dismal, dretful day w'en de sun hid hit's
face on Calbary. But, all de same, I
shill be pow'ful glad w'en my dark days
on ye'th is done, en de sun er redemp-
shun shines fer me; en my ole Marser
en my po' mammy lif's de latch er de
golden gate, in memory er Calbary, fer
dar li'l' yaller gal ter come thoo."
