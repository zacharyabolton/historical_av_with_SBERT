MISS JEWETT was the faithful
delineator of the life and char-
acter of old New England, as is
Mary Wilkins Freeman of the New
England of to-day. The daughter of
the village doctor, the little Sarah Orne
unconsciously absorbed the life of her
environment as she drove with her
father when he made his professional
calls.
"The best of my education was re-
ceived in my father's buggy and the
places to which it carried me," she said,
"The rest was mere schooling. With
the wicked connivance of my father I
used to run away from school and go the
rounds with him; if we suffered a lit-
tle from the pangs of our New England
conscience we enjoyed enough from the
delightful experience to make up for it.
