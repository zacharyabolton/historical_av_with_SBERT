tion to his country. Men high in
judicial realms, poets and historians,
great scientists whose efforts are given
for their country's honor, all would

of the past. A wide and beautiful road
would have led from the University
which the great patriot founded to the
magnificent home in which he dwelt and
it would have been known to all the
world as the People's Highway. "
