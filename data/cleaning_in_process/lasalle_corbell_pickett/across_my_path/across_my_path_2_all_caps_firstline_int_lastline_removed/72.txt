WHEN Mrs. Lander was play-
ing an engagement in Rich-
mond Mrs. Allan gave a tea,
inviting her guests to meet the actress,
who was a social favorite as well as a
theatrical star. I chanced to be sitting
by Mrs. Lander when tea was served on
little tables placed before us to hold
the delicious viands which our hostess
had prepared for us.
"How very delightful this is," said
Mrs. Lander. "It gives me a beauti-
ful chance to talk to you, and we can
say friendly and intimate things under
the inspiration of the tea-cups. What
pretty little biscuits! I have heard of
Maryland biscuit; are these the same?"
"I have never eaten Maryland beaten
biscuit but they originated in Virginia
and our neighbor Maryland borrowed
the recipe."
