but they had gone and I could find no
trace of them."
"I am Mrs. Edwards," I replied, and
explained the . name by which she had
known me and introduced her again to
the little boy whom she remembered as
a baby, and who still had the " peachy
cheeks and glorious eyes." She was
very glad to see us again and have a
pleasant talk of the old Canadian days.
"How you made me cry my eyes out
and then in the farce Toodles made me
laugh until the tears came again, ' ' I said.
"I am glad that you laughed after-
ward," replied Ellen, "for I do not like
to send my audience home crying; it
seems too ill a reward for the goodness
of people in filling theaters for me and
it is unkind to make folks unhappy."
"I thought you were unhappy, too. I
am older now and have learned that
people, both on and off the stage, learn
to simulate unhappiness at will."
