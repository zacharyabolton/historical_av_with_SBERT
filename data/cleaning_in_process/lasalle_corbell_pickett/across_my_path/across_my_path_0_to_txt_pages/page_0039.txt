CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN
one is so tensely f elt, that nearly all the
facets of emotional life are presented.
Then it gave me a chance to fight a real
duel, which is always a triumph for a
woman. On one occasion I experi-
enced an emotion not set down in the
book. I was playing Romeo to Miss
Anderton's Juliet when just as I was
revealing the rapture of my love a man
in the audience gave vent to a sneeze
so loud and grotesque that I knew he
had manufactured it for that occasion.
I quit making love and led my lady off
the stage with, I hope, a fair degree of
the gallantry of the Montagues. I re-
turned and announced that if some man
did not put that person out I would
have to do it. It was done and I got
more cheers for that irregular inter-
polation than for any of the scenes
written for the original Romeo. I es-
corted my Juliet back to the stage and
the play went on."
