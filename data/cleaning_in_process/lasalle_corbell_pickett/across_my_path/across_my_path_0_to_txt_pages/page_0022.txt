MRS. JULIA WARD HOWE
fcrated the value of this motto, for she
was never known to be out of touch
with the interests of the moment and
her help in every useful development
was given with all the enthusiasm of
her vigorous nature. She treasured
the lessons of the past but never for a
moment of her long life did she live in
the past. Her pen and voice were al-
ways ready and efficient in promotion
of the good cause and time did not
leave her on the barren sands. The
work she did in her last year was filled
with the old strength applied to the
new things of advancing thought.
