MARY ASHTON LIVERMORE
letter that she had written to the wife
and mother of a dying soldier, giving
his name. Mrs. Livermore had written
so many letters for soldiers who would
never again see their dear ones on earth
that she could not recall this one until
the woman showed her the old letter,
worn and patched, but still legible.
"I recall that letter, " said Mrs. Liver-
more. "I hope that it brought at least
a little comfort to you. ' ' " It helped us
to live through that awful time. It
has helped others. We sent it to those
who had suffered like sorrow until it was
so worn that I had to sew the paper to-
gether. Then I quit sending it out, and
made copies for those who might be
aided by your loving thought and ten-
der words. The poor young wife kept
up for a few years and then died of sor-
row. On her deathbed she told me to
take her wedding ring which she should
wear until her death, and give it to you
