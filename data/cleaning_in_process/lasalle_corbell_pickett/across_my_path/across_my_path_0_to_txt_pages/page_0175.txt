MRS. ROGER A. PRYOR
WHEN my Soldier was in com-
mand of the Department of
Virginia and North Carolina
and our home was in Petersburg I
knew and loved the beautiful and brill-
iant Mrs. Pryor, so well known for
years in old Washington. The deep in-
terest with which I listened to her
stories of life in the Capital incited her
to tell me many memories of what was
to her the brightest time she had ever
known, furnishing a wide contrast to
those dark days of war and privation.
She told me that she had known the
" Little Giant" of Illinois and my
cousin, Mr. Beverlv Tucker of Vir-
ginia, who were good friends.

las, the shortest man in Washington,
and Mr. Tucker, almost a giant in
