MES. CLEMENT C. CLAY
sparkled in her natural form as the
reigning queen of grace and beauty or
appeared in the homely and grotesque
guise of Mrs. Partington, convulsing
the entire company with laughter, she
was supreme. "Clay, you deprived the
stage of its most brilliant ornament
When vou married Mrs. Clav." said a
brother Senator to Senator Clay at the
Owyn ball where the pseudo Mrs. Part-
ington filled the ball-room with merri-
ment for the entire evening.
Sometimes such gayety and radiance
belong only to the sunshine and when
heavy clouds darken the day the
evanescent gleam vanishes. The brill-
iance of Mrs. Clay was a torch illumi-
nating the darkest night. In the Con-
federacy when gloom and uncertainty
hung over all southern hearts her
gayety glowed through the darkness
and helped her people to endure loss
and sorrow.
