ELLEN TREE
ELLEN TREE., known off the stage
| as Mrs. Charles Kean, was more
continuously enveloped in stage
atmosphere than anyone else I have
ever known. Others forget at times that
they are actresses, or remember it with
a sensation of relief that they can now
and then throw off the mimic part and
be themselves by way of variety. She
used to stab the butter with the knife
in a manner which suggested that she
was doing deadly things to some un-
fortunate stage villain. She would or-
der a spool of thread in a voice that
threw the clerk into a nervous chill from
which he recovered with difficulty and
the assistance of a physician. She im-
pressed me with the idea that she slept
on the verge of a volcano in eruption
with thunderstorms sweeping over her
and an earthquake shaking her couch.
