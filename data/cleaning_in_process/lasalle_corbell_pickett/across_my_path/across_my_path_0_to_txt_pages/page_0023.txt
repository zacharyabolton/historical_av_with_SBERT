MRS. JEFFERSON DAVIS
AT a reception in Richmond I
stood beside Mrs. Davis as thou-
sands of old soldiers passed by,
stopping to give us the hand-clasp of af-
fection and to look into our faces with
eyes that held loving memories of past
days and of those for whose sake we
were dear to the veterans of the South.
After they were gone she turned to me
and said:
"Is not love the most wonderful
thing in life? We should be the two
proudest women on earth to have had
the love of two such men as your hus-
band and mine, who could inspire the
hearts of so many, from the laborer
with his rough toil-worn hand to the
great professional man with soft white
hand and strong brain, with such af-
fection for us as is shown in the warm
clasp and the loving eyes."
