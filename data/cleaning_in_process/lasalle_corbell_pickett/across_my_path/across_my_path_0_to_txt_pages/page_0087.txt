FANNY KEMBLE
She made her debut here and is, I be-
lieve, the only Boston woman who
has ever attained international success
on the stage. . When I first came to
Boston in 1832 under the manage-
ment of Mr. Thomas Barry I met your
John Howard Payne. At that time
he had just returned after a twenty
years' absence and was given a bene-
fit a few days before my appear-
ance.' '
"Your art gives you an opportunity
of meeting all the charming people as
well as of having such beautiful ex-
periences."
"When I told Mr. Washington Irv-
ing that I did not like the stage be-
cause it gave me no time for congenial
and improving work he said that I was
seeing the world and by and by I could
retire and give myself to a happier ca-
reer but, great as Mr. Irving was, he
was not a prophet."
