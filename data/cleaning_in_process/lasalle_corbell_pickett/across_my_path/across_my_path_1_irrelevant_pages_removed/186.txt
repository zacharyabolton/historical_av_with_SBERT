SARAH ORNE JEWETT
"I love the thought part of it and the
weaving part, but the business phase is
not so agreeable. I wonder if in the
next life our thoughts will not grow like
the wild flowers in the woodland and
blossom and breathe fragrance and glow
with color and light all unconnected
with the book market.' '
In this era of futurist nightmares and
cubist spasms the clear etchings traced
by Sarah Orne Jewett are crowded out
of the gallery of time, but we who knew
her as a living presence like to go back
and revel in the silvery light of her ex-
quisitely drawn and delicately shaded
word pictures of the quiet scenes in
which she found the dramatic forces of
life cast in the comedy and tragedy of
everyday existence.
