are, like my own people, oppressed ; then
again, they are fond of me. In Dublin
I talked to them in the theater and they
greeted me with applause and cheers.
An English officer heard the noise and
came in, thinking that I was saying
something of a political nature. For-
tunately I knew him and was not
frightened when he came to me and told
me that it was late and he had come to
escort me home. I bade farewell to my
friends and left the theater with my
self -constituted protector, marveling by
the way over the uneasiness of the head
that wears the crown of despotism and
wondering that anyone would ever con-
sent to such discomfort."
Modjeska made her American debut
as Adrienne Lecouvreur. From her
success in that play and in Camille it
was sometimes thought that she was
essentially an emotional actress.
"I do not love those plays," she said.
