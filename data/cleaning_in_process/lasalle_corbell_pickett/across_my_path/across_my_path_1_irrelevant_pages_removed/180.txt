MRS. ROGER A. PRYOR
dered forth heroic sentiments in classic
periods, and lovely women had the slop-
ing shoulders and oval faces which have
since given place to the square build
and commercial profile of a business
age.
With a party of friends Mrs, Pryor
watched the wind-blown snow falling
upon the procession that escorted the
youthful and handsome President
Pierce to the White House and to his
political death. She was a distin-
guished social figure in the administra-
tion of President Buchanan, which went
its dancing, laughing, sparkling way to
meet the earthquake. She was a noble
woman of the Confederacy and lived
many years after its fall to give to the
reading world beautiful pictures of the
lights and shadows that had fallen over
her life.
