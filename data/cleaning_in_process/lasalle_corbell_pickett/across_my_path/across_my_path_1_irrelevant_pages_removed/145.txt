CELIA THAXTER
THERE are people who are born
for the sea. Life without its
white foam-horses galloping
shoreward in an endless succession of
charges upon the sands and wild
dashes backward in ever recurring de-
feat would be like a symphony without
its theme. The melody would fall on
silence without the deep basso-pro-
fundo of the rolling surges to sustain
its rich chords.
Of these was Celia Thaxter. I never
think of her without seeing her on Ap-
pledore, " Among the Isles of Shoals/'
with her chains of sea-shells encircling
neck and wrists, melting into the soft
grayness of her dress that she wore
with a simplicity and dignity which
made me think her born of the deep
gray stately ocean that she loved. Her
window gave us a view of the dashing
ill
