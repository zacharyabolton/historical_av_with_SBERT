ADELAIDE NEILSON
Adelaide Neilson has passed from
our sight but not from the stage world.
She lingers there as the perennial Ju-
liet. The traditions of that mimic
realm are irradiated by her luminous
eyes, her graceful form haunts the twi-
light of the Thespian gods as the Naiad
Queen roams in the mystic shadows of
an enchanted woodland. To those who
knew her she is a radiant memory; to
those who have come newly to the king-
dom wherein she reigned she is a bril-
liant dream.
