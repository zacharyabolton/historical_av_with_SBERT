CLARA BARTON
Plain, whom I saw here in your home
for the first time since that awful day.
I went to the station to meet the sol-
diers, and their pain and their courage
took possession of me and I felt that
the opportunity to help them was all
that life held for me. When they began
to think again and memories of home
came to them it was a joy unutterable
to write to their loved ones and tell them
that all was well. So the dear ones at
home would send gifts for their boys
and ask me to see that they went to
their destination and in a little while
quantities of things were coming to me
to be distributed where needed. Soon it
became necessary to carry supplies for
the wounded to the front, then came the
battlefield with all its horrors and the
long fight with death, the victory or the
heartbreak at the end. In it all I
learned that life is the giving of oneself
to save others."
