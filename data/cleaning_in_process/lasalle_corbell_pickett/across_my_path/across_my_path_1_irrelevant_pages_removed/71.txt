LAURA KEENB
Had Laura Keene been less versatile
she might have fared better and, per-
haps, lived a longer life. Leaving the
stage for a time she gave herself up to
the Fine Arts periodical which she
founded and edited. It was intended for
readers who were interested in the high
phases of art, dramatic and otherwise,
and only the art thinkers gave it sup-
port. It soon vanished, and with it
much of Laura Keene 's money. She
had lived up and burned out her life in
a shorter time than it takes most people
to reach that end and she passed from
earth when she should have been in the
prime of her genius.
