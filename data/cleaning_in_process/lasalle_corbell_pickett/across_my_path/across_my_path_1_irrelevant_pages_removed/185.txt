impulses. So there were 'Aunt Tempy
and her Watchers' ready to hand."
"I know the glory of that kind of
life. My first memories, even before I
was able to ride alone, are of sitting in
front of my father on horseback and
riding through the countryside. And
now work is all the more enjoyable, be-
gun in such a beautiful way."
