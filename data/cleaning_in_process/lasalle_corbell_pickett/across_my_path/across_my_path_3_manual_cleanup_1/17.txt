IT sometimes happens that the repu-
tation of a writer falls a slave to the
one work that sprang in glowing
spontaneity from the soul and struck
upon the white heat of a Nation's cru-
cial moment, sending an electric current
thrilling through the heart of the world.
So it happened to Julia Ward Howe,
and to the great body of readers that
name signifies the Battle Hymn of the
Republic, though it was but the out-
glow of a momentary fire and her long,
brave, laborious life was given by seri-
ous effort to the many great subjects
which demanded the exercise of all the
strength of her powerful mind.
"I should not think that you would
like the Battle- Hymn," she said when
I spoke of it with praise.
"Why not? Do not you like i Mary-
land, my Maryland'?"
