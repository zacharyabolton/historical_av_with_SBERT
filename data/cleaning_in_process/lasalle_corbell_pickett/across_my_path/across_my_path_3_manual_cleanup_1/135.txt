Philip Bourke Marston, whose physi-
cal eyes had been closed to earthly
things that his soul might behold in all
their splendor the beauties of earth and
sky glorified to the spiritual sight. One
of his characteristics was the power to
visualize the scenes which were his by
internal perception, as when he wrote
of the "most exquisite and natural
blending of strong emotion with the
sense of external nature" in Mrs.
Moulton's poetry.
"He seemed to have a supernaturally
clear vision," said Mrs. Moulton. "All
the great canvas of Nature was spread
out to his view and irradiated by his
spiritualized imagination."
'His sea poetry is majestic," I said.
'The sadness of the deep voice of
the sea appealed to the sorrow in his
heart and awakened an echo that
brought all the full, deep meaning to
the reader."
