was lost and the audience went off into
fits of laughter that quite ruined the
tragedy. Mr. Kean's dog loved him
with a devotion of which not many
human hearts are capable. Watching
from the wings, the faithful animal saw
his master fall under the attack of the
stage villain whose histrionic duty was
to kill the star with a dagger thrust.
Bushing out the dog bestrode the dead
man and snapped viciously at the mur-
derer whose next business was to carry
off the inanimate body. As the dog
could not be coaxed to leave his dead
master and the actor dared not ap-
proach the ferocious guardian, the cur-
tain hastily fell amid the laughter and
uproarious plaudits of the spectators.
That was the dog's first and last ap-
pearance upon any stage, but if a human
actor had made so great a sensation at
his debut he would immediately have
blazed into a star of the first magni-
tude.
