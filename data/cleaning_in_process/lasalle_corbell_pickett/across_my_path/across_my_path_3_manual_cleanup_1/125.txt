fort not on the battlefield alone but
wherever sorrow and calamity had
brought desolation.
From her woodland home in Glen Echo
her soul passed beyond to the kindred
spirits who through sorrow and cruci-
fixion had found Eternal Life. Over
almost impassable roads loving friends
took her back to her childhood home. In
one part of the route it was necessary to
go by wagon through ice and snow and
the progress was very slow. One of the
sorrowful group urged the driver to
make all speed he could to catch a boat-
He promised to use his best effort, and
asked who was in the coffin. Upon be-
ing informed he said, " Clara Barton!
She saved my father's life when he was
wounded in battle. Do not be afraid;
do not be afraid ; I will take you there in
time.'' So, on her last journey the
Angel of Pain was helped along the way
by a grateful heart.
