232 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
of his own military career, and to project a yet further
assault upon the victorious Confederates, which would
have resulted in a demoralization of the Army of the
Potomac from which it would probably never have re-
covered. Fortunately for him and the North, the strong
opposition of his generals prevented his carrying into
effect this crowning blunder, which he had carefully
planned for the 14th.
Longstreet has said: "They fully expected Burnside
would renew the battle the next day. They knew that
another day would nearly ruin the Army of the Potomac.
If Burnside would attack such a strongly fortified posi-
tion, it was reasonable to suppose that he would repeat
his folly the next day."
This would seem to indicate that Lee and his generals
had a realizing sense of the military acumen of their ad-
versary.
Lee himself was too astute to leave his strong position
and descend to the open plain to attack upon a level a
beaten foe who might suddenly change from conquered
to conqueror, so the two armies watched each other in
sullen silence until the night of the 15th, when the Army
of the Potomac recrossed the river.
