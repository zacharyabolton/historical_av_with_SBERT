CHAPTER XXJI.
frazier's farm.
General Pickett's severe wound necessarily obliging
him to leave the field after the battle of Gaines's Mill,
June 27, 1862, the command of Pickett's brigade devolved
for a few days upon Colonel Eppa Hunton, of the Eighth
Regiment, in spite of his ill health at that time.
On the 30th of June the battle of Frazier's Farm (Glen-
dale) was fought. It began with an artillery duel between
Jackson and Franklin, during the progress of which Long-
street's division was drawn up in line of battle, waiting for
Jackson to cross the White Oak swamp, and for Huger
to come up along the Charles City road. Jackson not be-
ing able to cross the swamp, and Huger being detained
down the road by Slocum's battery, they did not reach
the field as expected.
Hearing the sound of cannon toward the Charles City
road, Longstreet supposed th^t Huger was approaching,
and returned the supposed signal. This drew fire from
the Federal batteries, which barely missed President Davis,
who had come upon the field to consult with his generals.
As the President was not prepared to take an active part
in the fight, he was carried off with all possible speed to a
place of safety.
Colonel Jenkins, with his battalion of sharpshooters,
being nearest the impetuous battery, was ordered to
silence it. As half-way measures did not lie within the
possibilities of the dashing Jenkins, he charged upon and
captured the offending battery, and the battle was opened.
