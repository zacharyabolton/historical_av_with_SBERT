l80 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
fore his return. Pickett had but just crossed over when
Major Sorrell, Longstreet's adjutant-general, brought the
order to advance.
The Nineteenth Regiment, commanded by Colonel
Strange, was now on the right, being the center of the
brigade. The Twenty-eighth, led by Colonel Robert T.
Preston, was next. The Fifty-sixth, under Colonel Peyton
Slaughter, was on the left. In this order the three regi-
ments charged at double-quick upon the enemy's works,
in the teeth of a tempest of death-dealing projectiles of
every description, across this field of oats and sedge.
Pickett simultaneously moved down with the other
two regiments. From the extreme right the five regi-
ments were again united in the center of the field, and
charged in full line of battle, brigade front, Pickett
leading his men and cheering them on. The skirmish
line was soon driven in. The fire from the Federal bat-
teries and small arms was something terrific. The brigade
pushed on — on through a continuous rain of shot and the
roar of guns.
Whiting says: "The enemy, concealed in the woods
and protected by the ravine, poured a destructive fire
upon the advancing line for a quarter of a mile, and
many brave officers and men fell. Near the crest in front
of us and lying down appeared the fragments of a brigade;
men were skulking from the front in a shameful manner;
the woods on our left and rear were full of troops in safe
cover, from which they never stirred; but on the right of
the Third a brigade {Picketfs) was moving manfully up;
still further on the extreme right our troops appeared to
be falling back."
Colonel Robert E. Withers, commanding the Eight-
eenth Regiment, and Colonel Peyton Slaughter, leading
the Fifty-sixth, were shot down — both mortally wounded
