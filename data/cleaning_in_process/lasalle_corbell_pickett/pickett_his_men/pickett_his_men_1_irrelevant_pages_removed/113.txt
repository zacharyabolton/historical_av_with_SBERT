TURKEY ISLAND. 89
father, are among the blessedest of my blessed memories.
My husband's classic taste and perfect harmony and sim-
ple, pure heart made him a great lover of nature, and the
trees and the plants, the stones, the sod, the ground, the
waters, the sky, and all living animals, were his kin.
Though my warrior was a lion in battle, he was gentle,
amiable, good-humored, affectionate, and hospitable in
his home. The same exuberant and hopeful spirit which
cheered and encouraged his soldiers in the field was felt
in his home life. All the world are witnesses of his pa-
triotism and unselfishness, as he offered his life for the
success of the cause in which he had faith. He was never
disheartened by the most complicated difficulties. Un-
spoiled by fame, just and loyal, he deserved the love he
received — for he was worshiped by his family, idolized
by his soldiers, honored by all parties and all nations —
my brave warrior, as simple as a child, as high-minded as
he of whom the word-magician said:
Every god did seem to set his seal, to give the world assurance
of a man.
It was here, on the site of the old home, beautiful
still, though so sadly changed, among the dead stumps
where once waved the foliage of the magnificent ancestral
trees, we began to write our story for our children and, as
the General said, "for the children of the old division,
if it is good enough."
Far away from our dear old Turkey Island and the
sweet old days I finish the task which we, in happy
mood, set for ourselves.
