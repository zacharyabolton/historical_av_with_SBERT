"DOGS OF WAR" IN LEASH. 235
In the early part of February, 1863, it started out on
Longstreet's expedition to Suffolk, Virginia, and North
Carolina, marching to Richmond and thence to the breast-
works around Petersburg, where it made but a short stay,
and then pushed ahead to further the end conceived by
the wise, practical brain and great tender heart of Old
Peter, their stern but humane commander, to procure food
for his men.
It was hard winter weather, cold, inclement and trying,
and during their continued march of ten days the ground
was covered with sleet and snow. Hundreds of the men
were without shoes, blankets or hats. Many were shod
with improvised moccasins of raw beef-hide. The wives,
mothers, sisters and friends of Pickett's men could scarcely
have recognized in these bedraggled, muddy, ragged men
the trim, dainty soldier-boys whom they had sent out from
their homes to win fame and glory two years before, dressed
then in their new uniforms, with shining equipments, with
knapsacks and haversacks well stuffed by loving hands,
and almost every man taking with him cook and valet.
They had won fame and glory beyond the most san-
guine conception, and that they were heroes and warriors,
showed in their will-power and endurance, in the moral
firmness with which, without halt or straggling, they
passed through Richmond and all along the lines of their
homes, receiving the cheers and hurried greetings of their
many relatives and friends whom they had not seen for
months and might never see again.
Even now they could give to those dear ones only a
fleeting recognition from the ranks, a passing smile of
grateful thanks for the loving note, the flower, or the piece
of bread and meat which was hastily thrust into their
hands as tramp, tramp, tramp, they marched away once
again from home and friends.
