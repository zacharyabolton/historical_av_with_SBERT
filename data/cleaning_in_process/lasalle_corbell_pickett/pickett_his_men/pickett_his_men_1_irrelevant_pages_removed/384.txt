354 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
May 25 it reported to Lee at Hanover Junction, and was
stationed at the front to oppose Grant's attempted cross-
ing of the North Anna. Hunton's brigade was near the
old battle-field of Gaines's Mill. While it held this posi-
tion Captain Charles F. Linthicum, the adjutant-general
of the brigade, was killed, and Lieutenant John H. Jones,
aide-de-camp, was severely wounded. They had both
done valiant service with the old division ever since 1862.

upward progress. He was expecting reinforcements from
the Army of the James, then lyingbefore Richmond. Fear-

his ground with great difficulty until late in the afternoon,
when he was reinforced by the Sixth Corps and ten thou-

In the afternoon of June i, a fierce attack was made
by Smith and Wright upon Hoke and Kershaw, whose
outer line was broken. So gallant a defense they made
that the advance of the assailants was arrested, and the
price of the position gained by the attack was two thou-
sand killed and wounded, many of them officers.
At the same time there was a contest on the left of the
