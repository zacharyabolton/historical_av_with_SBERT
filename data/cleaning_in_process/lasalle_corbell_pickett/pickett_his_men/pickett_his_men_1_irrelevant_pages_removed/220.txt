encamped on the night of the 25th near Salem, and on
the next day passed the Bull Run mountains through
Thoroughfare Gap and in the evening was at Bristoe Sta-
tion between Pope and the Federal capital. With him
were the cavalry brigades of Robertson and Fitzhugh Lee,
led by J. E. B. Stuart. From here he sent a detachment
to capture supplies at Manassas Junction, taking posses-

recapture them was repulsed, and their leader, General

On the 28th, the divisions of Hill, Ewell and Taliaferro
halted near the old battle-field of Bull Run. The Fed-
