THE BLUE AND THE GRAY. 4O9
The delighted little maiden, who had never before re-
ceived the homage of a whole division, cried out in a glow
of gratitude:
" I wish I had a Confederate flag; I would wave that,
too!"
The General was asked afterward how he could bring
himself to salute the enemy's flag.
"I did not salute the enemy's flag," he replied. "I
saluted the heroic womanhood in the heart of that brave
little girl, and the glorious old banner under which I won
my first laurels."
On the twenty-fourth anniversary of the greatest battle
of the western continent the men who held those heights
and the men who stormed those heights — all that were
left of them — met on the old blood-stained field where
the bravest deeds known to history had been performed.
Peace had laid her soft mantle over the heights which
nearly a quarter of a century before had been frowned
upon by war's wrinkled visage. In majestic silence the
peaks looked skyward through the golden sun.
An amber glory lay over the summit of Little Round
Top, and the stream at its base which had once flowed
crimson now reflected in silvery gleams the light above it.
The clouds of battle had drifted away long ago, and
in their place were only soft gray mists, sun-tinted, float-
ing like a veil of peace around the crest where once the
Philadelphia brigade met the onset of Pickett's men. The
war-clouds had vanished, but many of the brave defenders
of the height yet remained. As generous in peace as they
had been brave in war, they had come with outstretched
hands to welcome all who were left of the ragged veterans
who so valiantly scaled Cemetery Heights on that terrible
July day which had burned its fiery mark upon the pages
of our history.
