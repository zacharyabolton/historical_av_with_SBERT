CHANCELLORSVILLE. 249
Lee, no longer apprehensive of an attack from the
main army, was able to concentrate himself upon Sedg-
wick and, reoccupying the heights of Fredericksburg, at-
tacked him on the flank and during the night forced him
across the river with a loss of five thousand men.
The next day, the 5th, passed quietly, and in the even-
ing Hooker determined to recross, a movement which he
effected without molestation from the Confederates. The
only obstacle to his withdrawal was a violent storm which
flooded the river. From the north side of the river on
the 6th of May, Hooker issued a congratulatory order in
which he claimed, if not a victory, technically speaking,
at least most of the advantages of one. The South, how-
ever, and the Army of the Potomac, the Northern people
and the administration at Washington, all united in re-
garding it as a defeat, which further demoralized the Army
of the Potomac and dispelled all illusions regarding
" Fighting Joe" as a great military leader.
Not quite a month had passed since Lincoln had given
his parting charge to the two commanders. Notwithstand-
ing this injunction from one in whom common sense well
took the place of strict military training, over forty thou
sand men, eager for the fray, had been left inactive.
