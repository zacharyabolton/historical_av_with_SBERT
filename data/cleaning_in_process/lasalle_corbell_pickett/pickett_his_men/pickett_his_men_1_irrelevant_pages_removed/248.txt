220 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
of the opinion that the removal of McClellan was fortu-
nate for their cause.
The Army of the Potomac, through all its disastrous
career, had never lost faith in "Little Mac," as it fondly
called him. If securing and retaining the confidence of
his men is a proof of military ability, no American leader
had ever been more fitted for his responsible position
than was the commander whose requisitions upon the
military department at Washington had won for his
army the derisive title of "The Umbrella Brigade."
It was with reluctance that General Burnside accepted
an appointment which he had twice declined, and which
would thrust upon him the arduous task of winning the men
from their former idol, or ensure his failure. Subsequent
events seemed to indicate that he had done well in twice
declining, and might have done better by persisting in that
course. However, we may give him credit for having
been actuated by good motives, and regard his subse-
quent career as one of the fortunes, or misfortunes, of war.
Burnside prepared for an aggressive movement which
might prove his metal and secure the good will of the
nation and the army. He consolidated the six corps of
the Army of the Potomac into three grand divisions of
two corps each, the right under General E. V. Sumner;
the center. General Joseph Hooker; the left. General VV.
B. Franklin. He spent ten days in reorganizing and get-
ting under control his dissatisfied army, who placed little
confidence in his plans. Wearied by the slow prepara-
tions of his predecessor for a forward movement which
never took him anywhere, the administration at Washing-
ton insisted upon knowing what the new commander pur-
posed doing. In response to this demand, Burnside
labored with such celerity that within two days from tak-
ing command his plan was ready to be submitted.
