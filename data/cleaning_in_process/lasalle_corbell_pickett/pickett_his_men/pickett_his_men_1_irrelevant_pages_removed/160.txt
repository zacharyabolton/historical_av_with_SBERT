nished an early illustration of the modern definition of
vice as "a virtue gone to seed."
Many of the English sovereigns invested in slave-
ships, and in 1776 slavery existed in all thirteen States.
A regular traffic was carried on between New England
and Africa. Virginia fought this revolting trade in the
Federal Convention, but New England voted with South
Carolina and Georgia that for another twenty years this
terrible crime should blot our escutcheon.
Still the Southern leaders fought, and in 1790 the Con-
gress of the United States declared that it possessed " no
power to interfere with slavery or the treatment of slaves
within the States."
In the meantime the Northern States had discovered
that it was not so lucrative to hold slaves in a rigorous cli-
mate as it was to catch them on the African coast and sell
them into conditions more favorable to the tropical consti-
tution and to the production of those crops to the man-
agement of which the African intelligence was best
adapted. Consequently the North was seized upon by a
severe spasm of virtue which demanded that she should,
for value received, transfer her human possessions to the
South, after the manner of the enthusiastic young convert
who announced in prayer-meeting that her eyes had been
graciously opened to see that her feathers and ribbons
and laces were carrying her straight down to hell, so she
pulled them all off and gave them to her sister.
In 1820, when Missouri was admitted into the Union,
the first halt was effected. The East was greatly opposed
to the extension of the Union toward the southwest, and
carried out its resolution that slavery should not be rec-
ognized as legal in the Territories north of the parallel
