Our Father who lives in the far above, beloved and
hallowed in our hearts [be] Thy name; Great and good
Thou great The above Chief among all people: Good
always Thy will upon earth as in Thy far above. Give
every day our food and water and meat. If we do ill,
[be] not Thou [the] great far above Chief very angry,
and if any one evil towards us, not we angry towards
them. Mend up our broken ways. Send away far from
us all evil. Thine is the great strength and love. For
all the suns. Good so.

gentle rays of the sun.
