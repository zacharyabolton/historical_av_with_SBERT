242 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
forded Lee opportunity to range his army opposite, in
preparation to receive Burnside, if he should succeed in
crossing, and thus place himself between Lee's army and
a river that was too swollen to be passed. The Confeder-
ate sharpshooters, watching the movements of the Army
of the Potomac as it endeavored to struggle through the
mud, called across the river to offer their services in as-
sisting to build the bridges.
When the Army of the Potomac set out upon its dis-
astrous expedition it destroyed many of the camps. Those
which were left proved now a welcome shelter. On the
22d, the army retreated, and on the 23d, reached its
former position, and the famous mud march was ended.
On the 25th, Burnside, at his own request, was relieved of
a comimand for which he had from the beginning felt
himself unfitted, and Major-General Joseph Hooker was
assigned to the vacancy thus created, Sumner, broken
by age and infirmity, was retired from active service, and
Franklin was deprived of his command, thus leaving
Hooker the senior general of this branch of the army.
" Fighting Joe" devoted himself with his usual energy
to the reorganization and drill of his army. President
Lincoln had written a private letter to the new commander,
which accompanied the order of appointment. After
commending him for his soldierly qualities and freedom
from political intrigue, and censuring him for his un-
friendly criticisms of his predecessor, he closes thus:
I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the
army, of criticising their commander and withholding confidence from
him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you as far as I can to put it
down. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any
good out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it. And now beware
of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give
U'; victories.
