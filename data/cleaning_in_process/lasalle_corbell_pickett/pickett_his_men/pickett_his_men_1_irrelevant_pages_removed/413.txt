ON TO DINWIDDIE COURT-HOUSE. 383
It was Pickett's intention to push on to Dinwiddie
Court-house, but, after consultation with Fitz Lee, the
other cavalry not as yet having joined him, the night be-
ing dark and rainy, and his own men tired and worn out,
it was decided that he should stop.
In order to keep the Federals at a respectful distance
during the night, Pickett threw out two of his brigades on
the Court-house road. Corse and Terry advanced almost
a mile, driving the Federal cavalry before them; though, be-
ing dismounted and armed with the repeating rifle, the
troopers made a vigorous fight. The strength of the
enemy was beyond conjecture.
On the morning of the 31st, Lee led McGowan's,
Gracie's, Hunton's and Wise's brigades against the Fed-
eral Fifth Corps, commanded by Warren, which was posted
between Pickett's command and the Confederate forti-
fications. Warren was driven back behind Gravelly Run.
Pickett placed W. H. F. Lee's and Rosser's cavalry
on the right, followed by the infantry and artillery. Fitz
Lee's division, commanded by Thomas T. Mumford, was
at the left. W. H. F. Lee's cavalry preceded the infantry
column on the. direct road to a crossing at Chamberlayne's
Creek, and Mumford moved by an immediate road in the
same direction.
At the fork of Chamberlayne's Creek, W. H. F. Lee
made one of the most brilliant and severe cavalry fights of
the war, forcing a crossing immediately in face of a superior
force of the Federal troops, who had all the advantages of
position, with a stream of water in front. The infantry
were unable to cross at this point, and sought a passage
lower down, Terry's brigade leading. It suffered serious
loss in the passage, though it made a brilliant dash across
the creek and killed and captured about a hundred of the
enemy, driving their forces back to Dinwiddie Court-house.
