342 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
odds, but it was led by the same Pickett who, with one
company of United States regulars, held the whole British
fleet at bay at San Juan Island, and made the English
lion crouch to the star-spangled banner. Would not he

which a nation had risked its honor, after the reckless

A portion of Haygood's South Carolina brigade, the
first reinforcement of troops from the south, arrived on
the 6th of May, the next day after the attack. Pickett
stationed them at Port Walthall Junction, on the railroad
between Richmond and Petersburg, about six miles dis-

army was south of Petersburg and was on its way toward
the defense of Richmond on the south side. Hence it was
all-important that this connection between Petersburg and
Richmond should be kept open. Pickett, knowing this,
detained this brigade on his own responsibility, although
he had been ordered in a telegram from Bragg, of the
War Department in Richmond, to send them directly on
to Richmond. It was only by the intervention of this
gallant little force of Haygood's brave South Carolinians,
who had a sharp skirmish with Butler's advance column,
driving them back, that the Federals were kept off of the
railroad and the connection between the two cities was
preserved unbroken.
The Weldon Railroad was threatened by Kautz's cavalry
