CHAPTER XXV
REORGANIZATION.
The Army of Northern Virginia had just returned from
the first Maryland campaign, greatly reduced in number,
and was falling back toward Winchester when Brigadier-
General Pickett reported for duty at Martinsburg. This
was in September, 1862, and the General was yet only able
to wear his coat across the wounded arm and shoulder,
which still caused him severe suffering.
At Martinsburg a reorganization of the army was made.
Pickett's and Kemper's Virginia brigades and Jenkins's
South Carolina brigade were consolidated into a division
and attached to Longstreet's corps. The command of the di-
vision was assigned to Brigadier-General George E. Pickett.
Brigadier-General Richard B. Garnett was assigned to
Pickett's old brigade, and from this date its designation
was changed to Garnett's brigade, and it became merged
into the general record of Pickett's division. Under its
new leader it well sustained its olden glory.
In September, 1862, at Culpeper Court-house, Briga-
dier-General Lewis Addison Armistead's brigade, which
had heretofore belonged to Huger's division, was assigned
to Pickett's division. This brigade had been engaged in
the second day's fight at Seven Pines, in the battles of
Malvern Hill and Sharpsburg, and had been with Lee's
army in the first Maryland campaign.
On October IQ, 1862, Brigadier-General Pickett was offi-
cially promoted major-general, and permanently placed in
command of Pickett's division.
