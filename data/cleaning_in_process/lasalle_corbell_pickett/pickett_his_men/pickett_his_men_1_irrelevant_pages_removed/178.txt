150 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Thus North and South, each charging the other with
aggression, sprang to arms, father against son, brother
against brother; the North to "save the Union," the South
to defend her homes and firesides.
General Pickett was stationed at San Juan Island on
the Pacific coast when his State seceded, and the follow-
ing letter to one of his loved ones, written on his way
back to offer his services to his beloved Virginia, will
show the contending feelings of his brave and loving
heart:
I pray God that this direful revolution
which has come about because of misunderstandings, and for which I see
no real necessity, may yet in some way be averted.
Of course, President Lincoln's call to march against the South, the
encampment around Washington, the invasion of Maryland by a Mas-
sachusetts regiment, the blockading of the Southern ports against the
commerce of the whole world, mean war and leave but one honorable
course open to me.
Dearly, therefore, as I love the Union, and proud as I am of my
country and the great name of American citizen, I can not invade my own
fireside â€” I can not raise my arm against my own kith and kin. All my
ambition and patriotism shall henceforth live only in the defense of my
beloved State, v/hich has the first claim upon my allegiance, and demands
this my immediate return to her. I hope the South has thought to keep
our flag, the stars and the stripes, for the star-spangled banner will be
worth more to us in the coming conflict than the people of the South,
who only know their own State flag, have any idea of
The war between the States has now been over thirty-
three years. The falsehoods and misrepresentations as to
the causes which led up to that gigantic struggle should
have since been truthfully and candidly written, but the
powers which have mainly controlled affairs since the war
have seemed to find it necessary to justify their actions
by an unfair statement of the motives and principles
which drove the Southern States to secession.
