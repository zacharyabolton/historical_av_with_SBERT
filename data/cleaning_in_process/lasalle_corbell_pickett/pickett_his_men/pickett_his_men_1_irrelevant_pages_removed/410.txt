380 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Pickett received the order from Lee on the 29th day
of March, 1865, at Swift's Creek, where he, with two of his
brigades. Corse's and Terry's, were bivouacked. Stuart's
brigade was west of Petersburg, and was ordered to join
Pickett en route. Hunton's brigade, the brave old com-
mand at the head of which Garnett met his glorious death
on the field of Gettysburg, was with Longstreet on the
north of the James River.
The entire division had been ordered to march, but it
was found that there was transportation for only three
brigades. In order to secure a whole division, Longstreet
suggested drawing Mahone from Bermuda Hundred and
allowing Pickett to replace him, but Lee preferred a part
of Pickett's division, and ordered the three brigades for-
ward.
Pickett, in carrying out the order of Lee, endeavored
to make the movement as stealthily as possible, though he
knew it was impossible to conceal entirely from the
knowledge of the Federals the action of Stuart's brigade
near Petersburg, it being in the range of vision from the
Federal lookout-stations.
Pickett, with the brigades of Corse, Terry and Stuart
was to cross the Appomattox River, passing Petersburg,
where they were to take the cars by the South-side Rail-
road to Sutherland's Station, ten miles west of Peters-
burg, and to move thence to Sutherland's Tavern on the
railroad. Fitz Lee's cavalry had already preceded the in-
fantry to the tavern, and he had from that point com-
municated with Pickett who, \yith the three brigades,
reached the station a little after nine o'clock in the
evening.
At ten o'clock the same night (the 29th), R. H. An-
derson sent an order to Pickett to come on with his three
brigades by a cross-road to the White Oak road, over
