1 88 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Pickett's brigade, under command of Hunton, was
brought up in line of battle, where it was exposed to a
furious cannonade. Hunton becoming separated from
his command because of exhaustion, consequent upon
his feeble condition, Colonel John B. Strange, of the
Nineteenth Virginia, took command, and under his leader-

Longstreet had been sustaining the attack of McCall,
Sedgwick, Kearny, Slocum and Hooker, in the expecta-
tion that Huger would attack the Federal right and Jack-

Hill at Sharpsburg."
The next day, meeting Surgeon Maish, of McCall's
division, who had remained upon the field to tend the
