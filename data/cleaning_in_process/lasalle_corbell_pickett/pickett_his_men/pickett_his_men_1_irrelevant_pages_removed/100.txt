j6 PICKETT AND HIS MEN:
tiemen, Mr. Beverly Tucker and Mr. Beverly Saunders,
had been gagged and taken through the lines, though
their release was immediately demanded by the English
government.
Much to my husband's relief, I volunteered to assume
the disagreeable task of notifying her, which notice she
seemed intuitively to have anticipated and determined to
thwart by telling of her troubles, all of which she laid at
"that Johnson's" (her husband's) door.
" He is got so high-minded now," she said, " he refuses
to blacken all the boots at night — leaves the top floor
ones till morning. Wants to set up-stairs with me and
the girls, instead of staying down in the kitchen, looking
for chaws and to be handy; expects us to hunt tins to
shine and mend, and nails to drive; won't eat the board-
ers' leavings; reads the Stateser's newspaper that he sends
to his girl; sets on it when he hears us coming; took
money from Stateser, too, and was that sly he was going
to spend it on himself, and I giving him all he needs."
Taking advantage of her pause for sympathy, I edged
in my notice. She immediately put all the blame of our
going on "that Johnson," and, though I assured her that
he had nothing whatever to do with it, wailed:
"You can't fool us, you can't fool us — he drives every
boarder out of the house."
Our next rooms opened on the Champs de Mars, the
attractions of which in part made up for the loss of the
veranda, but not for that of our " Left-handers," who had
come and gone, making oases in our lives.
