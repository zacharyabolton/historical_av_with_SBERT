BORN WITH EMERALDSâ€” NEMO NOCETUR. 8l
gaze, piercing my inmost thoughts, and with that dis-
couraging " Well !-what-can-I-do-for-you?" expression, I
felt all my courage going. My necessities aroused me
from my cowardice, and I said as bravely as I could:
" I have had the good fortune to read your advertise-
ment, madam, in the paper this morning, and have come
in answer to it. May I see the professor?"
Looking curiously at my card and then over her glasses
at me, she said, in a voice like an animated telephone
through which some one was speaking at the other end:
"The advertisement was for a teacher, not for a pupil."
"I am perfectly aware of that," I answered, "and
came in response, to offer my services to the professor."
A most quizzical expression bunched up the corners
of her mouth and wiggled across her little colorless eyes,
as she said:
" I will send the professor down to you."
Looking over her spectacles again, as if for a verifica-
tion of her first impression of me, she was gone.
Returning after a little while, she said:
"The professor requested me to ask if you would be
so good as to come up into the recitation-room."
I saw as soon as I had entered that a description of me
had preceded my coming, and not a very flattering one,
either, I judged, from the faces of the professor and the
pupils.
The class consisted of fourteen young ladies, all of
them apparently older than I was. The professor fin-
ished the sentence he was translating on the board,
rubbed it out, wiped his hands on the cloth, replaced it,
came forward and was duly presented by Miss Mcintosh,
who remained in the room. He had a pleasant, round,
smooth face, a bald head and large gray eyes, was short
and stout, with a sympathetic, cultured voice and manner.
