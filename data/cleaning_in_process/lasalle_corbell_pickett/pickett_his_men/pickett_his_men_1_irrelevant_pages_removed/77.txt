ONE WOMAN REDEEMED THEM ALL. 53
I wore a long, loose-fitting black silk mantilla with
three ruffles at the bottom, while those around me were
dressed in tight-fitting, short cloth jackets. My bonnet
was of gray straw, plaited and dyed by the servants on
the plantation at home, and sewed into shape by our fash-
ionable village milliner; a poke shape, extending far over
the face, a wreath of pink moss-rosebuds on the inside,
tangled in with my dark-brown hair, while it was trimmed
on the outside with several clusters and bunches of
grapes of a lighter shade of gray, also hand-made. The
grapes were formed of picked cotton, covered with
fleek-skin* and then tinted. My collar was one of my
bridal presents — from our pastor's wife — made of tat-
ting and embroidery, about five inches wide, and was
pinned in front with a lava breast-pin. The prevailing
collar worn by the fashionable world was made of linen,
very narrow, only an edge of it showing, while very small,
jaunty hats, worn back on the head, were the style.
The conductor seemed to be arguing with this man
as I caught his eye, and just then my baby sprang forward
and snatched the newspaper from an old gentleman who
was sitting, reading it, in front of me, and shrieked when
it was loosened from his baby hands, while the old gen-
tleman looked daggers in answer to my apologies; but,
thank heaven! when I looked again after this diversion,
the two men were gone.
I had just settled back, a little unnerved and weak,
however, when from behind me came a touch on my
shoulder, and, turning around, I saw the officer and the
conductor. The former said, " I have a warrant for your
arrest, madam," and forthwith served it upon me.
There on the cars, all alone, miles away from home
and friends, two dollars and ten cents all my little store,
