82 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
" Miss Mcintosh tells me you came in reply to my ad-
vertisement. I have been forced to advertise in order to
save time, as my going abroad is unexpected and brooks
no delay."
" I am very glad you had no option but to advertise,
else it might not have been my good fortune to know of,
and respond to, your wants, sir."
" And you have really come to apply for the position ? "
he asked.
" I have, sir."
The expression on Miss Mcintosh's face, the nudging
and suppressed titter among the pupils which this an-
swer brought forth was not calculated to lessen my em-
barrassment.
"Have you had any experience in teaching?"
"No, sir," I said.
" May I ask where you were educated."
" At home, except for two years, sir," I answered. " Then
I went to Lynchburg College, where I was graduated."
" Is that in England? "
"Oh, no, sir," said I, with astonishment at his igno-
rance, and then recollecting myself just as I was about to
inform him that Lynchburg was the fifth town in popu-
lation in Virginia, was on the south bank of the James
River, one hundred and sixteen miles from the capital of
the State, and within view of the Blue Ridge mountains
and Peaks of Otter, I stopped short, embarrassed by my
imprudence. The professor, taking no notice of my con-
fusion, went on to say:
"And so you were graduated there? My class here
has just finished Caesar. Do you remember how Caesar
commences?"
" Yes, sir," I said, and repeated: " Gallia est omnis di-
visa in partes ires."
