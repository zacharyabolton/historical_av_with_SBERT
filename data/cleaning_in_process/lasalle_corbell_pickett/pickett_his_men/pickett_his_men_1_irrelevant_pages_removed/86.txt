62 PICKETT AND HIS MEN-
perhaps, as so many curios. There were gowns remodeled
and refashioned from court dresses over a hundred years
old. There were others entirely new as to texture, and
grotesquely original as to style, woven on our crude looms,
made streaked and striped with our natural dyes, trimmed
with an improvised passementerie made of canteloupe

bridal-robe gave place to the sombreness of the widow's
weeds, which for many years were faithfully worn in
memory of her fallen hero.
My genuine grief for the loss of all my clothes touched
the heart of the sturdy Englishman into vouchsafing the
information that I would better return the checks for
exchange and I would receive my luggage on the next
