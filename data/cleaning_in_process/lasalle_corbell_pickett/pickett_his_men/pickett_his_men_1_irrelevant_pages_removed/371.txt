which, all told, was one regiment of infantry of Cling-

to the weakest private feel his heart thrill tumultuously
as he reflected that behind him stood home, friends, loved
ones, the closest and dearest of family ties, all that his
heart held dear in life, dependent on the valor and skill
with which he held his ground?
A small and feeble band, it might be said, to face such
