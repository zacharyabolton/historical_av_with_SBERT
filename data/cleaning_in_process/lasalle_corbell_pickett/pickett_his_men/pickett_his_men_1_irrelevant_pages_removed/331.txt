GETTYSBURGâ€” THIRD DAY. 3OI
If you are coming, come at once or I can not give you proper sup-
port, but the enemy's fire has not slackened at all. At least eighteen
guns are still firing from the cemetery itself.
After Pickett had read the note he handed it to Long-
street.
"General Longstreet, shall I go forward?" he asked.
Longstreet looked at him with an expression which
seldom comes to any face. In that solemn silence mem-
ories of the long friendship may have flooded his soul.
Possibly there came to his thought the time away back in
history when he had fallen on the stormy slope of Cha-
pultepec, and the boy lieutenant had taken his place and
borne the battle-flag in triumph to the flame-crowned
height. He held out his hand and bowed his head in as-
sent. Not a word did he speak.
"Then I shall lead my division forward, sir," said
Pickett, and galloped off.
He had gone only a few yards when he came back and
took a letter from his pocket. On it he wrote in pencil,
" If Old Peter's nod means death, good-by, and God bless
you, little one!" He gave the letter to Longstreet and
rode back. That letter reached its destination in safety
and, with its faint penciled words, is now one of my most
treasured possessions. It was transmitted with one from
Longstreet:
Gettysburg, Penn., July 3d.
My Dear Lady: General Pickett has just intrusted to me the safe
conveyance of the inclosed letter. If it should turn out to be his fare-
well the penciled note on the outside will show you that I could not
speak the words which would send so gallant a soldier into the jaws of a
useless death. As I watched him, gallant and fearless as any knight of
old, riding to certain doom, I said a prayer for his safety and made a vow
to the Holy Father that my friendship for him, poor as it is, should be
your heritance. We shall meet. I am, dear lady, with great respect,
Yours to command,
James Longstreet.
