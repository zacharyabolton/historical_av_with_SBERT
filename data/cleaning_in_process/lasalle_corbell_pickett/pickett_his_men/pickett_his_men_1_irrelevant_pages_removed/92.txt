68 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
By the "nine businesses" and "Stateser" I gathered,
from her explanation, which she volunteered in answer
to my puzzled look, that the fortunate son-in-law-to-be
was a Yankee living in a small town in the State of Ver-

We did not exactly understand what that meant, but one
day's experience proved it to be anything but comfort-
able. The dinner had all been cooked on Saturday and
was cut up and piled on the table in the center of the
