CHAMCELLORSVILLE. 243
Officers were required to have their absent men re-
turn. A system of furloughs was established. Presi-
dent Lincoln granted amnesty to all deserters who re-
turned by the first of April. Recruits began to come in.
The cavalry was placed under command of Stoneman,
an able officer, but not a great cavalry leader. The dash-
ing ardor of "Fighting Joe" infused new spirit into the
army and won the confidence of all who love a dazzling
warrior, and who does not? Perhaps the most peaceable
soul on earth is not dead to the thrill which a martial
hero excites.
Lincoln visited the army and reviewed the troops. A
Northern writer has said that "every visit he made to the
army was equal to the addition of a new brigade." As he
left he gave Hooker and Couch this final warning: "I
want to impress you two gentlemen â€” in your next fight
put in all your men." We shall see how well the injunc-
tion was obeyed.
By the end of April Hooker had what he called "the
finest army on the planet," but it would not remain so long.
He must fight an early battle, or lose the assistance of
forty-one regiments whose time would expire.
Lee expected either that Hooker would cross by the
upper fords, or that he would move against Richmond.
Longstreet laid out lines of defense for these fords, and
was then ordered with the divisions of Hood and Pickett
and the artillery of Bearing and Henry to a point near
Petersburg to meet the possible movement on to Rich-
mond. McLaws and R. H. Anderson remained to finish
the work in connection with the fords. It was important
to Hooker that he attack Lee in the absence of Long-
street and his divisions. Lee's cavalry was also much
worn by its series of brilliant raids, so dashing and suc-
cessful that a Northern writer has said in connection with
