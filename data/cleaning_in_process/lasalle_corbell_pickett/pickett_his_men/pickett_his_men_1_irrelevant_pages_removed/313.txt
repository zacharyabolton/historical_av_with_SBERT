GETTYSBURGâ€” SECOND DAY. 283
to open on the right, and the center was to fall into battle
when the Federal line should appear to be shaken.
Two divisions of Longstreet were on the right, Hill cen-

pines on the top and the western slope of the ridge.

Longstreet awaited the arrival of Law's brigade,
which reached the field at noon after a march of twenty-

division it took position behind the right of the Third
Corps. Alexander's batteries were posted on Seminary
Hill.
Meade felt so strong in his position for defense that
he supposed Lee would also recognize his invincibility,
and would decline to attack him in front, confining his
operations to a flank movement which would turn him out
of his position. He held a council of his corpb com-
