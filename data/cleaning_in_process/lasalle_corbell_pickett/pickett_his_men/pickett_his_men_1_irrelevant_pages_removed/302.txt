2/2 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Lee spent the night of the 30th in Longstreet's camp
in consultation, and the next morning the two generals
rode through the mountain pass to the field of the ap-

approach of Heth rapidly advancing along the Cashtown
road.
Heth deployed his two advance brigades, Davis's on the
left and Archer's on the right, south of the Chambersburg
road. About eight o'clock, the Confederate line descended

and the battle of Gettysburg, that wonderful event which
resulted from so many unforeseen accidents and apparent

in person the fire of his artillery, prepared to lead back
his small command to Cemetery Hill should it become
necessary. Hill, at Cashtown, had heard the echo of the
