268 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
hedged around and protected by magnificent and pic-
turesque rocks that in after time it was known as Rock
Creek.
The gigantic stem of the hook was formed by a suc-
cession of hills whereon there was later a sacred spot in
which the earthly forms of loved ones, whose souls had
passed beyond into the higher phase of life, were laid to
rest with loving, tender care, beneath green sod radiant
with the bloom of flowers watered by tears of love and
hope. From this peaceful and holy place the chain took
the name of Cemetery Ridge, a faithful prophecy of its
destined purpose.
The stem ends in two hills, Round Top and Little
Round Top, the two keys which some day would lock
and unlock the military treasure of the great Cemetery
Ridge.
A short distance northwest of Little Round Top was a
cavern formed of piles of enormous rocks, wild and rugged
and sinister-looking. So filled was it with appalling sug-
gestions and terrifying appeals to a sensitive imagination
that it had received the name of Devil's Den. It came
to pass in later days that, resounding with reports of
deadly musketry, shrouded in smoke and flaming with
fire, it bore well its demoniac name.
Between the Round Tops and Devil's Den flows a lit-
tle marshy stream known as Plum Run â€” name of gentle
suggestions dear to the heart of the farmer's child. It is
associated with summer orchards, with red fruit dropping
dovvn, with appetizing suppers in the soft gloaming of the
summer day, with the sweet smell of the clover wafted
up from the southern hillside meadow on the gentle
wings of the summer air, and the luscious crimson fruit
lying temptingly among green leaves on the white-draped
table.
