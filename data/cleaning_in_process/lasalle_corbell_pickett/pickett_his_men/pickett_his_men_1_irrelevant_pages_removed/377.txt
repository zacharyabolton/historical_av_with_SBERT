A STRANGE BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. ZA7
On the 15th of May, 1864, Whiting received orders
from Bragg, of the War Department at Richmond, to with-
draw his whole force from Petersburg and move by a
roundabout road some distance in the rear of Drury's
Bluff so as to get into the defenses of Richmond from the
rear.
Whiting was both amazed and indignant at being
obliged to abandon Petersburg after its almost miraculous
escape and to leave it thus entirely unprotected, but, fear-
ing to disobey, he, in accordance with Bragg's directions,
issued marching orders for the following day. This most
remarkable order of Bragg was signaled to Beauregard
by Colonel Walter Harrison who, at the solicitation of
Whiting, was for the time serving on his staff. Beaure-
gard at once sent an order through Colonel Logan to
Whiting, directing him to move with his command at
daylight on the i6th of May, and attack Butler on his
left, thus co-operating with Beauregard in his attack.
Whiting was delighted by this change of order, and
most enthusiastic at the prospect of meeting the Fed-
erals.
At Drury's Bluff, where some of the batteries were
stationed to prevent the fleet from passing up the river,
Beauregard had three divisions under Ransom, Hoke and
Colquitt. In Ransom's division were two of Pickett's
brigades. Barton's, commanded by Colonel Fry, and
Kemper's old brigade, under Terry. Another of Pickett's
brigades. Corse's, was in Hoke's division.
Beauregard's intention was to cut off the Federals
from their base of operations at Bermuda Hundred, and
on the 15th of May, he issued orders for battle on the next
day. In a letter written some years after the close of the
war Beauregard thus sets forth his intentions in regard to
this battle:
