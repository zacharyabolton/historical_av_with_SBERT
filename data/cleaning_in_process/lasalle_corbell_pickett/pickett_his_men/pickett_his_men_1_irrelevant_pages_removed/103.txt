B ORN WITH EMERALDS â€” NEMO NO CE TUR. 79
ing nose. His face, too, was wrinkled up into a thou-
sand gullies in his concentration upon his work.
"We don't hemploy young women 'ere," he said,
looking up and frowning as he suddenly became aware
of my presence.
"I came," I explained, taking out my emeralds and
handing them to him, "to ask you if you would not,
please, sir, kindly buy some of these stones from me, or,
at least, advance me some money on them."
"This is not a pawnbroker's shop, heither, mum," he
replied, as he carefully examined the jewels, and then,
suddenly popping the napkin-ring out of his eye, turned
both of the piercing little gray twinklers upon me and said:
"Where did you get these hemeralds from, miss?"
"I was born with them, sir," I said, indignantly.
Either from my appearance, or for some other cause,
he became suddenly suspicious, and not only would not
purchase them of me, but refused to let me have them
till I could prove my right to them. I was too young
and inexperienced to be anything but furious, and the
bitter, scalding tears that anger sometimes unlocks to re-
lieve poor woman's outraged feelings, were still falling
fast when I reached the hotel with the clerk whom the
jeweler had sent back with me that I might prove by the
proprietor my ownership of the jewels with which I was
born.
He, in his sympathy, shared my anger and, after ex-
pressing his sincere regret that I should have been sub-
jected to such an indignity, advised, as he snatched the
case from the clerk with a withering look of scorn trans-
lated into more emphatic language, that I should look
carefully over them to be sure that neither this hireling
nor his master had abstracted any of the stones, for his
experience had been that suspicion was born of guilt.
