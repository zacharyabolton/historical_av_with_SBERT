CHAPTER XVII.
SLAVERY.
The commercial greed of England anchored the negro
race upon America against the earnest protests of the
colonists.
In 1620, when a Dutch vessel landed twenty slaves at
Jamestown, the enlightened sense of Virginia quickly
took alarm, and laws against the wicked traffic were
promptly passed. For more than a century Virginia
fought most valiantly against the wrong which she fore-
saw would work irreparable injury, not only to the South,
but to the whole country.
In 1770 the King commanded the Governor "under
pain of highest displeasure to assent to no law by which
the importation of slaves should be in any respect prohib-
ited or obstructed." Two years later, after a prolonged
and earnest debate, the Assembly of Virginia submitted
to the King a memorial setting forth the inhumanity of
the trade, and its exceeding great danger to the existence
of his American dominions, and praying that the interests
of the British dealers who would be financially benefited
by the criminal traffic might not be permitted to take
precedence of the welfare of the entire colonies. As
England has never been known to hold any colony with
the smallest reference to the benefit of its inhabitants,
the petition was of course unavailing. Thus was forced
upon Virginia a gigantic evil which she bravely supported
for generations, and the wrongs of which she did all in
her power to ameliorate.
