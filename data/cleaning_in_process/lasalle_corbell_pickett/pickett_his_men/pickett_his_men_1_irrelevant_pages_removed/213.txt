GAINES'S MILL. I85
In Richmond every hospital was filled with our
wounded, and two hundred unfortunate sufferers taken

of confusion and dismay, obliged to be sheltered in an
open warehouse until such time as the friendly doors of
the private homes could be opened to supplement the
overcrowded hospitals.

leviate their miseries and to give them every comfort
within their power.
This fight, the battle of Gaines's Mill, was altogether

Carolinians could have won the fight.
Hood's gallant Texas brigade distinguished them-
selves upon the right flank of McClellan's position, but
they did not pass over the bloody field. That attack in
front at Gaines's Mill was made by George E. Pickett's
and R. H. Anderson's brigades alone.
General Longstreet, in a letter to General Robert E,

recognize the fact that the line in my front, that is, the enemy's line,
was broken by the troops that were under my orders and handling. A
part of Jackson's command, being astray, reported to me just as I was
moving my column of attack forward — Whiting's division — and I put it
in my column of attack, as stated in my report. I think that you must
have overlooked my report on this point, and have been guided by
