156 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
As Davis and Lee opposed Johnston's suggestion, lest
it might dangerously weaken other important points, and
Longstreet was not permitted to elaborate his plan, a suc-
cession of small engagements took place, decisive of
nothing in particular, unless it might be of the value of
"On to Richmond!" as a war-cry. The first of these was
the siege of Yorktown, which began the 5th of April and
was in progress on the 17th, when Joseph E. Johnston
took command of the Army of the Peninsula.
Upon the arrival of Smith and Longstreet the Con-

division forming the right wing, Longstreet's the center,
D. H. Hill's the left. Smith's the reserve.
There was some long-range skirmishing and a daily
cannonading, and a line of batteries was constructed. As
the time drew near for the attack to begin, Johnston de-

troops to a fire resulting in a loss so serious that it could
not be compensated for by the few days which might be
gained for the reinforcement of his army. Accordingly,
on Saturday, the 3d day of May, Yorktown was evacu-

driven in, and a skirmish took place near Fort Magruder,
where the Federal troops were defeated and lost a piece
of artillery.
There was a heavy fall of rain on the night of the 4th,
and on the next morning Smith's division and the bag-
