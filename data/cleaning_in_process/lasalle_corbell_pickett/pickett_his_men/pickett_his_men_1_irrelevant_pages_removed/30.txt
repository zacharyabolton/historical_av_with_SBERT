6 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
recollections, the official parchment might be but a torn
bit of wall-paper, turned wrong side out for convenience
in writing. Was not Judge Lyons still Judge Lyons — a
member of Old Dominion aristocracy — a former minister
to the court of St. James? With all the cold and stately
formality with which he might once have presented to
the Queen of England a representative of I'le wealth and
culture of his nation, he "had the honor" to introduce
his companions to Major Stevens, and if there was any
lack of dignity in the manner in which the aforesaid slip
of wall-paper was conveyed to that probably astonished
officer, it was from no failure of duty on the part of him
upon whom yet rested some shadow of the royal glory
which pervaded the court of St. James. Upon the un-
adorned side of the wall-paper were inscribed these words:
It is proper to formally surrender to the Federal authorities the
city of Richmond, hitherto capital of the Confederate States of America,
and the defenses protecting it up to this time.
Major Stevens courteously accepted the surrender on
behalf of his commanding general, to whom the docu-
ment was transmitted, and proceeded to reduce the newly
acquired property to possession by valiantly fighting the
flames which were sturdily disputing ownership with him.
Having utilized to good effect what little remnant of
the fire department he could find, he ordered the stars
and stripes to be raised over the Capitol. Two soldiers
of the Fourth Massachusetts Cavalry, one from Company
E and one from Company H, mounted to the summit of
the Capitol and in a few moments, for the first time in
more than four years, the national flag fluttered unmo-
lested in the breezes of the South. The stars of the
Union were saluted, while our "warrior's banner took its
flight to meet the warrior's soul."
