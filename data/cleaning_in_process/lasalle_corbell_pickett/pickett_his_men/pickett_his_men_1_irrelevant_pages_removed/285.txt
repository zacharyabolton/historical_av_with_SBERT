HIGH TIDE OF THE CONFEDERACY. 255
lowers of Lee with clothing and food that would support
them until the final blow could be struck, and win for the
South an unfailing store of supplies for the future.
For the greater part of four years the South had been
constantly supplying and never garnering. The men who
had formerly tilled the soil were now engaged in pursuits
that were not immediately productive, and the willing
earth lay with all its treasures deeply hidden in its heart,
waiting for the hand of peaceful toil to reach down
and gather the wealth that would be so freely given for
the asking. In vain Mother Earth held there her glorious
fruitage, while her wayward children rushed murderously
on, trampling to death the fresh green carpet which she
had spread over her, as a living promise of what she would
give if they would accept. Rivers of blood overwhelmed
her, while she lay prostrate, with her jewels held to her
own heart, because her children would not stretch out their
hands and take them from her grasp.
Across the Pennsylvania line the verdant hills and gen-
erous green valleys seemed to smile and beckon a loving
invitation to the starving, unclad Army of Northern Vir-
ginia to come over and be fed and clothed. Nature is
neither Northern nor Southern — she is universal. If she
were let alone to carry out her will she would provide for
all alike. What wonder that hungry eyes looked long-
ingly northward where her full garner offered abundant
■stores!
Once across the line, Lee hoped to turn the tables and
give the Northern army a taste of warfare with an empty
commissariat. His first step would be to destroy the rail-
roads and suspend communication from the North to the
Army of the Potomac. He would interrupt supplies and
reduce Hooker's army in a few days to the same condi-
tion as his own.
