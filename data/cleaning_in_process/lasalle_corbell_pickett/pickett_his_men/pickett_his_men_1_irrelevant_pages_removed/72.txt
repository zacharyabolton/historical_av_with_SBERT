48 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
there ever so sweet a slumber-song since babies were first
invented to awaken the deepest melody of mother hearts?
I went to sleep with baby in my arms. I had not
money enough to get a berth â€” just barely enough to buy
my ticket and pay my expenses through to Montreal,
Canada, from which point the telegram was dated.
When I awakened later I found that a homespun shawl
had been placed under my head. I never thought about
who had been so kind, nor why the shav/1 was there. All
my life long every one had been thoughtful of me; things
had been done for me, courtesies had been extended to
me, and I had learned to accept kindnesses as only what
I had a right to expect from the human race. Murmuring
softly the comforting words, " Edwards is better," I
turned my face over and went to sleep again on the shawl.
I slept until my baby became restless from the jolting.
We took the steamer up the Hudson from New York
to Albany. Something made poor little baby sick. I
censured myself for having allowed him to catch cold on
the train while I was sleeping. He was teething, and Vv^as
very fretful. He had been used, too, to his nurse, his
black mammy. He missed her customary care and atten-
tion, his cradle and rocking, and was unhappy and could
not understand it. She used to give him his bath, to sing to
him her negro melodies, and to dance him up and down
in her strong arms, only bringing him to me for his daily
nourishment and kisses and my own enjoyment of him,
or when sometimes she wanted to go to her meals before
Thomas was ready to put him in his little wagon. So, in
his discomfort, he would reach out his hands and nod to
anybody to take him. He was tired of me, and thought
that I must, in some way, be the cause of all these
privations and the pain and suffering he was then under-
going.
