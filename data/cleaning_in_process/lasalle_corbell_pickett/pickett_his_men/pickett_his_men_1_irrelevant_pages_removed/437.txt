SAILOR'S CREEK. 40/
After the battle of Sailor's Creek occurred the first
reunion of the Blue and Gray. It was when Sheridan's
soldiers shared their rations with Pickett's men until
Grant issued orders for their supply. Thus the voice of
a common ancestry of blood and kinship was heard as
an echo to the roar of cannon. In after years came other
reunions.
