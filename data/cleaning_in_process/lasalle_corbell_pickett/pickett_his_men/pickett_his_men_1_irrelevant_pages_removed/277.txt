CHANCELLOR SVILLE. 247
and left the field forever. As has been truly said by a
Northern historian, it is doubtful whether all the advan-
tages gained to the Southern cause in the battle of Chancel-
lorsville were not dearly purchased by the loss of Thomas
Jonathan Jackson. He died at Guiney's Station, Virginia,
on the loth of May.
Pleasanton, having gained an aggressive position, pro-
ceeded to fortify it, arranging batteries and constructing
roads across the marshy ground, until he had so strength-
ened his position that he thought, with the support of
Sickles's infantry, he could maintain himself against all
Lee's army. By unremitting efforts during the night of
the 2d, Sickles succeeded in recovering a part of the
ground and some of the guns which had been lost the day
before, but upon reporting to Hooker was surprised by
an order to fall back to Chancellorsville. Thus the key of
the military position was abandoned by the Federals, and
the Confederates seized it to unlock the door of success.
On the 3d, thirty Confederate guns were placed upon
the point of vantage and, covered as Lee's army was by
thick woods which concealed it from the opposing force,
it was no difficult matter to hold at bay the disorganized
Federals, who were unnerved by disaster, and disabled by
ignorance of the geography of the dense forest in which
they could never know anything about the magnitude of
the force they were to encounter.
Sickles was attacked by the old corps of Jackson, now
commanded by Stuart, the men crying out as they ad-
vanced: " Remember Jackson!" Stuart was singing, with
gleeful appreciation, "Old Joe Hooker, come out of the
wilderness." Sickles's men fought, as one of their officers
said, " like devils," but a flanking fire from the artillery on
the ground which they had relinquished that morning by the
order of the commanding general, and a furious front attack
