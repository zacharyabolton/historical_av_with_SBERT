DEDICATION.
To my husband, the noble leader of that band of heroes whose deeds
are sparkling jewels set in the history of the great Army of Northern Vir-
ginia, I would gladly inscribe this book — to him alone, to whom my life
has been dedicated; but remembering how often, in the humility of his
great soul, he has said, "I did not do it — my men did it all," I feel that
he would be better pleased to know that the brave men whom he led
through those four long, dark years have held a high place in my thought
as I have written. Hence —
To the men of Pickett's Division, who yet clasp hands with me in
the friendship that was cemented in blood to grow stronger through all
the passing years, and to the memory of those who have gone from our
sight to be ever present in our hearts and on the most glorious page of
our country's history, this volume is lovingly dedicated.
