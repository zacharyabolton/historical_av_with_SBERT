COLD HARBOR. 355
line, in which the Federals were repulsed. The forest was
so dense that artillery could not be used, but some guns
were placed along the lines of Kershaw, Pickett and Field
and did good service through the next day.
Night closed the contest of June i. Before morning
Grant had transferred his right to a point beyond Cold
Harbor road, and Lee had sent Hill and Breckenridge
to the defense of his right. Pickett's division was sta-
tioned, with the rest of the First Corps, between new and
old Cold Harbor. The troops of Breckenridge and Hill
extended to the Chickahominy. Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry
guarded the line between the Chickahominy and the
James. North of the First Corps and to its left was
Ewell's corps, commanded by Early. At the extreme
left was Heth's division. Over them the June sun poured
down floods of heat and around them surged heavy clouds
of dust as the troops marched over the field on the 2d
of June.
The afternoon of the 2d Lee ordered an assault
upon Grant's right, which was found to be so strongly
posted as to be invincible; whereupon Early erected de-
fenses and waited. At about five o'clock in the afternoon
a heavy fall of rain began, continuing into the night.
That night orders were issued by Grant for an assault all
along the line. About half past four the next morning,
Friday, a single gun to the left of the Federal line gave
the signal for the advance upon the Confederate position.
Through the rain of the gray dawn of June 3, a grand
assault was made along the whole six miles of the line.
The Confederate guns opened the counter-attack, and
were followed by the advance of Pickett's skirmishers,
in which Captain Campbell G. Lawson, of the Fifteenth
Virginia, was so badly wounded that he was never again
on a field of battle.
