THE FALL OF RICHMOND. 5

reconnoiter the Richmond roads and works. At the forti-
fications beyond the junction of the Osborne turnpike
and New Market road they were met by a flag of truce
waved from a dilapidated old-fashioned carriage drawn

parchment, shall I say? Yes, if I wish to preserve the
historic dignities, after the manner of my good friend,
Judge Lyons. Should I yield to the mandates of historic
truth, I should be compelled to state that it was a frag-

What of it? The chariot of state might be the wreck
of former grandeur, the horses might be the dimmest of
