rain of shells. Burnside captured forty-six guns, three
light batteries, and a large amount of stores. In the be-
ginning of 1864, Newbern was held by the Federal gen-
eral Foster, with a small force.
Pickett laid a plan for an attack upon Newbern which
was approved of and applauded by both Lee and Beaure-
gard, and was guarded with strictest secrecy.
On the 1st day of February, 1864, Hoke's and Cling-
man's North Carolina brigades and a part of Corse's Vir-
ginia brigade, with a battalion of Reid's artillery (the
Thirty-eighth Virginia), commanded by Pickett, set out
from Kinston on the Neuse River in North Carolina.
They were to threaten Newbern on the south side of the
Neuse River. On the north side of the Neuse there was
to be a demonstration by Bearing's cavalry and three
regiments of infantry. Matt. Ransom's North Carolina
brigade. Barton's and Terry's Virginia brigades, under
command of Barton, marched along the Trent River
to destroy the railroad to Morehead City, and were di-
rected to attack on the south side as soon as the Federals
should be diverted by the threatened assault of Pickett
and Bearing. Simultaneously with these movements,
Colonel R. Taylor Wood, with a naval force in small
boats, was to make a night excursion down the Neuse
River to Newbern and attack the gunboats.
The troops left Kinston just after nightfall in order
that they might make their appearance at the specified
points at daylight. They were buoyant and hopeful.
The start was excellent. Everything seemed propitious,
victory apparently smiling on the efforts of all.
Bearing's feint upon the north was successful in attract-
ing the attention of the Federals from the real objective
point. Colonel Wood effected a complete surprise, and cap-
tured the gunboat Underwriter under the guns of the forts.
