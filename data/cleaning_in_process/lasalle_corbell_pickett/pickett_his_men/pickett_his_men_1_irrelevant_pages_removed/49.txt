GEORGE JUNIOR'S FIRST GREENBACK. 2$
I did not know there was a witness to all my bitter-
ness till I heard a smothered chuckle and, looking up,
saw my husband and his friend, General Rufus Ingalls,

eral went out on deck. While I was peeping into the
basket "Mr. George junior" tore the note in two. I
caught the pieces and stuck my bonnet-pin through them
till I could paste them together. One of the officers
brought me some glue, and I cut a hundred-dollar Con-
