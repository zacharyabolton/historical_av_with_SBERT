GETTYSBURGâ€” SECOND DAY. 285
Longstreet to carry the position, while Ewell attacked the
high ground to the right. General Hill threatened the
center of the line.
Longstreet formed his line of battle, with Hood upon the
right and McLaws to the left, Anderson's division of Hill's
corps being on the left of McLaws. On an elevation to the

ing the importance of the hill on which he stood he per-
ceived at once that the Confederates had also appreciated
its value, and that it was the object of this gleaming array
of arms.
When the signal-ofificers on the crest of the hill saw
the advance they furled their flags and prepared to leave
