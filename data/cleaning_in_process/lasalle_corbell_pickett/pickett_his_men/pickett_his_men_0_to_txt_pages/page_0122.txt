94 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
The way to Mexico was opened on the 19th and 20th
of August by the battle of Contreras, in which our young
Second-Lieutenant Pickett received his first wound in the
service of his country. This experience, however, did not
prevent his doing good work at the battle of Churubusco,
he being in one of the two regiments which crossed the
Rio Churubusco and held the causeway which led to the
city. The historian says:
Breret-Major George Wright, Captains Bumford and Larkin Smith,
First Lieutenant and Adjutant James Longstreet, Second Lieutenants
James G. S. Snelling and George E. Pickett, of the Eighth Infantry,
were all distinguished at this point.
There is more than one name in that list of the glorious
old Eighth which will be seen again in the record of the
nation's history. The brevet which Lieutenant Pickett
received for distinguished gallantry at Contreras and
Churubusco must have had as much influence as the min-
istrations of the surgeons in healing all his wounds.
He was more fortunate in the battle of El Molino del
Rey from which, though he was one of the storming party
that Worth sent against the mill in this most bloody of
the battles of the Mexican war, he emerged without a
scratch. His brother lieutenant, J. G. S. Snelling, was
less happy, being severely wounded in the charge.
After this battle, which resulted in the complete rout
of the Mexican army, Santa Anna, to revive the sinking
spirits of his people, proclaimed that he had won a great
victory. This circumstance may serve to recall to the
mind of the reader of recent events the old adage, " His-
tory repeats itself."
East of Molino del Rey was a magnificent grove of
cypress trees planted by the kings away back in the days
of Aztec glory. Here Montezuma had his villa, Chapul-
