26 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
federate note in two to mend it with. Poor Confederate
money! —
* Representing nothing in God's earth now,
And naught in the waters below it;
As the pledge of a nation that passed away,
Keep it, dear friend, and show it.
Show it to those who will lend an ear
To a tale this trifle will tell —
Of Liberty born of a patriot's dream,
Of a storm-cradled nation that fell.
Too poor to possess the precious ores.
And too much of a stranger to borrow.
We issued to-day our promise to pay,
And hoped to redeem on the morrow.
The days rolled on, and weeks became years.
But our coffers were empty still;
Coin was so scarce that the treasury quaked
When a dollar should drop in the till.
But the faith that was in us was strong, indeed,
Though our poverty well we discerned;
And this little check represents the pay
That our suffering veterans earned.
They knew it had hardly a value in gold.
Yet as gold our soldiers received it;
It gazed in our eyes with a promise to pay,
And every true soldier believed«it.
But our boys thought little of price or pay,
Or of bills that were overdue —
We knew if it brought us our bread to-day
'Twas the best our poor country could do.
Keep it! It tells all our history over,
From the birth of our dream till its last;
Modest, and born of the angel Hope,
Like our visions of glory, it passed.
