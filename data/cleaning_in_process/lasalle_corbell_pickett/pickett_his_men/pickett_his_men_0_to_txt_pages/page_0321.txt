GETTYSBURG — SECOND DAY. ..gi
triumphant in the pride of never having been defeated in
a charge, reeled back, five hundred in number, never again
to be known to battle-field.
Brave Tigers, whose lines of life were but faintly illu-
mined by the light in which evolves that inborn inheritance
of all mankind, an undeveloped soul — under the influence
of a noble, grand and heroic purpose they displayed that
God-given greatness which commanded the admiration
and respect of both armies.
While the Tigers were making their daring and bril-
liant charge Johnson crossed Rock Creek and came
through the forest against the Union skirmishers, driving
them in. Under the heavy fire of Greene's and Wads-
worth's men, Johnson passed around to the right, and took
possession of the breastworks which had been constructed
with much labor and care and then vacated in the effort
to reinforce Sickles. After a fierce battle Johnson was
dislodged and passed through the woods in the rear and
almost reached the Baltimore road, coming within mus-
ket-range of the headquarters of General Slocum, the
commander of the Union right wing. Had Ewell known
the advantage he had gained he might have set the whole
Federal army in retreat.
Behind Round Top the Sixth Corps alone kept guard
through the long hours of the night, their gaze turned north-
ward, anxiously watching for the long dark line to loom up
heavily in the spectral moonlight. The radiance of that fair
July night lit no advancing columns, but only groups of
gray-clad men resting on their arms under the whispering
leaves of the forest of Rock Creek, and southward where
Round Top stood deeply silhouetted against a silvery back-
ground, a dark wall of soldiers standing at gaze, their bayo-
nets flashing back the rays of the moon, and their guns
glooming darkly against the glittering curtain of night.
