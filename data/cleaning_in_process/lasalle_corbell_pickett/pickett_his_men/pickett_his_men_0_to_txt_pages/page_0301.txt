GETTYSBURG â€” FIRST DAY. 27I
Heth called for the shoes to supply the needs of his
soldiers, and Pettigrew set out for Gettysburg to procure
them. Pettigrew did not find the shoes which he ex-
pected, but he did find two brigades of Buford's cavalry
which he did not expect, and, being unprepared for the
encounter, he fell back to Marsh Creek, half-way to Cash-
town.
Hill, supposing that merely a detachment of cavalry
was in Gettysburg, sent Heth and Pender of his division
on from Cashtown with battalions of artillery under
Pegram and Mcintosh, thus precipitating a battle with two
of Meade's corps whom Buford had summoned to his aid.
The little white village of Gettysburg nestled peace-
fully in the greenery between the two ridges on that early
July morning when the Army of Northern Virginia was
hastening to concentrate itself upon the little town.
The vapors of the recent rains yet hung in purple
glooms over the valley, and the morning sun, struggling
through, struck sharply against them and shattered them
into prismatic tints that shed a glory over the scene and
crowned the summit of South Mountain with a jeweled
circlet.
Before a storm all nature stands in hushed expectancy.
The winds sleep in their far-off caves of rest. The air is
motionless, and the earth breathes not. There is not the
faintest quivering in the leaves of the mighty forest. The
birds cower timidly, hidden away among the shady
branches, their wings folded, their voices hushed in ter-
ror. The clouds droop heavily over the earth and do not
seem to move. Earth and sea and sky, all trembling, wait.
So, in the silence of the night of the 30th of June, the
two armies concentrated their forces amid a hush un-
broken, in preparation for the mighty conflict that should
shake the continent.
