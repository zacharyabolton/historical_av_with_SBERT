THE FALL OF RICHMOND. Q
poor man who asked for help. He said that he was one
of "Pickett's men" — that he had come to the end of his
rope and had nothing to eat and nowhere to sleep. I
went back to my son's room to get some money, and
thought I smelled something burning. Opening the
door leading down into the basement just beneath my
son's room, a puff of smoke struck me in the face. Hur-
rying back to the porch where I had left the man stand-
ing, I sent him to the nearest drug-store to give the
alarm. The engines came in time, and for once, by what
seemed a mere accident, I escaped the fate which has fol-
lowed me with such unwavering persistence.
A flame of gas, lit by a careless servant, destroyed
the oil portrait of the General, given me by " Pickett's
men." It hung upon my wall, guarded on one side by the
beautiful Confederate flag presented to me by the " Phila-
delphia Brigade" and on the other by a handsome United
States flag, a treasured gift from my loved Southland.
The two banners for which so much blood and treas-
ure had been sacrificed were fastened together by a scarf
of Confederate gray and Union blue, the design of a deaf
and dumb boy, a son of one of Pickett's men, and met
above the pictured head of the soldier who had fought
so bravely under them both. When the flames were ex-
tinguished, the portrait was a charred ruin, and flags and
scarf were a heap of ashes on the floor.
Fire destroyed the first manuscript of the story of
Pickett and his men, in the preparation of which thirteen
years of labor had been spent. Let me hope that the
only fire» which will attach to my present effort to record
the history of those gallant soldiers is the long-ago-burnt-
out flames which surged over the unfortunate capital of
the Confederacy.
