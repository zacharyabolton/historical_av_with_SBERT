FORAGING EXPEDITIONâ€” SUFFOLK. 239
Captain Stribling was in no way responsible for the sacri-
fice of his men or the loss of his battery. He simply
obeyed the orders of his commander, General French.
On the 4th of May, General Longstreet, the old "War-
horse of the Confederacy," or "Old Peter," as he was
more commonly called, having successfully accomplished
the object of his maneuver, and secured quantities of
meat and grain even beyond his most sanguine expecta-
tions, quietly withdrew his whole force from Suffolk, So
stealthily was this done that our soldiers were across
Blackwater River before the Federal troops were aware
that we had gone.
Hood's division was hurried on from Blackwater River
by rail to rejoin Lee's army, who had just gained a vic-
tory at Chancellorsville. Pickett's division had orders
to follow, when information was brought that raiding cav-
alry was passing down the south side of James River en
route to Suffolk, and a peremptory order came to Pickett
to proceed by the Jerusalem plank road to Petersburg
with three brigades of his division and intercept the riders.
With that end in view the division, with the exception
of Jenkins's brigade which, much against General Pickett's
will, was left on the Blackwater River, marched to Peters-
burg. The report was false. There was no cavalry raid.
Pickett's division, without Jenkins's brigade, marched
through Petersburg and on to Richmond, to rejoin the
Army of Northern Virginia at Culpeper Court-house.
On the 1st of June, 1863, after four months of hard-
ship, marching all the way, going and coming, three
brigades of Pickett's division were on nearly the sam.e
ground they had left in the winter. Almost immediately
afterward they started on that disastrous Pennsylvania
campaign.
