266 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Early's bivouac, that leader failing to warn him of the
southward march. All unconscious of his proximity to
his friends, he moved on toward Carlisle, while Lee anx-
iously awaited his coming, hoping to capture Harrisburg
and offer determined battle at Cashtown.
At sunset the heads of the two armies, each ignorant
of the presence of the other, were close together. Twi-
light crept up softly from the distant forest and threw
her purple veil over the mountains which grew wraithlike
in its magic folds. The mists floated upward from the
streams that made rippling, silvery lines through the
grass-grown valley and quivered in changeful beauty in
the shimmering air. Night came gently down, radiant
with stars, fragrant with flower-laden breezes, musical
with sweet summer sounds, peaceful as sleep, but with
that solemn quietude with which sleep deepens into
death.
Such were the surroundings of the approaching armies.
