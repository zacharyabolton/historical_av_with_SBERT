manders and, with their approval, directed Butterfield to
prepare a detailed order for the withdrawal of the troops
if his apprehensions should be verified. Longstreet's
guns broke up the conference and called Meade to the de-
fense of his left.
Sickles had left his troops in charge of Birney and had
gone to the council in Meade's headquarters. When the
roar of the cannon called the chiefs back to their posts,
Meade followed Sickles, who was posted on ground that was
low and commanded by an elevation in its front, being
therefore untenable. He had applied for permission to
occupy more elevated ground half or three-quarters of a
mile in front. Receiving no order, and his outposts hav-

with Round Top and Hancock, technically carrying out
instructions. This weakened his line and presented too

certain as to whether this ground could be held, and sent
for reinforcements. Sickles proposed to fall back, but it
was too late. He was still further endangered by the re-
