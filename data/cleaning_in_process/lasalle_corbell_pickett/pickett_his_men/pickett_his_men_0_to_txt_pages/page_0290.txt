met the Federal cavalry led by Pleasanton near Aldie
and drove it back. The next day the attack was renewed
and, Pleasanton having been reinforced by infantry, Stuart
was compelled to retire, having taken about four hundred
prisoners and some horses and arms.
At this time the Confederates were outstretched

On June i8 Lee ordered his entire army to cross the
