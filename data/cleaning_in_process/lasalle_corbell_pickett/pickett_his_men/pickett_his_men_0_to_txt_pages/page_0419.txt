flank, which was quickly repulsed with considerable loss
to the enemy. Pickett had a short time before ridden to
the north side of Hatcher's Run and, hearing the sound
of battle, he galloped through a rain of fire and balls from
Crawford's troops on the Ford road.
Soon after he reached his command Colonel Pegram
of the artillery was mortally wounded, and fell near where
the General was standing reforming his line. Pegram
was shot from his horse by a sharpshooter just after the
charge had been repulsed, and fell in rear of two of his
guns.
A few minutes after this attack a terrific fire of mus-

to the left flank, while Sheridan's cavalry, mounted and
dismounted, was engaging the front and right. Warren
forced Ransom and Wallace back and doubled them on
Stuart's brigade of Pickett's division.
Hunton's brigade was withdrawn from the front,
moved double-quick to the left and thrown forward to
meet the attacking column, Pickett leading, cheering on
the men, waving the Confederate battle-flag. He dashed
up to Colonel Floweree, whose regiment was on the left.
Informing him of the situation of affairs, he said:

"I shall follow the moon, Marse George [meaning
he should go westward], and we'll save the day, if our
last man has to bite his daddy's dust. Youp boys are all
