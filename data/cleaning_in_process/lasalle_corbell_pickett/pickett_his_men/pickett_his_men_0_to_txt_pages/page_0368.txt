338 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
The authorities at Richmond giving no heed to Pick-
ett's warning, and taking no cognizance of his appeals in
behalf of Petersburg, he, in his desperation, sent a special
courier with a confidential letter to General Lee, who was
then on the Rapidan with the Army of Northern Virginia,
telling him of his unheeded repeated warnings and re-
quests, and of his fruitless interview with the Secretary of
War.
General Pickett pointed out to General Lee the ex-
treme danger to the Confederacy at that point and the
perils of further procrastination. General Lee, by return
courier, wrote as follows:
Consult at tmce with General Beauregard. I myself, General Pick-
ett, am in perfect sympathy with your apprehensions Will
despatch ofl&cer to Richmond to-night, urging immediate action upon
your request
R. E. Lee, General.
Beauregard was then in command around Charleston,
South Carolina. Without loss of time he and Pickett met
by appointment at Weldon, North Carolina. Pickett laid
before Beauregard the letter of General Lee, and explained
the actual critical condition of affairs, the absolute cer-
tainty of the immediate attack of the Federals on this
the most vulnerable approach to the capital of the Con-
federacy, and the inadequacy of any force which he had
at his command to repel such an attack.
Beauregard expressed himself at once as being in per-
fect unison of sentiment with Pickett, agreeing to the pro-
priety of all he said. He proffered his co-operation and
assistance, and promised to reinforce Pickett as speedily
as possible with whatever troops he could spare.
Upon Pickett's return to Petersburg he found that in
the face of all argument, in spite of all warning, the expe-
dition to Plymouth had been ordered forward.
