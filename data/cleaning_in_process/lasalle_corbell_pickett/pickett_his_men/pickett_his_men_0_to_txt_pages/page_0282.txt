can soil that he could never be uprooted, he made his
protestations of amity the cloak for every possible device
against the administration party. He strove to induce
other powers to join him in plots against the North, not
from any friendship for the South, but with the design, as
he expressed it to one of his confidants, of "restoring to
the Latin race on the other side of the ocean its force and
prestige." Should the South be successful, he hoped that
Louisiana and Texas, at least, might fall an easy prey into
his hands, thereby furnishing him with a territory larger
than all France, upon which he might experiment with his
scheme for Latin restoration.
Let the tide of war roll from the South to the North,
and foreign alliances would be made, loans would be
secured in London and Paris, supplies would be sent from
European ports, a fleet might be fitted out in foreign
waters for raising the blockade.
While the foreign assistance which might be expected
in the event of a successful aggressive movement was a
strong incentive to bold action, the situation in the North
seemed to indicate that such success would not be very
difficult of attainment. From the beginning of the war
the Northern States had been permeated with a Southern
element. Not all the friends of the South breathed the
magnolia-scented atmosphere of the sunny clime. They
flourished as vigorously, and almost as helpfully, in the
steely frosts of the North as in the pearly dews of the
South.
This element had been greatly strengthened by recent
events. The fatality which seemed to have followed with
the faithfulness of an echo the tramp, tramp, tramp of the
Northern army had encouraged the Southern sympathizers
and added to their number, while it had in like measure
disheartened and weakened the supporters of the North.
