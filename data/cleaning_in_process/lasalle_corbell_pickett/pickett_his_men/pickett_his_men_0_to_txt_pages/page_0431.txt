SAILOR'S CREEK. 40 1
To describe the sufferings of the march on to Amelia
Court-house and thence to Sailor's Creek would be to
paint a picture of the darkest horror. The army supplies
were utterly exhausted. There was no food to be had in
the country. All the homes along the line had been
stripped by those who had come in advance. There was
nothing to eat but a little parched corn when they stopped
long enough to parch it. This they shelled from the ear
as they marched along. Many of the men, overcome by
fatigue and suffering, loss of sleep and hunger, succumbed
by the way, and others found themselves going to sleep
as they walked along and would stumble and fall in the
road. Now and then they made a halt for a skirmish
with the enemy, who were on all sides, front, rear and both
flanks. Time and again during the forty-eight hours they
were forced to halt and not only draw up in line of battle,
but form a hollow square to prevent capture.
The tortures of the march were intensified by the fact
that it led through a country in which lived the families
and friends of many of these soldiers who were marching
on to death, imprisonment, or to the humiliation of de-
feat. Yet, notwithstanding the fact that they were within
a few hours of their homes and loved ones, whom they
had not seen, many of them for months and many for
years, there was but little straggling.
Although it was not safe to stray faf from the com-
mand on account of the enemy's cavalry, yet now and
then some one of these starving heroes, impelled by the
pangs of hunger, would venture off in a vain search for
food, only to fall from weakness by the wayside.
All the sufferings, privations, and hardships of the four
preceding years put together would not equal those en-
dured on this march to Amelia Court-house, yet they went
bravely on, sustained by the hope that food awaited them
