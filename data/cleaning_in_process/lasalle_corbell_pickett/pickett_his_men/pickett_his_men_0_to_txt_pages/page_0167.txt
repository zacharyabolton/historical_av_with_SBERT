CHAPTER XVIII.
SECESSION.
The victims of a lost cause are not alone those who
go down in its wreck. Perhaps its saddest victims are its
precursors â€” those who have marked out the pathway to
the field on which the great battle is to be fought and
lost.
Thus it was with many who led the way to the final
adjustment of the long-disputed question of States'
rights, a quarrel which had begun away back in the
beginning of constitutional history. When Hamilton
and Jefferson separated on the question of centralization
of power, they laid out a long and circuitous route to a
tragic ending of the dispute which began with the failure
of the Articles of Confederation and led up to the dra-
matic exit of the Southern members from the halls of
Congress, more than half a century later
Article II. in the "Articles of Confederation" stipu-
lated that, "Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom
and independence."
Article III. specified that, "The said States hereby
severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each
other."
The great advocate of Federalism, Alexander Hamil-
ton, was among the first to appreciate the advantage which
the State government possessed in the affections of the
people. He perceived that in a clash of State with
national interests, the State interests would receive the
support of the people.
