CHAPTER II.
ANXIETY, SUSPENSE, LONELINESS.
The fire revealed many things which I would like
never to have seen and, having seen, would fain forget.
One of the most revolting sights was the amount of
provisions and shoes and clothing which had been accu-
mulated by the speculators who hovered like vultures
over the scene of death and desolation. Taking advan-
tage of their possession of money and their lack of both
patriotism and humanity, they had, by an early corner in
the market and by successful blockade-running, bought
up all the available supplies with an eye to future gain,
while our soldiers and women and children were abso-
lutely in rags and barefoot and starving.
Not even war, with its horrors and helplessness, can
divert such harpies from their accustomed methods of
accumulating wealth at the expense of those of their fel-
low men who have spent their lives in less self-seeking
ways.
All my own little store was a small quantity of flour
and meal and a bag of beans; no salt even to season them;
and I an officer's wife. How much worse it must have
been for those less favored than I.
The General had left me in Richmond when he went
away to fight the battle of Five Forks, telling me to stay
until he returned or sent for me. " I shall surely comcf"
he said. So, like Casablanca, I waited, and not even "the
flames that lit the battle's wreck " should frighten me
away.
