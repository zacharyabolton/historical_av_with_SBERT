He led Pickett's brigade for a time at Gaines's Mill
when its commander was compelled by his wound to leave
the field. Colonel Hunton being too ill to retain the com-
mand, it devolved upon Colonel John B. Strange, of the
Nineteenth Regiment. At Frazier's Farm, Colonel Hun-
ton gave the order to charge, but as he was too weak from
illness to keep up with the command it again fell to the
direction of Colonel Strange, who led it with great ability.
Colonel Strange was killed at South Mountain.
Colonel Hunton was promoted brigadier-general in
1863. He was among those who were so unfortunate as
to be captured at Sailor's Creek, the last chapter in the
history of Pickett's division.
From 1872 until 1881, Colonel Hunton was a member
of the United States Congress, and served upon the Elec-
toral Commission.
