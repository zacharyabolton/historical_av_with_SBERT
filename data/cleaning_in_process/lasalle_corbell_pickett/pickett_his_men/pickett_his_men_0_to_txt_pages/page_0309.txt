GETTYSBURG â€” FIRST DAY. 279
Encouraged by the successful issue of the engagement of the first
day, and in view of the valuable results that would ensue from the defeat
of the army of General Meade, it was thought advisable to renew the
attack.
At five o'clock the Federals, under the skilful manage-
ment of Hancock, were strongly posted on Cemetery Hill,
and held Gulp's Hill. Sickles and Birney were coming up
the Emmitsburg road with troops yet unworn by the
fatigue of battle. A little later Slocum arrived from
Taneytown with the Twelfth Corps, and to him Hancock
turned over the command.
