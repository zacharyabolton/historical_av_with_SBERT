140 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Under the Articles of Confederation the States had
shown more disposition to take back the powers which
had been delegated to the general government than to
give up any that might remain.
The State was the mother of the people; the general
government was an unsympathetic, overbearing master.
The bond between the State and the individual had
become a fixed habit of affection. To rend the State
government would be the act of a matricide; it would
even be self-destruction. Should the general government
fall to pieces in some sudden political earthquake life
would, according to the popular view, go on much the
same as it had always done.
In certain large affairs of life the people looked to the
national government â€” in the small things of every-day
existence they looked to the State. The small things are
what make up life. Large events occur once or twice in
a lifetime; small ones happen every day.
The people paid taxes to the State; in return therefor
they shared in the institutions which were supported by
those taxes. They constructed and repaired roads for the
State; they walked and drove over those roads. They
supported schools for the State; their children reaped the
advantages of those schools. They elected the law-
makers of the State; they looked to the State laws for
protection. The State officers were their fellow-citizens,
some of them near and dear friends. In them they felt
a much stronger personal interest than in the President
and Cabinet, too far away to seem to hold any connection
with the mass of the people.
One of the delegates to the Federal Convention had
expressed his opinion that the people would be rather
more attached to the national government, as being more
important in itself, and more flattering to their pride.
