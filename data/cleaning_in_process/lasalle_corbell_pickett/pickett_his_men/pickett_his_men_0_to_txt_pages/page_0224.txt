196 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Franklin's corps was ordered to pass through Cramp-
ton's Gap and attack McLaws, thereby relieving Harper's
Ferry, while Burnside, with the commands of Reno and
Hooker were sent to Turner's Gap, the second of the two
principal roads through the South Mountain. A North-

rear, but the darkness prevented objects from being dis-

was ordered to bring off his brigade. He had been in
command only a few days.
In his report Garnett says: "We have to mourn in
this action many of our companions as killed and
wounded, who go to swell the list of noble martyrs who
