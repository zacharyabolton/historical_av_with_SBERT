176 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
the valley of the Shenandoah toward Washington, attract-
ing the attention of the Federal forces to that quarter,
while he secretly instructed Jackson to co-operate with
him upon McClellan's right flank.
Two hours before daybreak on the 26th of June,
Pickett's brigade was ordered out of its cantonments on
the Williamsburg road, and before daylight was on the
Mechanicsville turnpike leading northward out of Rich-
mond. In the afternoon of the same day General A. P.
Hill's division set in motion Lee's plan of attack upon
McClellan, crossing the Chickahominy by the Meadow
Bridge road and Mechanicsville turnpike, and capturing
by sundown McClellan's right position at Mechanicsville.
That evening Pickett's brigade crossed the Chicka-
hominy and bivouacked on their arms in front of Mechan-
icsville. Between half past two and three o'clock next
morning the attack was recommenced. General Lee driv-
ing the Federals before him till he reached Ellyson's
Mill, a strongly fortified point, which Lee carried with
considerable loss.
McClellan then continued his retreat, burning and de-
stroying everything of any value that could not be carried
away, until he reached Watts's Farm, a wonderful natural,
as well as improved, stronghold, known also by the names
of Gaines's Mill and Cold Harbor. There was fought the
greatest battle of the war up to that time â€” the battle of
Gaines's Mill, so called because a mill of that name was
near the central point of attack.
The great stage-painter. Nature, had never arranged
a more picturesque scene for a battle than that which
was set for Gaines's Mill, one of the most awful contests
of the Civil War. It was an undulating plain, gracefully
rising into gentle swells, crowned by dense growths of
trees.
