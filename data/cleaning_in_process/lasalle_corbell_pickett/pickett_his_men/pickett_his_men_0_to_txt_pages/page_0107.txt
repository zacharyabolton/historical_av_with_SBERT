BORN WITH EMERALDSâ€” NEMO NOCETUR. 83
"You have the Continental pronunciation, I see."
He gave me several sentences to translate; then an ode
from Horace and some selections from Catullus and
Tibullus. By this time the pupils were silent, and Miss
Mcintosh's expression was changed.
He then asked me to wj^ite and parse a sentence, which
I did, saying sotto voce as he took the chalk from me:
"That was a catch question."
" Please translate and parse this," said he, without
noticing my aside, and he wrote in Latin, "The President
of the United States said ' nobody is hurt ' "
" Before he wrote any further, instead of translating, I
looked up at him and said:
" But, oh, sir! somebody was hurt."
Quickly he cleared the board, put down the cloth,
wiped his hands, turned his face to me and offering his
hand, said, not to my surprise, because I had faith in
prayer, but rather to that of Miss Mcintosh and the
young ladies:
" I will engage you, Mrs. Edwards, and will be respcm-
sible for you."
We then went down to the parlor, and I gave him the
names of the only friends I had in Montreal of whom he
could make inquiries regarding me. The next day I gave
my first lesson to the class. I became very fond of them
all and, after my embarrassment of the first few days, got
along very well with them.
The General was very curious to know where I went
every day, but, knowing it gave me great pleasure to be
thus mysterious, humored me and asked no questions.
My first month's salary was spent in part payment on
an overcoat for him, and only Our Father and the angels
know what joy filled my heart, that with the work of my
hands I could give him comfort. Theii my secret was out.
