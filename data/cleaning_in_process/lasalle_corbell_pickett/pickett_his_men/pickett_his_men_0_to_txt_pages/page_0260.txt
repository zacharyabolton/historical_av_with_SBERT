230 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
by a number of Americans, in testimony of their apprecia-
tion of the gallant sons of Erin, but had failed to arrive
in time for the battle. Meagher, however, would not
permit his men to go into action unguarded by the color
sacred to their own dear Emerald Isle, so he placed in his
own cap a sprig of evergreen and each man followed his
example.
In the attack of Howard's division the Confederate
commander. General Cobb, was killed. At the same time
General Cooke was seriously wounded. Ransom's brigade
came to the relief of Cooke's; McLaws sent Kershaw to
the assistance of Cobb's troojDS. Pickett and the troops
posted at the south angle of Marye's Hill were keeping
up a lively fire with Sturgis and Getty, who were also sub-
jected to a cross-fire from Hood and McLaws.
The battle which had been practically won weeks be-
fore when Longstreet first posted his men on Marye's
Hill was now dedicated to the Confederates by a chrism
of fire, but Burnside would not believe it. From beyond
the river he viewed the contest, ignorant of the ground,
knowing nothing of the insurmountable obstacles to a
successful attack on the height, and unv/illing to believe
what was told him by those who had survived the attempt,
saying to Hooker: "That crest must be carried to-
night." Hooker knew that it was impossible, and Han-
cock, French and the other officers, including the fiery
Sumner, agreed with him, but Burnside had determined
upon another assault, and was immovable.
For the first time in his military career " Plighting Joe"
was averse to living up to the soubriquet which he had
won by gallant deeds on the field. Resolved upon saving
his men, if possible, and at least throwing off the responsi-
bility for their sacrifice, he adopted the strong measure of
making a personal appeal to the commander of the Army
