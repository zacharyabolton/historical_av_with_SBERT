and thousands of other brave ones marched to death the
daisies were blossoming in a great white sea. As I looked
they seemed to fall, crushed under the rush of martial
feet, and through the mists of a quarter century I saw
that long line moving forward in the wondrous charge of
which the poet has written:
WHEN PICKETT CHARGED AT GETTYSBURG.*
When Pickett charged at Gettysburg,
For three long days with carnage fraught,
Two hundred thousand men had fought;
And courage could not gain the field,
Where stubborn valor would not yield.
With Meade on Cemetery Hill,
And mighty Lee thundering still
Upon the ridge a mile away;
Four hundred guns in counterplay
Their deadly thunderbolts had hurled —
The cannon duel of the world —
When Pickett charged at Gettysburg.
When Pickett charged at Gettysburg,
Dread war had never known such need
Of some o'ermastering, valiant deed;
And never yet had cause so large
Hung on the fate of one brief charge.
To break the center, but a chance;
With Pickett waiting to advance:
It seemed a crime to bid him go,
And Longstreet said not "Yes" nor "No,"
But silently he bowed his head.
"I shall go forward!" Pickett said.
Then Pickett charged at Gettysburg,
