no PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Mr. Benton, in a speech in the Senate in favor of
the treaty, mentioned the slight deflection of the line
with the object of avoiding the cutting of the south
end of Vancouver's Island. Again he spoke of the line
through the Channel de Haro, and stated that it pre-
served for the United States that cluster of islands be-
tween the Channel de Haro and the continent. Even Mr.
Crampton, the British minister, did not claim that Rosario
was the channel meant, but thought that it must refer to
Vancouver's Channel, erroneously supposing it to be the
only one answering the description which had up to that
time been surveyed and used.
It is a noticeable fact that the Strait of Rosario did
not appear upon any map, south of the forty-ninth paral-
lel, until it was needed by the British government to cut
off a piece of somebody else's land, when it was hastily
moved southward and dated back to a period antedating
the treaty.
