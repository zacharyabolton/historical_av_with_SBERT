CHAPTER XXXIX.
NEWBERN.
Newbern, North Carolina, was held by the Federals, and
was reported to General Pickett as being weak in its de-
fenses and protected by a small force. It was a place of
storage, and its alleged stock of provisions and clothing
was a most tempting bait for our nearly naked, barefooted,
famished soldiers.
" Newbern " is the modern form of New Berne, so
named in the latter part of the seventeenth century by its
founder, Christopher, Baron de Graffenried, in memory of
his former home, Berne, Switzerland.
In its early infancy Newbern had been baptized in
blood, and its sinister beginning seemed to have ushered
it into a career of turbulence, occasioned more by its
location than by any consequence attaching to it from
size or other characteristic adapted to attract attention.
Its position as an important seaport of the Confederacy
early rendered it an object of desire to the enemy.
It is near the corjfluence of the Neuse and the Trent,
and the only two roads by which it may be reached by
land lie through an almost impassable swamp. There was
once a railroad from Newbern to Kinston and Goldsboro,
passing through the marshy ground, but it had been de-
stroyed.
On March 14, 1862, Burnside advanced upon Newbern,
destroying a fortification of little value in the vicinity,
and capturing and partially burning the town, being sup-
ported by gunboats which cleared the way by a heavy
