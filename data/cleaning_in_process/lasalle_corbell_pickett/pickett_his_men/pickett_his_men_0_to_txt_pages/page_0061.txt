CARPET-BAG, BASKET AND BABY. 37
" No; never mind. It is all right. Only register your
name. I /emember you did come on board just as the
whistle blew; but was there not another passenger who
came on with you â€” a gentleman?"
" Yes, sir," I said. " It was my precious father, and he
went back home on the little sail-boat."
There must have been something to excite suspicion
in the way I wrote my name, or else in my m.anner. I
boldly wrote out my given name, and then as I started to
write my last name, I looked all around me, confused,
and changed the letter "P" to "C," writing " Corbell."
Then I began to erase " Corbell " and write " Phillips," the
name in my oath of allegiance. While there was really
nothing very false in what I did, I felt guilty and was
frightened, for I had been brought up to be strictly truth-
ful, and to keep faithfully even the word of promise.
I had not been long in the saloon when baby became
restless and fretful. I was impatiently awaiting the com-
ing of the captain, whom I had sent for, when a man ap-
peared. He had short, curly hair, deep, heavy eyebrows,
eyes sunken and close together, as if they had to be
focused by his big, hooked nose or they would not be
able to see. He was chewing alternately one end of his
crinkly moustache and one side of his thick, red lip, and
was making a sucking noise with his tongue, as he said:
"Madam, you sent for the captain of the boat, I be-
lieve."
"Yes, sir."
"What do you wish?"
" I want you to be kind enough to get my ticket and
stateroom, please. My father had not time to see after
me. He barely had time to put me on board."
"Certainly; with pleasure. You stop in Baltimore
long?"
