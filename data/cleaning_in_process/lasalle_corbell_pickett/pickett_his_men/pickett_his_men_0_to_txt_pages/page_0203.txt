CHAPTER XXI.
GAINES'S MILL.
Lee's army on June 25, 1862, received orders to cook
three days' rations, draw eighty rounds of ammunition,
and be ready to march at sound of the bugle.
Richmond at that time had but few, and very imper-
fect, fortifications. The Federals had already sent up two
of their gunboats as far as Drury's Bluff and, though
they had been repulsed, great fear for the safety of the
city was felt by all. Congress, then in session, was dis-
cussing the propriety of its evacuation.
Consequently, the success of the Confederates in the
battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines, though not so
brilliant as some subsequent ones, was of great moment
to them, not only in its moral effect, but in preventing
McClellan's immediate approach to Richmond.
Pickett's brigade was increased after these battles by
Colonel William D. Stuart's Fifty-sixth Virginia Regi-
ment, temporarily commanded by its lieutenant-colonel,
Peyton Slaughter. The regiment was greatly depleted in
numbers, having belonged to the Army of the West, and
been cut up at Fort Donelson.
General Joseph E. Johnston was severely wounded in
the battle of Seven Pines, and General Robert E. Lee
for the first time personally assumed command of the
army.
Anxiety was felt for the safety of Richmond. Mc-
Clellan was threatening it from the north side of the
Chickahominy. Lee's plan was to send Jackson down
