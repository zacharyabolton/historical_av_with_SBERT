12 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
implored me not to listen to or credit any rumors to the
contrary, and urged me in an added line to be brave and
of good cheer — to keep up a " skookum tum-tum." This
letter was brought to me by Jaccheri, a daring, fearless
Italian in my husband's employ as a headquarters post-

As I said before, our people were on the verge of star-
vation. The army had been living on rations of corn and
beans, with *' seasonings " of meat, for weeks before we left
camp. A rat even had been considered a bojine bouche
for months past. The game had been trapped and killed
throughout the whole country, and my breakfast that

no salt; for salt had been a luxury for a long time in the
Confederacy. All the old smokehouses had been moved,
that the earth might be dug up and boiled down to get
the salt which in the many years it had absorbed.

had just brought up my beans and was lovingly coaxing
me to eat them when Jaccheri came. A plate wis filled
for Jaccheri, and after he had finished his meager break-
fast, seasoned with his adventures in getting to me, swim-
ming the river at one place with his clothes tied up in a
bundle on his head, etc., he said he must go. I added a
few lines to my diary of all my acts, which I always kept
for the General, and gave it to our faithful letter-carrier
to take back to him.
"Ina da days to come," said Jaccheri, in his soft Ital-
ian voice, "ina all landa, no matter, mucha people —
mucha gloly, nadia money, no matter, you find Jaccheri
