The roads and streams were almost impassable, but
Pickett's indefatigable men without a murmur moved on

Forks. Upon the examination of this officer, he let out

fifteen thousand strong, supported by a heavy infantry
force, was at or near Dinwiddie Court-house.
Lee did not give much credence to the statements
