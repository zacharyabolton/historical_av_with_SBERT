GAINES'S MILL. 179

eenth Regiments from the right of his line, and advanced
with them in person to rout them from that point. At
this time there was no appearance or sign of the enemy

and Robert E. Withers, the sudden puffs of smoke and
simultaneous sharp rifle-cracks from the field of oats and
sedge revealed to him that the enemy were not only con-
cealed there, but were watching and were cognizant of his
every movement.
Pickett had temporarily charged Colonel Walter Har-
rison, whom he had ordered to remain behind with the
three regiments, to execute at once the order of the com-
manding general, should the signal to advance come be-
