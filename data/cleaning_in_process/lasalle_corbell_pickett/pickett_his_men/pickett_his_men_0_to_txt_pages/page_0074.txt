50 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
cents. It was all I could afford to pay for dinner, but
as I looked at the tray when it was brought to me, I
thought, "How cheap things must be in New York,"
for there was soup and fish — a kind of yellow fish I had
never seen before, salmon, I afterward learned it was —
stewed with green peas, a bird, some asparagus and pota-
toes, ice-cream, a cup of coffee and a glass of sherry.
Upon his insisting that perhaps it would be restful to
the baby, I let him hold it while I ate my dinner, I did
not know how hungry I was, nor how much I was in need
of nourishment. Baby immediately became quiet in his
arms. Whether it was the change or not, I do not know,
but in a little while he was fast asleep. I covered him up
with the shawl to which the gentleman pointed, finished
eating my delicious dinner, taking my time and enjoying
it, while he read his book and held my baby. When the
servant came and took away the tray, I arose and, thank-
ing the stranger for his kindness, said:
" I will take the baby now, if you please. "
" If you would rather," he said, " yes, but I think he will
be more comfortable with me for awhile. Then, too, you
might awaken him if you moved him. Let me hold him
while you rest. Here is a sweet little book, if you would
like to read it. I think, however, it would be better for you
tdrest; to sleep, if you could. You look really fagged out."
The book he gave me was a child's book — it may have
been "Fern Leaves." I can't remember the name, but
written on the fly-leaf, in a child's irregular hand, were
these words:
For my dear darly popsy who is gon to fite the war fum his little
