302 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Pickett gave orders to his brigade commanders and
rode along down the line, his men springing to their feet
with a shout of delight as he told them what was expected
of them.
He was sitting on his horse when Wilcox rode up.
Taking a flask from his pocket, Wilcox said:
" Pickett, take a drink with me. In an hour you'll be
in hell or glory."
Pickett declined to drink, saying:
" I promised the little girl who is waiting and praying
for me down in Virginia that I would keep fresh upon my
lips until we should meet again the breath of the violets
she gave me when we parted. Whatever my fate, Wilcox,
I shall try to do my duty like a man, and I hope that, by
that little girl's prayers, I shall to-day reach either glory
or glory."
At a quarter past three on that bright afternoon the
order " Forward! " rang along the lines. The supreme mo-
ment had come. As far as the eye could reach, up and
down on each side, the gaze of thousands of men of both
armies was riveted on a long line of soldiers moving with
all the precision of a grand review. The five thousand
Virginians had begun their march to death.
Longstreet joined Alexander, and they stood together
by the batteries when that magnificent column went by,
the officers saluting as they passed.
Pickett led, mounted on his spirited charger, gallant and
graceful as a knight of chivalry riding to a tournament.
His long dark, auburn-tinted hair floated backward in the
wind like a soft veil as he went on down the slope of
death.
Then came Trimble, riding lightly as he might have
ridden in the golden glow through the rose-scented air of
some brilliant festal morning.
