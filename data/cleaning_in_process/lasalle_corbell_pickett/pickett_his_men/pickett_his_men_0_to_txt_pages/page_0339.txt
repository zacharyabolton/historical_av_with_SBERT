GETTYSBURG— THIRD DAY. 3O9
our hearts and on the fame-crowned pages of their coun-
try's history.
Virginia is rich in the names of great warriors, states-
men and leaders of men, but the charge of this Virginia
division furnishes the most conspicuous proof in the his-
tory of the State that the rank and file of its citizen
soldiery are the peers of any troops on earth, and the
memory of this band of martyrs will be cherished in the
hearts of her people forever and forever. With such fol-
lowers Virginia will never be without great leaders. It
was fitting that in the descendants of the great sons of
Virginia, who had led in all that had contributed to Ameri-
can grandeur, this consummation of chivalrous manhood
should be attained.
The battle-flag of the Confederacy had waved for a
moment in triumph to droop forever around its staff. To
the South was left the bitter sense of loss, the heartbreak
of defeat.
She had left, too, a memory which is enshrined forever
in the proudest and grandest niche of her temple of fame,
a glorified page of history to thrill the heart of the world
while time lingers.
It is the page on which is inscribed the grandest charge
known in all the long and proud record of martial history;
a charge which will live in song and story while the heart
of man can throb responsive to immortal deeds; a charge
which can never be obliterated from the roll of fame be-
cause, in the changed conditions of warfare, it can never
be repeated or equaled; that transcendent charge which
awakened echoes to roll through the halls of time and to
incite to actions of supernal glory heroes of coming ages
— Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.
