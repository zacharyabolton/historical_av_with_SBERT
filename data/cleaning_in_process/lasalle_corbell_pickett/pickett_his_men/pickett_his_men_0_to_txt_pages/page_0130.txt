ests and her pride, and in 1800 was quite ready to accept
the offer of the King of Spain to exchange Louisiana for
Tuscany, in order to secure a bridal present for his daughter;
who, having married too small a fraction of the earth for
a royal potato-patch, must be provided with a piece of

the English, Napoleon, in 1803, sold the territory to the
United States, who, by this purchase, acquired all that

Utrecht fixed the limit of the French possessions at that

possessions west of the Mississippi, Spain had constantly
aflfirmed her title up to fifty-four forty. Subsequently she
conveyed to France all her claim to the forty-ninth paral-

by France. In 1814 a new commercial treaty was made
between Great Britain and Spain, reaffirming the Nootka
treaty, which was a virtual concession by Great Britain
of the claim of Spain to fifty-four fort)^ Anything that
Spain owned beyond this was ceded to the United States
by the Florida treaty of 1819, which transferred all the
Spanish possessions north of forty-two.
These transactions left the question of boundary which

Russia and the United States, Russia's claim being based
on the discoveries of Bering. Later Russia put forth a
