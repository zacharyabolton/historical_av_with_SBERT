CHAPTER VIII.
ONE WOMAN REDEEMED THEM ALL.
My attention was attracted by a man in close con-
versation with the conductor. I was evidently the object
of it, for they would look carefully over the paper they
held and then at me, as if comparing me with something
therein described. Had I been a hardened criminal, they
would probably not have taken the risk of thus warning
me of the fact that I was under suspicion. As my ap-
pearance would seem to indicate that, if a law-breaker, I
was a mere tyro in vice, they supposed they could safely
take notes of me. I was absolutely sure that I was the
subject of the conversation, and trembled with a pre-
sentiment of coming evil. I tried in vain to turn my
face toward the window, but my eyes seemed fascinated.
A thousand preposterous fears passed in review through
my mind, though the real one never suggested itself. I
endeavored to dispel them each in turn, arguing that the
scrutiny of the men foreboded nothing, because I seemed
an object of curiosity to everybody, and now, as I recall
my appearance, I don't wonder, for I was very odd-looking.
In the first place, I was dressed so quaintly and looked
so entirely unlike those around me, and was all uncon-
scious of any peculiarity or deficiency in my apparel â€”
being garmented in my very best, the traveling-gown,
etc., in which I had been married, and which had been
bought and made under such difficulties, and kept after-
ward with such scrupulous care. So I was perfectly well
satisfied with myself.
