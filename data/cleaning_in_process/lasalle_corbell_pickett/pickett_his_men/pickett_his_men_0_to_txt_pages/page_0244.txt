out, never again to inspire his gallant warriors by his pres-
ence on the field. He was afterward placed in command
of the forces at Richmond, where he did good service,
and in 1864 was promoted major-general.
After the war, he most ably served the State of Vir-
ginia as governor, and won in civic life laurels no less un-
fading than he had gained in war.
Brigadier-General Montgomery D. Corse was a native
of Alexandria, Virginia, and a graduate of a military school.
In 1846, he was elected captain of volunteers, and
served in the war with Mexico. After the close of the
war, he spent some years in California, and was captain of
the Sutter Rifles in Sacramento. In i860, he organized
the Old Dominion Rifles of Alexandria, and a battalion of
volunteers, of which he was major. The infantry com-
panies of this battalion were afterwards a part of the cele-
brated Seventeenth Regiment of Virginia infantry, and
Major Corse was made its colonel, leading it with distinc-
tion at Manassas and the battles in that vicinity.
He commanded Kemper's regiment in the second
battle of Manassas, where he was slightly wounded. He
was wounded while leading his regiment at Boonsboro,
and again at Antietam, where he went into battle with
fifty-six men and came out with seven.
On November i, 1862, Colonel Corse was commissioned
brigadier-general, and for a time was in command of
Pickett's brigade. Soon after he was assigned to a new
brigade made up of the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, Thirtieth
and Thirty-second Virginia regiments, afterward includ-
ing the Twenty-ninth Virginia. It served with Pickett's
division throughout the war, but being, unfortunately,
detached from it and left at Hanover Junction in the
campaign of 1863, the division was deprived of its assist-
ance at Gettysburg.
