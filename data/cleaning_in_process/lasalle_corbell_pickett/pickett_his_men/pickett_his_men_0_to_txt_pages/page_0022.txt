XU INTRODUCTION.
States, fought as fierce battles as ever their warrior hus-
bands waged, for in the silent passages of the heart many
severer battles are waged than were ever fought at Get-
tysburg.
George E. Pickett's greatest battle was really at Five
Forks, April i, 1865, where his plans and operations were
masterful and skilful, and if they had been executed as
he designed them, there might have been no Appomat-
tox, and despite the disparity of overwhelming numbers,
a brilliant victory would have been his, if reinforcements
which he had every reason to expect had opportunely
reached him; but they were not ordered in season and
did not join the hard-pressed Pickett until night, when
his position had long since been attacked by vastly su-
perior numbers with repeating rifles.
He was of an open, frank and genial temperament, but
he felt very keenly the distressing calamities entailed
upon his beloved Sunny South by the results of the war,
yet with the characteristic fortitude of a soldier, he bowed
with resignation to the inevitable, gracefully accepted the
situation, recognized the duty of the unfortunate to ac-
cept the results in no querulous spirit, and felt his obliga-
tion to share its effects.
No word of blame, or censure even, of his superior oflfi-
cers ever escaped Pickett's lips, but he nevertheless felt
profoundly the sacrifice of his gallant soldiers whom he
so loved. At Five Forks he had a desperate but a fight-
ing chance, and if any soldier could have snatched victory
from defeat, it was the intrepid Pickett, and it was cruel
to leave that brilliant and heroic leader and his Spartan
band to the same hard straits they so nobly met at Gettys-
burg. At Five Forks Pickett lost more men in thirty
minutes than we lost, all told, in the recent Spanish-
American war from bullets, wounds, sickness or any
