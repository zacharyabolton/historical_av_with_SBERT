PENNSYLVANIA CAMPAIGN. 26 1
know that a battle was fought at Gettysburg on the ist of
July.
Lee had consented to his making this ride, expecting
that Stuart would be able to return by the time his serv-
ices were needed. He was the ideal cavalry leader, bold,
dashing and ardent, impetuous of heart, and zealous in the
cause for which he fought, and Lee's army was indeed
blind and deaf without his sleepless vigilance. But
for the absence of such information as the cavalry could
have obtained for him in his northern invasion, who
knows what changes might have been wrought in the map
of the western hemisphere?
Hooker crossed the Potomac at Edwards's Ferry on
the 25th and 26th, and marched directly upon Frederick,
Maryland. Here he intended to send the Twelfth Corps
(Slocum's) through the South Mountain passes to the west-
ward to join eleven thousand troops under General French
at Harper's Ferry, and attack Lee's rear, interrupting com-
munications, capturing trains, and exposing him to a gen-
eral attack. Halleck would not allow the troops to be
taken from Harper's Ferry, saying that Maryland Heights
must be held "as the key to Maryland." Hooker said
that it was useless to hold the key " now that the door
had been smashed in," and tendered his resignation, thus
snapping the already severely strained relations existing
between himself and the authorities at Washington. On
the 27th he was relieved from command. Assistant
Adjutant-General James A. Hardie was sent by special
train with the double order â€” one relieving Hooker, the
other appointing General George G. Meade to the com-
mand of the Army of the Potomac, Thus the star of
Hooker went down at Chancellorsville, to remain in
eclipse until it rose again above the clouds of Lookout
Mountain.
