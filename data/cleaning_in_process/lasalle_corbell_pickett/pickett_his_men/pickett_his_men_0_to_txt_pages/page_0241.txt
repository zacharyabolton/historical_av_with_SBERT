PICKETT'S GENERALS. 21 3
leading his brigade at Gettysburg when he was so ill as to
be scarcely able to sit upon his horse. His magnanimity
is attested by the fact that no more sincere a mourner
followed the great leader "Stonewall" to his untimely
grave than the man in whose heart still rankled the
wound which would be healed only when the gallant soul
had passed into that higher phase of life where all the
hurts of this narrow existence pass away.
Garnett commanded Pickett's brigade in the absence
of its leader while wounded, and when Pickett was pro-
moted to the command of a division the brigade was
placed permanently under Garnett, who led it with dis-
tinguished success, winning the respect and affection of
ofificers and men. It was at the head of this grand old
brigade that he rode down into the valley between the
hills of Gettysburg, cheering on his men with all the en-
thusiasm he had shown in his greatest vigor and health,
to meet the death to which every true soldier looks for-
ward as the crowning glory of a noble life.
Brigadier-General Lewis Addison Armistead com-
manded the second brigade of Pickett's division. He
was born in Newbern, North Carolina, February 18, 1817.
The son of an army officer, it was inevitable that he
should enter West Point, from which he would probably
have been graduated with most brilliant honors, had not
his martial instincts so far overruled the discipline of that
rigid institution as to result in the smashing of Jubal
Early's head with a plate. Although it is not the avowed
intention of that conservatory of war to repress the heroic
soul, yet in this particular case it was deemed best that
the belligerent instincts should be permitted to develop
in a less restricted atmosphere, and so the scholastic
career of the future Confederate leader was suddenly
terminlted.
