CHAPTER XLVI.
ON TO DINWIDDIE COURT-HOUSE.
It is a heartaching service to record the gathering
gloom of the last days of the Confederacy, when the
noblest blood of the Southland stained the mother clay
as her sons uselessly gave up their lives, gun in hand and
faces forward, where their officers led, the officers feeling,
as they gave the order, how vain, alas! it all was. To us
who lived through the darkness of those days there is
yet a black shadow falling around us like the memory
of an awful dream.
Poor Confederacy! She had nothing to oppose to the
affluence of resources possessed by the enemy save the
unconquerable gallantry of her children, who fought
against such odds as had never before stood in the way
of freedom.
When Pickett received and obeyed the telegram from
Lee, ordering him to move to the right of Petersburg, he
knew, and his men knew, that it was a forlorn hope.
No cheek blanched, no muscle quivered, as the order
was read. There was no weakening of their proud res-
olution to fight the battle for principle through sacrifice,
however vain, to the end.
As I humbly, reverently, record these last days, I lov-
ingly lay the immortal laurel of gratitude, prayer, love
and tears entwined on â€”
"The sacred grave
Of these last men who, vainly brave,
Died for the land they could not save."
