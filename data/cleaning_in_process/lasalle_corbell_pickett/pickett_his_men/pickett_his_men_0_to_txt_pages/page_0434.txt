404 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
battle. This creek is a marshy stream, difificult to cross,
running westerly into the Appomattox.
In the meantime every effort was being made by the
Confederates to push on their wagon-trains and artillery
across the Appomattox River at Farmville, a small town
west of the Danville Railroad. The mud and mire and
famishing animals made the progress slow. Soldiers may
live for a time on hope and patriotism, but mules and
horses must have fodder and corn. Both the wagon-road
to Lynchburg and the South-side Railroad cross the Ap-
pomattox at Farmville, and the latter again five miles east
of it, at High Bridge. The river being too deep to ford,
Farmville therefore became an important point to both
armies.
Ewell's command was on Pickett's left, and Mahone's
division was on his right. Sheridan, with his thousands
of well-fed, well-equipped cavalry, was in front, making
every demonstration to delay the Confederates from at-
tacking until he should be reinforced by his infantry.
Meantime Mahone received orders to move on, thus
leaving a gap in the Confederate line, which grew wider
as Mahone advanced.
Hunton, from his position on the right of Pickett's
division, observed this movement and gave notice of it
to Pickett, who at once made a report to Anderson
of Mahone's withdrawal, and of the consequent danger
to his own command, and asked permission to follow
Mahone.
The order, however, which Anderson had received
from the commander-in-chief to "hold on in connection
with Ewell's command, unfortunately prevented him,"
he said, "from complying with Pickett's request." In
the meanwhile, the gap between Pickett and Mahone was
increasing.
