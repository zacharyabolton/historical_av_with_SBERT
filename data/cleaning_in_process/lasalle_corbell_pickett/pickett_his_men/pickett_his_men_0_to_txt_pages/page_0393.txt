THE BERMUDA HUNDRED LINES. 363
Headquarters Army of Northern Virginia.
July 17, 1864.
Major-General Pickett has permission to visit Richmond and return.
By order of General Lee, W. H. Taylor,
Acting Adjutant-General.
Dear General: Accept through me the congratulations of the
general commanding and the zvhole army. My best wishes in addition.
Yours truly, Taylor.
The General, with bowed head and hat in hand, in
grateful acknowledgment of this delicate expression of
the love of his comrades in coming to greet us, rode on
past them and boarded the train just before it reached
the station. As soon as he handed us off, his men sur-
rounded us, eager to take a peep into the great bundle of
swaddling-clothes which hid from view their "little gen-
eral" as they then christened him.
We were hurried into the carriage, too soon for some, at
least, of the dear soldiers. One, whose name was Young,
and who, as the General told me afterward, had been
wounded in the battle of June 17, coming near losing
his head, which was just missed by a ball, took George
Junior, sans cerernonie, from my arms, and held him up to
the welcoming gaze of his comrades. With many a word
of love and blessing, our baby was passed on down the
line from one to another. Tenderly, almost reverently,
they touched him, our blessed baby, and many a tear was
dropped on the pillow upon which his thoughtful black
mammy, to ensure his safety, had carefully fastened him.
Meanwhile, the young hero, in wise and dignified si-
lence, with closed eyes and clenched fists, received the
love and honors thrust upon him. He may have made
faces, but not a sound did he utter as he passed on in this
his first review. No; Pickett's baby gracefully left the
rebel yell for Pickett's men to make.
