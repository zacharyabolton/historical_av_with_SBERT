1 86 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Jackson's. Jackson knew nothing of the matter of my having his troops,
I suppose, and merely made his report from riding over the ground after
the battle. I presume that he was not within one mile of the division
when I put it in, and had no idea of its whereabouts. General Whiting
reported to me that he had lost his way, and did not know where to find
General Jackson, and offered his troops if I had use for them. I was
then moving to assault, and put Whiting in a little behind Pickett's
brigade. The commands made the assault together, and broke the
enemy's line. Anderson's brigade followed and secured it, the assault-
ing columns being somewhat broken in making the charge. Just after
breaking his lines the enemy made a severe attack, and would have re-
covered his position, I think, but for the timely support of Anderson's
and Kemper's brigades at this point. Another fact should not be lost
sight of in this connection. A. P. Hill had made several formidable at-
tacks at the same point, and had fought manfully against it for several
hours, and though not entirely successful, he must have made a decided
impression, and have injured the enemy as much as he was himself in-
jured, and thus weakened the enemy's lines so as to enable us to break
them. It is quite common to give those credit only who show results,
but it frequently happens, as in this case, that there are others who
merit as much who are not known by results â€” that is, who are not seen
by others than those on the ground.
General Pickett was severely wounded, and was kept
out of the field until September of that year, when he
joined his brigade at Martinsburg, Virginia, though even
then he was unable to wear the sleeve of his coat upon
that arm.
Immediately upon his return to the field General
Pickett was assigned to the command of a division, and
on the lOth of October, 1862, was promoted major-general.
