382 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
of the Federal captain, nor did Heth, who was one of the
chiefs mentioned as being in consultation with him, but
just about this time a message came from Fitz Lee, stat-
ing that the enemy's cavalry were in great force at Five
Forks, and had driven in all of his pickets.
Upon this information, Lee at once sent orders to Fitz
Lee to take command of the whole cavalry, his own divi-
sion, the division of W. H. F. Lee, and a part of Rosser's
division, and make an attack upon the cavalry force at
Five Forks.
At n*oon on the same day Lee ordered Pickett to move
on to Five Forks with his small force of artillery and in-
fantry, consisting of his own three brigades. Matt Ran-
som's and Wallace's brigades (both together not equal to
a full brigade), and six rifled pieces of artillery under
Colonel Pegram, and take command of the whole force.
The main object of the attack was to break the Federal
left. The proposed plan to further that end was that Pick-
ett should press down upon Dinwiddie Court-house, and as
far down upon the front as possible, and that R. H. Ander-
son should at the same time make an attack in front.
The Federal cavalry was in strong force between the
right of the Confederate line and Five Forks, and Pick-
ett's men, being compelled to drive the Federals out of
their way the entire distance, the skirmishing in their
front and flank being continuous, they could not of course
make much of a record as to speed.
After eighteen hours of continuous marching through
the discomforts of rain, slush and hunger, and the dan-
gers of shot, shell and saber, Pickett reached Five Forks,
There had already been a sharp skirmish at this point be-
tween the two cavalry forces. Immediately on Pickett's
arrival he threw out two regiments of infantry, and the
Federal cavalry was soon driven in.
