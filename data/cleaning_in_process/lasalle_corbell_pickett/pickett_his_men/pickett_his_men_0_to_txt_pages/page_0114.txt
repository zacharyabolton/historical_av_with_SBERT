CHAPTER XIII.
MEXICAN AND INDIAN WARS.
" Right or wrong, my country." Statesmen may argue
â€” soldiers must fight.
When in 1819 the United States, in the exuberance of
her territorial wealth, voluntarily threw Texas into the
hands of Spain as a bonus for the cession of Florida, for
which adequate compensation had been already given,
it would have taken a far-sighted statesman to foretell
that the lavish extravagance would sometime fuTnish
occasion for an unjust war of aggression.
The seeds were sown then with spendthrift hand, to be
reaped in a harvest of darkness little more than a quarter
of a century later and, whatever a soldier may have
thought of the justice of the cause, his duty was to follow
his flag.
The West Point class of 1846 probably held that all
that "pomp and circumstance of glorious war "was set
upon the stage especially foe their instruction and em-
ployment. Whether it was or not, that fortunate class
was ushered upon the scene just in time to get the full
benefit of the situation.
Thus it happened that when General Scott led to
the siege of Vera Cruz his devoted band of warriors,
accompanied by a pontoon-train, " to cross rivers," in
a region conspicuously devoid of those picturesque
physical features. Lieutenant George E. Pickett, just
from West Point, was one of the number. I quote from
a letter just received from Major Edwin A. Sherman,
