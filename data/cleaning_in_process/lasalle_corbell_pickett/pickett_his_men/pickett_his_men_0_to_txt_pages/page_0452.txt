thread in the strong and beautiful web of Southern life.
Their graves make sacred the historic ground of the
land for which they fought and fell. The star of their

Far more have drifted away on the sea of silence. If the
flower of memory which I lovingly plant on the grave of
the dead shall bloom to cheer the heart of the living I
am content.
