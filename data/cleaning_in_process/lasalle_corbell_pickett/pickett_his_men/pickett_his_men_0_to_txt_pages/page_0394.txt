364 PICKETT AND HIS MEN,
I am ashamed to confess it, but, notwithstanding the
gentleness of the soldiers, baby's quiet, peaceful mien,
and the General's continued assurance that he was all
right, I, his very new and solicitous mother, suffered
agonies of torture and anxiety until he was back again in
my arms; and oh, dear, what a greasy, dirty, grimy little
bundle it was when I did get it back. One would hardly
have recognized the snow-white baby of a few minutes
before. Nor was the soiled linen the only price the " little
general" had to pay for honor and glory â€” there were
other emoluments. Our poor army, for want of soap and
clothes, had superior numbers of graybacks as well as
bluecoats to fight, and this enemy put our young gen-
eral through his first contest and, in spite of our raising
the black flag, and of the combined heroic and immediate
remedies of surgeon, mother, and nurse, it was many days
before our wee, wee soldier recovered from the wounds
received in his first battle.
Our army at this time, numbering about forty to fifty
thousand, was holding a line from a point north of Fort
Harrison, on the north side of the James, to Hatcher's
Creek, south of Petersburg, several miles in length,
bounded on all sides by the Federal army. The Con-
federates were in constant fear that Grant would at any
moment swing around our right and shut us up in Rich-
mond and Petersburg to starve. He had possession of
the Weldon road and was threatening the Richmond and
Danville Railroad, our only remaining line connecting us
with the Southern States from which we received our
supplies.
The line from Howlett House, on the James River
opposite Dutch Gap Canal, across to Swift Creek and Fort
Clifton on the Appomattox, a distance of about three
miles, was held by Pickett's division, which numbered
