356 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
From all the angles of the Confederate lines poured a
stream of fire which left no living thing in its track. Bar-
low's division of Hancock's corps fell back before a heavy
rain of shot and shell. Gibbon's division reached the
parapets and recoiled. Wright and Smith were driven
back after an hour's fierce contest. While Warren held
the Confederate line in front, Burnside was to attack the
left. The outposts fell back before his charge, but the
order to attack in force was countermanded, the failure of
the assault on the other part of the line having convinced
Meade that the works could not be carried. Three thou-
sand of Hancock's men lay upon the field.
The order to withdraw was given by Meade, the battle
of Cold Harbor was over, and nearly ten thousand of
Grant's troops had gone to reinforce the army of the lost
in that gloomy and blood-stained Wilderness. Grant or-
dered a renewal of the attack, but his generals refused to
obey.
