60 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Point, July 19, 1864, thus bespeaks his accord with his
government in opposing the exchange of prisoners:
It is hard on our men held in Southern prisons not to exchange them,
but it is humanity to those left in the ranks to fight our battles. Every
man released on parole, or otherwise, becomes an active soldier against
us at once, either directly or indirectly. If we commence a system of
exchange which liberates all prisoners taken, we will have to fight on
until the whole South is exterminated. If we hold on to those caught,
they amount to no more than dead men. At this particular time to re-
lease all rebel prisoners North would ensure Sherman's defeat and would
compromise our safety here. tj g Grant
Lieutenant-General.
General Grant further said, in his testimony before the
Committee on the Conduct of the War, February, 1865:
" Exchanges of prisoners having been suspended by reason
of disagreement on the part of agents of exchange on both
sides before I came into command of the armies of the
United States, and it then being near the opening of the
spring campaign, I did ?iot deem it advisable or just to the
men who had to fight our battles to reiijforce the eiiemy with
thirty or forty thonsmid disciplined troops at that time. An
immediate resumption of exchanges would have had that
effect without giving us corresponding benefits. The suf-
fering said to exist among our prisoners South was a pow-
erful argument against tlie course pursued, and so I felt it."
In the light of historic facts, the right entry will be
made of the suffering of the prisoners, North and South.
