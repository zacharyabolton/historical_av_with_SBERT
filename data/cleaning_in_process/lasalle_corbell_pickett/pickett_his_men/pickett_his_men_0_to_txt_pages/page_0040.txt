1 6 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
" 'Tisn't so, sister; 'tisn't so! Don't you believe him!"
said my little brother. "Hush, sir; hush!" he excitedly
called out of the window to the newsboy. " Hush this
minute, hallooing your big stories out loud and scaring
everybody to death. I'd like to stick those five forks
through your old black gizzard, for you haven't got any
heart, I know. Ain't you ashamed of yourself, you good-
for-nothing old scalawag, you! There ain't a word of
truth in brother George being killed, and you know it,
you old thing! I'll go down and mash his mouth for him
and kick him to death for scaring you so, my poor sister —
poor sister! Yes, I'd just like to kill that boy, sister,
'deed I would; but it isn't so, my sister. You trust in
the Lord. I know brother George is not killed, for he
said he wouldn't get killed."
" No, it is not so. You are right, my darling. Your
brother George is not killed," I said. "Yes, he will come
back! — he wi// come back! He said he would, and he
will."
I thanked God then, and I thank God now, for the
sweet comfort of that precious little brother, John T.
Corbell — my little confidant and friend — and for his loy-
alty and love in all the succeeding years.
Oh, the sleepless nights that followed each other after
that in monotonous succession!
