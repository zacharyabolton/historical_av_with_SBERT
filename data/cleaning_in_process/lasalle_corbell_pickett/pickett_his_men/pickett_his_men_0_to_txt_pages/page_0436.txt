406 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
inevitable fate. Many of the men broke their guns, and
many of the ofificers snapped their swords in two, rather
than surrender them to the enemy. They fought as hero-
ically and nobly on this, their last battle-field, when all
hope was gone, as they had ever done in any battle, even
when in their first flush of glory, and in perfect faith of
ultimate success.
Corse and Hunton were taken prisoners, with almost
the entire remnant of their commands. Stewart and
Terry succeeded in getting off the field. Pickett himself,
with Colonel Walter Harrison and his medical director^
Dr. M. M. Lewis, escaped death or capture almost by a
miracle. Pickett, seeing several squadrons of cavalry rid-
ing directly down upon them, rallied around him a mere
squad of his beloved old division, and with this last rally
the men fired their parting shot into the faces of the ad-
vancing horsemen, and in the momentary check they
made their escape.
In the annals of warfare there is found no page which
glows more vividly with the light of heroism than does
that which records the retreat of the Confederate army
after the battle of Sailor's Creek. Starving, jaded by
forced marches and strenuous exertion in battle, it yet
found strength to turn and with its old-time impetu-
osity and transcendent effort, force back twice across the
stream the strong, well-fed, victorious army of Sheridan.
Friend and foe alike have marveled over such wondrous
gallantry displayed in the face of so great suffering
and disaster. Truly the last flashes of the expiring
flames of Southern hopes and Southern ambitions have
shed imperishable glory over the record of the men
who kept those flames alive through over four years of
heroic struggle against overwhelming odds of men and
resources.
