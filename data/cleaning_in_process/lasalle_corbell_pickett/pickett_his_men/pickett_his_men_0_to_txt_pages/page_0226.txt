198 PICKETT AND HIS MEN.
Had Lee made a battle-field for himself he probably
could not have constructed a more desirable one than
that which he had chosen. In the front was a gentle rise
and fall like the graceful undulations of a sea in a calm.
In the rear rose the hills, crest upon crest, as if nature in
martial mood might have formed them with an eye to the
location of artillery. Ridges swelled here and there, to
afford hiding-places for reserves. The short line of the
Confederates across the angle of the Antietam and Po-
tomac facilitated reinforcement at any point.
The sluggish little Antietam, coming down from the
hills of Pennsylvania, is crossed by four stone bridges â€”
the upper one on the Keedysville and Williamsport road;
the second on the Keedysville and Sharpsburg turnpike,
two and a half miles below; the third about a mile below
the second, on the Rohrersville and Sharpsburg road;
the fourth near the mouth of Antietam Creek, on the
road from Harper's Ferry to Sharpsburg, three miles
below the third.
Lee's line of battle was ranged along Sharpsburg
Heights, the cavalry and horse artillery near the eastern
bend of the Potomac. Single batteries were posted along
the line and below the crest of the heights, and the Wash-
ington Artillery was on Longstreet's right. When Jack-
son arrived from Harper's Ferry with his division and
Ewell's, he was posted west of the Hagerstown turnpike.
Walker was stationed with his two brigades to the right
of Longstreet.
When Pickett's brigade, led by Garnett, reached the
field, it was posted under a heavy fire on the southeast of
Sharpsburg in a hollow at the rear of the Washington
Artillery to support some batteries. Here it was for some
hours exposed to a severe fire of shot and shell, losing a
number of its men.
