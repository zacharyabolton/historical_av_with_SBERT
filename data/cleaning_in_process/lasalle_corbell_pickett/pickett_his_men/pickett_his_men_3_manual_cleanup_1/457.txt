men, he loved his lovely and devoted wife, he refused to leave her for
foreign service, and accepted the position of general agent of the Wash-
ington Life Insurance Company of New York, for Virginia, and in the exe-
cution of his duty in this civil capacity, in Norfolk, his war-worn frame
succumbed to the disease which attacked him only a few days before.
Could he have had his wish he had died amid the roar of battle. No
man of our age has better illustrated the aptitude for war of his class of
our country, and with these talents for war was united the truest and
sweetest nature. No man of his time was more beloved of women, of
men and of soldiers. He was to the latter a rigid disciplinarian, and at
the same time the soldier's friend.
Virginia will rank him in her roll of fame with Lee, with Johnston,
with the Jackson they love as Stonewall; and mourners for the noble
and gallant gentleman, the able and accomplished soldier, are legion.
True and noble soul, rest in peace; and may the God he revered give
that consolation He only can to his devoted wife and namesake son.
