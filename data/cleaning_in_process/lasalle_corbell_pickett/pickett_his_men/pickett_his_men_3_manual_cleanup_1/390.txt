One morning as we rode along the Howlett House line,
I saw a puff of smoke rise in the distance, drifting, scat-
tering, becoming a mere film as it floated higher and
higher until it was lost against the blue sky.
" How pretty that smoke is," I said.
The General looked at it attentively, then said anx-
iously:
"Yes, dangerously beautiful. It is from a shell. The
enemy have begun firing again. Come, you'd better ride
on as fast as you can and let me get you beyond the
danger."
" No, no. General. I could not do that," I replied, with
something of the indignation which a soldier might have
felt upon being recommended to run away from battle.
â€¢' Never, never, in the wide world would I let Pickett's
men see your wife riding fast to get away from danger."
As we rode slowly along amid the cheers of the sol-
diers, looking as carelessly over at the beautifully curl-
ing columns of smoke as if they were harmless clouds,
Captain Smith rode up.
"They are not firing at us," he said, greeting me and
saluting the General. "They are testing their guns, I
think, for the entertainment of Mrs. Grant, who, I learn,
has this morning come down to the lines. She is just
over there, as you see, looking on," handing us his glass.
"Nevertheless, our position is not a safe one. A stray
ball might accidentally strike us here. Would it not be
better for you to take Mrs. Pickett away? Turn to the
left into that clump of trees."
"She will not go," said the General, "and I can not is-
sue a military order, as I might in the case of any other
insubordinate. The only disadvantage. Captain, of having
a wife is that, whatever place you may hold on the army
rolls, she outranks you."
