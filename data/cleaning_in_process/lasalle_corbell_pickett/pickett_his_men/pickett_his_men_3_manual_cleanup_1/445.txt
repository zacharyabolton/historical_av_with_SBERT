'Tis Pickett's charge at Gettysburg:
What grander tableau can there be
Than rhythmic swing of infantry
At shouldered arms, with flashing steel?
As Pickett swings to left, half-wheel,
Those monsters instantly outpour
Their flame and smoke and death! and roar
Their fury on the silent air —
Starting a scene of wild despair;
Lee's batteries roaring: "RoomI Make room!!"
With Meade's replying: "Doom I 'Tis doom
To Pickett's charge at Gettysburg. "
•Tis Pickett's charge at Gettysburg:
Now Hancock's riflemen begin
To pour their deadly missiles in.
Can standing grain defy the hail?
Will Pickett stop? Will Pickett fail?
His kft is all uncovered through
That fateful halt of Pettigrewl
And Wilcox from the right is cleft
By Pickett's half-wheel to the left!
Brave Stannard rushes in the gap —
No more disastrous thing could hap
To Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.
'Tis Pickett's charge at Gettysburg:
How terrible it is to see
Great armies making history:
Long lines of muskets belching flame!
No need of gunners taking aim
When from that thunder-cloud of smoke
The lightning kills at every stroke!
If there's a place resembling hell,
'Tis where, 'mid shot and bursting shell,
Stalks Carnage arm in arm with Death,
A furnace-blast in every breath,
On Pickett 's charge at Gettysburg.
