tance chiefly as being the first regular cavalry engage-
ment of the war.
Lee's army was able to seize and hold all the fords of
the river, was secure from attack on the march, and when
it reached the valley was protected by the Blue Ridge.
Lee had drawn every available man. A like concentra-

the hostility of the commander-in-chief at Washington

Lee, on June 10, despatched Ewell from Culpeper toward
the valley to capture Milroy. Imboden was at the same

Jenkins moved down upon Winchester.
On the morning of the 12th of June the right wing of
the Union army, under Reynolds, was put in motion
toward Manassas, and the next day three other corps
were ordered to the northward.
On June 13 Ewell was in possession of Martinsburg,
Imboden held control of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
and Jenkins was pressing northward to Williamsport.
Longstreet was encamped at Culpeper. A. P. Hill was
at Fredericksburg. Hooker was trying, according to
orders, to maintain his position between Lee's army and

Ewell, on June 15, gained a victory over Milroy at Win-
