and that all the suffering of prisoners on both sides could
have been avoided by carrying out the terms of the cartel
proposed by the Confederate government. If I had only
dared to raise the veil and reveal the truth, sympathy
would have tempered their bitterness; the flame of divine
kinship smoldering in their veins, hidden as in a tomb,
would have miraged over the gulf of wrongs a bridge
of holier feelings. Yet the memory of the woman
whose son had been killed on the field of Gettys-
burg, and whose lily, now browned and withered with
the years, I cherish with such tender care, softened the
words that were like blows to my ear and heart. Thus
the power of one pure heart radiating its love upon
the world as an odorous flower, diffuses fragrance on
the surrounding atmosphere, uplifts the sorrowful spirit
and strengthens it to withstand the rude assaults of a vin-
dictive world.
The official figures of Secretary of War Stanton and
Surgeon-General Barnes show that over three per cent,
more Confederates perished in Northern prisons than
Federals in Southern prisons. The report of Mr. Stanton,
July 19, 1866, says: " Of the Federal prisoners in Confed-
erate prisons during the war, 22,576 died. Of Confeder-
ate prisoners in Federal prisons, 26,436 died. Surgeon-
General Barnes said that the Confederate prisoners num-
bered 220,000; the Federal prisoners, 270,000. Out of
270,000 Federals more than 22,000 died; of 220,000
Confederates more than 26,000 died.*
General Grant, in his letter to General Butler from City
* Mr. Blaine accounts for the greater mortality of Southern prison-
ers by saying that the Southern men were "ill-clad, ill-fed and diseased,
so that they died of disease they brought with them. " That being true,
how then could the South provide any better for Northern prisoners
than for her own soldiers?
