from the batteries on the height and the Federals re-
treated to their guns on the other side of the Antietam.
When night brought silence to this terrible field of
the Civil War, Mcintosh's battery, taken when A. P. Hill
first arrived upon the scene, had been regained, and the
ground lost by Longstreet had been recovered.
When Pickett's brigade had been for some hours in
rear of the artillery it was ordered forward to the crest of
the hill to dislodge the Federal skirmishers and protect
the artillery eastward. Shortly after, S. D. Lee's battalion
took the place of the Washington Artillery, and the Fifty-
sixth Regiment under Captain McPhail, Colonel William
D. Stuart being ill, was sent back to protect the move-
ment.
When Burnside crossed the river the brigade again
took position in front in a corn-field, the Fifty-sixth Regi-
ment being recalled to the left wing of the main body.
Here it opened fire on a large number of skirmishers and
drove them back.
From the woods of Antietam a moving wall of bayonets
bore down upon the little band. Only two hundred of
the gallant Virginians were left, but with two rifled pieces
they bravely held their ground. After an hour of heavy
work the right began to yield. A number of Federal flags
were seen upon a hill in rear of Sharpsburg, the only ave-
nue of escape. Garnett, seeing that his small force was
in danger of being surrounded and captured, was forced
to withdraw it, the Nineteenth under Major Cabell halting
to protect a section of artillery. The brigade filed out
from its position of peril and passed around to the north
of the town.
The battle had been fought and lost, but it could scarcely
be said to have been won. It stopped, apparently be-
cause both sides were too much exhausted to go on. Lee
