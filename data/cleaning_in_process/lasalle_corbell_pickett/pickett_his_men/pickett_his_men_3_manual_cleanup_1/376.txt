stood; our souls translated for us the poem of the look
â€” then the General rode on.
In many ways had my dear ones always shown loving
memory of my birthday, but to-day a new celebration was
in store for me. The Federals were to grace the occasion.
I could not help contrasting in my mind various kinds of
entertainment, and wondering if many young people had
celebrated their natal days in so many different manners.
Child, almost, as I was, I wondered if I should ever again
dance with light feet and a merry heart at a real birth-
day fete.
Thus I rode through the dewy morn, the first golden
rays of the sun making a veil of glory from the mist that
shimmered in evanescent beauty to the touch of the gentle
wind. They lit with an amber glow the edges of the fresh,
newly opened leaves, rustling to the soft movement of the
morning breeze. They struck glittering shafts through
the dewdrops that quivered on the blades of grass, and
changed them to diamonds pendent, trembling in emerald
settings. The echo of the cannonade that had thundered
against the loved city in which were centered so many sweet
memories and so many reminiscences of terror yet seemed
to strike upon ear and heart, but a little bird in a tree close
by arched its irised neck and from its tiny throat came a
flood of melody that drowned discordant recollections.
The bottled general being still " corked up," and Peters-
burg being for the time safe, Beauregard deemed it ex-
pedient to move with the greater portion of his force
toward Richmond and Drury's Bluff on the James River,
leaving Whiting in command at Petersburg. Beaure-
gard's lines extended from the Howlett House on the
James River to Fort Clifton on the Appomattox below
Petersburg. On the south side of the Appomattox there
was a very small force for the defense of Petersburg.
