" ' Go to 97 Brenton street, where my niece, Mrs. C
will bring you to my house,' " he read. " It might be any-
thing else as well as Brenton," he said. "It looks like
'Brenton,' but I have lived here all my life and have
never heard of such a street. I'll get my directory, how-
ever, and look. No," he said, " but it may be Preston ; let's
look, but there are no C s living there. You might try
this house, at any rate, 97 Preston street, and if you do not
find your friends living there then come to this number,
where my wife and I will be happy to have you as our
guest, you and the little lost bird, till you can write to your
friends and find out where they do want you to come."
Off again I started with the Irishman, who had become
interested in me by this time, and had forgotten all about
the depot.
" Here you are, marm, 97 Priston strate, an' a nice
house it is, marm. Shall I take yure things in, marm?"
" No; first take up my card, if your horses will stand."
"Av coorse, marm, an' they will."
I wrote on my card:
" Does Mrs. C live here â€” a niece of Mrs. S ?"
In a moment there were two or three faces at the
windows, and in another moment as many voices at the
carriage-door, asking, "Is this George Pickett's wife and
child?" and I was so thankful to be once more where
they knew George Pickett's wife and child.
Besides the lovely people whose home it was, there was
with them, on her way to her mother's, a daughter of Mrs.
S , Mrs. General B , who was one of the most
charming women I ever met. She had just returned from
the South. Her husband, too, was in the Confederate
army. The next day we both went out to her mother's,
my husband's aunt's home.
