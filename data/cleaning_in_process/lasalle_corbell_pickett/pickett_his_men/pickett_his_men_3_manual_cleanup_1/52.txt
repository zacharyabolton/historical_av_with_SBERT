ence between those who wore the blue and those who
wore the gray, and some of them had little ones at

ors and ofificers, and this time cheer after cheer went up
for my noble hero husband, as the little steamer hauled
in the lines and puffed away, and more names were
added to the list of Yankees for baby not to hate.
