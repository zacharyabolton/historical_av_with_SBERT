Beneath little Mary's name was this line:
Little Mary died on the i6th of May, 1864 — her fifth birthday.
1 rested, but thought of little Mary as I watched my
own baby who was sleeping so sweetly in this childless
stranger's arms — till presently the waves brought back to
me the days of my childhood — the story of the sailor with
his stolen mill, grinding out salt, forever and forever, and
the lost talisman lost still — back to my grandmother's
knee, listening with wonder-eyes to " Why the sea is
salt," the while my soul anon chanted to music those all-
healing, blissful words, " Edwards is better," gaining
strength for the o'erhanging trial I least dreamed of —
and the shadows rose to make place for one darker still.
