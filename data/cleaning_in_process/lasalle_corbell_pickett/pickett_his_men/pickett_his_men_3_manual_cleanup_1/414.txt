The loss of the Confederates was chiefly confined to
W. H. F. Lee's cavalry and Terry's and Corse's brigades.
Many valuable ofificers were killed.
Although the Fifth Corps had suffered great loss, it
rallied and charged against Lee's brigades, but was again
forced back to White Oak road and then to the fortifica-
tions.
The darkness of night fell over the Confederates with-
in but half a mile of Dinwiddie Court-house. Had some
good Southern Joshua been there to stop the sun in its
course for even one little half-hour the court-house would
have been ours.
The Federals were being strongly reinforced with in-
fantry. Grant, in response to Sheridan's request, having
ordered up the Fifth Corps under Warren, numbering
fifteen thousand. The whole of Sheridan's and Kautz's
cavalry were in front, MacKenzie's division, sixteen thou-
sand strong, having been sent forward.
When the battle was over Pickett sent a courier to Lee,
who was on the lines at Petersburg, telling him of the suc-
cess of the day, but stating that he had just ascertained,
through his scouts, the certainty of the heavy infantry
support to Sheridan's cavalry at Dinwiddie Court-house,
and that he had no option but to withdraw with his small
force. This he proposed to do under cover of the night.
Further assurance of the truth of this report proved to
Pickett that his decision was a judicious one. He ac-
cordingly left the front of Dinwiddie Court-house at two
o'clock on the morning of the ist day of April, and
started back toward Five Forks.
Thus ended another scene in the fifth act of the tragedy
on which the dark curtain was so soon to fall.
