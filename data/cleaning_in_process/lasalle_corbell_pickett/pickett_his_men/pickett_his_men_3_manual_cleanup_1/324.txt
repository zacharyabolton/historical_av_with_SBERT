Pickett rode on to meet Longstreet, who had ex-
pressed a desire to see him, and who, though relieved and
delighted by his arrival upon the field, manifested great
anxiety. While conversing with Longstreet Pickett
viewed the ground and watched the fight in front of Lit-
tle Round Top, where the other two divisions of Long-
street's corps under Hood and McLaws, having started
twenty-four hours in advance of his three brigades, had
struck the corps commanded by Sickles. He was thus
engaged when Colonel Harrison rode up with Lee's reply:
"Tell General Pickett that I shall not want him this even-
ing; to let his men rest, and I will send him word when
I want him."
Pickett and Harrison left Longstreet still fighting with
fearless tenacity in front of Round Top, and rode back to
the division to seek such rest as they might find. They
had viewed the field, had studied its advantages and dis-
advantages, had witnessed the terrific struggle, had
watched A. P. Hill's attack upon the center, thoroughly
understood the situation, and knew that before them lay
a dark and tragic day,
Lee had not been so successful on the second day as
on the first, but he had gained some ground by a series of
brilliant movements, and his repulses had been attended
with heavy loss to the enemy. In his report he says:
"These partial successes determined me to'continue the
assault next day."
On the afternoon of the 2d Stuart came in from Car-
lisle and joined Lee on Seminary Ridge. He was followed
by Kilpatrick, who lost about thirty men in a skirmish with
Hampton, the latter having been left by Stuart at Hunters-
town to prevent the Federal troopers from falling upon
Ewell's rear.
Lee had concentrated more than a hundred guns
