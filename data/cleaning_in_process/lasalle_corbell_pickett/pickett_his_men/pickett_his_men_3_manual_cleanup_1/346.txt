who, having been given the privilege of going back and
forth, happened to be at hand at the time. Many a mile
I had ridden on mule-back, hoping to hear directly from
the General, before I was rewarded.
" Reck," our old mule, had been a benefaction not
only to us but to the whole county. Every other mule
and every horse had been confiscated and taken by the
Federals. But for his wonderful memory, " Reck" would
have changed owners, too, like all his half-brothers and
-sisters, for he was a fine-looking mule. When a colt
his leg had been broken in crossing a bridge, and all
the powers of coaxing and whipping and spurring after
that accident could not make him step on a plank,
much less cross a bridge, unless you pretended to
mend the bridge, and first walked across it yourself in
safety, and then came back and led him over. My last
ride on "Reck" brought me as compensation a package
of five or six letters. The first was the letter which the
General, as he went into battle, had handed to General
Longstreet, with its sad superscription â€” "If Old'Peter's
nod means death ." The next was written on the
second day after the great catastrophe.
Later there came to me the following:
WiLLIAMSPORT, July 8, 1863.
I am crossing the river to-day, guarding some four thousand prison-
ers back to Winchester, where I shall take command and try to recruit
my spirit-crushed, wearied, cut-up people. It is just two months this
morning since I parted from you, and yet the disappointments and
sorrows that have been crowded into the interval make the time seem
years instead. My grand old division, which was so full of faith and
courage then, is now almost extinguished. But one field-officer in the
whole command escaped in that terrible third of July slaughter, and
alas ! alas ! for the men who fearlessly followed their lead on to certain
death.
