General Grant also wrote that it had not been at all
necessary for us to go away in the first place, and that
the terms of his cartel should have been respected, even

We stopped in New York en route to Virginia, ex-
pecting to remain there only three or four days, but we
found that our board had been paid in advance for two
weeks, that a carriage had been put at our service for that
length of time, and that in our box was a pack of wine-
cards marked "Paid." To this day I do not know how
many people's guests we were, for a great rrftiny of Gen-
eral Pickett's old army friends were there at the time, and
they all vied with each oth.r in making it pleasant and
happy for us.
