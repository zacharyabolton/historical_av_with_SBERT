forcements of troops could possibly be spared, that a
gunboat should be stationed on the James River at Fort
Powhatan on the south bank of the river, and that below
that point the river should at once be further obstructed
with torpedoes. These promises, for causes unknown,
were not fulfilled, and subsequent events showed their
importance.
When we returned to Petersburg after our bridal visit
with the General's sister and aunts, we found that loving,
thoughtful hands had been unsparing in their tasteful ar-
rangement of our temporary abode. Affection had found
a way, in spite of the check of war, to anticipate every
luxurious requirement. Choicest selections were made
by the General's friends from among their own treasures
to adorn our rooms.
It was here that the first tears of my married life were
shed. It happened some months after we had entered
our Petersburg home, upon a gloomy, rainy morning
when the General was busy at his office and there was
nothing to prevent my falling into the temptations which
wait upon idle hands.
Did you ever see or hear of a girl graduate who had
never read a novel? Incredible as it may seem, such was
I at this period of my life. From infancy I had been
under the especial guidance of my good grandmother, a
rigid churchwoman, who had unshakable convictions as
to the influences which should surround a young girl.
She did not approve of novels. Consequently I had never
been subjected to the charm of their seductive pages.
Having grasped a situation so remote from the proba-
ble, just imagine such an innocent, crude mind suddenly
brought into contact with the tense tragedy of " East
Lynne" â€” a tragedy which probably has never been ex-
ceeded in literary history. So it happened to me.
