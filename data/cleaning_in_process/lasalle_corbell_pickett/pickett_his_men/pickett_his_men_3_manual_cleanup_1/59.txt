my arrest, and that, in any event, if it were known who
I was, it was more than possible that I might be held
as a hostage for my husband. After consideration it had
been decided that I should travel, not under my own
name, but under my maiden name. The more I studied
the subject the more bewildered I became. How could
I keep my precious secret? I determined to be very
silent and guard my tongue closely and answer in mono-
syllables that would discourage intimacies. I began to
draw my face down and look serious and wise and assume
an expression of profound abstraction. Then it occurred
to me that this attitude would never do. In the few
novels I had read, the people who had secrets were al-
ways silent and mysterious. Their demeanor said more
plainly than words could have expressed:
" Behold, the modern Sphinx, whose riddle can never
be read!"
Every one would recognize immediately the fact that
my mind was the repository of something dangerous.
Then I thought I would cultivate a light and chatty
style, more in accordance with my natural character. So
I was soon, in my thought, in conversation with some im-
aginary person on home scenes and pleasures, assuming
an animation that ought to remove from the mind of the
most suspicious person the fancy that I could possibly
have anything to conceal. I found that my mental
allusions to what the General said and did were quite too
frequent and enthusiastic to be in accordance with my as-
sumed character of an unknown little wife and mother,
traveling for the innocent purpose of spending a few
days with relations, expecting her obscure husband to
come for her after awhile from a little farm that he was
industriously tilling. If I could neither talk nor be silent,
what could I do?
