In Spite of the darkening gloom, the fall of Fort Fisher,
the evacuation of Tennessee by Hood's army, Sherman's
march to Charleston, danger, starvation and cold, Pick-
ett's men were hopeful and full of faith.
All through the winter the men had been in the
trenches and the ofificers alert to prevent surprise. They
had small huts to shelter them from the beating storm.
To add to their discomfort fuel was very scarce and dif-
ficult to secure. They were dependent upon a small belt
of timber between their own and the Federal skirmish-
line. It was necessary that a guard should accompany
the party procuring the wood, in order to ward off sur-
prise.
Notwithstanding all precautions, many were captured.
One of the pluckiest and most venturous of the wood-
gatherers, Adam Thompson, the mascot of the division,
became so absorbed that before he knew it he was taken
prisoner. Such an immense man was Mr. Adam, with
such an enormous foot, that special orders had to be given
to the quartermaster for his shoes and clothes. In an-
nouncing this capture, the Federals said: "One milk-
white prisoner, three and a half feet across the back, legs
in proportion, and each foot encased in a side of sole
leather." Later on, when exchanging some prisoners cap-
tured in the rifle-pits, the Federals demanded four of their
men for our Mr. Adam, to which demand we gladly acceded.
