band, and I hope, madam, you will meet him with more
cordiality than you did another of your husband's friends.
At least, for the sake of their lifelong friendship, you
will not hurt him."
He turned for sympathy to my husband, who looked
acquiescingly at him and beseechingly at me. Presently
the General drew me to one side and whispered:
" Suckley voiced my wishes, my little wife, and I want
you to meet my old friend just as cordially as you can.
Put your little hand in his and forget everything except
that he is one of your husband's oldest and dearest
friends."
I promised my husband with all my heart to do what
he asked, and I really meant to do it. I loved to do every-
thing he bade me. I liked him to make things hard for me
sometimes, that I might show him how sincere and loving
my obedience was. But when General Ingalls came on
board, was given a salute and received, as became his
rank, with the honors the absence of which I had marked
when my own General came, I slipped my hand out of
my husband's and ran back to my stateroom as fast as
I could.
There I burst out crying and shook our baby, waking
him, and told him how papa had been treated — that poor
papa had not had any honors paid him at all, and that
a dreadful old bad Yankee general had come on board
and taken them all, and that when he grew up and was a
big man he must fight and fight and fight, and never sur-
render, and never forgive the Yankees; no, not even if his
poor, dethroned papa asked him to do so. I told him
how his papa had asked me to shake hands with this
Yankee general, because he was his friend, and that I was
going to do it because papa wanted me to; that I tried and
could not and that he never must, either — never, never.
