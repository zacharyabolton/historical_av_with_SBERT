Pickett's division — reserved for the last great scene in
the tragedy of Gettysburg — had not yet entered the circle
of fire which environed the mountains, filled the valleys
with death, and turned the silvery streams into rivers of
blood.
Until the night of July i the three brigades under
Pickett's command, Corse and Jenkins having been left
behind, remained on guard at Chambersburg. Being then
relieved by Imboden, at two o'clock on the morning of
the 2d, they were under marching orders and moving
along the Gettysburg road. In the pass of the South
Mountain a fire flashed upon them from sharpshooters
stationed in the gorges of the crags.
On the east side of the range the air trembled with the
battle-rage of Gettysburg. The ardor of the men kindled
into flame, and with eager, impatient feet they pressed
forward to answer the call. Through the intense heat of
one of the most fiery days with which July ever scorched
the earth Pickett's men marched twenty-four miles and
at two o'clock in the afternoon halted three miles from
Gettysburg.
Though they were parched with heat and worn by the
march, their commander sent his inspector-general, Colo-
nel Walter Harrison, to report to Lee their position and
condition and to tell him that, notwithstanding their fa-
tigue, they could with two hours' rest be in any part of
the field in which he might wish to use them.
