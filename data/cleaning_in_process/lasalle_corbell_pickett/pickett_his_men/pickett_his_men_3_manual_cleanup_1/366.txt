The present operations I was afraid of from the first, as there were
too many contingencies. I should have wished more concentration, bat
still hope the effect produced by the expedition may prove beneficial.
I am. General, very respectfully,

Barton's explanation of his inaction at Newbern is, that
although he had made every safe and proper exertion to
gain information regarding the position of the enemy, and
had been assured by those whom he was forced to be-
lieve trustworthy that there were no fortifications at
Newbern other than those abandoned by the Confederates
at the capture of the place, yet when he got there he found
an invincible array of forts, breastworks and field-works,
bristling with so deadly an array of guns that further prog-
ress was impossible.
