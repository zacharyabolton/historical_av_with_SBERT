'" No, sah, Marse John; no, sah,' said the awe-stricken
servant. • I ain't a-gwine ter, sah, I neber had no notion

"Once, too, I "
"You have relatives in Baltimore?" said the gentle-
man, abruptly interrupting me; otherwise, feeling that
geography and history were safe subjects, I should have
rattled on till I had told him all I knew.
" Yes, sir," said I. "I am going to visit them."
"Where were you from this morning?"
" I came from a little country village about thirty
miles from Norfolk — Chuckatuck, a village in Nanse-
mond County. It used to be the capital city of a tribe of
Indians called the Nansemums."
" I saw your father as he was leaving the steamer. I
was attracted to him because he made an appeal to all
Masons, asking of them — poor man — with his hands
raised to God, their protection and care for his child and
grandchild. He thus was making himself known to any
of us, his brothers, who might be aboard, when he was lost
sight of by the turn of the boat. So, you see, you can
safely confide in me, and I will help you in any way I can."
"Thank you," I said. "I know my dear, dear papa ?!s
a Mason. I know he was anxious about me; but I have
nothing to confide — nothing. I only want a stateroom
and my tickets and some milk for the baby. I do not
wish for any supper myself. I am so lonesome I could
not eat. It is wicked to feel blue and down-hearted,
with baby and all the kind friends to watch over me, as
you say; and then, too, God is always near."
