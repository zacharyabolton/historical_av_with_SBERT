gage-train marched out through rain and mud. The Fed-
erals attacked the fort, and the brigades of Wilcox and
A. P. Hill were sent to its assistance, and later, as the fire
increased, Pickett's and Colston's brigades reinforced the
troops in the fort.
Johnston had ridden forward to join the troops on the
march, but the battle became so hot that he turned back
and ordered the division of D. H. Hill, which had gone
forward, to return to Longstreet's assistance. In his offi-

"The action gradually increased in magnitude until about
three o'clock, when General Longstreet, commanding the
rear, requested that a part of Major-General Hill's troops
might be sent to his aid. Upon this I rode upon the
field, but found myself compelled to be a spectator, for
General Longstreet's clear head and brave heart left no
apology for interference."
At Williamsburg, on this 5th day of May, 1S62, Pick-
ett's brigade, as a brigade, fought its first battle, helping

honor and glory to themselves and great loss to the

The Williamsburg conflict, though unsought by the
Confederates, was important to them, in that it not only
appeased their impatience for action — for ennui is a lash —
but opened a vista of hope, while to the Federals it showed
what havoc might be wrought by the mere fragment of an
army they were following.
