to go but to my father's. We had nothing. We both
knew, however, that a loving welcome awaited us there
in my father's home.' We knew that he had an abundance
to eat. Nature's great larder, the Chuckatuck, ran but a
stone's throw from the back door, supplying with but lit-
tle labor terrapin, fish, oysters and crabs in abundance, and
bait was plentiful. It was there, then, to my childhood's
home, that the General decided we should go. But, how?
There was no way of getting there, no steamers running,
and the railroad was derailed for miles around. Then
again, there was no money; my husband had not a penny
in the world, and our friends were no better off.
On the afternoon of the second day after the General's
return, while we were planning about going, my little
brother Johnny came running in, saying:
"Sister, I saw riding by the door just now that same
Yankee who came here to see you the other day, and who
said he was brother George's friend. He knew me, and
asked how you were, and how's the baby,"
*' Oh, I forgot; I must tell you all about it," I said,
and I then told the General of the visitor I had had be-
fore he came back. When I had told him all, his gray
eyes filled with tears, and looking down he said, tenderly:
"Dear old Suckley! God bless him! That's just
like him. Where is his card? Find it for me, please,
little one. Dear old Suckley — dear old fellow — so
true!" he said, looking at the card.
I stooped down and took the General's dear head in
both my hands, and raising it up looked down search-
ingly into his earnest, loving eyes to see how he could
possibly speak so kindly and so affectionately of a
Yankee.
" So you have that same kind of ' off-duty ' feeling, too,
I see, that this Yankee doctor spoke of having," I said
