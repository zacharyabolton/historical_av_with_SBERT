It terminated in a tall cliff, a great rounded mass of
rock, which had been hurled from its native bed so many-
centuries before as to be now covered with a large forest.
This cliff furnished a position which seemed to ensure
victory to that leader who should be so fortunate, or so
wise, as to gain this point of vantage.
It was here that General George B. McClellan, the
astute engineer, brilliant but most unfortunate of military
leaders, recognizing at once the natural advantages and
strength of the position from which the battle was to be
fought, elected to make his stand. The position was
formidable in itself, and his clever corps of engineers
soon made it almost impregnable.
Directly in front of the cliff, separated from it by a
deep gorge, was a low, level field of about eight hundred
acres. This field was partly covered with a heavy crop
of oats which, together with a rank natural growth of
broom-sedge, afforded concealment to McClellan's sharp-
shooters and lines of skirmishers.
The Confederates, in order to make an attack upon the
stronghold on which McClellan stood at bay, were obliged
to advance over this field, a distance of about six hundred
yards, in direct line of approach. The cliff was defended by-
three tiers of field artillery and a heavy infantry support.
The battle was fought June 27, 1862. It was the turn-
ing-point of the Seven Days' Battles around Richmond.
For mxonths "On to Richmond" had been the war-cry of
the Federals. No event of the memorable campaign
which had followed that slogan was more important in
its results than this desperate conflict.
Pickett's brigade was ordered to the front and formed
in line of battle just under the brow of the hill, on the edge
of the field with its luxuriant covering of oats and sedge..
Kemper's brigade was stationed near Pickett's.
