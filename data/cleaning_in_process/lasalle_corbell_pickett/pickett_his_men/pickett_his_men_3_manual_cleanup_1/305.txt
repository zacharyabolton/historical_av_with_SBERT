Rodes to take possession of it. The arrival of Ewell on
the Heidlersburg road would bring him to the rear of
Doubleday, who would thus be imprisoned between him
and Hill with whom he was fighting. This would more
than compensate for Howard's reinforcement.
Sickles was marching to the field, and Howard's line
must be held until he came. Howard had not perceived
the danger descending from the north, and directed Schurz
to post Schimmelpfennig on Oak Hill, which he was pro-
ceeding to do when Rodes appeared upon the desired
point. Just then Howard learned of the approach of
Ewell, whose artillery opened fire obliquely upon Double-
day's line, and was weakly met by an ineffective counter-fire.
Ewell, coming down the Heidlersburg road, would
probably strike the position which Schurz was trying to
hold between Oak Hill and the Mummasburg road.
From the western slope of Oak Hill, Rodes's artillery
made incessant warfare on Doubleday's guns on the
Cashtown road and drove them back almost to the Semi-
nary. Rodes sent O'Neal's brigade against Doubleday's
reserves who were advancing to his aid. From behind a
stone wall the Federals repelled O'Neal's desperate
charge. Already shattered by Howard's batteries it was
with great difificulty that O'Neal rallied when beyond the
reach of the fire. To the left the Union forces found an-
other wall behind which they met the charge of Iverson,
and just at the crucial moment received reinforcements
sent by Doubleday.
Doubleday still held the points he had gained on Wil-
loughby Run. Meredith retained that tragic wood where
the Federals met with their saddest loss of the great battle,
Behind the chain of hills Cooper's batteries enfiladed the
slopes of Seminary Ridge from south to north.
Iverson's force made an attack here, vigorous but un-
