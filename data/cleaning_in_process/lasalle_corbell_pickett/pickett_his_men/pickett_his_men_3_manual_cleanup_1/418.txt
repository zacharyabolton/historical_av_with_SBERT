Matt Ransom's and Wallace's brigades, acting as one,
and, combined, not numbering over eight hundred men,
were on the left. Stuart's brigade, amounting to about one
thousand, was next on the right, and extended to the forks
of the roads. Then came Corse's brigade, one thousand
strong, and then Terry's, eight hundred strong, support-
ing Corse's on the right of the line. The six rifled pieces
of artillery were placed along the line at wide intervals.
Fitz Lee's cavalry was ordered into position on the left
flank; W. H. F. Lee's on the right flank; McCausland's
and Bearing's cavalry were all of Rosser's division that
were present, though they did fine service. The cavalry
numbered in all about twenty-five hundred men. Thus
cavalry, infantry and artillery amounted to not over six
thousand men, to meet Sheridan's cavalry, numbering in
itself more than five times that of Pickett's whole com-
mand. In addition to Sheridan's own force, he was sup-
ported by Warren's infantry corps.
As soon as the Confederates were in position they be-
gan cutting down trees, piling up logs, digging trenches
and erecting obstructions. Their work was interrupted
only when they were compelled to seize their guns to re-
pel an attack. Three times the labor was thus suspended,
the Federals having begun the attack upon the front as
soon as the line was formed. Having repelled the foe,
they would immediately return to their work, which they
enlivened by singing "My Maryland," "Dixie," and
"Bonnie Blue Flag."
The hurried work of three hours of these hungry,
march-fatigued veterans, a shallow ditch, a few loose, dirt-
covered pine logs were their only line of breastworks, and
yet these devoted men were ready to " do or die."
About two o'clock in the afternoon, a general advance
and attack began along the whole front and on the right
