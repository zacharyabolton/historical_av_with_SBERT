'Tis Pickett's charge at Gettysburg:
Brave leaders fell on every hand!
Unheard, unheeded, all command!
Battered in front and torn in flank;
A frenzied mob in broken rank!
They come like demons, with a yell,
And fight like demons, all pell-mell!
The wounded stop not till they fall;
The living never stop at all —
Their blood-bespattered faces say,
" 'Tis death alone stops men in gray,
With Pickett's charge at Gettysburg!"
Stopped Pickett's charge at Gettysburg
Where his last ofificer fell dead,
The peerkss, dashing Armistead!
Where ebbed the tide and left the slain
Like wreckage from the hurricane —
That awful spot which soldiers call
"The bloody angle of the wall, "
There Pickett stopped, turned back again
Alone, with just a thousand men!
And not another shot was fired —
So much is bravery admired!
Pickett had charged at Gettysburg.
Brave Pickett's charge at Gettysburg!
The charge of England's Light Brigade
Was nothing to what Pickett made
To capture Cemetery Hill —
To-day a cemetery still,
With flowers in the rifle-pit.
And no one cares to capture it.
The field belongs to those who fell;
They hold it without shot or shell;
While cattle yonder in the vale
Are grazing on the very trail
Where Pickett charged at Gettysburg.
