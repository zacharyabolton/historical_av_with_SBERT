who may oppose their movements. Such minority was precisely the case
of the Tories of our own revolution.
We see that secession had been acknowledged as a
right by all parts of the country. When at the Hartford
Convention New England threatened to secede because
she felt that her interests were prejudiced by the war with
England, she asserted her faith in the doctrine of the right
of States to protect that which most nearly concerned
