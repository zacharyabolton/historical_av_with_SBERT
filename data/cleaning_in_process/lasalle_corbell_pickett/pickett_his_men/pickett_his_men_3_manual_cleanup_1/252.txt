Federal commander might, from the point of view pre-
sented by military prudence, have refrained from pushing^
his project. Urged on by a sense of what was required
of him by popular opinion, and actuated by the thought
of the demoralization which would follow a retreat before
the first blow was struck, he persisted in crossing.
