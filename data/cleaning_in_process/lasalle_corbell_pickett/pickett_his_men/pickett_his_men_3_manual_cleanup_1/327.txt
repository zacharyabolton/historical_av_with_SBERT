the plain beyond, nevermore to thrill with the ardor of
earthly battles!
When this solemn, silent review was over detachments
were thrown forward to support the artillery, consisting of
one hundred and twenty cannon, stretched a mile along the
crests of Oak Ridge and Seminary Ridge. For five hours
the July sun poured its scorching rays almost vertically
down upon the supporting detachments lying in the tall
grass in the rear of the artillery-line, waiting in anxious
suspense for some sound or movement to break the awful
silence of the vast battle-field. The Federals on Ceme-
tery Hill marveled at the unexpected calm. Why did
not the long-looked-for attack begin?
Anderson held the wood west of the wheat-field, a little
to the north of Devil's Den. On the Emmitsburg road were
six batteries of the First Corps, forming, with the rest of the
artillery of this corps stationed near it, a slightly concave
line of seventy-five pieces along the ridge which Hum-
phreys had ineffectually tried to hold the day before. At
the right of the orchard a cross-fire was effected by Henry's
batteries. Alexander's were posted on the summit of a
slope to the north, and on his left, a little to the rear, was
the Washington Artillery, guarded by the battalions of
Cabell and Dearing. Lee intended to batter the point of
attack with Alexander's guns, which for that purpose
were placed ahead of the infantry. The troops which
were to make the attack were screened from view by the
ridge, Pickett's three brigades being supported by one of
Hill's light batteries. The assault was to be supported by
Hill's artillery on Seminary Hill, and a part of Ewell's
artillery was to fire on Cemetery Hill.
Signal-flags fluttered their portentous messages up and
down the line â€” death-tokens alike to that living wall
over which they waved and to the defenders of Cemetery
