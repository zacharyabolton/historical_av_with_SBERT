Thus we sat our horses in the glory of the sunbright
Southern morning, and chatted gaily of anything, every-
thing, nothings-just what came to us on the fleet wings
of the passing moment, while the guns over on the enemy's
lines troubled the air with their thunderous roar, the puffs
of smoke adding their touches of artistic grace to the
landscape. The balls were aimless. They harmed nothing
but the helpless and unresisting earth, which was scarred
where they fell. It was a playtime of war.
The captain bade us adieu, lifted his hat and rode on
in advance, riding in that graceful way which the South-
erner has by inheritance from a long line of ancestors
who have been accustomed to ride over wide reaches
of land. I watched him as he rode on, then â€” my heart
in terror stands still even now, as I faintly try to record
the dread sight. The captain's horse dashed on down the
lines, bearing a headless body. One of the aimless balls,
alas! had found a mark.
