General Pickett having planned the capture of Plym-
outh, he was, of course, to have commanded in person,
but just upon the eve of his starting out from his head-

Colonel D. B. Harris.
On the 5th of May, the very day of Butler's advance,
Colonel Walter Harrison, Pickett's inspector-general, and
Major Giles T. Cooke, Beauregard's inspector-general,
