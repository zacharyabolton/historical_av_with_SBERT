Keyes was broken an4 driven from its ground, most of
them along Williamsburg road to Heintzelman's line and
two brigades into White Oak swamp.
In the meantime, Johnston had left the control to
Longstreet and Hill, and had gone to the Nine-Mile
road to watch for reinforcements which might be sent
to the Unionists from beyond the Chickahominy. He
had supposed that the sound of the musketry at the
opening of the action would be audible from that point.
By some fatality, the wind carried the sound away from
hi?n, only four miles distant from the scene of action,
and bore it to McClellan, lying ill ten miles away, who
recognized the situation and sent Sumner forward to Fair
Oaks.
Johnston, with Smith and Whiting, was to have made
an attack upon the Federals' right simultaneously with
Longstreet's advance, but was prevented by his failure
to catch the reports of the musketry fire until it was too
late to co-operate fully. He then sent Smith forward
along the Nine-Mile road. The Sixth North Carolina,
being in advance, encountered the Federal skirmishers
and drove them back. As Johnston rode on with Hood's
brigade, he stopped near Fair Oaks to witness a contest
between Smith and a body of Federal infantry supported
by a battery, but supposing that Smith was able to hold
his ground, he sent Hood on to join Longstreet and attack
the right flank of the Federals. General Couch had gone
toward Fair Oaks to attack the Confederate left when he
was met by Smith and Johnston,
At 4.30 General Sumner arrived at Fair Oaks with
Sedgwick's division and Kirby's battery, having suc-
ceeded in crossing the river on two bridges not yet com-
pleted. Here he was attacked by Smith with Hampton's,
Pettigrew's and Hatton's brigades. Smith was repulsed,
