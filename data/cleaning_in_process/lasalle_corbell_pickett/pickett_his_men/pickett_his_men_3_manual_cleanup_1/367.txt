The expedition to capture Plymouth, the capital of
Washington County, North Carolina, which General Pick-
ett had planned to take effect some time before, was just
then about to set out.
This town, situated a few miles south of Roanoke River
where it enters Albemarle Sound, had been captured in
1862 by an expedition led by Burnside, and was now oc-
cupied by twenty-four hundred men under command of
Wessells.
Pickett now maintained that too much time had been
wasted, and that the delay of this project, which delay had
had its origin with the authorities at Richmond, rendered
the execution of the plan at this late hour both rash and in-
expedient. He held that, inasmuch as danger threatened
Petersburg, the troops then in North Carolina for the pur-
pose of moving on to Plymouth, instead of being kept
there, should be ordered back at once to the defense of
the endangered city.
Pickett again pointed out the weakness of Petersburg,
how ineffectual were the defenses on the tide-water and
approach to Richmond, and pleaded that immediate action
should be taken in that direction. He asked that the ex-
pedition be abandoned, and that the three brigades of his
division (Barton's, Corse's and Terry's) which had been
left in North Carolina after the affair of Newbern should
be sent to him without delay. Hunton's brigade of his di-
vision was still retained around the defenses of Richmond.
