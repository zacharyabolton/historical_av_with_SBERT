While I wrestled with these perplexities my train of
thought was interrupted by the ringing of a bell and a
loud voice shouting:
" Passengers will please walk into the custom-house
office and show their passports!"
The laws were so strict that no one could leave any
city in the South without a passport from the military
authorities stationed there. My grandmother had given
me her "oath of allegiance," which everybody in those
dread days immediately after the surrender of the army was
compelled to take, in order to purchase medicine, food or
clothing of any sort, or for the transaction of any kind of
business whatsoever. It was a rare occurrence that a man
was found who would take this iron-clad oath, for, no
matter how great the exigencies might be, he was branded
as a traitor if he yielded to them. Consequently, the
women, who were most bitter, too, in their feelings, were
obliged to make a sacrifice of their convictions and prin-

the absolute suffering of their loved ones. Illness in the
family and the urgent necessity for quinine and salt left
my unselfish little grandmother no alternative, and hav-
ing taken this oath herself she found in it a kind of
safety. It had, at any rate, brought her relief, and she
wanted that I should have it with me, as a sort of
"mascot" or safeguard.
With carpet-bag, basket and baby, I started into the
custom-house office and explained to the officer in charge:
" I am very sorry, sir, that I have no passport. The
steamer was about to sail as I reached Norfolk. I came
from a little village thirty miles beyond, where passports
are not given. I have an oath of allegiance, if that will
answer in its place."
The officer, laughing, said:
