brigade was hurried up as quickly as possible, followed
by the other brigades. The Federal forces were driven
back toward Bermuda Hundred. They fought hard to
hold the line recently given up by Beauregard, but the
whole line was retaken, and was held by Pickett's division
from that time on until March, 1865, when it was relieved
by Mahone's division and sent off to meet Sheridan's
cavalry raid upon the upper James and around Richmond.
Lee said it was not his intention that this attack on
Bermuda Hundred should be carried to such an extent,
but he was so delighted and gratified with the result, and
so proud of the perseverance and daring of his brave
Virginians that he afterward wrote a complimentary
acknowledgment of their service in the following letter
to Anderson:
Clay's House, 5.30 p.m., June 17, 1864.
Lieutenant-General R. H. Anderson,
Commanding Longstreet's Corps.
General: I take great pleasure in presenting to you my congratula-
tions upon the conduct of the men of your corps. I believe they will
carry anything they are put against. We tried very hard to stop Pick-
ett's men from capturing the breastworks of the enemy, but could not
do it. I hope his loss has been small.
I am, with respect, your obedient servant,
R. E. Lee, General.
On the 17th, the morning after the battle of Drury's
Farm, Longstreet's corps pursued the Federals to the
Howlett House on the James River, and bivouacked for
the night in an unfinished earthwork not more than six
hundred yards from the Federal gunboats and monitors,
which kept up an incessant shelling throughout the night.
On the i8th, the corps marched toward Manchester,
and thence on the morning of the 20th, by way of the
Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad to Milford Station,
