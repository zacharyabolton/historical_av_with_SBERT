not proved an unmitigated evil. It has imposed upon
the South a political burden she was little able to bear,
but it has also given her a political strength which she
would not otherwise have enjoyed. Though it has
wrought injury to its unfortunate victim, who was help-
lessly and unconsciously legislated into duties for which
he was not fitted and responsibilities of which he had not
the faintest conception, retarding his progress and lead-
ing him to depend upon politics instead of individual
effort, it has increased Southern representation in Con-
gress and given the South a legislative power which she
never before exerted. It has created race prejudice
where it did not before exist, but its worst effects will
melt away in the sunlight of the prosperity which has
dawned so gloriously for the summer-land.
Thus, the dark shadow lifted from her pathway, the
South moves forward on her heaven-lit course to her
brilliant destiny.
