Though my husband's friend, General Breckenridge,
our Secretary of War, had, in his thoughtfulness, offered
me the opportunity of leaving our dear old Confederate
capital with him and his family, I remembered that Gen-
eral Pickett had left me here, and obediently determined
to remain until he should come or send for me. I grate-
fully thanked General Breckenridge for his kindness, but
said:
" I am like the boy who stood on the burning deck. I
can not go until the one voice calls me."
So my husband's good friend was regretfully forced to
leave me.
The days were made up of fears and anguish unspeak-
able. The clock struck only midnight hours for me.
Rumors of the death of the General were credited
(I saw by the look in everybody's face), though no word
was said, and I would not ask a question nor let anybody
speak to me of him. The last letter I had received from
him had been dated the 30th of March, at Hatcher's
Run, the extreme right of the Confederate line at that
time. Most of the letter was written in Chinook. This
is a quotation from it:
Heavy rains; roads and streams almost impassable. Wliile Gen-
eral Lee was holding a conference with his chiefs this morning a mes-
sage came from General Fitz Lee, stating that through a prisoner he had
learned that the Federal cavalry, fifteen thousand strong, supported by
heavy infantry, were at or near Dinwiddle Court-House. This decided
the General's plans, and he has placed General Fitz Lee in command
of the whole cavalry, Rosser's, W. H. F. Lee's, and his own, with
orders to march upon Five Forks. I am to support with my small
force of artillery and infantry this movement and take command
of the whole force.
The letter was in full faith of a short separation and
that all would be well, that he would surely return, and
