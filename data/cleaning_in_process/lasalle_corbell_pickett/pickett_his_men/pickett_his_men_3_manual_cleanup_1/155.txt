I never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especially if you have got a
bad memory, is the -worst enemy a fellow can have. The fact is truth

At the close of the letter he said:
Now, boy, on your march, don't you go and forget the old maxim

Load your musket with this maxim, and smoke it in your pipe.
Pickett remembered, for there was not a drop of gall
in his whole life.
Short as was Mr, Lincoln's time when he passed through
Richmond after its surrender, he came to the old Pickett
home to hunt up his friend and former partner, the Gen-
