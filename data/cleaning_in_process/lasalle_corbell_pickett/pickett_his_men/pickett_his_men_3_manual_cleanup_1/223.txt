General Lee, having won the second battle of Ma-
nassas, pushed on into Maryland with his whole army,
arriving at Frederick City on the 8th of September. The
next day he issued Order No. 191, afterward known as
the "Lost Order."
This order directed Jackson to go through Sharpsburg,
cross the Potomac, capture Martinsburg, and help take
Harper's Ferry. Longstreet was to remain at Boonsboro
with the trains. McLaws was to station his command on
the heights of Harper's Ferry and capture the force in
the town, assisted by Walker, and guarded in the rear by
D. H. Hill. After these movements had been effected the
commands were to meet again at Boonsboro or Hagers-
town.
This was a well-laid plan, and Lee had carefully pre-
pared the order for the guidance of his own generals and
not for the instruction of the Federal commander. A
copy was sent from headquarters to D. H. Hill who, hav-
ing been transferred to Jackson's command, received his
order from the hand of his new chief. The copy which
was intended for him served the useful purpose of a cigar-
wrapper until it chanced to be left behind in camp, where
it was found by a prowling Federal soldier. On the
morning of September 13th it was placed in the hands
of McClellan, and in the afternoon he was on the way
to the pass in South Mountain on the Boonsboro and
Fredericksburg road.
