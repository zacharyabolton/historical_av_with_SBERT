death-sounds, and with nerves strained to the highest ten-
sion awaited the results. Not only did they have their
own near and dear to think of, but from all the South had
poured in letters to friends and relatives, with the sacred
charge, " care for and watch out for our loved ones if
wounded." From all quarters of the Confederacy wives
followed their husbands to the scene of action. Every
available house, public and private, was sought for by the
refugees in the city.
To these strangers in a strange land it had been a trial
of no slight moment to listen to those death-dealing
monsters and know that a dear one's life was at stake.
Ah, yes; this battle had thrilled the city to its center.
Richmond authorities were unprepared for so extraordi-
nary a call upon their accommodations. Buildings were
hastily fitted up with the barest of comforts; medical and
all other stores were inadequate to the demand. The
doctors were employed day and night. The women, young
and old, volunteered their services as nurses. In every
house soups and other delicacies were made for the
wounded. Though much suffering was in a measure
mitigated, many a precious life, which otherwise might
have been saved, was lost for want of ordinary attention.
For days and nights wagons and ambuiances never
ceased to empty their wretched loads before the doors of
each of these hastily improvised hospitals until the build-
ings overflowed with maimed humanity. There was not an
empty store in which rude pallets were not strewn over
the floor and counter. In the dressing of the wounds —
rough it must have seemed, in spite of every effort to
make it gentle — the racking of quivering nerves passed all
bounds of patient endurance. Screams of agony would
sometimes break out upon the open air with startling
emphasis.
