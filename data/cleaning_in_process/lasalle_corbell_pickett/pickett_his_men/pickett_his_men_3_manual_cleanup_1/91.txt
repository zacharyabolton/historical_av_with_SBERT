The first week in June the French maid came to our
room with a telegram for Mr. Edwards, announcing that
Mr. and Mrs. Hutton would sail for home from England
the following week.
My husband calculated about what time they would
arrive, and how soon we would be forced to give up the
comforts of their beautiful and luxurious home, which we
were then enjoying. We began to hunt for a place to live,
commencing with the hotels and larger boarding-houses,
and v/inding up with the smaller ones. After a week of
varied, and some very funny, experiences, we decided at
last upon one house, principally because of its attractive
court and the pleasant verandas overlooking it.
"With its glistening fountain and pretty shrubbery and
flowers, how nice for our baby," I said. " How cool and
refreshing the sound of the water, and the glimpse of
green."
So, for baby's sake, the selection was made and our
rooms engaged. Our landlady was a very dark bru-
nette, and prided herself upon being a French Canadian,
but
"That man of mine," she sorrowfully said, "is a soggy
Englishman, and you would hardly believe it possible he
could be the father of our two beautiful daughters. Both
of them are going to do well, but they don't take after their
pa. The oldest is engaged to be married to a Stateser
with nine businesses!"
