McClellan's advance was delayed by a meeting with
Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry. When he reached the field he
placed his batteries near the center and massed his corps
on both sides of the Sharpsburg turnpike. Four batteries
were on the height above Antietam at the right; on the
crest near the third bridge, afterward known as the Burn-
side Bridge, were Weed's and Benjamin's guns. Between
these points were ten or more batteries.
On the Hagerstown road was a chapel known as Dunker
Church. West of this church Hood was placed to defend
the road, supported by S. D. Lee's artillery, to the east
and beyond the road. North of the church was a field of
corn turning golden in the warm sunlight. All around
grew the soft grass, green and beautiful, on the banks of
the life-giving river. Beyond were the cool shades of the
East Wood. On the west of the road was the West Wood,
a towering forest of oaks. On the western side of the
turnpike, its left sheltered by the West Wood, was the
Stonewall division under D. R. Jones.
McClellan's Ninth Corps under Cox was stationed with
Burnside on the left at Burnside Bridge. Hooker, with
the First Corps, was on the right. At two o'clock Hooker
crossed the creek at Williamsport Bridge and attacked
Longstreet's left brigades. As he advanced to the charge,
his muskets flashing brilliantly in the last rays of the sun,
he was received and repelled by Hood and the batteries
of S. D. Lee. When the crossing of Hooker was reported
to General Lee, he sent Jackson to command the entire
battle of the left wing.
At the East Wood Hooker's skirmishers met McLaw's
veterans and were driven back to the edge of the wood.
As they retired the curtain of night fell slowly over the
scene and the soft rain descended, as if nature, with gentle
hand, would wash away the stains of war.
