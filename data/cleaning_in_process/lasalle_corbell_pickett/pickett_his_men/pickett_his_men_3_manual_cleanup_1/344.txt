to the cause for which he fought, and in the performance
of that duty he asked that this thing might be done. His
wishes were respected then, and through all the years that
have passed since that time they have not been forgotten.
The most alluring temptations have not brought that re-
port from the oblivion to which it was consigned in the
far-away past.
The hand which penned those blood-stained notes,
reaching from the grave, is as powerful as when it un-
sheathed the sword upon the field of battle, and it draws
across them still the mark of silence. They are all our
own â€” they who went down in the battle-fire, they who
left the field with heavy hearts and reluctant steps, long-
ing to stay behind with their comrades who had passed
beyond the conflict, our tried and true, our best-beloved.
May the soft veil of mercy and love enfold them forever!
