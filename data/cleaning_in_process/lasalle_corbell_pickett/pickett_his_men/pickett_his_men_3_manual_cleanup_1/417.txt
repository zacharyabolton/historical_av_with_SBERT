small force directed to hold it could easily have been
turned on the right or left and isolated from the main
army at Petersburg, It was, therefore, a most unfortu-
nate selection of a field on which to meet a superior force,
and yet six thousand men — infantry, cavalry and artillery,
all told — were stationed here to hold the ground against
an attack by thirty-five thousand troops, supported by

but the effort was, nevertheless, most bravely made.

the holding of Five Forks would be hazardous, cheerfully
worked and waited. It was nine o'clock on Saturday
morning, when the line was formed. The number and
disposition of the Confederate force was as follows:
