of 1858. He was betrayed by Forbes, an English adven-
turer, who had joined in the project and who, being dis-
appointed in his effort to depose Brown and usurp his
place, took this method of avenging himself. For this
reason action was postponed to the following year.
In the autumn of 1859 John Brown assembled together
eighteen other minds almost as warped as his own, and
made his disastrous descent upon Harper's Ferry, falling
into the hands of Colonel Robert E. Lee and his detach-
ment of United States marines, and met the fate that is
most likely to befall a man who mistakes both himself
and the era in which he lives.
The singular qualities of this most morbidly erratic
character in the whole dark history of slavery agitation
are thus set forth by Governor Wise, of Virginia, who vis-
ited him in the guard-house:
"They are mistaken who take him for a madman. He
is a man of clear head, courageous fortitude, and simple
ingenuousness. He is cool, collected, and indomitable;
and it is but just to him to say that he was humane to his
prisoners; and he inspired all with great trust in his in-
tegrity and as a man of truth. He is a fanatic, vain and
garrulous, but firm, truthful, and intelligent."
On the 2d of December, 1859, the name of John Brown
was added to the roll of martyrs on one side of the divid-
ing line, and to the list of defeated criminals on the other,
and it would have been lost in the dust which time throws
upon the name and fame of all ill-guided enthusiasts, had
not the rapid succession of startling events immediately
subsequent to this period kept "his soul marching on."
Though these things all happened but one year be-
fore South Carolina formally seceded from the Union,
Wendell Phillips said over the coffin of the fallen fanatic:
"I do not believe slavery will go down in blood."
