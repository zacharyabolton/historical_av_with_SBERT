out its sheltering arms to screen troops from the fire of
an attacking party. The hand of man had come to the
assistance of nature in rearing this gigantic fortification,
and had constructed, probably for some peaceful purpose
now unknown, a road guarded by a stone wall. Behind
this wall a force of musketry might be concealed, from
which an incessant fusillade could be kept up, with no pos-
sibility of an effective counter-fire.
On the i8th, one of Longstreet's divisions under Mc-
Laws set out for Fredericksburg, another under Ransom
marching toward the North Anna. The next day, finding
that the whole Union army was on the way to Fredericks-
burg, Lee ordered the remaining divisions to go forward.
On the 19th, Longstreet took possession of the heights
of Fredericksburg, thereby securing an advantage which
assured him the victory, those hills being invincible when
well fortified. There was Longstreet on the 21st day of
November, when General Sumner called Fredericksburg
to surrender.
In the meantime, Burnside had reached Falmouth,
where he intended to cross. Here he was delayed by the
fact that the bridges had been destroyed by heavy rains,
and the pontoons which had been ordered from Washing-
ton had failed to arrive, by reason of a mistake as to whose
duty it was to send them forward, and the indifference of
the commander-in-chief as to whether they went forward
or not. While Burnside waited with what patience he
might, Lee's army beyond the river busied itself in forti-
fying the heights.
On the 19th of November, Franklin and Hooker en-
camped about ten miles from Falmouth on the northeast
side of the river, Franklin at Stafford Court-house and
Hooker at Hartwood, The Federal batteries, one hundred
and forty-seven siege-guns and long-range field-batteries
