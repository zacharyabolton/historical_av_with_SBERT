gleaming and beautiful, but I did not love it. It seemed
to glow with the baleful fires of war. My great loving,
tender, white star was like a symbol of peace looking
down with serenest compassion.
" Our star," he had said, as we stood together only
one little evening before — how long ago it seemed — and
gazed upward to find what comfort we might in its soft
radiance. "Wherever we may be, we will look aloft into
the night sky, where it shines with steady light, and feel
that our thoughts and hearts are together."
I fell asleep, saying softly in my heart, " God's lights
to guide him."
There were no steamers and no railroads from my
home to Norfolk, but my father secured a pungy — a lit-
tle oyster-boat — and the following day we, baby and I,
started off. My father's heart was almost broken at
parting from me so soon again. I was going, he knew
not where, but knowing that "what God hath joined to-
gether, no man should put asunder," he could not say
one word to keep me.
A storm came up just after we had gotten out of
Chuckatuck Creek, and we were delayed in arriving at
Norfolk. We had hoped to be there some hours before
the departure of the Baltimore steamer, but reached the
wharf as the plank was about to be taken in, so that my
father barely had time to say good-by to me and put me
on board.
