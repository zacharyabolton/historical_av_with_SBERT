Speaking of the character of the Irish as soldiers, Gen-
eral Lee says: " Cleburne, on our side, inherited the intre-
pidity of his race. On a field of battle he shone like a
meteor in a clouded sky. As a dashing military man, he
was all virtue; a single vice did not stain him as a warrior.
His generosity and benevolence had no limits. The care
which he took of the fortunes of his ofificers and soldiers,
from the greatest to the least, was incessant. His integ-
rity was proverbial, and his modesty was an equally con-
spicuous trait in his character. Meagher, on your side,
though not Cleburne's equal in military genius, rivaled
him in bravery and in the affections of his soldiers. The
gallant stand which his bold brigade made on the heights
of Fredericksburg is well known. Never were men so
brave. They ennobled their race by their splendid gal-
lantry on that desperate occasion. Though totally routed,
they reaped harvests of glory. Their brilliant, though
hopeless, assaults on our lines excited the hearty applause
of our ofificers and soldiers."
It has been estimated that on that portion of the plain
over which the Union forces charged upon the heights
of Fredericksburg the killed and wounded, on the night
of the 13th, averaged a thousand to the acre â€” one out of
every twenty being a soldier of the Irish brigade.
For the first time the Irish brigade went into battle
unsheltered by the flag of Erin, that has waved over
deeds of Irish heroism on the battle-fields of every nation
on the globe, the Twenty-eighth Massachusetts being the
only regiment that bore the national colors. The flags
of the other regiments had been sent to New York, that
their tattered folds might be cherished in sacred memory
of Gaelic virtue; a new set of colors had been provided
