fire to it. As Early could not cross the Susquehanna,
he returned to his corps.
At Chambersburg, Lee delivered an address with the
refrain, "Vengeance is Mine," and issued an order that
there should be no retaliation, and that private property
should not be destroyed.
Lee's army had been increased to its maximum
strength. Pickett's division had reinforced Longstreet's
corps. The Fourteenth Virginia Regiment marched to join
Pickett's division, and was afterward in time for the close
of the battle of Gettysburg, where it fought in Armistead's
brigade, and its colonel, James G. Hodges, was killed in
the great charge of July 3. So thoroughly had Lee con-
centrated his army that when he suggested to President
Davis that Beauregard should make a demonstration upon
Culpeper to divert Hooker's attention Davis replied that
there were not enough men left to make it possible.
Jenkins had taken possession of Greencastle and
Chambersburg. At the latter place he proceeded to gather
in the supplies of which his army was in great need, pay-
ing for them in the most liberal manner with Confederate
scrip. Of his commercial methods the editor of a Cham-
bersburg paper said :
True, the system of Jenkins would be considered a little informal
in business circles; but it's his way, and our people are agreed to it, per-
haps, to some extent, because of the novelty, but mainly because of the
necessity of the thing.
On Jenkins personally he commented thus;
He graduated at Jefferson College in this State, and gave promise
of future usefulness and greatness. His downward career commenced
some five years ago, when in an evil hour he became a member of Con-
gress from Western Virginia, and from thence may be dated his decline
and fall.
