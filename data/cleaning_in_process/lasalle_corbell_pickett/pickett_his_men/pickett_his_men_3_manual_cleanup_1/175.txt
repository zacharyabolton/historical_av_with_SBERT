resulted in giving commercial success to the North in pref-
erence to the South, The undeniable facts still remained,
that in colonial days the South was the seat of power, and
that she had now fallen to a minor place.
Again, in 1842-43 Massachusetts and Ohio proposed a
"peaceful dissolution of the Union," as preferable to re-

In 1844, when the discussion of the annexation of Texas

At a large meeting in the Williamsburg District it was re-
