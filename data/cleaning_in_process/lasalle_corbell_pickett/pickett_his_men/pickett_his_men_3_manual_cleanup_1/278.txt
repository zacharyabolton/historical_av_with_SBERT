by the Confederate infantry caused them to retire to a line
which they succeeded in holding to the end of the day.
The roads centering at Chancellorsville passed under
control of the Confederates, who pressed forward until
Stuart, fighting the Union right, effected a junction with
Lee's main army.
As the Union forces fell back, the Confederate artil-
lery was brought more into play, and the Chancellor House,
where Hooker had his headquarters, was soon under fire.
Hooker was struck by a falling column and for a while
was supposed to be dead. Much time was lost before he
became conscious, and his dazed condition for the rest of
the day rendered him incapable of determinate direction.
Sedgwick waited at Fredericksburg until the night of
the 2d, when he received orders to destroy the Confeder-
ate force and march at once to Chancellorsville, falling
upon Lee's rear while Hooker attacked him on the front.
To do this, the heights of Fredericksburg must be scaled.
Early driven off, and a march of eleven miles effected.
These arduous duties were so far accomplished as to bring
him out upon the Chancellorsville road in pursuit of
Barksdale's Mississippians, with Banks's Ford in his rear,
affording him an opportunity of recrossing the river
should it become necessary. Here he was met by Mc-
Laws, sent by Lee to stop Sedgwick's progress.
Sedgwick soon found that he must either avail himself
of the opportunity of retreat furnished by the proximity
of Banks's Ford, or fight the whole Army of Northern
Virginia, with no support from Hooker, whose despatches
indicated a vacillation of mind which foreboded no good
to any one whose safety depended upon prompt action by
^'-^e commander-in-chief.
