have suffered in our just cause. It was my lot to be ac-
quainted with but one of the officers who fell on this oc-
casion, Colonel John B. Strange, Nineteenth Virginia
Volunteers. His tried valor on other fields, and heroic
conduct in animating his men to advance upon the enemy,
with his latest breath, and after he had fallen mortally
wounded, will secure imperishable honor for his name
and memory."
Captain Brown, of Colonel Strange's regiment, says:
"In this engagement Colonel J. B. Strange fell, seriously
wounded, and in the retreat was left behind. His voice
was heard after he had received his wound, urging his
men to stand firmly, and he commanded with that cool-
ness and daring that is found only in the truly brave."
In this contest at Turner's Gap the command of Reno,
one of the finest officers on the Union side, met the
brigade of our gallant and brilliant General Garland, and
both leaders were killed. Among the wounded was Lieu-
tenant-Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes, commanding the
Twenty-third Ohio, who received a rifle-ball in his arm.
The fight at Crampton's Gap between a part of Mc-
Laws's forces with Stuart's cavalry and Franklin's com-
mand had taken place at the same time. At nightfall
Franklin's banner waved from the crest above Crampton's
Gap, and Lee ordered the withdrawal of his troops from
Turner's Gap and their removal to Sharpsburg. The
battle was lost, but the delay suffered by McClellan in
winning it had enabled Jackson to take possession of
Harper's Ferry. At noon of the next day Lee received
the following note from Jackson: "Through God's bless-
ing. Harper's Ferry and its garrison are to be surren-
dered."
At that moment Lee resolved to stand and meet the
enemy at Sharpsburg.
