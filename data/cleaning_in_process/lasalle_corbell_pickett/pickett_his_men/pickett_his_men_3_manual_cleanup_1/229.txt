most of the field-officers were killed or wounded. As
Lawton was carried off the field, Hood's brigades came
dashing up from the church, leaving their half-cooked
breakfast to the tender mercies of the camp-fire. At the
same time three of D. H. Hill's brigades came through
the Confederate center and attacked Ricketts.
Before this onslaught Hooker retreated to the protec-
tion of his guns, leaving about one-fourth of his men on
the field. Mansfield led out his two divisions in an effort
to regain the ground which Hooker had lost. The battle
in the corn raged anew and Mansfield went to swell the
roll of the fallen.
Early, who had taken the place of the wounded Law-
ton, held the position left vacant by Jackson's division,
which had been withdrawn at seven o'clock. Hood,
who had returned to the field, joined with Early and held
the ground under a heavy fire of a force far greater than
their own.
At half past eight Sumner crossed the Antietam and en-
tered East Wood, followed by Sedgwick. As he turned with
his six thousand toward the West Wood, he was met by a
storm of shells from Stuart's guns and a shower of canister
from Jackson's batteries.' Behind the ledges of rock stood
Grigsby and his three hundred, and from their points of
vantage they held Sumner in check until his way to de-
struction was prepared. Hood's division had been shat-
tered, but McLaws had reached the field and, with Ander-
son and Walker, came to the support of Grigsby and
Early, and Sumner was swept away in a storm of fire.
This was followed by a heavy attack on the center,
which was hurled back by G. B. Anderson and Rodes, of
D. H. Hill's division, and part of Walker's command, with
a few pieces of artillery. French's brigades took refuge
behind the crest of a hill from which they kept up a des-
