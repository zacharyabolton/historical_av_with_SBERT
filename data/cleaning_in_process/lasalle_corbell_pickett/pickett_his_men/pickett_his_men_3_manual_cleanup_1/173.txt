the Kentucky resolution of 1798, In 1832, Mr. Clay's bill
providing for "a reduction of duties upon foreign prod-
ucts, except where they came in conflict with articles of
domestic manufacture," was regarded by the South as fix-
ing upon the country the protective system, a policy
which was favorable to the manufacturers of the North,
but not to the agriculturists of the South.
On the 24th of November, 1832, the convention called
by the Legislature of South Carolina declared the tariff
act to be null and void, and that the State would be ab-
solved from allegiance to the Union if the government
should attempt to enforce the act, and would establish
an independent government. The threatened war was
averted by the efforts of the great " Compromiser," Clay,
who modified his tariff bill to meet the demands of South
Carolina, and secession was once more postponed to the
future.
The general opinion among the leaders of the South is
thus illustrated by the following statement made by the
great nullifier: "Nothing short of a negative, absolute
or in effect, on the part of the government of a State
can possibly protect it against the encroachments of the
united government of the States, whenever their powers
come in conflict."
In the closing year of his long life, that wise and far-
sighted statesman, Madison, wrote: "The visible suscep-
tibility to the contagion of nullification in the Southern
States, the sympathy arising from known causes, and the in-
culcated impression of a permanent incompatibility of in-
terest between the North and the South, may put it in the
power of popular leaders, aspiring to the highest stations,
to unite the South, on some critical occasion, in some course
of action of which nullification may be the first step, se-
cession the second, and a farewell separation the last.'*
