Tavern. Most of Matt Ransom's brigade had already-
gone across the river at Exeter Mills.
On the following morning, just as the day was breaking,
Pickett, in accordance with the orders received from Ander-
son, started out with his command, but he had not gone very
far on his way when he found the road blocked and strewn
with stragglers from Heth's and Wilcox's divisions.
These wanderers informed Pickett that the lines in
front of Petersburg had been forced, that they had been
cut off from Petersburg, and that Anderson had gone
on toward Amelia Court-house. Assured of the truth of
this information, Pickett immediately followed on up the
river, and on the evening of the same day (the 2d of
April) joined Anderson at Deep Creek, nearly famished,
for no rations had been issued since the scanty supply of
the 29th â€” and yet not a murmur was heard.
A few hours afterward Hunton's brigade, numbering
about nine hundred, reported. This brigade had also
been severely engaged, meeting with serious loss. On
their march they learned that their beloved A. P. Hill
had been killed at Petersburg, and just as they were going
into bivouac came, too, the first sad intelligence of the
evacuation of Richmond and its partial destruction by
fire. These mournful tidings struck a knell of despair to
every heart, but especially to those whose families and
homes, together with all their worldly possessions, were
within the captured, burning city.
With the light which we now have, it seems strange
that this' blow should have been made heavier by com-
ing as a surprise, but the fact was, that the loss of
their capital was a calamity for which the Confeder-
ate soldiers were wholly unprepared. It seemed, how-
ever, but to strengthen their resolve as they perseveringly
marched on.
