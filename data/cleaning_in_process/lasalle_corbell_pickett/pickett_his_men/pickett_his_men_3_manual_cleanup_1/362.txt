At two o'clock in the morning, Pickett's infantry met
the Federal troops at Bachelor's Creek seven miles dis-
tant from Newbern. The advance picket and vedette
were silently captured, and the reserve sought protection
in a small fort just beyond the bridge. This bridge, be-
ing made of loose planks, was taken away by the guard in
the retreat, and the stream, too deep to ford, proved
an impassable barrier to the assailants. Thus the Con-
federate advance was checked, and the gallant little Fed-
eral force held its position till it was reinforced. During
this engagement sixty-seven men were killed; among
them, Colonel Shaw, who was supporting the advance.
Early in the morning Hoke's brigade crossed the
stream, flanking the Federals and opening the way to
Newbern. Corse had already crossed, captured a large
force of Federals, which had been encamped on the rail-
road, and forced back the garrison into Newbern,
The Confederates had succeeded in surprising New-
bern, and had taken all the outworks and defenses in
front. Almost victorious, they waited with impatience
for the attack on the other side, which was to have been
made by Barton's column, and which would have enabled
them to enter Newbern without opposition. Not a sound
was heard. The suspense was unbearable. Fear and
anxiety began to crowd out hope.
The marsh prevented communication between the dif-
ferent divisions of the troops. The failure was incom-
prehensible to all. Hour after hour of restless impatience
went by and yet no gun was fired, no attack was made by
Barton's column. Through a whole day of torture Pickett
waited in deathlike suspense with the prize of Newbern
almost within his grasp. Barton, it seems, regarded the
Federal defenses as too formidable to attack with any
reasonable hopes of success.
