carrying out orders and the ability they evinced in conducting their
regiments when separated from me.
I take pleasure in calling attention to the efficient service rendered to
my own brigade, as well as to others, by the gallant Captain Manning,
aide-de-camp to the major-general commanding. To my personal staff,
CatDtain Croxton and Lieutenants Baird and Pickett, I am much indebted
for the continuous and arduous duties they performed under a most
galling fire. Having been sent with an order, Captain Croxton was with
General Pryor and Lieutenant-Colonel Berkeley, of the Eighth, during
the early part of the engagement. These gentlemen speak of the great
assistance which he rendered them. I respectfully call the attention of
the major-general commanding to those specially mentioned by their
colonels in regimental reports.
I must also mention the dastardly subterfuges of an enemy professing
to be civilized, such as raising a white flag and pretending to surrender
in order to stop our fire, to allow their reinforcements to come up and
enable them to pour in deadly volleys upon an honorable and too un-
suspicious foe.
Our loss was severe: Officers killed, two; enlisted men killed,
twenty-four; officers wounded, nine; enlisted men wounded, one hundred
and twenty-nine; officers missing, one; enlisted men missing, twenty-five.
Total killed, wounded and missing, one hundred and ninety. The brigade
entered the action with fifteen hundred and twenty-nine muskets. Ac-
compan3'ing is a full list of casualties.
I am. Captain, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
