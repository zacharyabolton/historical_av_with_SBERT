assumed that the Rosario Strait answered to the require-
ment of the language, "separates the continent from Van-
couver's Island," whereas Canal de Haro merely "sepa-
rates Vancouver's Island from the continent," an illustra-
tion of the importance of linguistic purism in the science
of diplomacy. As his nation had drawn up the treaty,
and was therefore responsible for the peculiar wording,
it was scarcely becoming in him to set forth that claim,
in violation of the law of nations which provides that a
difficulty of construction shall not be decided in favor of
the nation creating the obscurity.
Being unable to support his claim, he offered as a
substitute a smaller channel which would include San
Juan in the British possessions. The United States com-
missioner refused to accept this compromise. The British
commissioner had received rigid instructions, and had no
power to accept any line that would not give San Juan to
Great Britain. He said, "beyond what I now offer I
can no further go."
It was only reasonable to suppose that the nearest
natural boundary which would avoid the necessity of
cutting Vancouver's Island would be the one sought.
This boundary was the Canal de Haro. In the communi-
cation by Mr. McLane, who had been sent specially to
Great Britain to aid in the negotiations, to Mr. Buchanan,
then Secretary of State, he specifically mentions the ex-
tension of the line by the Canal de Haro and the Strait
of Fuca to the ocean, no reference being made to Rosario.
He states that this proposition now made by Lord Aber-
deen was suggested by his (Mr. McLane's) immediate
predecessor as one which his government might accept.
Again he refers to the modified extension of the line as
being adapted to avoid the southern cape of Vancouver's
Island.
