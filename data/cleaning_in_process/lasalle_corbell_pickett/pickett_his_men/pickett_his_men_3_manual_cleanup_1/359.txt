over me, bringing contrition and remorse. Yet how could
I explain and risk the contempt which I felt my deception
warranted. I watched the General as he paced up and
down the floor, vainly endeavoring to analyze the problem
with which he had been so unexpectedly confronted.
Sympathy, doubt, grief, amazement seemed to commingle
in his mind. After a time he came and stood beside me,
looking at me with such an expression of sadness that,
under the influence of that gaze, there was nothing left me
but to acknowledge the cause of my hitherto unuttered
woe. Blushing and confused, I sobbed out my mournful
story and took the poor paper-back book, the cause of our
first and only misunderstanding, from its hiding-place
beneath the cushion and sheepishly handed it to him, and
all the clouds drifted away in smiles.
