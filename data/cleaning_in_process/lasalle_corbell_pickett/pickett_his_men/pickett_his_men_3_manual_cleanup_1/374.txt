are safe. You can depend upon my noble, self-sacrificing
hero. Trust and wait."
They not only trusted in their brave defender, but gave
him of their courage and strength in helping him to keep
up a brave show and deceive the enemy, cheering the
trains as they came in, though, alas ! they were but empty
coaches.
They would gather at the station as each train was due
from the short trip it made into the country to keep up
the appearance of transacting a large business in transpor-
tation, and send up cheer after cheer of welcome, fondly
hoping the Federals would not be cognizant of the fact
that there were none to be welcomed except the feeble,
half-starved men who ran the trains. There were none,
to the eye, but to the heart were not those whistling,
rumbling trains full to overflowing with gallant forms,
clad in the beautiful gray that we loved, adorned with
flashing swords, carrying muskets that meant protection
for us, and above all, with faces that had bent in truest
love to our own?
Such a week of anxiety as the General passed, only he
can know who holds in his hand the homes, the lives, the
honor, of men, women and children. For almost that
length of time Pickett had not slept, and for three days
had not been near our home. His soup and bread and
coffee, I myself had carried to him out on the lines. I
had George and Bob and Charles, my cook, butler and
gardener, out on despatch-duty. Each and all had done
their part, and they had not trusted in vain in the bravery
and strategy of their fearless defender, for, as General
Grant had said in his telegram to President Lincoln,
Pickett had bottled up Butler at Petersburg.
