Jackson's column was supposed to be somewhere on
the left, though as yet nothing had been heard from him,
he having been delayed by the obstructions which the
Federals in passing had taken the precaution to put in his
way. Lee had given a general order to make an attack
in front upon hearing Jackson's musketry open upon the
enemy.
The Federal forces were under command of General
Fitz John Porter, and extended over two miles, from the
Chickahominy to Cold Harbor. Upon the dominant
points of the field he had posted sixty cannon.
Near the noon hour the battle in all its fury was on.
The hills trembled under the roar of one hundred and
twenty pieces of artillery. The plain was shrouded in
smoke so dense that the two armies were lost to view.
In these days of smokeless powder no battle-field can
equal those of the olden time in terrific majesty and mys-
terious fascination. The mists which enshroud war, as
well as many other subjects, are gradually passing away,
and we are beginning to see things as they are.
The banks of the chasm which protected the Army
of the Potomac in its strong post on the cliff were
lined with serried ranks awaiting the signal for action.
Squadrons of troopers were dashing over the field; dense
columns of infantry were rushing madly into the fray;
the field was agleam with the flashing of bayonet and sword.
Through the clouds of the cannonade A. P. Hill's
division charged again and again with what a Northern
writer has called "a disregard of death never surpassed."
Out from the dells and from behind the trees the Federal
reserves rushed forth and beat them back, but not until the
foeman's ranks were thinned almost to the point of break-
ing. Not a gun was left which Porter could call into
service.
