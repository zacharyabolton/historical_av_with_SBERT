him before the arrival of Longstreet. When that ofificer
reached the field he was placed on the right of Jackson.
Pickett's brigade was on Longstreet's right, with the re-
mainder of Kemper's division. It was one of the brigades
supporting the advance of Hood and Evans, which re-
sulted in the victory for that day, a piece of artillery,
several regimental standards, and a number of prisoners
being taken.
The morning of the 30th was given to a heavy artillery
combat between Colonel S. D. Lee, and the Federal artil-
lery, in which Colonel Lee was as successful as he had
been on the previous day.
In the afternoon Pickett's brigade was a part of the
force which received and repelled the onset of Fitz John
Porter. In the magnificent charge which finally cleared
the field and won victory for the Confederate arms,
Pickett's men proved their valor as loyally as they had
done when they followed their own leader, who was far
away, his gallant soul chafing under the sad necessity
which kept him off the field.
Lee again sent Jackson to secure a position between
Pope and the capital, but Pope, having foreseen this
movement, fell back to Chantilly, where he was attacked
by Jackson on the 1st of September. Here the Federal
army lost the brilliant general, Philip Kearny, who rode
within the Confederate lines and was shot in attempting
to escape.
Kearny had been a Chasseur d'Afrique in Algeria,
where his bravery won for him the cross of the Legion
of Honor. He had lost an arm at the siege of Mexico.
He had fought with the French army in the battles of
Magenta and Solferino, and had again received from
Emperor Napoleon III. the decoration of the Legion of
Honor,
