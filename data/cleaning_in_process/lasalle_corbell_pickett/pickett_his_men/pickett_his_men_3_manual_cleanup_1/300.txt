ance of those who had long been warring with each other
across the historic river.
The selection of a battle field is of no less importance
than its preparation away back in the geologic ages. The
field for the greatest battle of the war between the States
had been set apart for that purpose by a series of what
might be regarded as trivial circumstances, were it not
for the well-known fact that there are no trifles in the
realm of destiny.
The general-in-chief of the Army of Virginia and the
commander of the Army of the Potomac each had con-
victions about the proper field for the battle. Lee chose
Cashtown, as affording a strong background of mountains
as a defense; Meade had set his martial mind upon fight-
ing at Pipe Creek. In the selection of battle-fields, gen-
erals propose, but Mars disposes.
By his untrammeled will does the god of war choose
the stage for the unfolding of each scene in his blood-red
drama. Having made his selection, he leads thither his fol-
lowers by some slight incident in which his hand is unseen.
The armies were guided to the field on which was to be
fought the decisive battle of the Civil War by the somewhat
homely detail of shoes. These minor articles, which have
been rendered daily necessities by a highly evolved and
complicated state of society, have played an important
part in history; as, for example, the sandals that betrayed
the unfortunate Empedocles and destroyed a faith upon
which a whole school of philosophy depended for intel-
lectual and moral salvation.
So, it happened that shoes which had never been on mor-
tal feet — phantasmal shoes, which may have existed only
in the imagination — evanescent shoes, eagerly sought but
never found — though devoid of guiding feet, even ghostly
ones, led the way to the battle-field of Gettysburg.
