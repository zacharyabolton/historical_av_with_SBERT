I brushed away my tears, caught up my baby, who had
just awakened, snatched from the nurse's hand the bunch
of white violets which she said she had "jes' bruck fum
off'n dem li'le low-growin' bushes what dey sed Marse
Gawge's ma had plant de year 'fo' she tuck sick an' die,"
and ran down the steps to the gate.
The division halted as it drew near. When its leader
came to say good-by I closed baby's hands over the
cluster of white violets and held it out to him. He carried
the snowy blossoms away with him, as the division
marched forward shouting, "Three cheers for the little
general and his mother!"
Ten years later, brown and withered with time, the
tiny cluster of violets went down to the grave with all
that was mortal of the soldier who carried them in their
sweet perfume and snowy bloom at the head of his brave
division.
