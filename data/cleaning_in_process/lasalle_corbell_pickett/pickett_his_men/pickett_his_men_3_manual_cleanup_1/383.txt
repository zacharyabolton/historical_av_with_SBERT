monplace Cold Harbor, with occasional deterioration into
Coal Harbor, grimy and repellant. No more trailing of
soft silken and lace robes through the shaded corridors of
the old colonial inn. No more tread of martial step, soft-
ened deferentially to keep pace with the graceful fall of
delicately slippered feet.
As Cold Harbor, the domain was wrested from the
gentle sway of the tender gods and relegated to the
sterner rule of crimson-hued Mars. The old inn, which
in its ancient Cool Arbor days had softly echoed to the
melodious notes of harp and spinet, became the head-
quarters of the commander-in-chief of a great army, and
its walls resounded with military orders and the multi-
tudinous discords of war.
For a second time Cold Harbor became the scene of a
battle. In the evolution of the wheel of time the two
armies drew near each other at almost the same point on
the historic river which two years before had furnished a
field for the battle of Gaines's Mill, otherwise known as
the first battle of Cold Harbor.
Grant had been appointed lieutenant-general and
placed in command of all the United States armies, choos-
ing his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, in
heroic defiance of the political wires which had been
woven into a death-trap for most of the commanders
whose fortunes had heretofore been linked with the east-
ern branch of the Federal army.
Over a crimson road had the two armies returned to
Cold Harbor. The Wilderness had become one great,
wide graveyard. The wind which soughed through the
dark and heavy forest sighed a requiem over nearly fifty
thousand of Grant's men.
From October, 1863, until May, 1864, Pickett's division
was detached from the Army of Northern Virginia. On.
