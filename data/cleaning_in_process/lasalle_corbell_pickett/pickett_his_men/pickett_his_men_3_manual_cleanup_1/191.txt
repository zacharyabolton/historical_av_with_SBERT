comprising the corps of Heintzelman and Keyes, had
crossed the Chickahominy. McClellan was trying to
bridge the stream for the crossing of his artillery, an ef-
fort greatly impeded by the heavy rains which carried
the bridges away as fast as they could be constructed.
Sumner, Franklin and Porter extended their troops on
the east bank along a line of eighteen miles. Johnston's
design was to attack Heintzelman and Keyes as soon as
they should be far enough removed from the rest of the
army to make such a movement practicable.
On the morning of the 30th a reconnoitering party un-
der General Garland reported indications of the presence
of at least a corps of Federals west of Seven Pines. Gen-
eral Johnston seems to have made the mistake of underes-
timating the strength of the force which he was about to
attack, it consisting of two corps instead of one, as he
supposed. In the evening he issued the following com-
mands:
Headquarters Department of Northern Virginia,
Major-General G. W. Smith. May 30, 9:15 p.m.
General : If nothing prevents, we will fall upon the enemy in front
of Major-General Hill (who occupies the position on the Williamsburg
road from which your troops moved to the neighborhood of Meadow
Bridge) early in the morning â€” as early as practicable. The Chicka-
hominy will be passable only at the bridge, a great advantage to us.
Please be ready to move by the Gaines road, coming as early as possi-
ble to the point at which the road to New Bridge turns off. Should
there be cause for haste, Major-General McLaws, on your approach, will
be ordered to leave his ground for you, that he may reinforce General
Longstreet. Most respectfully your obedient servant,
J. E. Johnston.
Headquarters Department of Northern Virginia.
Major-General Huger. May 30, 1862, 8:30 p.m.
General: The reports of Major-General D. H. Hill give me the
impression that the enemy is in considerable strength in his front. It
