Then Pickett charged at Gettysburg:
Down from the little wooded slope,
A-step with doubt, a-step with hope,
And nothing but the tapping drum
To time their tread, still on they come.
Four hundred cannon hush their thunder,
While cannoneers gaze on in wonder!
Two armies watch, with stifled breath.
Full eighteen thousand march to death.
At elbow-touch, with banners furled.
And courage to defy the world.
In Pickett 's charge at Gettysburg.
'Tis Pickett's charge at Gettysburg:
None but tried veterans can know
How fearful 'tis to charge the foe;
But these are soldiers will not quail,
Though Death and Hell stand in their traill
Flower of the South and Longstreet 's pride.
There's valor in their very stride!
Virginian blood runs in their veins,
And each his ardor scarce restrains;
Proud of the part they're chosen for;
The mighty cyclone of the war,
In Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.
'Tis Pickett's charge at Gettysburg:
How mortals their opinions prize
When armies march to sacrifice.
And souls by thousands in the fight
On battle's smoky wing take flight.
Firm-paced they come in solid form â€”
The dreadful calm before the storm.
Those silent batteries seem to say:
"We're waiting for you, men in gray!"
Each anxious gunner knows full well
Why every shot of his must tell
On Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.
