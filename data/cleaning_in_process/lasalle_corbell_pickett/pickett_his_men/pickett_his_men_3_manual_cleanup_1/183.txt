chambeau, again became the scene of important historic
events.
President Davis, being uncertain as to whether McClel-
lan's army was intended for the invasion of Virginia, or
was on its way to North Carolina, had sent General John
G. Walker's brigade from Fredericksburg to North Caro-
lina, and the brigade of General Wilcox from the Rapidan
to reinforce Magruder near Yorktown. When the ad-
vance upon Yorktown became evident the divisions of
D. H. Hill, D. R. Jones, and Early were sent from the
Army of Northern Virginia to the Peninsula, Jackson's
division was left at Mount Jackson, Ewell's on the Rap-
pahannock, Longstreet's at Orange Court-house, and G.
W. Smith's at Fredericksburg.
Reports from General Magruder at Yorktown indi-
cating that McClellan's whole army was moving toward
Richmond, Major-General Longstreet and General Smith
were ordered to Richmond, the latter leaving a portion
of his troops in front of Fredericksburg.
With his small force General Magruder opposed the
march of the Federals, with the design of delaying them
until his army could be reinforced, which he so far suc-
ceeded in doing as to impress McClellan with the idea
that the Confederate forces were much larger than they
really were.
In the conference which took place about this time,
between President Davis and his leading generals, John-
ston urged a consolidation of all the available forces in
front of Richmond, to receive the impending attack of
McClellan and repel it with such vigor as to destroy the
Army of the Potomac, thus hoping to end the war at a
stroke. Longstreet wished to attack Washington, thereby
compelling McClellan to turn his attention to affairs
nearer home.
