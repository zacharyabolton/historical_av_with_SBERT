This plan differed from that which Lee was expecting
of him. The Confederate general had prepared to oppose
a movement north of Culpeper Court-house. Burnside
moved south, with the intention of crossing the Rap-
pahannock near Fredericksburg and securing a position
between Lee's army and Richmond, designing to cut off
communication and prevent the Southern army from gain-
ing access to their capital. On the 15th, he began to put
this plan into operation, attempting to conceal it by a
demonstration on Gordonsville.
Lee was not thus to be deluded, and on the same day
the Confederate outpost at Fredericksburg was reinforced
by a battery of artillery and a regiment of infantry. On
the 17th, Lee received information that the right division
had gone south, led by General Sumner, and he ordered
General W. H. F. Lee's cavalry to Fredericksburg.
Fredericksburg is a small town, at that time of about
five thousand inhabitants, situated on the south bank of
the Rappahannock. It is north of Richmond, and about
half-way between Richmond and Washington. Low ranges
of hills extend along the river; on the north, they are
close to and parallel with the stream; on the south they
stretch backward from the river and inclose a plain six
miles long and nearly three miles wide; above the river
they rise boldly and present a rugged, unforested front;
eastward they are lower and wooded, and spurs, covered
with a growth of trees, run down to the plain.
Had nature formed the design of creating an appro-
priate location for a victorious army, she could have suc-
ceeded no better than she did in her operations upon the
south of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg. In
front were bold, bare crests, on whose natural ramparts
artillery might be placed to hurl destruction upon the
helpless plain below. On the flanks the woodland spread
