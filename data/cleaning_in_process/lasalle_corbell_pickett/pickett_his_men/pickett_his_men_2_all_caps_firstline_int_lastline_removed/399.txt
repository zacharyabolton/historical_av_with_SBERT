it down 'bout how it all happened to be. They all remembers you and
always asks after you. They sets a heep of store by me, and I don t
want them to think nothin' bad of me, and then mought blame
herself some if she knowed; so please, marm, kiver it all over. Kiverin'
it won't hurt nothin' and it mought ease things a bit. I know all your
folkes and I went to school to your Uncle Jasper close onto a year.
I knowed your brother Tom before he died, and he want afeered of
nothin' on earth; he'd pull off his coat and roll up his sleeves and fight
aelefant if theelefant had 'a' been a-tryin' to impose on him or anybody
else littler than him. Well, this is the end of the paper, and when
you get this t'will be the end of me, too. God bless you, God in heaven
bless you — double times. Please, marm, don't let none of them
down home lose store by me if you can helf it. Please, marm, and
that is all.

cabin burned the fires of patriotic ardor, and the poor^

Colonel Harrison were working over a map, and handed

miserable wretches have got to be shot in the morning,
and all your pretty play — is pretty play. They have been
tried by court martial, their sentence approved, and the
General has nothing on earth to do with it, and can't help
it. You and Lady H. not only look very much alike,
but you are very much alike"
