efforts to strengthen the left that he had reduced his right
to the lowest point compatible with existence.
Lee had directed Ewell to attack upon that side at the
same time that Longstreet's guns opened upon the peach-
orchard, the thunder of his cannon to be the signal. For
the second time the wind had not blown fair for the Con-
federate cause, and the report of the guns did not reach
the ear of Ewell. Consequently, his attack was delayed
two hours after the opening on the right. The sound of
Hill's guns at five o'clock first announced to Ewell the
fact that the battle was on, and his batteries began the at-
tack. They were soon silenced by the guns of Weiderick
and Ricketts on Cemetery Hill, which being protected by
lunettes, had an advantage over Ewell's unprotected
batteries.
To the east of Gettysburg from behind a hill came
long lines of infantry moving on in grand array. Stevens's
battery, between Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill, opened
upon them a terrific fire, enfilading the line, and from
the long blue ranks on Cemetery Hill poured a heavy rain
of lead and flame, beating them to the earth.
From the stone wall Howard's infantry swept them
down like grain before the scythe. They did not pause.
The famous Louisiana Tigers were leading, and they
would go forward while there were enough of them left
to charge upon the foe.
The brigades of Hoke and Hays followed. They
cleared the stone wall and Stevens ceased firing lest his
friends should fall victims. Weiderick's men were borne
back. Ricketts's guns alone poured death into the as-
saulting column. Over the battery was a fierce hand-to-
hand struggle, and the gunners were almost overpowered,
when Carroll's men rushed to the rescue, and the Tigers
who had ascended the slope seventeen hundred strong.
