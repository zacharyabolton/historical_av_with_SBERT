AT YORKTOWN AND WILLIAMSBURG.
On the 14th ofr February, 1862, General Pickett was
appointed brigadier-general, and assigned to the com-
mand of Cocke's Virginia brigade of infantry.
Pickett's brigade was composed of the Eighth, Eigh-
teenth, Nineteenth and Twenty-eighth Virginia Regi-
ments. The Eighth Regiment was commanded by Col-
onel Eppa Hunton, and was recruited in Loudon County,
Virginia. The Eighteenth Regiment was commanded by
Colonel Robert E. Withers, and was recruited in Pittsyl-
vania County, Virginia. The Nineteenth Virginia Regi-
ment was commanded by Colonel J. R. Strange, and was
recruited in Albemarle County. The Twenty-eighth Regi-
ment was commanded by Colonel Robert T. Preston, and
was recruited in Roanoke County.
The first movement of the brigade after General Pickett
assumed command was the occupation of the Peninsula
in front of Yorktown under General Joseph E. Johnston,
where it maintained the line of defense in several severe
skirmishes with the Federal forces under General George
B. McClellan.
Of the four ways in which the Army of the Potomac
might have advanced toward Richmond, McClellan chose
the one by Fortress Monroe into the Peninsula and up
between the James and York rivers.
Thus the ground which had been made famous less
than a hundred years before, by the surrender of Corn-
wallis to the combined forces of Washington and Ro-
