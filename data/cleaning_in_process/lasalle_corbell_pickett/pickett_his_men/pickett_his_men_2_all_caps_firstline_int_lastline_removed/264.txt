portuneness and advantages of the attack but, being more
cautious and chary of assuming responsibility than Pickett,
insisted upon first sending a brief of their intentions to
General Longstreet, who was with General Lee in another
part of the field watching the progress of the battle, ask-
ing him if, in the detailed circumstances, they should not
at once push in with their divisions. Any delay at such
a moment was, of course, disastrous, and before the as-
sent of General Longstreet was obtained and the order
given the opportunity was lost.
The strength of the division at the time of its forma-
tion was about nine thousand, though only a part of one
brigade of the division (Kemper's) was actively engaged
in this their first battle as a division â€” the battle of Fred-
ericksburg. The casualties of the battle, as a division,
were of course trifling, but enough, alas, to make many a
heart ache, many a hearthstone desolate. About forty-
seven wounded, dead and dying were found near the
"stone fence" at Marye's Hill.
The fearless Federal commander, Burnside, was bold,
determined and fierce in his attack, and had he been drawn
still deeper into the toils which had been set for him on
this field of battle by our General Lee, it is more than
probable that his whole army would have been destroyed.
General Lee's position was so strongly and so thoroughly
protected that General Burnside's attack was repulsed
with great loss at every point. Only a portion of Lee's
first line, near Hamilton's Crossing, was driven back by
Franklin's daring assault upon it, but even that ground
Lee at once recovered.
Pickett's division remained bivouacked in the rear,
picketing the Rappahannock River below Fredericksburg.
Then it was removed to the left to meet Burnside's at-
tempted crossing at Banks's Ford.
