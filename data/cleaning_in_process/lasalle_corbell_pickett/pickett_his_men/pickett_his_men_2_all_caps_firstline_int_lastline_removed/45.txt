before, and they all loved me and called nne " sister."
Their pride in each other and in their command, the perils
that together they had endured, the varied experiences
of good times and bad, had bound them together in links
stronger than steel.
Spite of the partings, the loss of our cause, our dis-
appointment and poverty, there was to me a sweet,
restful, peaceful feeling of thankfulness in my heart and
gratitude to God that the war was over, that my husband
had been spared and belonged now only to me, that we
v/ere going home, and together, free from intrusion, could
rest under the shade of our own trees.
