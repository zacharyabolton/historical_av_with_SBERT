boats on the James River. If any mind, possessed of a
germ of humanity, could realize the terrors of that death-
march, it would never again be able to contemplate the
possibility of war without a shudder of revulsion. All
the ambulances which could be obtained were filled with
wounded, and those for whom there was no place were
left to die upon the field or by the roadside, or to be car-
ried off as prisoners. Gentle death, kinder far than life,
came with each hour to relieve some sufferer of the pain
which had become insupportable. Many, overcome by
the heat, fell by the way, raving deliriously.
At the White House the retreating army burned its
stores to prevent their falling into the hands of the pur-
suers. There was but little rescued from the flaming pile
of Federal provisions, and the only prize which fell into
the hands of the Confederates was a load of overcoats,
which they stored away for cold weather.
At Savage Station hundreds of barrels of provisions
were piled up into pyramids and devoted to the flames.
It was not so easy to get rid of powder and shells to pre-
vent their being used against their former owners. They
were put into a train of cars and fired and the cars sent
on their flaming way, the powder and shells exploding
and sending out the most brilliant pyrotechnic displays,
like a traveling Fourth of July celebration.
Here occurred perhaps one of the saddest scenes of
the whole war, if in such a succession of horrors there can
be any one event surpassing all the rest in sorrowfulness.
It was here determined that the safety of the army re-
quired the abandoning of the sick and wounded. It was
not possible to convey them along that difficult march,
halting by the way to fight the pursuers. Then followed
parting of father from son, of brother from brother, of
friend from friend, with no hope of any future meeting.
