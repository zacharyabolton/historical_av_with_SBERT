with surprise, and rather disrespectfully for me, too, I am
afraid.
" I must find the dear old fellow," the General said,
graciously overlooking my smallness of spirit, and excus-
ing himself and taking leave of baby and me, he went out
at once. In a little while he came back, saying:
" It is very fortunate for us, little one, that I went out
when I did. Suckley goes down the river to-morrow to
Norfolk in the surgeon-general's steamer, and he has
kindly invited us to go with him, dear old big-hearted
bug-catcher! Come, let us lose no time. Let us hurry
and get our little traps together and be ready. We will
not say anything about our plans to any one till to-morrow
morning, when we can announce our intentions and say
our good-bys simultaneously."
Not only had this Yankee of^cer, in his "off-duty"
feeling for the General, kindly volunteered to transport
us to our home, but to carry our trunks and horses, in
fact, all we had, which, alas! was very, very little. Most
of our worldly possessions — all of our bridal presents,
linen, library, pictures, silver, furniture, harp, piano, china,
— everything except a few clothes, had been stored at Kent,
Payne & Co.'s, and had been burned in the awful fire the
night of the evacuation of Richmond.
The General's staff had, one by one, come in during
the day from the field and camp, and all breakfasted with
us for the last time next morning in the old Pickett home
at the corner of Sixth and Leigh streets. The military
family had broken up at Appomattox after Lee's surren-
der, and the dear old headquarters Confederate flag the
General himself unstaffed, tore into strips and divided
among them. Such a happy family they had been.
The second social parting was sad, too, for they had
taken me, "the child wife," into their lives twenty months
