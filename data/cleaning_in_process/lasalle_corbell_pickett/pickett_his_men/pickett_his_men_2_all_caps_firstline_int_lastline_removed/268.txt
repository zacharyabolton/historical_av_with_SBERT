blood of the Blue and the Gray, yet who can say that it was,
under the circumstances, unnecessarily high? There are
many functions of civilized life which can be postponed
to more convenient occasions, but dining is not one of
them. If it be true that the soul of man, as some philos-
ophers assert, is located in the stomach, how few will be
lost through the voluntary neglect of this tabernacle of
the Holy Ghost.
The Confederate loss in officers and men was consider-
able, but the saddest loss, saddest because it seemed so
unnecessary, was the loss of the Fauquier Artillery (Strib-
ling's battery) attached to Pickett's division.
The battery had been detached by the order of General
French, commander of artillery, and placed in an old
earthwork on the Nansemond River far in advance of our
lines, situated on a point of land unprotected in the rear.
The battery was supported only by two small companies
of infantry.
Two gunboats of the Federals attempted to run by this
battery, one of which was sunk and the other driven away.
The Federals made no other attempt to pass, but for two
days and nights kept up a heavy and incessant fire from
their gunboats and land batteries. Under cover of this
fire they landed three of their regiments in the rear of the
isolated and indefensible position. After a fierce resist-
ance the gallant little Confederate band, cut off and over-
whelmed, f.ghting hand to hand at the guns, were all either
killed or made prisoners, except the drivers with the bat-
tery horses under Lieutenant Carroll, who, being some
distance in the rear, managed to make their escape.
The battery was one of the finest in the service, having
been captured by us from the Federals. It consisted of
five magnificent guns â€” three brass Napoleons and two
twenty-four pound howitzers, all of which were recaptured.
