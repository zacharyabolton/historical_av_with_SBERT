have to get out, but not until I had paid him for the two
hours he had been hunting "for the same."
" I will pay you the money," said I, " but there must be
such a place. Come, here is the letter and the instructions."
"There's no place of the koind, an' the letther is all
wrong," he said, spelling it out, "an' phat's to be done,
an' where am I to be laving you? It's to the daypo I've
got to be afther going to now."
" Oh, I don't know," I said. " Why did you not tell the
captain of the steamer you did not know, and have him
tell you where to go?"
"Shure, I thought you would be afther knowin' yure
own moind, an' there's no one knows the place betther
'an the loikes of me an' it's there to be a-finding."
I did not know enough to get out and go to a drug-
store and hunt in the directory. I was at my wits' end,
if I had ever had any wits. There was not a soul in the
city that I knew. I thought of the captain of the boat,
the only friend I had, yet I was afraid to go back to seek
him for fear the power he had would not be strong enough
to protect me, once I had left his boat. I could think of
no one else, nowhere else to go, and there was that in
the captain's voice and manner of daring and strength
that made me willing to trust myself with him, so I said:
" Drive me back to the captain of the boat, please. I
don't know what else to do."
When I went on board the captain was not yet gone,
which was an unusual thing. He had waited to see the
officers before leaving. I answered the smile that came
into his face, in spite of his kind heart, by handing him
my aunt's letter, who wrote not only a very peculiar hand,
but a very illegible one, saying:
" Read, captain, and see if this is not Brenton
street, the place my aunt has written me I must come."
