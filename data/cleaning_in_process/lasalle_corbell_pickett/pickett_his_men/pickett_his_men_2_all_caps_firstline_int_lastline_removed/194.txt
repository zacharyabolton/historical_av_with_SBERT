While the battle yet continued darkness came to force
a truce. Johnston ordered his troops to sleep on their

he was slightly wounded by a musket-shot. A little later
he observed that one of his colonels was trying to dodge

"The sword was one worn by my father in the Revo-

thousand dollars; will not some one please go back and
get it and my pistols for me?" Armistead returned to
the field, found them and carried them safely off through
a storm of artillery, receiving one of the pistols as a token
of the gratitude of the wounded chief. The pistols had
been presented to Johnston by the inventor. Colonel Colt.

tastes than to those of a Confederate leader. In war
