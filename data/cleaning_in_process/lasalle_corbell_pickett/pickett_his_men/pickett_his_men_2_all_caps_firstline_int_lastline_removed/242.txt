In 1839 Armistead was appointed second-lieutenant in
the Sixth Regiment of infantry, then in General Zachary
Taylor's command. He served in the Florida war under
his father, General W. K. Armistead, and in 1844 was
promoted to a first-lieutenancy by President Tyler. He
was brevetted for gallant conduct in Mexico, being at
Chapultepec, as we are told, "the first to leap into the
great ditch."
At the opening of the Civil War he was a captain in
the regular army. He resigned, was commissioned colo-
nel, and placed in command of the Fifty-seventh Regi-
ment of Virginia infantry. In 1862 he was made briga-
dier-general and organized a brigade of infantry, which
was assigned to Huger's division of Longstreet's First
Army Corps. It was first engaged in the second day's
fight at Seven Pines, where its brave general was espe-
cially distinguished. In September, 1862, it was added
to Pickett's division of Longstreet's corps. In his re-
port of the battle of Malvern Hill, General Magruder
says: "Brigadier-General Armistead held the line of
battle in the wood which secured the field, and after
bringing on the action in the most gallant manner by re-
pulsing an attack of a heavy body of the enemy's skir-
mishers, skilfully lent support to the contending troops
in front when it was required."
It was at the head of this brigade that he stormed up
the deadly slope of Cemetery Hill, broke the Union lines
and, with his hand resting on a Federal gun and the shout
of victory on his lips, fell, as noble a sacrifice as ever
sanctified a battle-field.
Brigadier-General James Lawson Kemper was com-
mander of the Third Brigade of Pickett's division.
He was born in 1824, of a Virginia family whose his-
tory dates back to the beginning of the eighteenth cen-
