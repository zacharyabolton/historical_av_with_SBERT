In how short a time did that long-contested institution
go down in blood, and from its ruins arose a new South to
give the world impressive lessons in the eternal persist-

From the whispering foliage of her majestic forests
floats over all her broad land a message of prosperity,
of wealth, of commercial greatness.
Over the fields where once grew only cotton, rice, to-
