Every part of that ground had been consecrated by a
deed of heroism. The banner of the South furled itself
in sadness around its broken flag-staff long ago, but the
field on which its heroes fought and fell is sacred to all
Southern hearts. Here, upon this spot, fell a young lieu-

boy soldier in the protecting folds of the flag he had so
loved. Stranger hands laid in a Northern grave that
noble son of the South. " Unknown," the grave is marked;
