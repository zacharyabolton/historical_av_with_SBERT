lingham Bay, and knowing how you felt when he left the
old army, he has often wondered at your remaining, and
going to the front."
"I am a surgeon in Grant's army," said Dr. Suckley,
proudly, ignoring and, by his manner, almost resenting
my reference to his former sympathy with the South.
" I love Pickett, and came, as he would have come had
our positions been reversed, to see his wife and offer her
my services."
I thanked this kind-hearted gentleman and distin-
guished officer, but was too bitter to accept the smallest
courtesy at his hands, even in my husband's name, and
though offered for love's sake — so bitter that suffering
was preferable to such obligation. He bowed and was
going, when I said:
"Doctor, is there any news of the army — ours, I
■mean? "
"The war is over, madam. You have my address, if
you should change your mind and will show me how I
can serve you."
He bowed and left. He, too, had heard that the Gen-
eral had been killed, and believed it, and I hated him
worse because of his belief.
On the evening of the 3d of April I was walking the
floor. Baby was asleep, and my little brother was walk-
ing behind me, when I heard:
"Grand victory at Five Forks! Pickett killed, and
his whole division captured!"
It seemed very strange to me that in the streets of
Richmond, my dear old home, the capital of the Confed-
eracy, the death of Pickett and the capture of his whole
division should be heralded as a "grand victory." How
great a change had come in so short a time! Even the
newsboys had gone over to the enemy.
