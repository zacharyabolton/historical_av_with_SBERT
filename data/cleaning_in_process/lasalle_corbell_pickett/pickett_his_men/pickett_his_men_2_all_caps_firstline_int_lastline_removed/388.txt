life's deepest forces in the ages gone. You stand with
prophets, poets, kings, of the great world of thought.
Down in the depths of your soul you thank Faust and
Gutenberg for having been born.
You will never have an adequate sense of the extent
of your indebtedness to those grand old Teutons until you
have grown accustomed to regarding even a last week's
newspaper as a gracious benefaction, a summer novel as
an Olympian gift, a fugitive stanza, drifted across your
way by a friendly wind, as a great rose-garden of the mind,
filling your world full of beauty and fragrance.
If you had known all these things you would realize
what my feelings were when our good friend, General
Rufus Ingalls, of the United States army, sent to us across
the lines a beautiful copy of ^^ Les Miserabksr How we
wept with Fantine and Cosette! How we loved the good
Mayor Madeleine, all the dearer to us because he had
once been Jean Valjean! How we hated Javert, that cold
and stony pillar of "authority"! How we starved with
Marius and waxed indignant in contemplating his frigid
grandfather! How we fought over and over the wonder-
ful battle of Waterloo, and compared it with other con-
tests of which we knew!
The soldiers, with a quick instinct of appropriateness
born of experience, rechristened the work "Lee's Miser-
ables," and certainly no book ever achieved the popularity
of that most marvelous picture of life. They watched
with eager eyes and hearts its progress along the line.
They formed groups around the camp-fire and the man
who was deemed to have the greatest elocutionary devel-
opment was appointed reader for the assembly.
"It's our turn now. The General's wife said we were
to have 'Lee's Miserables' next," one would cry out
triumphantly.
