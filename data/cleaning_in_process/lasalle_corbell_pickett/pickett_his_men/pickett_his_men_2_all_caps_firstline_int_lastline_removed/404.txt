and verbal merely. On our part the whole substance of the instructions
to the Secretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted
upon and nothing was said inconsistent therewith; while by the other
party it was not said in any event or in any condition they ever would
consent to reunion; and yet they equally omitted to declare that they
never would so consent. They seemed to desire a postponement of that
question and the adoption of some other course first, which, as some of
them seemed to argue, might or might not lead to reunion; but which
course we thought would amount to an indefinite postponement. The
conference ended without result.
The news of the unsuccessful termination of the peace
commission soon spread through the whole army, and
hope died in all hearts. Anxious faces indicated the deep
sorrow with which the failure of the conference was re-
garded. It was possible that the leaders might know of
a prospect of foreign intervention of which the army was
ignorant. Unless this was true, nothing was left but to
fight it out to the bitter end.
After the failure of the peace commission was known
there was held in General Pickett's tent a consultation of
the ofKicers of his division. As they talked, their words
drifted out to me. Said one:
"We must hush all hope of peace in our hearts with
the cry of, ' War to the knife! ' All skulkers and absentees
must be driven into the army. I believe the Yankees are
as tired of war as we are."
Another suggested: "Why not free the negroes? They
would be as loyal to us if we freed them as to our enemies,
who can give them certainly no more than we can, unless it is
better rations and pay, but their love for us and the confi-
dence they have in us will more than counterbalance that."
"Certainly," responded another, " they are no dearer
than our own sons. We are willing to sacrifice our sons,
our fathers, and ourselves; why not our property? Is our
property dearer than our own lives?"
