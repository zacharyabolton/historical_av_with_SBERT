SECOND MANASSAS.
Some one has said that the first battle of Bull Run gave
such great satisfaction to the audience that an eiicore was
demanded. The Federal government prepared for a suc-
cessful repetition of the piece as first presented by assign-
ing General Pope to the command of the newly formed
Army of Virginia, thereby securing his services as lead-
ing man, and appointing Halleck general-in-chief of the
Federal armies, thus making him stage-manager. These
preliminary arrangements were completed in the latter
part of June, and near the close of August the cur-
tain rose upon the second presentation of that martial
drama.
On the 22d of August, the dashing Stuart effected his
bold ride around the lines of Pope, and secured the papers
which revealed to Lee the intended movements of his op-
ponent,* and Lee's line of march was modified in accord-
ance with that information. He divided his army and
sent part of it under Jackson to cut off Pope from Wash-
ington.
Pickett's brigade, under the leadership of Eppa Hun-
ton, was a part of Longstreet's corps which held Water-
loo Bridge against Pope while Jackson crossed the Rap-
pahannock. Having safely passed the river, Jackson
* Among the articles taken from Pope's tent was a sword, belonging
to him. I have just this moment (November 24, 1898) laid my hand on
this weapon — a reminder of Pope's boasts of prowess — in the home
of my friend, Dr. J. B. Hodgkin, of Virginia.
