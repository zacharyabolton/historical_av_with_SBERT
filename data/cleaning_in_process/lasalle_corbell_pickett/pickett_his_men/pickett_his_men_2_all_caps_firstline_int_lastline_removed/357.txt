Some one, more hardened to fictive woes than I, had
been reading it and left it where it fell into my hands.
When I began, I was not thinking much of the story. I
was too greatly appalled by the enormity of my crime in
reading a novel of any kind to have a clear idea of what
it was about. I was remorsefully thinking, "What would
my good grandmother think? What would she say?"
As I read on I began to lose sight and memory of my
grandmother. Her influence ceased to move me. The
story exerted a miserable fascination for which there is
no name. All the woe and heartbreak of it fastened
itself upon me and became my own. The tragedy of a shat-
tered life filled me with a grief unspeakable. I read until
my eyes were blinded with tears. Then I let the book fall
upon the floor and gave way to a passion of sobs.
I heard the General coming and hid the book, but I
could not conceal the traces of my woe. He was filled
with anxiety when he saw my tear-stained face.
"What is the matter, little one?" he asked with tender
solicitude.
" Nothing," I sobbed, brokenly.
"Are you ill?"
" No-0-0, sir," with renewed floods of tears.
" Have you hurt yourself?"
He looked anxiously around in search of some weapon
with which I might have accidentally inflicted upon my-
self an injury.
No, I had not hurt myself.
" Has any one wounded your feelings, or offended you
in any way?"
No, everybody had been kind and good to me.
" Poor little thing. She is tired and lonely. Will you
come and ride with me?"
No, I would not ride.
