tain that the question of supports had had his careful attention. Before
answering I rode back to converse with General Pickett, whose line was
now formed or forming in the wood and, without telling him of the ques-
tion I had to decide, I found out that he was entirely sanguine of suc-
cess in the charge and was only congratulating himself on the op- ~
portunity. I was convinced that to make any half-way effort would
ensure a failure of the campaign, and that if our artillery fire was once
opened after all the time consumed in preparation for the attack the only
hope of success was to follow it up promptly with one extreme effort,
concentrating every energy we possessed into it, and my mind was fully

the presence of guns at the head of this column would only have resulted
in their loss, but it would have been a brilliant opportunity for them, and
I always felt like apologizing for their absence.
There have been many efforts to shift responsibility

aught but what the most profound sense of duty and pa-
triotism, controlled by the emergencies which surrounded
him, suggested that he should do.
General Imboden, describing an interview with Lee
after the battle, states that in a voice tremulous with
emotion, Lee said:
"General, I never saw troops behave more magnifi-
