••A SHILLING A DOZEN. "— OUR LEFT-HANDERS. yi

untarily I offered up a prayer — all the help I could give.
Imagine, if you can, my surprise when the next morn-

painful scene. The poor man had returned, I reasoned.
Taking them all together, I thought they certainly were
a most curious family, and I determined to enlist my hus-

Kloshe kahkwa " (Send away far from us all evil — Amen), a
handsome stranger stepped out and, with outstretched
hand, said to the General, with great cordiality, " Klahowya
sikhs, potlatch lemah" (How do you do, friend; give me
