The public sentiment of the South, having demanded
this movement, was looking forward with vivid imagina-
tion to its possible results. The daily press thrilled the
popular heart with pictures of the devastation which would
accrue to the North and the consequent advantage to the
South of the invasion. The occupation of the principal
cities of Pennsylvania would cut the North in two. The
coal-fields would be destroyed and business would be
paralyzed. '<
Another incentive to Lee's aggressive action was the
necessity of relieving the pressure upon the west. Grant
was thundering at the gates of Vicksburg. A strong
movement toward the north might result in calling him
from Mississippi, and Rosecrans from Tennessee, back to
Washington, If Vicksburg should fall, a success on
Northern ground would go far toward alleviating the bad
effects of that disaster.
To crown all, the Union army itself was believed to
be dispirited by defeat. Want of harmony among its
generals, especially between Halleck, the commander-in-
chief, and the commander of the Army of the Potomac,
gave promise of an easy victory.
The battle of Antietam had delayed Lee's raid, pro-
jected in 1862, but subsequent events had seemed to point
to it as the one way to success.
In all the history of warfare, had ever a commander of
a great army resisted such alluring temptations as spread
themselves before Lee, as he looked across the Southern
border into the smiling meadows of the North gleaming
in the golden sunshine of June?
