brightly, and all was quiet and still.
The General's plan for me was that I should go next
day to Norfolk, take the steamer to Baltimore, and visit
his aunt, whose husband had been in the old army, and
who had not left it to join the Southern Confederacy,

the telegram, ' Edwards is better,' for it will surely come.
Now, keep up your courage and have faith; for it will
surely come. God bless you."

my face upward, look down upon it with his kind eyes,
