We reached Drury's Bluff at three o'clock in the morning in a ter-
rible rain-storm, passing between Butler's left and the river. Sent Col-
onel Stevens of the Engineers to President Davis to tell him that if he
â– would that day (the 14th) send me ten thousand men from the troops
about Richmond (five thousand under Ransom) and General Lee's army,
I would take Butler's thirty thousand men (who had been successful on
the afternoon of the 13th in taking the outer line of defenses) and capture
or destroy them by twelve on the 15th. I would then move to attack
Grant on his left flank and rear, while Lee attacked him in front, and I
felt sure of defeating Grant and probably opening the way to Washing-

" Bragg, circumstances have thrown the fate of the
Confederacy in your hands and mine. Let us play our

won his battle on the i6th, starting out in the heavy fog
of the early dawn. He almost totally annihilated Heck-
man's Star Brigade, took prisoners its leader and several
hundred of the men, and drove Butler's entire army

Three brigades of Pickett's division, Barton's, Corse's
and Terry's, were engaged in this battle, behaving with
great gallantry, but suffering heavily.
Colonel Joseph C. Cabell, of the Thirty-eighth Vir-
ginia, the only field-officer who came out of the battle of
Gettysburg unhurt, was killed in this action.
Among the many who were killed was Colonel Ham-
brick, of the Twenty-fourth Virginia. Major Robert H.
