"I don't know," I said.
"You have been there before, I suppose?" *
"Oh, no; never. I have been nowhere outside of
Virginia and North Carolina. Most of my traveling be-
fore my marriage was in going to and from Lynchburg,
where I was at school.
" Lynchburg is a hilly city. It was founded by an
Irish emigrant, John Lynch, whose brother, Colonel
Charles Lynch, of Revolutionary fame, instituted the
lynch-law. Colonel Lynch was a great Whig, and too
impatient to wait for the superfluous ceremony of legally
administering justice upon the lawless Tories.
" Once I rode on horseback to the Peaks of Otter,
which are among the highest mountains of the South.
You can't imagine how glorious it was to be up there so
far away from the earth. When I first looked down from
their lofty heights the sky and the earth seemed to be
touching, and presently the rain began to pour. I could
see the glimmering, glittering drops, but could not hear
them fall. I was above the clouds and the rain â€” up in
the sunshine and stillness, the only audible sound a
strange supernatural flapping. It was the hawks and
buzzards flapping their wings. Suddenly the rain ceased,
the haze vanished, and I saw below the rugged moun-
tains and what seemed in the distance a vast ocean.
It was the level country below.
"The words of John Randolph echoed in my heart
with this infinite mystery of nature. He with only a
servant had spent the night on those mighty rocks, and
in the morning as he was watching the glory of the sun-
rise, having no one else to whom to express his thought,
he pointed upward with his long, slender hand and
charged his servant never from that time to believe any
one who said there was no God.
