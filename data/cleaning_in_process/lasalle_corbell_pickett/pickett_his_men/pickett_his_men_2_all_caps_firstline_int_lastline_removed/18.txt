Though the dream nation about which clustered so
many beautiful visions will never take its place among
the courts and powers of the world; though the ideal
which led the South through efforts of heroism not sur-
passed in all the records of the world will never be crys-
tallized into that reality known to mortal eyes, yet in that
higher realm of thought, where the ideal is the true real,
it dwells in transcendent glory which transmutes into a
golden veil of light the war-clouds by which it was en-
shrouded.
"That dream nation did not crumble into ruins and fade
away into naught. The setting sun reflected from its
gleaming minarets makes more radiant the light by which
our united country marches on its way to national glory
The bells in its towers ring out a paean to swell the grand
symphony which circles the world.
The gallant sons of heroic fathers who fell on battle-
fields of North and South now stand together to defend
our common country. Side by side North and South are
marching against the foe; step by step they keep time
to the mingled notes of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and
" Dixie," blending into the noblest battle-hymn that ever
thrilled the heart of soldier to deeds immortal.
Three phases of loyalty sway the Southern heart to-
day â€” loyalty to memory, loyalty to present duty, loyalty
to hope. There is no rivalry among these phases of the
same noble sentiment. Together they work for the evolu-
tion of a regenerated nation. He who is untrue to the
past is recreant to the present and faithless to the future.
