That flag which almost a century before had risen
from the clouds of war, like a star gleaming out through
the darkness of a stormy night, with its design accredited
to both Washington and John Adams, was raised over
Virginia by Massachusetts, in place of the one whose
kinship and likeness to the old banner had never been
entirely destroyed.
In Mafch, 1861, the Confederate Congress adopted
the stars and bars â€” three horizontal bars of equal width,
the middle one white, the others red, with a blue union
of nine stars in a circle. This was so like the national
flag as to cause confusion. In 1863 this flag was replaced
by a banner with a white field, having the battle-flag (a
red field charged with a blue saltier on which were
thirteen stars) for a union. It was feared that this might
be mistaken for a flag of truce, and was changed by cov-
ering the outer half of the field with a vertical red bar.
This was finally adopted as the flag of the Confederate
States of America.
Richmond will testify that the soldiers of Massachu-
setts were worthy of the honor of first raising the United
States flag over the Capitol of the Confederacy, and will
also bear witness to the unvarying courtesy of Major
Stevens, and the fidelity with which he kept his trust.
It has seemed appropriate that I should begin my
story with the burning city, for fire has followed me all
my life. My story, I say? Semmes has said: "To
write history we must be a part of that history." My
story has been so closely allied with that of Pickett
and his division that it does not seem quite an in-
trusive interpolation for me to appear in the record of
that warrior band. How could I tell the story, and
the way in which that story was written, and not be a
part of it?
