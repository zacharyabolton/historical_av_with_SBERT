and waiting. I mounted and galloped forward to meet
the General. As we rode slowly away he looked thought-
fully and sadly around him and sighed a farewell to tent
and camp of Howlett House, Chester and the lines of
breastworks. This position, important as the main line
of defense between Richmond and Petersburg, and oppos-
ing any advance by the Federals, he had occupied since
the i6th of May, 1864.
Through the soft lights and shades and the perfumed
breath of the dawn of the year, we rode away from our
first and last camp, and on together to the old Pickett
home in Richmond, where the General was to leave me
and rejoin his division. He said good-by, and as we
knelt beside our baby's cradle we placed each other in
God's holy keeping.
"Take care of mamma, my little man, if papa should
not come back. I leave her to you, my dear, dear little
namesake son. Ask mamma to tell you what papa says,
and if— there, there," he said cheerily; "I must go now.
Smiles — come, smiles — give me smiles; no tears, mind,"
and he went out of the door and down the steps, two at a
time, whistling "The Girl I Left Behind Me."
A little while later I heard the drums beating, and
baby's nurse rushed in to say:
" Dem sojer troops an' drums you yeahs a-comin' is
ourn. Yas'm, dey is; dey is we all's derwision-troops, an'
hit certainly is scand'lus de way dey is a-playin' music an'

'Deed an' 'deed, hit's turrible— 'deed, 'tis. Dey ought ter
