THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.
When Abraham Lincoln stood at the foot of Cemetery
Ridge and looked upward to where the frowning cannon
had so short a time before sent its leaden death to the
valley below, some one said to him, "Think of the men
who held these heights!" "Yes," he replied, "but think
of the men who stormed these heights!"
As Pickett's division, weary, foot-sore and heart-sore,
wended their toilsome way through Pennsylvania, on the
march which ended on the field of Gettysburg, they passed
a small Dutch house nestling away in the greenery of a
pleasant village. As they came near a little maid rushed
out upon the porch, waving the stars and stripes in a wild
burst of patriotic enthusiasm.
For a moment the leader of that wayworn band felt
apprehensive that not all its members could be depended
upon to maintain their chivalry in the presence of that ban-
ner which to them represented so much of wrong done upon
their native soil. Many of them had come from the war-
ravaged district of Suffolk, and Southerners will know what
that flag meant to them. Instantly the General wheeled
from the line and, taking off his cap, bowed to the little
maid with all that grace for which he was noted in camp
as well as drawing-room, and respectfully saluted the flag
of his foes. Then turning he lifted his hand, and when
the long line had passed every man in it had doffed his
cap to the youthful patriot and had saluted the banner
which she had made her gage of battle.
