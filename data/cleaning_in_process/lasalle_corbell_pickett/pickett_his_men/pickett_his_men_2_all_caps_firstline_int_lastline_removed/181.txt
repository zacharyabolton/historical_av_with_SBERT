people was denied. The States, therefore, which had con-
tributed so much to the formation, protection and exten-
sion of the American Union were made to feel that they
no longer had any part in a government for which, when
treated with justice and fairness, they would gladly have
died. Thus thousands of broken-hearted, patriotic, union-
loving men bade farewell to a Union in which their rights
and privileges were forcibly wrested from them.
Under the Southern flag there were no traitors, no rebels.
To state the reverse of this proposition is to falsify his-
tory; to charge it is a crime. The bravest, truest survivors
who wore the gray are as ready to defend our country as
any man who wore the blue. They thank God that no
question of slavery, secession, or anything else can ever
again disturb our unity, our interest, or our pride in our
grand and glorious country. But history will not fail to
teach us the lesson that we should learn, and which we hope
our country has learned so thoroughly as never to be for-
gotten, that the majority, no matter how powerful, can not
with impunity trample upon the rights of the minority.
The war which has just been happily concluded showed
the love and heroism of all parts of this country, and
teaches all what I would teach my reader in this chapter
â€” that the manhood, courage and patriotism of each sec-
tion of our country must not be disparaged by any other
portion of our Union. We are Americans all.
