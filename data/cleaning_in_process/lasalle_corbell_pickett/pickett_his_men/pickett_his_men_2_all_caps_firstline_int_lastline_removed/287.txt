PENNSYLVANIA CAMPAIGN.
Lee disclosed his plan of campaign to General A. L,
Long, his military secretary, in the camp near Fredericks-
burg. He traced on the map the proposed route of his army.
His first thought was to maneuver Hooker out of his
position on the Rappahannock and force him to fight at
Chambersburg, York or, perhaps, Gettysburg. He was
confident of victory â€” a victory which meant the evacua-
tion of Washington, and the recall of the Federal troops
from the siege of Vicksburg.
Lee had about sixty thousand veterans. The artil-
lery, under Pendleton, aggregated two hundred guns.
The strength of the cavalry was about six thousand,
under Stuart, Hampton, Robertson, and Jones. The in-
fantry was reorganized into three army corps, desig-
nated as the First, Second, and Third Corps, commanded
by Longstreet, Ewell, and A. P. Hill.
On June 3, 1863, Longstreet began to push on to-
ward Culpeper, followed by Ewell. A. P. Hill was left
in front of Fredericksburg to restrain Hooker from ad-
vancing against Richmond, and to conceal the movements
of the main army. With unceasing vigilance he prevented
any communication between the two sides of the river,
capturing the scouts who had been sent out by Hooker to
ascertain Lee's movements. On the 5th Hooker sent a
corps to the south side of the river. As Hill perceived
that it was intended merely for observation, it was not
opposed.
