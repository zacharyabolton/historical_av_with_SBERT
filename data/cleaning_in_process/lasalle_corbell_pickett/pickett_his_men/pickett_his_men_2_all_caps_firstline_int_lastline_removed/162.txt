dition were no less than its economic disadvantages. A
system which a few generations earlier had been regarded
in the North as a mere economic blunder gradually came
to be viewed as a crime. The North had rid herself
of the burden of slavery, why could not the South? The
North had freed herself by the simple and easy process
of unloading upon the South. There was no remoter
South to serve its turn in the descending scale, unless it
were the Gulf of Mexico, against which, laying aside
the matter of expense, certain considerations of humanity
might obtain.
The system became a component part of the life of the
South. To separate it from that life was like taking a vital
part from a highly evolved organism and expecting its func-
tions to continue. Laying aside the financial difificulties
of getting rid of slavery, there still remained the one great
problem, what could we do with the slave if he should
become politically free? He could not be morally and
economically free, because his nature and training had
not fitted him for liberty.
The political and social dangers of any form of eman-
cipation were considered to outweigh the economic dis-
advantages of the existing condition, and for years the
war of contending political parties went on with a degree
of acrimony probably never before equaled in political
discussion between the different parts of the same coun-
try. It passed through all the stages of fugitive-slave
lavv^s, Dred Scott decision, Kansas-Nebraska bill, abolition
v/arfare, underground railways, and reached the acute
phase of the slavery and free-soil war in "bleeding
Kansas."
From the smoke of that conflict, like a genie from
a malignantly enchanted box in "Arabian Nights," arose
the most striking figure of the long and bitter strife
