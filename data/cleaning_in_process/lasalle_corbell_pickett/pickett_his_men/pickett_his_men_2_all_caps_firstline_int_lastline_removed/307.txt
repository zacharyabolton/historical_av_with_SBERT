only the brigades of Hoke and Hays to help Ewell
pursue the Union forces and wrest from them the cov-
eted hill. Far up on the rugged height was a deadly
crest of frowning guns rolling their awful thunder across
the valley. Their lightnings flashed like merciless swords
through the heavy clouds of battle-smoke. Gordon was
still absent, and the brigades of Rodes were exhausted
with heavy marching and yet heavier fighting. Ewell
was brave, but there are times when even the bravest
dare not.
Hill's two divisions had been engaged in the recent at-
tack against the First Corps and he was not willing to send
them again into battle. Longstreet's men had not been
able to pass Ewell's wagon-train. Johnson had eighteen
miles to march and had not arrived, and Anderson was in
the rear of Johnson. When Johnson's division, which was
the first reinforcement, came up, the sun had set and the
plan of attack was abandoned.
Johnson took position at Rock Creek, intending to oc-
cupy Culp's Hill, almost joining Cemetery Hill on the
east. Had he mounted a battery on Culp's Hill the Fed-
eral position on Cemetery would have become untenable.
Ewell also thought of taking possession of Culp, and
would not fall back to Seminary Ridge, in accordance
with Lee's suggestion.
At four o'clock, Hancock arrived, took command of
the defeated Union army and became the savior of the
battle of Gettysburg to the Federals. The Eleventh
Corps reformed around Von Steinwehr across the Taney-

Doubleday's divisions on the heights resting on the Em-
mitsburg road. Wadsworth's division was stationed on
Culp's Hill, which commands the valley of Rock Creek,
faces Wolf's Hill and Benner's Hill, and protects Ceme-
