husband's old comrades and friends, came up and, cor-
dially reaching' out his hand, said:
" How do you do, Mrs. Pickett? Where is the General?
What are you doing here, and where are you going?"
He himself was returnmg to his home in the far South,
but had been called back to Baltimore on business.
" Thank you, General B ," I said. " My husband has
gone to farming. He has turned his sword into a plow-
share, and 1 am going to visit his aunt, whom I have
never seen. He is to come to us after a little while;
could not leave conveniently just now. He is very well, I
thank you."
"I am so glad to have seen you," he said. "Will see
you later on," and was hobblingaway on his crutches. He
saw by my manner that he had said something to embar-
rass me, something hurtful to me, and left with a pained
look. He was dressed in his old Confederate gray.
The brass buttons had all been cut off, in obedience to the
order at the custom-house office.
For several moments not a word was spoken. Then
I looked up and said:
" My tickets and stateroom, please."
" I thought you said your name was Corbell," said he
of the hooked nose, as he held my money shaking in his
hand. "I thought you said your husband's rank was not
sufficient to have made an impression; that in all proba-
bility I had never heard of him."
Oh, that smacking sound of jaw and tongue, and that
beak of a nose, and those little black eyes which grew into
Siamese twins as they glared at me like a snake! He did
not move, but said, while an undefined fear of him made
me tremble and grow cold:
"Your name was Corbell, and your husband was in the
country. He was an officer of low rank."
