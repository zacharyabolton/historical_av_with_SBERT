The "incompatibility of interest," which Mr. Madison
recognized as one of the leading elements of discord
capable of resulting in "nullification," "secession," and
" farewell separation," was impressively illustrated in the
discussions of the commercial convention which met in
1838 at Augusta, Georgia, and afterward at Charleston,
South Carolina.
In this convention a comparison was made between
the relative commercial conditions of North and South
before and after the Union. In colonial times the com-
merce of the South was far superior to that of the North;
under the Constitution the difference was very largely in
favor of the North. In 1760 the importations of Virginia
amounted to 850,000 pounds sterling, and that of South
Carolina to 555,000 pounds sterling. The imports of New
York at the same period were only 189,000; of Pennsyl-
vania, 490,000, and of all the New England colonies col-
lectively only 561,000 pounds sterling. In 1821 the im-
ports into New York had risen to about seventy times its
colonial import at an equal time before the adoption of
the Constitution. Those of South Carolina were about the
same as in 1760. In the nullification period of South
Carolina the difference had increased to an enormous ex-
tent. New York had more than doubled, Virginia had
fallen off one-half. South Carolina two-thirds.
There were natural and inherent causes for a difference
in the commercial magnitude of the two sections, but,
making due allowance for these, the convention held that
unfair legislation was the prevailing cause of their busi-
ness depression. The plan of the convention, providing
for the opening of the Southern ports to trade with for-
eign countries, failed. This failure, though partly the ef-
fect of Northern advantages of navigation, business apti-
tude, and free labor, was yet held by the South to be in
