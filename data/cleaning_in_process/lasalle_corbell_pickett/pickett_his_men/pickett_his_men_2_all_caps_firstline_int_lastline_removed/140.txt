my government, can not allow any joint occupation until
so ordered by my commanding general."
The English captain said, "I have one thousand men
on board the ships ready to land to-night."
"Captain, you have the force to land, but if you under-

"Very well," answered Hornby, "I shall land them at

"If you will give me forty-eight hours," said Captain
Pickett, "till I hear from my commanding officer, my
orders may be countermanded. If you don't, you must
be responsible for the bloodshed that will follow."
"Not one minute," was the English captain's reply.
Captain Pickett gave orders for the drawing up of his
men in lines on the hill facing the beach, where the Eng-
lish would have to land.
" We will make a Bunker Hill of it, and don't be afraid
of their big guns," said Pickett to his men.
The following is an extract from the report of General
Harney to General Scott:
The senior ofl&cer of three British ships of war threatened to land
an overpowering force upon Captain Pickett, who nobly replied that
whether they landed fifty or five thousand men his conduct would not
be affected by it; that he would open his fire, and, if compelled, take to
the woods fighting; and so satisfied were the British officers that such
would be his course, that they hesitated in putting their threat into
execution.
The following letter from General Harney to Captain
Pickett defines at length his purpose in transferring troops
to San Juan:
Headquarters Department of Oregon,
Fort Vancouver, W. T., July i8, 1859.
Captain: By Special Orders No. 72, a copy of which is inclosed,
