Longstreet mentions the distinguished gallantry and
skill of Corse while commanding a regiment at the battle
of Frazier's Farm. He led his brigade brilliantly at Five
Forks, was captured at Sailor's Creek, and remained a
prisoner until some months after the close of the war.
The dashing Micah Jenkins fought with great ability
at Seven Pines, and brought on the battle of Frazier's
Farm by leading his battalion of sharpshooters in a charge
upon a battery, which he captured. He was afterward
placed in command of a brigade which was incorporated
into Pickett's division, and was held in reserve at Fred-
ericksburg. Greatly to the regret of General Pickett, and
the crippling of the division, he was left on guard-duty
when Pennsylvania was invaded and the battle of Gettys-
burg was fought.
When General Longstreet was transferred to Tennessee,
Jenkins, with his brigade of South Carolinians, was at-
tached to Hood's division and accompanied him. He dis-
played great skill in leading his command across Lookout
Mountain after the attack upon Hooker's rear-guard.
In the Wilderness he rode next to Longstreet and said:
"I am happy; I have felt despair of the cause for some
months, but am relieved, and feel assured that we will put
the enemy back across the Rapidan before night." Scarce
had the words left his lips when the party, mistaken for
an advance of the enemy, was fired upon, Jenkins falling
mortally wounded, and Longstreet being shot through
shoulder and throat.
Among those members of the division who distin-
guished themselves in less prominent positions was Colo-
nel Eppa Hunton of the Eighth Regiment. Colonel
Hunton did not seem to find his long experience in por-
ing over musty files in a law-office any obstacle to a gal-
lant military career. By common consent of humanity,
