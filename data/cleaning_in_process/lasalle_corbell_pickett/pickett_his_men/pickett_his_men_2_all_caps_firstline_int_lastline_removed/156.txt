then for the General's wife. I had seen the carriage and
the guard and retinue, but did not know who the visitors
were. In those suspicious times of trouble and anxiety
we did not wait for formal announcements, and we were
following on after the servant who went to answer the
bell. When I heard the caller ask for George Pickett's

his father's friend a dewy baby kiss, seeming to feel with
the prescient infant instinct the tie that binds. As I took
my baby back again, Mr. Lincoln said in that deep and
sympathetic voice which was one of his greatest powers

I had sometimes wondered at the General's reverential
way of speaking of President Lincoln, but as I looked up
at his honest, earnest face, and felt the warm clasp of his
great, strong hand, I marveled no more that all who knew
him should love him. When, but a few days later, the

steer her through the breakers ahead. Again must she
feel the smart of fanaticism."

military services:
