The mystic light grew dim and the moon hid behind
dark veils of cloud. The soft rain fell on the woodlands
of Rock Creek and on the Round Tops hidden away in
the folds of the heavy clouds. It dropped gently on the
stones above the peaceful sleepers in the mountain ceme-
tery and on the weary, restless slumberers on the blood-
drenched ground. Still the gray groups sheltered them-
selves under the trees that bordered the rippling stream,
and down behind the rugged slope of Round Top the
watchers kept silent guard till the dawn of a new day
faintly silvered the east.
