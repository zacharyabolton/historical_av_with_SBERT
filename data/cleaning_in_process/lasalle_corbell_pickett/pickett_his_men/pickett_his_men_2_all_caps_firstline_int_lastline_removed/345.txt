DETAILED FOR SPECIAL DUTY.
The temperature of the summer of 1863 seemed to
keep pace with the high tide of war. The heat was so
excessive that the schools were closed early.
The first week in June I was graduated from my alma
mater. I stopped in Richmond for a few days en route
to my home within the Federal lines. The day after I
arrived I received a letter dated at Culpeper Court-house,
June 13, full of faith in a successful campaign, a short
separation, and a "speedy termination of the difificulties."
June 15 and 18 there came other letters, one written on the
march to Winchester, the other after reaching that place,
breathing the same spirit of confidence and hope. Until
the fatal third of July such letters came to me, expressing
hope and trust — always hope and trust.
Then drifted to us rumors, faint and indefinite at first,
of a great battle fought at Gettysburg. Gradually they
grew stronger and brighter, and the mind of the South
became imbued with the impression that a grand victory
had been won. Thus the news first came to us, trans-
muted in the balmy air of the South from the appalling
disaster it really was into the glorious triumph which our
longing hearts hoped it might be. A few days of this
glowing dream, and then — the heartbreaking truth.
I could hear nothing of the General except the vague
rumor that he had been killed in the final charge. Our
mail facilities were very meager, and our letters were
smuggled through the lines by any trustworthy person
