" It is too good a book to be lent around in this way to
the men," said a book-lover, jealously, glancing over the
many penciled marks; for after the initiatory christening
and comments the men began in turn as they read it to
write their sentiments, till every space — margin, fly-leaf,
every spot, in fact, where the pencil could find room for
a name, a word, a thought — was covered.
"Let them have the book and mark it all they want
to, for nothing is too good for the poor devils," said the
General, as he smilingly read aloud these marginal notes:
"Abe Lincoln re-elected; has called for a million of men;
and Jeff Davis says war to the knife. What shall we do? "
And again, "We sadly miss thy green persimmons, dear
old Chester, with which thy fields did once so abound, and
which did mercifully help us in our efforts to draw up our
stomachs to the size of our rations." " As our fore-
fathers resisted British tyranny, so we shall resist the as-
sault upon our constitutional freedom and the sovereignty
of the States of the Confederacy."
I have the old book now, and, in comparison with it,
the most gorgeous edition de luxe of Victor Hugo ever
sent out by enterprising publisher to ravish the eye of the
connoisseur is of no value whatever. ^' Les Miserables"
was one of the few books published in Charleston, and was
printed on paper manufactured in the Confederacy. The
General sent on and bought for his men a number of copies
of it and of several other books published at that time.
One of my greatest pleasures was to ride along the
lines with the General. The easy, graceful movement of
my horse, the amber sunlight, the glint of color in a late
autumn flower which had escaped the tramp of heavy feet,
the ringing cheers of the men as they saw us coming, all
helped to make me lose sight for a moment of the awful
cause of our being there.
