About ten days earlier General Dix, at Fortress Monroe,
had been ordered to threaten Richmond, left with but a
weak defense. Troops were sent to Yorktown and the
White House. Seven thousand men under General Getty-
moved to Hanover Junction to destroy Lee's communica-

and go on to Wrightsville. He desired to secure the
bridge at that place, as it would furnish a passage for Lee's
army across a difficult stream which would otherwise
present an impassable barrier. When he appeared the
Pennsylvania militia retreated across the bridge and set
