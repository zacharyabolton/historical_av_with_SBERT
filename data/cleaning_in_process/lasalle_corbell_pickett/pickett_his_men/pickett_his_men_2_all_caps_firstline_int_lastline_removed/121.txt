had some days the start of him, and when the division
of General Twiggs reached the pass of Cerro Gordo he
found there a battery and a hostile line crossing the road.
Captain Joseph E. Johnston, topographical engineer,
discovered these obstacles to comfortable progress, hav-
ing the misfortune, while prospecting for them, to arrest
two musket-balls proceeding on their lively way. Some
of us may be impressed by the fact that Joseph E. early
formed the habit of stopping musket-balls, and that it
lingered with him uncomfortably until a much later period
in his military career.
Santa Anna, being aware of these explorations on the
part of the invader, spent the 12th of August in examin-
ing his lines and preparing for an attack the next day.
Having attended to his military duties, he dined with his
staff and high officers, enjoying the patriotic music of his
fine band, and congratulating himself and his friends upon
the prospect of having yellow fever as a valuable ally in
fighting the enemy, a pious aspiration which has since
been known to bring solace to the Spanish mind.
The longed-for ally did not appear in time to be of
service, and the next day the crags of Cerro Gordo,
through which Santa Anna had said "not even a goat
could pick his way," were overrun with the soldiers of
General Shields. Santa Anna's chief of cuirassiers,
Velasco, fell at the foot of Telegrafo; and Vasquez, the
central hero of the Mexican army, the admiration of
friend and foe alike, surrounded by the guns of his bat-
tery, had the happiness to meet a soldier's glorious
death.
In the rocky cliffs of the Telegrafo, Captain John B.
Magruder gave evidence of those fighting qualities which
were afterward to be used against the flag for which he
was now doing such valiant battle.
