ultory fire. An attack by Richardson was then repulsed.
Through mistake, Rodes's brigade was withdrawn from
position and the Federals took advantage of the gap thus
formed to break through G. B. Anderson's line, Anderson
being mortally wounded. General R. H. Anderson and
General Wright were also wounded and taken from the
field.
The object of all this display by Hooker was to enable
Burnside to effect a crossing at the Rohrersville turnpike,
over the bridge since known as "Burnside's Bridge," op-
posite the right wing of Longstreet. The western end of
this bridge was held by Toombs with three Georgia regi-
ments and one of Jenkins's South Carolina regiments,
supported by batteries stationed among the trees.
Upon this bridge Sturgis led a bayonet charge, sup-
ported by a heavy cannonade, but was forced to retreat
by the concentrated fire of Longstreet's gun and the rifles.
There were just six hundred of Toombs's gallant riflemen,
brave as the dashing six hundred who have charged down
the highway of history ever since Balaklava, and four
times they sent the storming party back across the east
end of the bridge. There was a sheltered ford below the
bridge, and Rodman's division made a double-quick charge
across it and reached the west bank. This rendered the
position at the bridge untenable, and a little later Burn-
side's corps crossed the bridge and climbed the heights,
attacking Longstreet and driving back the brigades of
Drayton, Kemper and Garnett (Pickett's brigade). Jones's
division broke and retreated to Sharpsburg.
Burnside had been successful against Longstreet, but
A. P. Hill came upon the field with three thousand four
hundred men ready to descend upon Burnside's brigades,
notwithstanding a march of seven hours, in which time
they had made seventeen miles. A flood of fire poured
