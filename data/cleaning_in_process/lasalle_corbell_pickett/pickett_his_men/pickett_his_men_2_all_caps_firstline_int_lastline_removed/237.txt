leadership of Bearing and, upon his promotion, became
Blount's battery, Captain J. R. Blount being its leader.
It was organized in Lynchburg in 1861, and did good serv-
ice at the first battle of Manassas, being said to have fired
the first guns on that day. In 1862, it was in active service
in the Peninsula, and supported Pickett's brigade with
distinguished honor at Seven Pines and Gaines's Mill. In
December, 1862, it was made a part of Dearing's battalion
and attached to Pickett's division, serving in the expedi-
tion to Suffolk and at Gettysburg, and in many subsequent
engagements. It was neither captured nor surrendered,
but pushed its way on to its native city of Lynchburg
where it disbanded and destroyed its guns.
On the first of November, 1862, Pickett's division was
moved from Orange Court-house to Fredericksburg, where
it was confronted with Burnside's Army of the Potomac.
Here a brigade was formed for Colonel M. D. Corse, and
became a part of Pickett's division. Colonel Corse had
also previously commanded Pickett's brigade for a short
time while Pickett lay wounded.
Pickett's division at this time was about ninety-one
hundred strong. The fate of many a brave man is yet to
be recorded before these pages are finished.
