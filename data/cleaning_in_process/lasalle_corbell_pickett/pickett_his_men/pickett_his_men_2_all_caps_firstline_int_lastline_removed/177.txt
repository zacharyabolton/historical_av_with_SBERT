Southern statesmen, Calhoun, the unparalleled champion
of States' rights.
What wonder that, when the vital crisis came, the South
should resort once more to that course which had served
her so well in the past — secession?
Abraham Lincoln's avowed principle was that if slav-
ery was wrong for the North, it was wrong for the South,
and that the Federal Union must be all slave or all free
territory. When, in i860, he was elected President the
Southern States looked upon the Union as substantially
broken and the cotton States wanted to secede at once.
They summoned conventions, in accordance with the prec-
edent of 1787 in the adoption of the Federal Constitution.
Through these conventions they revoked the assent of
each commonwealth to the federal compact and, as
sovereign commonwealths, they formed a new federal
compact, as the Southern Confederacy.
The border States, were bitterly opposed to secession,
taking no part in the movement, anxiously and prayerfully
awaiting the policy of President Lincoln — but, alas! they
interpreted his inaugural speech as a declaration of war.
After his Cabinet meeting, March 29, 1861, he ordered a
naval expedition to be in readiness to move on to Sumter
and Pickens. On April 12, 1861, Beauregard, in opposi-
tion to this armed invasion, opened fire, and Mr. Lincoln
further verified the interpretation of his address by issuing
an ofificial call for seventy-five thousand volunteers to over-
come " combinations too powerful to be suppressed by ju-
dicial proceedings." The border States, who had hereto-
fore been for peace, at once put on their war-paint.
Virginia, who, but a month before, had by a vote of
ninety to forty-five rejected the ordinance of secession,
now immediately passed it. North Carolina, Tennessee
and Arkansas followed in hot haste.
