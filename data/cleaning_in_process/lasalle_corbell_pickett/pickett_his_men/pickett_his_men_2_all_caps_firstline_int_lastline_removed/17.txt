Why do I write this book? To add my tribute to the
memory of my hero husband and the noble men who fol-
lowed him through the trials, dangers and hardships of a
four years' war. The impulse which moves me is love,
and I have endeavored that nothing should be written un-
worthy of that motive. If anything expressed or implied
shall give pain to any, whether he wore the gray or the
blue, it is contrary to the purpose or the wishes of the
author â€” contrary to the chivalrous soul of the soldier
and patriot, George E. Pickett, whose courage and con-
stancy this work is intended to commemorate.
In the compilation of this record the reader must know
that I could not bring personal witness to the events de-
scribed. They are based upon the official and other re-
ports of eye-witnesses and participants. In treating of
the maneuvers and engagements herein mentioned, I have
excluded every disparaging statement which the facts of
history and justice to all participants would possibly per-
mit. I have purposely avoided reading histories of the
conflict by authors on both sides, and based my own nar-
rative upon original material, to avoid the possibility of
traveling over ground already covered by others.
Upon the battle-field I visited last year grew a wonder-
ful wealth of white daisies, piled drift upon drift like the
banks of snow that glitter in the light of the winter sun.
So blossom the flowers of peace and love and hope in the
hearts which yet fondly cherish the memory of the long-
gone days of darkness and of blood.
