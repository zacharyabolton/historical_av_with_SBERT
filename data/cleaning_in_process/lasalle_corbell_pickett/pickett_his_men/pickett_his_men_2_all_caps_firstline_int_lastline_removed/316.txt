the position without a contest. Warren directed them to
unfurl their flags and signal for help. Sykes sent Colonel
Vincent with a brigade of the Fifth Corps to the foot of
Little Round Top. Hazlett's battery struggled up the
rocky acclivity and amid a heavy rain of bullets took posi-
tion, circling the crest with a deadly coronet.
Colonel Patrick O'Rourke, with the One Hundred and
Fortieth New York, dashed up the hill and came face to
face with the almost victorious soldiers of Law climb-
ing up the opposite side. The Federal muskets were
empty but there was no time to load. "This way, boys!"
shouted O'Rourke, drawing his sword and circling it high
in the air. Over the height he rushed and down the slope
into a sea of fire and smoke from which his gallant soul
went up above the warfare of the world.
Hood's Texans dashed again and again upon the flam-

the inspiration of the ardent Texans, was wounded and
Law led on the charge.
Vincent, defending the hill at its base, followed O'Rourke
beyond the battle. Weed fell upon the flame-girdled
crest, and Hazlett, bending over to catch his last dying
words, sank lifeless across the dying chief.
The valor of Hood's Texans and Law's men of
Alabama had not dimmed, but they had lost heavily in

tieth Maine, and retarding that of the wings.
Brave Texans, noble sons of Alabama, no more price-
less treasure sanctifies the field of Gettysburg than your
