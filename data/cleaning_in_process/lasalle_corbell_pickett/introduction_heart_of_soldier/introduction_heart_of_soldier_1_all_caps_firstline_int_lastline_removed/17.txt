An Introductory Chapter
from the One to Whom these Letters
were Written
EARLY in life's morning I knew and
loved him, and from my first meeting
with him to the end, I always called him
"Soldier"â€” "My Soldier." I was a wee bit
of a girl at that first meeting. I had been
visiting my grandmother, when whooping-
cough broke out in the neighborhood, and she
took me off to Old Point Comfort to visit her
friend, Mrs. Boykin, the sister of John Y.
Mason. I could dance and sing and play
games and was made much of by the other
children and their parents there, till I sud-
denly developed the cough, then I was
shunned and isolated.
