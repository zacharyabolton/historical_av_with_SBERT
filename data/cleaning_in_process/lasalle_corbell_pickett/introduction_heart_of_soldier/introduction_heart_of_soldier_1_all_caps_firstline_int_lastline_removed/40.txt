they were looking earnestly into each other's
eyes. Grant, ever faithful to his friends, had
been urging my Soldier to accept the marshal-
ship of the State of Virginia. Pickett, sorely
as he needed the appointment, knew the de-
mands upon Grant, and that his acceptance
would create criticism and enemies for the
President. He shook his head, saying:
"You can't afford to do this for me, Sam,
and I can't afford to take it."
"I can afford to do anything I please," said
Grant. My Soldier still shook his head, but
the deep emotion of his heart shone in his tear-
dimmed eyes, and in Grant's, as they silently
grasped each other's hands and then walked
away in opposite directions and looked out of
separate windows, while I stole away.
My Soldier was urged to accept the posi-
tion with Generals Beauregard and Early
in connection with the Louisiana Lottery.
There was a large salary attached to it, but
he said there was not money enough in the
world to induce him to lend his name to it.
