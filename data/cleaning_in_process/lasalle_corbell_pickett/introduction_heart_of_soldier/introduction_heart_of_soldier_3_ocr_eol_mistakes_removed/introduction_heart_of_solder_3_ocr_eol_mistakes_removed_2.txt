An Introductory Chapter
from the One to Whom these Letters
were Written
EARLY in life's morning I knew and
loved him, and from my first meeting
with him to the end, I always called him
"Soldier"— "My Soldier." I was a wee bit
of a girl at that first meeting. I had been
visiting my grandmother, when whooping-
cough broke out in the neighborhood, and she
took me off to Old Point Comfort to visit her
friend, Mrs. Boykin, the sister of John Y.
Mason. I could dance and sing and play
games and was made much of by the other
children and their parents there, till I suddenly developed the cough, then I was
shunned and isolated.I could not understand the change. I
would press my face against the ball-room
window-panes and watch the merry-making
inside and my little heart would almost break.
One morning, while playing alone on the
beach, I saw an officer lying on the sand reading, under the shelter of an umbrella. I had
noticed him several times, always apart from
the others, and very sad. I could imagine but
one reason for his desolation and in pity for
him, I crept under his umbrella to ask him
if he, too, had the whooping-cough. He
smiled and answered no; but as I still persisted he drew me to him, telling me that he
had lost someone who was dear to him and
he was very lonely.
And straightway, without so much as a by-
your-leave, I promised to take the place of his
dear one and to comfort him in his loss.
Child as I was, I believe I lost my heart to
him on the spot. At all events, I crept from
under the umbrella pledged to Lieutenant
George E. Pickett, U. S. A., for life and death,
and I still hold most sacred a little ring and
locket that he gave me on that day.
It is small wonder that this first picture of him is among the most vivid still ; the memory
of him as he lay stretched in the shade of
the umbrella, not tall, and rather slender, but
very graceful, and perfect in manly beauty.
With childish appreciation, I particularly noticed his very small hands and feet. He had
beautiful gray eyes that looked at me through
sunny lights — eyes that smiled with his lips.
His mustache was gallantly curled. His hair
was exactly the color of mine, dark brown,
and long and wavy, in the fashion of the time.
The neatness of his dress attracted even a
child's admiration. His shirt-front of the
finest white linen, was in soft puffs and ruffles, and the sleeves were edged with hemstitched thread cambric ruffles. He would
never, to the end of his life, wear the stiff linen
collars and cuffs and stocks which came into
fashion among men. While he was at West
Point he paid heavily in demerits for obstinacy in refusing to wear the regulation
stock. Only when the demerits reached the
danger-point would he temporarily give up
his soft necktie.
It was under that umbrella, in the days that
followed, that I learned, while he guided my
hand, to make my first letters and spell my
first words. They were *'Sally" and "Soldier." I remember, too, the songs he used to
sing me in the clear, rich voice of which his
soldiers were so fond, frequently accompanying himself on the guitar. He kept a diary
of those days and after the war it was returned
to him from San Juan by the British officer
who occupied the island conjointly with him
before the opening of the war. I have it now
in my possession.
Three years after our first meeting I saw
my Soldier again. He had just received his
commission as captain, and was recruiting his
company at Fortress Monroe, before sailing
for San Juan. The first real sorrow of my
life was when I watched the St. Louis go out
to sea with my Soldier on board, bound
around the Horn to Puget Sound, where he
was stationed at Fort Bellingham, which I
thought must be farther than the end of the
world. Forty thousand Indians had risen
against the settlers. For two years he was in
the thick of it, and greatly distinguished himself, but he did even better after the Indians
were suppressed, for he made them his friends,
learned their languages, built school-houses
for them and taught them, and they called
him Nesika Tyee — Our Chief. One old Indian chief insisted upon making him a present of one of his children. He translated the
Lord's Prayer and some of our hymns and patriotic songs into their jargon and taught the
Indians to sing them. He taught me some of
them afterward. Years later, one night after
the Civil War, while we were exiles in Montreal, General Pickett and I were singing a
hymn in Chinook to put our baby to sleep,
when a voice in the next room joined us. At
the close of the hymn a stranger came and
spoke to my Soldier in Chinook. When he
left, he invited us to the theater where he was
playing. He was William Florence, and he
gave me my first taste of the pleasures of the
drama.
Following the Indian war, the quarrel with
the British over the ownership of San Juan
Island reached a white heat, and on the night
of July 26, 1859, my Soldier, with sixty-eight
men, was sent from the mainland to take possession. They were none too soon, for when
morning dawned there were five British warships off the coast, with nineteen hundred and
forty men ready to land. They proposed
joint occupation, but Captain Pickett replied:
**I cannot allow joint occupation until so
ordered by my commanding general."
The English captain said: "I have a
thousand men ready to land to-night."
Captain Pickett replied: "Captain, if you
undertake it, I will fight you as long as I have
a man."
''I shall land at once," said the British ofii-
cer.
"If you will give me forty-eight hours, till
I hear from my commanding officer, my orders may be countermanded. If you don't
you must be responsible for the bloodshed that
will follow."
^'Not one minute," was the English captain's reply.
My Soldier gave orders for the drawing up
of his men in lines on the hill facing the beach
where the English must land.
''We will make a Bunker Hill of it, and
don't be afraid of their big guns," he said.
In his official report General Harney said:
"So satisfied were the British officers that Captain Pickett would carry out this course, that
they hesitated."
The United States retained the Island and
my Soldier remained in command until the
outbreak of the Civil War. But when Virginia passed the Ordinance of Secession he resigned his commission and recognizing the
claims of his native state, joined his fortunes
with those of the Southland, although, like
many others who fought as bravely against the
national government as in happier times they
had fought for it, he loved the Union and
every star in that flag which he had so often
borne to victory.
My Soldier reached Richmond September
13, 1861, and at once enlisted as a private.
The next day he was given a commission as
captain, a short time later promoted to a colonelcy, and early in 1862 received his commission as brigadier-general. In June, while
leading his brigade in a charge at Gaines's
Mill, he was severely wounded in the shoulder, but refused to leave the field, ordering
Dr. Chancellor to extract the bullet on the
field. The surgeon remonstrated, but he said :
''My men need me here, Doctor. Fix me
now."
He was finally carried off, but was back
with his brigade two months before he was
able to draw a sleeve over the wounded arm.
Time has not lessened the fame of Pickett's
Charge at Gettysburg, and it never will ; for
the changes that have taken place in the science of war leave no possibility that future
history will produce its counterpart. Truly,
"the first day of the terrible three at Gettysburg was an accident, the second a blunder"
and the third the greatest tragedy that has
ever been played upon the stage of war.
With its imperishable glory — overshadowing
all other events in martial history, notwithstanding its appalling disaster — is linked forever the name of my Soldier.
Down the slope into the smoke-filled valley
the devoted men followed him as he rode in
advance upon his black war-horse. Their
ranks were thinned and torn and shattered by
the tempest of lead which from every side
was turned on them. Smoke and flame surrounded them. But from the rear the men
sprang to fill the gaps in front as they pressed
after their leader through the tempest of iron.
Five thousand Virginians followed him at
the start; but when the Southern flag floated
on the ridge, in less than half an hour, not two
thousand were left to rally beneath it, and
those for only one glorious, victoryintoxicated moment. They were not strong enough
to hold the position they had so dearly won;
and, broken-hearted, even at the very moment
of his immortal triumph, my Soldier led his
remaining men down the slope again. He
dismounted and walked beside the stretcher
upon which General Kemper, one of his officers, was being carried, fanning him and
speaking cheerfully to comfort him in his suffering. When he reached Seminary Ridge
again and reported to General Lee, his face
was wet with tears as he pointed to the crimson
valley and said:
"My noble division lies there!"
"General Pickett," said the commander,
"you and your men have covered yourselves
with glory."
"Not all the glory in the world, General
Lee," my Soldier replied, "could atone for the
widows and orphans this day has made."
Soon after the great battle my Soldier confided to his corps commander his intention of
marrying, and asked for a furlough. General Longstreet replied that they were not
granting furloughs then, but added, with the
twinkle in his eye which those who knew him
so well will remember: "I might detail you
for special duty and you could, of course, stop
off and get married if you wanted to."
In old St. Paul's Church in Petersburg,
September 15, 1863, we were married, while
the bells rang out the chimes that still make
music from that old belfry and are yet known
as "Pickett's Chimes." In the throng which
crowded the church and extended to the sidewalk were hundreds whose mourning garb attested to the costly sacrifice which Petersburg
had given to the South. Many hands were
reached out to greet my Soldier, and from the
lips of many a black-robed mother came the
words: "My son was with you at Gettysburg
— God bless 5^ou!" A salute of a hundred
guns announced the marriage; cheers followed
us, and chimes and bands and bugles played
as we left for our wedding reception in Richmond.
The food supply of the South was reduced
to narrow limits then. Salt was reclaimed
from the earth under smoke-houses. Guests
at distinguished functions were regaled with
ice-cream made of frozen buttermilk sweetened with sorghum. But friends of the general had almost worked miracles to prepare
a wedding supper. It was sora season, and
those little birds had been killed at night with
paddles — the South being not much richer in
ammunition than in edibles — and contributed
so lavishly to our banquet that it was always
afterward known as "the wedding sora supper." Our wedding present from Mrs. Lee
was a fruit-cake, and Bishop Dudley's mother
sent a black cake she had been saving for her
golden wedding. Little bags of salt and
sugar were sent as presents. The army was
in camp near by, and all the men at the reception, except President Davis, his cabinet,
and a few clergymen, came in full uniform,
officers and privates as well. We returned
without delay to Petersburg, that being my
Soldier's headquarters.
In early May, General Butler, with thirty
thousand men, came down upon Petersburg,
defended by only six hundred. They held
the place till half-starved and ragged reinforcements were hurried in from every direction. We women carried the despatches, and
cooked the food and took it to the men at
the guns. The roar of the cannon and the
shriek of shot and shell filled our ears day and
night. At train-time we would go to the station and send up cheer after cheer to welcome
the train from its short trip out into the country, hoping to blind the Yankees to the fact
that it brought in only the half-starved railroad
men. During the entire week, until he had
Butler safely ^'bottled up at Petersburg," my
Soldier did not sleep, and the only times I saw
him were when I carried his bread and soup
and coffee out to him. It was just as it had
been when he started for Cemetery Hill at
Gettysburg. He would never stop till he had
accomplished his work. After Pickett's Division had retaken Bermuda Hundred the following summer. General Anderson, commanding Longstreet's Corps, wrote to General Lee :
'We tried very hard to stop Pickett and his
men from capturing the breastworks of the
enemy, but we could not do it."
The devotion of General Pickett's men to
him has often been recounted as something
phenomenal. It was equaled only by his devotion to them. Very near the end of the war,
when the army had subsisted on nothing but
corn for many days, as my Soldier was riding
toward Sailor's Creek, a woman ran out of
a house and handed him something to eat.
He carried it in his hand as he rode on. Presently he came upon a soldier lying behind a
log, and spoke to him. The man looked up,
revealing a boyish face, scarcely more than a
child's — thin and pale.
"What's the matter?" asked my Soldier.
"I'm starving, General," the boy replied.
"I couldn't help it. I couldn't keep up, so I
just lay down here to die."
"Take this," handing the boy his luncheon;
"and when you have eaten and rested, go on
back home. It would only waste another life
for you to go on."
The boy took the food eagerly, but replied:
"No, Marse George. If I get strength
enough to go at all, I'll follow you to the last."
He did, for he was killed a few days later
at Sailor's Creek.
I was in Richmond when my Soldier fought
the awful battle of Five Forks, Richmond
surrendered, and the surging sea of fire swept
the city. News of the fate of Five Forks had
reached us, and the city was full of rumors
that General Pickett was killed. I did notbelieve them. I knew he would come back,
he had told me so. But they were very anxious hours. The day after the fire, there was
a sharp rap at the door. The servants had
all run away. The city was full of northern
troops, and my environment had not taught
me to love them. The fate of other cities had
awakened my fears for Richmond. With my
baby on my arm, I answered the knock, opened
the door and looked up at a tall, gaunt, sad-
faced man in ill-fitting clothes, who, with the
accent of the North, asked:
*Ts this George Pickett's place?"
"Yes, sir," I answered, "but he is not here."
"I know that, ma'am," he replied, "but I
just wanted to see the place. I am Abraham
Lincoln."
"The President!" I gasped.
The stranger shook his head and said :
"No, ma'am ; no, ma'am ; just Abraham Lincoln; George's old friend."
"I am George Pickett's wife and this is his
baby," was all I could say. I had never seen
Mr. Lincoln but remembered the intense love
and reverence with which my Soldier always
spoke of him.
My baby pushed away from me and reached
out his hands to Mr. Lincoln, who took him
in his arms. As he did so an expression
of rapt, almost divine, tenderness and love
lighted up the sad face. It was a look that
I have never seen on any other face. My
baby opened his mouth wide and insisted upon
giving his father's friend a dewy infantile kiss.
As Mr. Lincoln gave the little one back to me,
shaking his finger at him playfully, he said:
"Tell your father, the rascal, that I forgive
him for the sake of that kiss and those bright
eyes."
He turned and went down the steps, talking to himself, and passed out of my sight forever, but in my memory those intensely human eyes, that strong, sad face, have a per-
petual abiding place — that face which puzzled all artists but revealed itself to the intuitions of a little child, causing it to hold out
its hands to be taken and its lips to be kissed.
It was through Mr. Lincoln that my Soldier, as a lad of seventeen, received his appointment to West Point. Mr. Lincoln was
at that time associated in law practice with
George Pickett's uncle, Mr. Andrew Johnston, a distinguished lawyer and scholar, who
was very anxious that his nephew should follow in his footsteps and study for the law —
an ambition which, it is needless to say, my
Soldier did not share. He confided his perplexities to Mr. Lincoln, who was very fond
of the boy; and the great statesman went at
once to work to secure his appointment.
After Richmond's fall I anxiously awaited
my Soldier's return, and at last one morning
I caught the familiar clatter of the hoofs of
his little thoroughbred chestnut which he always rode when he came home, and the sound
of his voice saying: "Whoa, Lucy, whoa, little girl."
He gave his staff a farewell breakfast at our
home. They did not once refer to the past,
but each wore a blue strip tied like a sash
around his waist. It was the old headquarter's flag, which they had saved from the surrender and torn into strips, that each might
keep one in sad memory. After breakfast he
went to the door, and from a white rose-bush
which his mother had planted cut a bud for
each. He put one in my hair and pinned
one to the coat of each of his officers. Then
for the first time the tears came, and the men
who had been closer than brothers for four
fearful years, clasped hands in silence and
parted.
Ever since the Mexican War General Grant
had been a dear friend of my Soldier. At
the time our first baby was born the two
armies were encamped facing each other and
they often swapped coffee and tobacco under
flags of truce. On the occasion of my son's
birth bonfires were lighted in celebration all
along Pickett's line. Grant saw them and
sent scouts to learn the cause. When they reported, he said to General Ingalls:
"Haven't we some kindling on this side of
the line? Why don't we strike a light for the
young Pickett?"
In a little while bonfires were flaming from
the Federal line. A few days later there was
taken through the lines a baby's silver service,
engraved: "To George E. Pickett, Jr., from
his father's friends, U. S. Grant, Rufus In-
galls, George Suckley."
It was through their courtesy, at the close
of the war, that we were taken from Richmond down the James to my father's old
home at Chuckatuck. But we were not allowed to remain long at peace. General In-
galls warned my Soldier that General Butler
was making speeches against him in Congress,
and urged that he would be safer on foreign
ground. Though he did not believe it, he
reluctantly consented to go. He mounted
Lucy and rode to the station. It was a pathetic incident that, just as the train moved
out, the chestnut thoroughbred lay down and
died.
We had been in Canada almost a year when
General Grant, learning of our exile, wrote
to us to return, saying that his cartel with
General Lee should be kept, if it required another war to make it good. We went back
to our dear old place, Turkey Island, on the
James River, and built a little cottage in the
place of the magnificent mansion which had
been sacked and burned by order of General
Butler. I once asked my Soldier why it was
called Turkey Island. He replied that there
were two good reasons; one was that it was
not an island, the other that there were never
any turkeys there. Everything, even the
monument in the family cemetery, had been
destroyed, but it was home. We loved it.
My Soldier was always passionately fond of
flowers, and our garden was an unfailing delight to us both.
He tried to turn his sword into a plowshare, but he was not expert with plowshares;
and, worse, he constantly received applications for employment from old comrades no
more skilled than he. All were made welcome, though they might not be able to distinguish a rake from a rail fence or tell
whether potatoes grew on trees or on trellised
vines. They would rise at any hour that
pleased them, linger over breakfast, and then
go out to the fields. If the sun were too hot
or the wind too cold, they would come back,
to sit on the veranda or around the fire till
dinner was ready. There were generals, colonels, majors, captains, lieutenants, privates —
all of one rank now; and he who desired a
graphic history of the four years' war needed
only to listen to the conversation of the agricultural army at Turkey Island. But the inevitable came; resources were in time exhausted, and proprietor and assistants were
forced to seek other fields.
The Khedive of Egypt offered my Soldier
the position of general in his army, but he declined. When General Grant became President, he entertained us as his guests at the
White House, and one of my keenest memories is of President Grant and my Soldier as
they stood facing each other in the White
House office the last day of our visit. Grant's
hand was on the shoulder of my Soldier, and
they were looking earnestly into each other's
eyes. Grant, ever faithful to his friends, had
been urging my Soldier to accept the marshal-
ship of the State of Virginia. Pickett, sorely
as he needed the appointment, knew the demands upon Grant, and that his acceptance
would create criticism and enemies for the
President. He shook his head, saying:
"You can't afford to do this for me, Sam,
and I can't afford to take it."
"I can afford to do anything I please," said
Grant. My Soldier still shook his head, but
the deep emotion of his heart shone in his tear-
dimmed eyes, and in Grant's, as they silently
grasped each other's hands and then walked
away in opposite directions and looked out of
separate windows, while I stole away.
My Soldier was urged to accept the position with Generals Beauregard and Early
in connection with the Louisiana Lottery.
There was a large salary attached to it, but
he said there was not money enough in the
world to induce him to lend his name to it.
When he was offered the governorship of
Virginia, he said that he never again wanted
to hold any office, and would be glad to see
Kemper, his old brigadier, made governor.
Kemper was the only one of Pickett's brigadiers who came out of the battle of Gettysburg, and he was wounded and maimed for
life. He was elected governor, and as he was
a bachelor, my Soldier and I often assisted
him at his receptions.
For himself, my Soldier finally accepted
the general agency for the South of the Washington Life Insurance Company, and held the
office till his death. The headquarters were
at Richmond. I always went with him on
his trips, and we spent our summers in the
Virginia mountains.
External conditions as well as natural instincts made my Soldier's life one of deep and
tragic earnestness. He was always grave and
dignified, but he was fond of jokes, especially
if they were on me. Once, when he was leaving home for an absence of some length, he
asked how much money I would need. I
made a laborious calculation, and named a
sum which he promptly doubled. He had
not been gone long when I remembered an
obligation, and telegraphed him that I had
underestimated the amount. By the next
mail came a check carefully made payable to
"Mrs. Oliver Twist." I had to indorse it in
that way, and he always carried the cheque in
his pocket afterward for my benefit. I have
it now.
At the wedding breakfast given for General Magruder's niece at the mansion of the
governor-general of Canada, the governor
asked my Soldier to what he attributed the
failure of the Confederates at Gettysburg.
With a twinkle in his eyes, he replied, "Well,
I think the Yankees had a little something to
do with it."
In the summer of 1B75, when we were prepared to start for White Sulphur Springs, my
Soldier was suddenly called to Norfolk.
Very much against his advice, I insisted on
accompanying him. It was fortunate, for
after two days of anxious work he fell ill, and
died there. The evening he was dying, the
doctor wanted to give him an anodyne, but he
said:
"Doctor, you say that I must die. I want
to go in my right mind. I would rather suffer pain and know. Please leave me now. I
do not want anybody but my wife."
The longest procession of mourners ever
known in Virginia followed him to his grave
on Gettysburg Hill, in beautiful Hollywood.
General Longstreet has written of my Soldier:
These were the tributes of friend and enemy — if any man, though he fought him on
the field of battle, could be called his enemy.
Rivers of blood did not quench the flames of
the campfires of Mexico and the West. My
Soldier's comrades under the old flag were
still his comrades through the crucial test of
that most deadly warfare, a conflict between
the opposing sections of the same country.
To me the legacy of love that he left in his
letters and in the memories of his daily life
is greater than any riches earth could give.
The nobility of soul with which he met the
problems that come to men in the arena of
the world is a treasured possession in my
heart even greater than his magnificent heroism on the field of battle. The radiance of
the stars in the blue sky of peace eclipse the
crimson glow of the fiery comet of war. The
heart of "My Soldier" is mine to-day as it was
in that long-gone yesterday when I awaited
the messages that link the battlefield with tomorrow's Eternal Harmony.
