It was through Mr. Lincoln that my Sol-
dier, as a lad of seventeen, received his ap-
pointment to West Point. Mr. Lincoln was
at that time associated in law practice with
George Pickett's uncle, Mr. Andrew John-
ston, a distinguished lawyer and scholar, who
was very anxious that his nephew should fol-
low in his footsteps and study for the law â€”
an ambition which, it is needless to say, my
Soldier did not share. He confided his per-
plexities to Mr. Lincoln, who was very fond
of the boy; and the great statesman went at
once to work to secure his appointment.
After Richmond's fall I anxiously awaited
my Soldier's return, and at last one morning
I caught the familiar clatter of the hoofs of
his little thoroughbred chestnut which he al-
ways rode when he came home, and the sound
of his voice saying: "Whoa, Lucy, whoa, lit-
tle girl."
