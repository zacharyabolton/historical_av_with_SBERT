THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
"Haven't we some kindling on this side of
the line? Why don't we strike a light for the
young Pickett?"
In a little while bonfires were flaming from
the Federal line. A few days later there was
taken through the lines a baby's silver service,
engraved: "To George E. Pickett, Jr., from
his father's friends, U. S. Grant, Rufus In-
galls, George Suckley."
It was through their courtesy, at the close
of the war, that we were taken from Rich-
mond down the James to my father's old
home at Chuckatuck. But we were not al-
lowed to remain long at peace. General In-
galls warned my Soldier that General Butler
was making speeches against him in Congress,
and urged that he would be safer on foreign
ground. Though he did not believe it, he
reluctantly consented to go. He mounted
Lucy and rode to the station. It was a pa-
thetic incident that, just as the train moved
out, the chestnut thoroughbred lay down and
died.
