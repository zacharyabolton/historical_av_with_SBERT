THE HEART OF A SOLDIER.
morning dawned there were five British war-
ships off the coast, with nineteen hundred and
forty men ready to land. They proposed
joint occupation, but Captain Pickett replied:
**I cannot allow joint occupation until so
ordered by my commanding general."
The English captain said: "I have a
thousand men ready to land to-night."
Captain Pickett replied: "Captain, if you
undertake it, I will fight you as long as I have
a man."
''I shall land at once," said the British ofii-
cer.
"If you will give me forty-eight hours, till
I hear from my commanding officer, my or-
ders may be countermanded. If you don't
you must be responsible for the bloodshed that
will follow."
^'Not one minute," was the English cap-
tain's reply.
My Soldier gave orders for the drawing up
of his men in lines on the hill facing the beach
where the English must land.
