THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
results in no querulous spirit, and felt his obligation to
share its effects.
"No word of blame, or censure even, of his superior
officers ever escaped Pickett's lips, but he nevertheless felt
profoundly the sacrifice of his gallant soldiers vi^hom he so
loved. At Five Forks he had a desperate but a fighting
chance, and if any soldier could have snatched victory
from defeat, it w^as the intrepid Pickett, and it was cruel
to leave that brilliant and heroic leader and his Spartan
band to the same hard straits they so nobly met at Gettys-
burg. At Five Forks Pickett lost more men in thirty
minutes than we lost, all told, in the recent Spanish-
American war from bullets, wounds, sickness, or any other
casualty, showing the unsurpassed bravery with which
Pickett fought, and the tremendous odds and insuperable
disadvantages under and against which this incomparable
soldier so bravely contended ; but with George E. Pickett,
whether fighting under the stars and stripes at Chapultepec,
or under the stars and bars at Gettysburg, duty was his
polar star, and with him duty was above consequences, and
at a crisis, he would throw them overboard,"
General McClellan has said:
"Perhaps there is no doubt that he was the best infantry
soldier developed on either side during the Civil War.
His friends and admirers are by no means confined to the
Southern people or soldiers to whom he gave his heart and
best affections and of whom he was so noble a type, but
throughout the North and on the Pacific coast, where he
long served, his friends and lovers are legion.
