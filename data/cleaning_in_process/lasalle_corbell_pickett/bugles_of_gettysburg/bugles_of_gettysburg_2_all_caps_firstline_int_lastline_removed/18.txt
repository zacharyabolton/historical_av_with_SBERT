days in which a Nation was saved and a Na-
tion was lost.
Three persons are standing in the valley
looking in awed silence at Seminary Ridge and
across the sunlit space to the range opposite,
as if the long ranks of men who passed over
that ground fifty years ago were before their
eyes and they heard the crash of the guns that
made deadly gaps in the line.
One of them is an old man, white-haired and
stooped, with a step that has lost its youthful
alertness. He is in the darkening shadows of
lifeâ€™s dimming twilight and yet as he wanders
over the historic field the bugles of the past
echo in his heart and his pulses bound again
with the fervor of youth. The winds of battle
sweep around him as he follows the flag up that
flame-crested height to the mouth of the blaz-
ing guns.
Beside him is a gentle-faced woman with a
wealth of gray hair in soft waves around her
face, and dark eyes that hold sad memories of
one who lost his life there. Her gaze is lifted
above the old line of march, seeking visions
beyond the mountains. An officer in the blue
uniform of the United States Army looks down
at her with filial love.
