ASihhs OF] G LORY
Above the plain, over the range of hills and
around the desolate peaks of the Round Tops
that keep solemn guard over the ground on
which the greatest chapter of our history was
written, the echoes of the bugles of Gettysburg
yet thrill with quivering memories of the days
that consecrated those hills to immortality.
And to the three who stand there together,
hand clasped in hand, eyes dimmed with tears,
this is the story the bugles tell.
