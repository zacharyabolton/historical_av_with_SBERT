INTO THE HEART OF THE STORM
ROM Canada our travelers rode south-
ward, keeping to trackless wilderness
and mountain roads. After some days they
struck a narrow pass in the Cumberland Moun-
tains where the range divides the golden fields
of old Kentucky from the neighboring lands of
Tennessee. A storm had swept down upon
the heights and a swirl of strong winds hurled
itself wildly over the towering gray ramparts
and against the jagged walls of the dark moun-
tain-clefts. Lightnings flashed into the black
corridors and thunders reverberated from wall
to wall like the crash of guns in a great artil-
lery battle. Riding through the pass the
Captain and Jasper stopped under a shelving
ledge, sheltering themselves from the blinding
sheets of rain.
“T say, Captain.”
“Well?”
“This doesn’t seem like hospitable Ken-
tucky.”’
