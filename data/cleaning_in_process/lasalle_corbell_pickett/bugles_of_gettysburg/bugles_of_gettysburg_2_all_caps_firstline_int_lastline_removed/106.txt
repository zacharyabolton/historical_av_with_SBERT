“DEAREST Cousin MINE:
On the 3d of June we joined Longstreet on
his way to Culpeper Courthouse. Remem-
bering my promise to you, the first thing I
did after necessary preliminaries was to hunt
up Colonel Carrington and give him your let-
ter and message. Allow me to congratulate
you on your good judgment. The Colonel is
a fine fellow.
“Longstreet, the Apostle, ‘Old Peter,’ as
the soldiers have nicknamed him, seems to
have all the attributes of a great soldier, —not
the dash perhaps of him who fell at Chancel-
lorsville, but he has care, caution, and bull-
doggedness, which are equally necessary, and
all the country knows how brave he is.
