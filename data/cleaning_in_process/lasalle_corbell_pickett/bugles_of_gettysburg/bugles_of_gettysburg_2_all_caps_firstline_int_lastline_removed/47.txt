as I am, they have an eye on my place, for some
reason.”
A commotion below called the old sailor away
and his guests heard him saying:
“On with your serious mug and doctor’s
coat, shipmate.”’
He went on down the stairs and his voice
came back to them in greeting to apparently
unwelcome visitors:
“Officers is it you want? You won’t find
*em here. What do you think I want o’ shoot-
ing irons and cutting things around Sailors’
Rest? This is a peaceful harbor for unsea-
worthy craft to sail into and put up for repairs.
You won’t find anything here but boats gone to
wreck and sea-dogs on their last legs.”’
“T suppose you will let us look around over
your upper deck, will you not? This young
man was on the boat with them and heard
them arranging to come here.”
“There’s no one come yet, but go right
ahead; no, wait. Better ask old Pill-box first.
There’s a sick man up there steering straight
for t’other world with a gospel pilot towing
him in, and you might have to step in quiet.
Here comes the medical mate. These gentle-
men want to go up, Doc.”
