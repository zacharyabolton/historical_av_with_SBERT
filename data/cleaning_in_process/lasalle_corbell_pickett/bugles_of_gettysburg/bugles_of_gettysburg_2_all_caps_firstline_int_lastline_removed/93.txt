Throwing his bridle to Pete he entered the
central tent. Darkness yet lingered inside
and on a small table was a tallow candle which
had burned nearly down to the wooden block
that served as a candlestick. Its wavering
light glimmered over a map spread upon the
table, above which two men were bending in
puzzled study, a Major-General seated on a
camp-chair and a Brigadier looking over his
shoulder. .
The Brigadier was tall and rugged, with
dark face deeply marked, as if each experi-
ence of life had engraved its line in the his-
tory written on his countenance. There was
nothing of the reckless dash of the enthusias-
tic warrior in his aspect, yet one looking at him
felt that when the time should come he would
lead a forlorn hope to the mouth of the guns
and fall before them. It must have been in a
spasmodic ebullition of youthful spirits that
he had made an onslaught upon his comrade,
Jubal A. Early, at West Point and had been
expelled from that venerable institution for
such premature display of valor.
