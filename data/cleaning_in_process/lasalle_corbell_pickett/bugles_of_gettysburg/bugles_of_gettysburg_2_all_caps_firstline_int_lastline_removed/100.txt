mothers away back in the centuries. She
wore it at a ball in the court of Louis the Superb
and danced with Prince Condé. But the roses
bloomed today and belong to the sunshine.”
“The roses blossomed in the sunshine of your
presence and belong to you. As for the robe,
I venture the Court Lady did not look half so
pretty in it as her descendant does.”
“Condé could tell you better than that,
flatterer, but just you wait till you see Nannie
Wickham. She has a really and truly new
dress, smuggled through the lines. It is a
dream and so is she, and you shall fall in love
with her.”
“That is impossible; I have fallen in love.”
Oh, but old love affairs do not count.”
The carriage rolled through the Southern
dusk along a dreamful lane, and Kate chatted
gaily with the recklessness of youth that
dances lightly on whether cannons boom or
doves of peace coo softly. Soon they were
at Nannie’s gate and in a moment were whirled
away in the light and glow and laughter and
music.
“Tt seems to me that we are dancing on the
rim of a volcano,” said Garnett as he walked
with Nannie Wickham between dances.
