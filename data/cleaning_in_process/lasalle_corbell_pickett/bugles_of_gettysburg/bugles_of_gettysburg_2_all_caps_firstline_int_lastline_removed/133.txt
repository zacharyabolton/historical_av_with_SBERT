A horse came dashing by and the fallen man
caught his bridle.
“Like Kendall, I can be a hitching post,”
he said.
Garnett bore the flag onward.
Over the stone wall and up the hill they fol-
lowed the sword that flashed a silver path for
them till they stood upon the flaming crest.
The first line of defenders fell back and Gar-
nett waved his battle-flag over the gun beside
which stood the man whose sword-flash had
lit the way. In a seething heart of fire he saw
the leader fall.
Forced back by the rally of the men on the
height, the little remnant of survivors reeled
down the hill, Jasper and Garnett together, a
storm of bullets following them as they went.
Half-way down the slope Jasper fell back and
Garnett caught him in his arms. “Jasper,
are you hurt, old fellow?”
Jasper made no answer and Garnett carried
him on, a mortal faintness seizing him sud-
denly, but he heeded it not, for above the roar
of the guns, the cries of the wounded, the tramp
of men and horses he heard a soft voice saying:
“Take care of him for me, — take care of
him for me!”
