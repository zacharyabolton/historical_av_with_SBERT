THE RETURN TO BRIGHTVIEW
: RAISE de Lawd! We’s gittin’ to’a’ds
home, Marse Jasper. Yas, suh, we’s
jis’ sightin’ de ole Slocum place now. Praise
de Lawd! We’s mos’ dar at las’.”
Jasper Carrington lay half asleep on an army
cot in the old covered wagon in which his
faithful servant was taking his wounded mas-
ter home. The negro, waving a fan gently to
and fro over the white face, glanced at Jas-
pers cap under the driver’s seat. It had
served as a fan until a thoughtful woman at
the last stopping place had given them the
palm-leaf. The gray cloth was faded and
dusty, the gold cord tarnished and frayed.
He took it up and turned it over. In the
crown was a strip of white silk, discolored now,
on which was embroidered the owner’s name.
The old man could not read, but he knew the
meaning of the mysterious characters and that
they were the work of Kate’s dainty fingers.
