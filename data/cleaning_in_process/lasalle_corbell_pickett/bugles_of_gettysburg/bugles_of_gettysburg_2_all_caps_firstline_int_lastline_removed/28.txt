choose; but Virginia, the State that gave me
birth, and my father and grandfather before
me — she needs me, she calls me —”
He took a step forward as if he saw a vision.
His voice broke and sank almost to a whisper.
“She calls me —and—TI cannot choose —
but — go.”
He stepped back and steadied himself against
a chair.
“Forgive me, Captain.” He bowed. “I
beg your pardon.”
“Be seated, Lieutenant.”’
There was no change in the level tone, but
the Captain’s face was white.
“Be seated, please.” And after a moment,
“Have you anything further to say?”
“Only this, Captain Pickett. I should like
to add that, as it has been no small part of my
happiness in the Army to be under your com-
mand, so the leaving of that command is no
small part of my unhappiness in withdrawing
from the Army. I have been proud, very
proud, of my Captain. I am sorry, more
than sorry, to go.”
Again he bowed with military formality.
“And now I must not detain you longer. I
should not have come at such an hour.”
