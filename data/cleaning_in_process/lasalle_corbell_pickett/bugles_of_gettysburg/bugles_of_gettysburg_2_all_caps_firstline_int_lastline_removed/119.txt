men rode down the line in silent review, — the
last death review, — and every eye of the long
line was on the slender man who rode the black
charger and held his cap lifted above his head.
Thus they watched their leader till the shadows
hid him from view.
In the grass in front of the forest line they
lay through hours of beating sun. There were
no sleepers now. Each man was awake to
the heat that poured upon him as from a burn-
ing cauldron. Occasionally one moved rest-
lessly. Now and then there was a whisper to
a comrade.
“The Baby,” the youngest soldier in the
regiment, crept close to Garnett and held his
hand. His yellow curls were matted damply
over his head. In his eyes were depths of
unspoken sadness.
“T want you to do something for me, for,
somehow, I feel that I shall not live out this
day”
“Nonsense, boy, nonsense. You will live
to be gray-bearded, and some day you will
hold your grandchildren on your knee and tell
them of how we won a glorious victory and
saved our Southland.”
The boy shook his head sadly.
