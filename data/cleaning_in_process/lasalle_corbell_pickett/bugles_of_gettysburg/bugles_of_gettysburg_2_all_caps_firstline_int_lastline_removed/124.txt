Jasper’s head was uncovered and a light
wind blew his hair back as Garnett looked at
him leading his regiment, and across the dis-
tance heard a sweet voice say:
“Take care of him for me, — take care of
him in camp and on field!”
“‘T promise!” he had said with all the solem-
nity with which he would have made a vow to
his Creator.
His pledge to the woman he loved came
back to him with the touch of the south wind
and he renewed the promise in his heart to
guard with his own life the man who was dear
to her. What, after all, was his life in com-
parison with the happiness of her loving heart?
A stray shell from the opposite ridge struck
down a soldier at Garnett’s side. “The Baby”
moved quietly in and the line was unbroken.
The boy looked up and smiled as a child might
have looked at his protector. Garnett took
his hand and pressed it affectionately. It
seemed a mournful prophecy that death should
have placed them side by side as they were
about to march down the fatal slope.

rade and said:
“We are to charge that height?”
