“We are not so very far away and I asked
permission to run over. I was so hungry for
a sight of home folks.”
““How does it go, Garnett, dear? Is it very
terrible?”
“Yes. God only knows how terrible. But
I could not bear not to be among the others.
There has never been a war in our country
without a Phillips in it fighting for his flag.”
“The fight was never for a flag, but for an
idea,” said Colonel Marshall. ‘The old idea
still lives, sheltered under our new flag. A
sectional party elected a sectional President,
who declared war without the authority of
Congress and invaded the sovereign States,
whose only offense was that they asserted
their right and power to fight for their own
Union under the Constitution which their
forefathers had made.”’
“Tf you and my cousin will excuse me I’ll go
and change my habit while you discuss flags,
but remember there is but one flag for me, the
Stars and Bars, and but one idea, freedom.”
Catherine waved her hand to them and
passed out into the hall and up the stairway,
the gaze of the young man following her till
she disappeared.
