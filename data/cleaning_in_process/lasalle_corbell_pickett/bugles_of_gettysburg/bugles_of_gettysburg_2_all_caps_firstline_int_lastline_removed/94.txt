The man sitting at the table leaned back
and looked up at his companion.
“Do you know, Armistead,” he said, “I
am learning the true value of a war map.”
“Delighted to know that it has a value,
Pickett. I have always thought that the one
exception to the theory set forth by the poet,
‘Nothing walks with aimless feet,’ was the
man who attempted to follow a war map.”
“Just so. The real value of a war map is
in pointing out with definiteness one of the
many imaginable conformations of the coun-
try and setting it beyond the limits of the
possible, leaving us free range to choose among
the rest. I used to fancy that if an Earth-
Man should be turned loose on Jupiter instinct
would lead him somewhere. Since this war
began I have learned more about the limita-
tions of the race. Once on the Chickahominy
I sent for immediate re-enforcements. A de-
tachment of picked men started out under
the leadership of one of the most accomplished
officers in the service. They marched all
night and in the morning found themselves in
sight of the camp from which they had started.”
“What had become of you, Pickett, in the
meantime?”
