children in the bushes by the roadside. Only
members of the household of Magnolia Lawn
would be gathering berries on that stretch of
road, miles away from any other habitation.
His old heart gave a jump and with difficulty
he suppressed a cry. It was a chance —a
slim chance — but the only one, and he would
take it.
He ceased fanning and closely watched the
sleeper, who did not stir. As the wagon neared
the children Pete crept cautiously forward
and picked up the gray cap. Then he took
the large white handkerchief with which he
had been wiping away the drops that occa-
sionally broke out on the young man’s face,
threw it over his head and leaned across the
seat.
The children stood up, dumb, stolid, to
watch the wagon go by. They did not move
even when a man’s cap, hurled by a long arm
from the front of the cart, fell at the feet of
the largest boy. A few moments later Pete,
whose face was still masked, watching them
from the rear of the cart, saw them pick up
the cap, examine it with great excitement and
shrill little cries, and then set off with it at
full speed up the lane to Magnolia Lawn.
