to Washington and offer to withdraw the army
from Northern soil on condition that the South
should own herself and live her own life?
-What a magnificent, glorious life it would be
with their wide fertile lands, their beautiful
homes, the power to make their own laws
adapted to their own needs.
But what were laws and national interests
to Kate? Jasper was coming home. What
wider meaning than that had peace for her?
And Garnett, â€” yes, he would come, too.
In the first rush of joy she had not thought of
him. She would be glad to see him, though.
He was a dear fellow and had been good to
Jasper. That either would not come had never
dawned upon her thought. Lovers and cousins
and fathers and brothers had been left on the
field, and sweethearts and cousins and sisters
and daughters had walked black-robed in the
sun, and the darkness of their sorrow had
dimmed the light of day for her. That she
should suffer like loss had never come within
the range of her imaginings. The field-glass
of youth sees no cloud on the horizon of the
future even when the eyes of youth are forced
to recognize a present darkness.
