knowledge of the ways of peace, of something
better than ghost dances and the slaying of
enemies. Whatever might come to him in
after life, he should remember with joy that
he had brought some of the light of knowledge
into the lives of the children of the plains.
And the flag waved over it all! Always the
flag! Always its blue sky with the fixed stars
shining down and its red and white folds wav-
ing in the breeze! Always the flag, beckoning,
leading on to victory. Always the flag â€” the
flag!
