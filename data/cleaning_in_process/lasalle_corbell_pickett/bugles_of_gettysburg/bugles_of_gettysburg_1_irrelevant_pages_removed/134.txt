THE BUGLESS OF GETTYSBURG
He laid his comrade upon the ground and
poured down his throat a drink from his can-
teen.
“He is not dead. He will not die; cannot,
for he has love to live for and it will take him
safely back to her.”
As he sank upon the ground he heard the
sound of hobbling feet and the face of Eagle-
heart was thrust into his own.
“Fagleheart, old fellow, did you come to tell
me goodbye? I know you carried your rider
valiantly into the battle till he fell from your
back. He could not have gone on without
you, for he was too ill to ride any other. Oh,
I am proud of you, Eagleheart, and I am glad
I lent you to the brave General Garnett. I
wonder if he knows that his namesake sol-
dier follows him so soon.”
The pathetic brown eyes of Eagleheart looked
wistfully into his with insistent appeal. Then
Garnett saw that one of his feet was shot off and,
led by instinct, he had hobbled to his master.
“Fagleheart, I love you and will do what
you ask of me. Goodbye, old fellow.”
He drew the pistol from his belt and took
sure aim. A long, slow quiver, a deep-drawn
sigh, and Eagleheart was at rest.
