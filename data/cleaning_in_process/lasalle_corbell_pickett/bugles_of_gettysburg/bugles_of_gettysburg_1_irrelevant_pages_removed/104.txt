and Garnett stopped for a moment upon the
veranda and looked out into the moonlight
where the pines were black against the silvery
wall.
“Why do beautiful things seem sad?” asked
Kate as a south wind swept up from the river
and, lifting a branch of the rose-vine, brushed it
across her cheek.
“T suppose it is because we cannot take all
their beauty into eyes and heart at once.
There is a reason, though, why all this” —
stretching his arms out toward river and
wide white space — “‘is especially sad to me
to-night, because I must say goodbye — per-
haps for an even longer separation than
before.”
“Oh, I hope not, — surely not.”
“T go to-night to join Armistead’s Brigade.”
“Oh, I am so sorry! No, I don’t mean
that I am sorry, either —I’m glad. It is just
what I would have you do. And then — you
will see — Jasper.”
