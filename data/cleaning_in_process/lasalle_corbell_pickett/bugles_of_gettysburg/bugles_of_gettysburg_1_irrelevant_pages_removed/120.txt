THE BUGLES-OF GETTYSBURG
“Men in our way of life sometimes know;
there is something in their hearts that tells
them.”
_“Brace up, my boy; brace up. We all
have a feeling of that kind in the presence of
a great danger. We come up out of the con-
flict with hearts stronger because of the trial
and lives better for the victory.”
“T don’t know what it is, but I feel that my
heart will be stilled in this battle, and when
you march back to the Capital of our new
Nation won’t you find my mother and tell
her about me and give her this letter? Oh,
tell her how dearly I love her and that the
proudest thing in her boy’s life is in trying to
be worthy of her and in giving the life she gave
him to his country.”
“Tl take the letter, of course, boy, but sup-
pose I should still keep you company at the
end of the day?”
There was a long silence and then the man
who had been at Antietam turned over and
growled:
“By George, fellows, I say, this makes me
think of what Tom August said to Squire
Minturn.”
““What’s that?” asked the man next him.
