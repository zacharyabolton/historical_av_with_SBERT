THE BUGLES OF GETTYSBURG
“Remembering a friend is leaving for Can-
ada, I have just sent a message to him hasten-
ing his departure by a day or two. His love
for me and loyalty to our cause is unquestioned ;
you will be safe with him.”
“Go to Virginia by way of Canada?”
“It is a case in which the longest way around
is the shortest way home,” he laughed.
That evening George Pickett and Jasper
Carrington took the train for Canada, every
revolution of the wheels carrying them farther
and farther away from the home and friends
they were so eager to reach.
