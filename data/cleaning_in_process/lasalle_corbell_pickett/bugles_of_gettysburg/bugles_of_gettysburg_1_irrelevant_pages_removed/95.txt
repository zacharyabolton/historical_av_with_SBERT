LIGHTS OF BRIGHTVIEW
“TY had caught another detachment, which
had been ordered northward and had trav-
eled due south till it accidentally fell in with
me. Yet our men have hunted over this
region since the days of their infancy. Ah,
here is Colonel Carrington.”
Jasper saluted and handed a paper to the
General.
“Thank you, Colonel. You carried my
message promptly and have returned earlier
than I expected.”
““My return was hastened, General, by the
necessity of declining a pressing invitation
from our Northern friends to remain with
them for a time.”
“Northern hospitality is occasionally em-
barrassing to the busy Southerner in haste
to get on with his work. I commend your
strength of mind in resisting their fascina-
tions, Colonel.”
Jasper saluted and withdrew, returning to
his tent, where Pete had prepared a break-
fast that did honor to his title of Commissary-
General.
