THE BUGGES, Of GEDLYSSURG
chirography is due to the fact that I am seated
on a camp-chair, holding my paper on my knee
and writing with a pen the point of which has
acquired an upward curve from hard usage,
the whole scene being illuminated by a tallow
candle in frequent need of being snuffed.
“T am not likely soon again to strike such
favorable circumstances for collecting and
transcribing my thoughts, but you must not
allow that fact to curtail my supply of letters
from home. You don’t know how hungry a
fellow is for the sound of a sweet home voice
and the sight of a dear home face and the
touch of a tender home hand.
“T have had a letter from my mother, —
poor dear little mother. Torn by divided
affections and anxious about so many sorrow-
ful and perilous things, I think of her with
sadness that grows heavier each day. I wish
that you could go to her or that she might
come to you, but I suppose that is hardly
possible. So all you can do is to seize upon
every opportunity of writing a sweet and
comforting letter to her and one sometimes,
too, to your
“Cousin GaRNETT.”
