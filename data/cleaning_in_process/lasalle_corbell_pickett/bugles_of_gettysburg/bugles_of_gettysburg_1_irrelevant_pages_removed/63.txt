had not jogged far into Slumber-Land when
they were awakened by a vigorous clutch.
“They have come,” said the Kentuckian,
“and they outnumber us. No, let your pis-

don’t know which side the first shot may bring

The visitors followed him into an unfinished
room with unplastered walls and ceiling.
“Up among the joists.”
They swung themselves up and, peering down
between, waited. Soon afterward footsteps
entered the room they had left and came
toward their hiding-place. The door opened and
Pomp appeared upon the threshold carrying a
lighted candle, two officers following him. As
the sable guide stepped across the entrance he
stumbled and the candle fell from his hand.
“Ef dat can’le ain’ done gone en unlit it-
se’ f,” grumbled old Pomp from the darkness
that followed the accident. “ Jes’ wait, Mar-
sers, en I'll git a match.” .
The matches were hard to find and some
minutes elapsed before Pomp announced ex-
ultantly:
“Hyear dey is. Now we'll hab a light.”
