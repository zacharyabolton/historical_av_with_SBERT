THE (BUGLEES JOP SGETEYSBURG
“No, suh, Marse Jasper, you ain’t dreamin’;
bress yo’ heart. Now you knows whut de ole
man foun’.”
Out of the shadow she came into the
golden radiance that shone from the west.
Her face was white with tense emotion and
her dark eyes were aglow. The wondrous pic-
ture held him motionless and silent as the
realization of her presence dawned upon him.
She came into the sunset glory and knelt be-
side the cot. His arms were around her and
his lips in the wind-blown tangle of her hair.
Pete tiptoed out, a suspicious moisture in
his eyes.
‘Kate, my sweetheart, my love! How did you
know? Howdid you come here? Little girl, little
girl, don’t cry so. I’m all right — all right.”
The wonder of it all filled his heart again and
he said: — ““How did you know?”
“One of the boys brought me a cap with the
very strip of silk on which I had embroidered
your name, saying that it had been thrown
from a wagon that went down the lane, by a
negro with something white over his face. He
said that there was a dead soldier lying in the
wagon. I knew that Uncle Pete had brought
you home and we came at once.”
