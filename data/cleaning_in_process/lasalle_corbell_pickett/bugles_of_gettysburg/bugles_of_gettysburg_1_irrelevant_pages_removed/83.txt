“Well, cut it, then, and come to the point
and tell us about the road.”
“Well, suh, den you goes on twel you comes
ter a riber en den you fodes th’oo de riber
kaze dar ain’ no bridge dar.”
“How soon will that bring us to Bright-

“Well, I should say ef you goes dat ’way
*twould bring you dar in bout a hun’ed yeahs;
dat is, ef ’twan’t fer de water. Considerin’
de water I don’ know how long ’twould tek.
You mought hab ter go ’roun’ de yeth en come
up turrer way.”
“Confound you! What do you mean by
telling us all this rigmarole?”
“T wuz tellin’ you dat way, Marser, kaze I
wuz skeered you mought go dat way en git

“Perhaps you could tell us the way we can
go, and for heaven’s sake, don’t take us around
by Jupiter if you can help it, for we are in a
hurry.”
“Yas, suh, I’s in a hurry, too, en I don’

He ain’ no ’quaintance er we-alls, so I couldn’
