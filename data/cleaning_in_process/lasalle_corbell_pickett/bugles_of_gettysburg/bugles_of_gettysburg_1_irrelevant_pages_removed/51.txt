looked from the window and saw two men
who seemed absorbed in gardening. Raising
the window one of them called:
“Have you seen any men going through here
this morning?”
“No, sir,” said Jasper. ‘“‘We ain’t seed
nobody.” He spoke with a nasal twang and
fumbled clumsily with his hat.
The other workman looked on with an ex-
pression of curiosity as if but half compre-
hending what was said.
Returning to the library the officers took an
apologetic leave of Dr. Paxton. |
“That is all right, gentlemen,” said the
Doctor. ‘“‘These times require strict watch-
fulness. Good morning.”
When the unwelcome callers were gone Dr.
Paxton invited the volunteer gardeners to re-
turn to their breakfast, at the close of which
he said:
“T hope you will not think it inhospitable if
I suggest your going at once; it is sometimes
far more hospitable to speed the parting
guest.”
“We thank you, Doctor, with all our hearts
for this, the truest hospitality, but the ques-
tion is, how are we to get away?”
