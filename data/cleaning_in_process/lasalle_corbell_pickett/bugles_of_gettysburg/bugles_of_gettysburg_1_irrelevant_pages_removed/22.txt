THE BUGLES OF GETTYSBURG
shadowed and to which it led. A soft sweet
echo of those bugle-notes has swept over the
old battle-field and thrilled the hearts of one-
time foes who have become friends. It has
been the accompaniment of the grandest melody
ever sung, the harmony of friendship and love
into which the years have merged the mourn-
ful sounds of that field of darkness and blood.
The bugles have echoed in sweetest tones over
hands that are clasped across a sea of tears,
all the more warmly because of the distance
and the darkness over which they have met.
They played softly around the scene when
the sword of an unknown hero who fell on the
slope of Cemetery Ridge was returned upon
that field by Colonel Cowan of Cushing’s Bat-
tery, who had kept it through many years
vainly seeking some one with title to receive
that sacred weapon dropped from the brave
hand that bore it with honor unto death.
They rang out in thrilling music when the
sword of Armistead was returned to Pickett’s
men beside the scroll which marks the spot
where it fell from the hand that had borne it
through fire and blood to the remotest limit of
the high tide at Gettysburg, and which fell
nerveless when that tide receded.
