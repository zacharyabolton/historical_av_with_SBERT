woodsy odors clung around him with myriad
hands of enchantment. A bird awakened and
trilled out a greeting to the night. He passed
a narrow path that made a detour into the
woods and came back to the main road a short
distance ahead. A man who was following
him came to this point and plunged into the
side path. At the cross-road he awaited the
approach of Carrington, who was awakened
from his reverie by the whiz of a ball over his
head.
“When you have succeeded in emptying
your pistol at me you will please be so good as
to explain who you are and why you are mak-
ing so unskilful an effort to murder a man in
the dark. Take all the time you want and
don’t be frightened. I have no pistol, and
would not stain my sword with the blood of a
coward.”
The dark horseman had come near and the
misty light drifting across the pathway fell
on his face.
“Do you suppose that if I had taken seri-
ous aim I could not have put a bullet through
your head as easily as over your hat? I merely
wished to arrest your attention.”
