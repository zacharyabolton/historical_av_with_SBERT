FROM THE FRONT
As Kate finished the letter, she looked up
wistfully at her father and said:
“Oh, father, if I had only been a boy!”
“Thank the Lord that you are not a boy,
my daughter.”
“Do you love me better as I am, Papa,
dear?”
“If you were my son instead of my daugh-
ter, even loved as you are now, I should give
you up though it were to death.”
