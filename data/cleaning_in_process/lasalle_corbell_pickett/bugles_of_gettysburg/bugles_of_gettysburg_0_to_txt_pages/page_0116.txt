THE BUGLES OF GETTYSBURG
hovering mistily on the far horizon of their
fancy. Was there ever so ghostly a wood as
this that lay between their night’s bivouac
and the fighting line at Gettysburg? Only
the rustling of feet upon the grass broke the
stillness. Yet was the silence full of sound
— whispers of voices and the echoes of yester-
day’s guns thrilling on the air.
When they passed through the line of woods
fringing Seminary Ridge, morning yet waited
behind the hills. The men lay in the long
grass and the trees kept guard around them.
The weary soldiers held the attitudes into
which they had thrown themselves as if they
might have been stone figures cast aside by
an impatient sculptor. Some fell asleep.
Others waited grimly for the dawn, — the
strangest dawn that ever gloomed into their
lives.
Garnett, resting on his elbow, looked toward
the east where a ridge slightly overtopped the
ground on which he lay. What was between
his fancy could not show. How the day had
gone he did not know. No tidings had come
from the battle except the dull echoes of the
guns that had shivered the air on the road
from Chambersburg.
