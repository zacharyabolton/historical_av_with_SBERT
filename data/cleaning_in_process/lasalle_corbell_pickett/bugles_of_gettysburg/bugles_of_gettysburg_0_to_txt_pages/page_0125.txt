Fixing his gaze southward he said, “Then
this will be a sad day for Virginia,” and stretch-
ing out his arms he called out solemnly, — “
Goodbye, Virginia!’’ He thought of the little
cottage nestling away in the Blue Ridge in that
beloved old State which bounded the dreams of
his youth and the memories of his manhood.
“Goodbye!” surged through the heart of
Garnett, and a radiance of dark eyes and a
swaying of a slim young form draped in white,
with a crimson Jacqueminot at the throat,
was the vision that passed before his eyes as
he shut them to the smoke-wreathed valley
and the fiery height.
The gaze of Jasper was directed straight
forward to the forest of guns on the hill in
front. Garnett could see only the set pose
of the head with its stern unwavering lines.
Maybe that was why all things came to Jas-
per. Was the same farewell echoing sorrow-
fully in his heart? Or was he intent only upon
scaling that deadly wall beyond?
Garnett watched the graceful form on the
black charger as their leader took his place
at their head, his long dark hair floating back
in the wind.
