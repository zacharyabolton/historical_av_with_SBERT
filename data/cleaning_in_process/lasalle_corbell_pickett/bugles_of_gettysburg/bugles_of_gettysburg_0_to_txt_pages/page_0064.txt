THE BUGUES OF (GETTY SU NG
There followed a succession of unavailing
efforts to strike a light and Pomp’s disap-
pointed voice growled:
. ‘°Clar ter gracious! pear lak dese matches
ain’ got no eend ’tall ’cep’n de wrong eend.”
After another series of labored efforts he suc-
ceeded in lighting his candle and started toward
the door where the officers waited. The clat-
ter of galloping horses was heard coming nearer
and nearer and then the cry:
“Morgan’s Mens! Morgan’s Mens!”
““Morgan’s Mens is comin’!”’ shouted old
Sambo bursting into the room that was feebly
lit by Pomp’s struggling candle.
The two officers rushed out of the room,
joined their companions who had waited below,
and their horses were heard clattering away in
the distance. The Captain and Sam leaped
from the joists.
“Where are Morgan’s Men?”
“De Lawd He know, Marse Cap’n. He’s
mos’ in gen’ally de onlyes’ one whut does
know. Ober on t’udder side er Ole Kaintuck,
I s’pose. Dey wuz hyear yis’day, en any man
whut ’spec’s Morgan’s Men ter be terday whar
dey wuz yis’day don’ know needer de mens
ner needer de hosses.”’
