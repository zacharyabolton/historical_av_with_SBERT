A man who was lying near leaped suddenly
forward and fell, his blood spattering on Gar-
nett’s sleeve. The shriek of a shell hurtled
by and a little distance from him he saw the
earth torn up and heard the dying groans of
comrades. Even in the mighty uproar, look-
ing upon the fire and smoke of the most terrific
cannonading the world ever knew, Garnett
pitied those who had fallen at the threshold
of the battle, — who could never go down into
that sea of surging flame and wind-tossed smoke
and charge the fire-crested heights.
On a hill overlooking the valley was the
stately form of the Commander on his power-
ful gray horse. He turned to Pickett, mounted
by his side, and pointed to a clump of trees
flanked by a glittering array of artillery and
infantry on the ridge opposite.
“General, can you take that height?”
“TI can, sir, if it can be taken.”
While the roar of the cannon filled the val-
ley and fiery fuses were still darting through
the blackness, General Pickett came down
the line. The men sprang to their feet and
saluted as he, pointing to the flame-crowned
hill, explained what they were to do. Cheer
after cheer followed him.
