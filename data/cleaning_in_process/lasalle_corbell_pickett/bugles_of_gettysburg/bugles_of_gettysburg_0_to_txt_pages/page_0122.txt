CHAPTER XII
“THE BATTLE’S VAN”
The fittest place where man can die
Is where he dies for man.
A CANNON-SHOT shivered the awful
silence. While it echoed from the hills
another shot thundered out and a cloud of
smoke hung over the plain. Then came a
crash of artillery and between the two ridges
was a blazing sea over which a heavy curtain
of smoke waved and tossed tumultuously like a
wrack of storm-clouds in a raging wind. The
hills trembled with the roar of battle. It
was as if warring worlds had rushed together
in one stupendous conflict. Through a roll-
ing ocean of smoke and dust flaming arrows
darted across the field.
“Them pesky things allus ’pears to be aimin’
straight at a feller’s eyes,” grumbled one of
Armistead’s men, blinking as a burning shell
swept past him.
