THE BUGLES OF GETTYSBURG
wild note of triumph that filled the night. The
bones rattled out their victorious message as
if the joyful news had brought life again to
them and clothed them with sentient flesh and
given them a heart to thrill with triumph.
The clapping of hands resounded uproariously.
A chorus of voices rolled out in a jubilee and
the wave of melody widened out over a sea
that had no shore.
“Dey sho’ is got dar Ferginia blood het up,”
said Zeke with admiration. “’Pear lak w’edder
dey’s fiel’ hands er bodyguards dese niggers is
all got heart feelin’s fer we-all’s cause.”
Through the wild uproar of the plantation
surged the solemn, proud, triumphant yet
almost melancholy refrain of the bells, ‘The
South is free! The South is free!”
Thus the news came home. Far-off nations
learned the fateful decision of that great con-
flict before accurate tidings of it could perco-
late through the stone wall which war had
built around the South. Rumor was opti-
mistic, and the hope of a great victory swelled
under her cheerful ministrations. For a little
moment, the South felt the bliss of triumph.
Then darkness fell.
