PHE AMBER PATH
Some distance in advance was a horseman.
The General recognized the tall form, the strong,
erect shoulders, the soldierly bearing and the
superb horsemanship of Lee’s ‘‘Old War-
Horse,” whose corps was said by the Federals
to be the terror of their army. The younger
officer put his horse at speed and was soon
beside the tall, handsome Corps Commander.
“How are you, Pickett?” said the Lieutenant-
General, laying his hand on the shoulder of
his companion.
The two rode on together talking, not as
commanding and subordinate officer, but as
old friends who had met casually on the road
of life.
“You saw her last evening?”’ asked the older
man turning his steel-blue eyes upon his friend,
—eyes that were stern and piercing except
when the sunniness of his mood made them
twinkle with mirth. The sunniness was in
them now. “You gave her my message?”
“She sent her thanks and good wishes in
reply.”
“TI am obliged to her. But how do you
reconcile it with military tactics to follow
Mars and worship at the shrine of Venus both
at once!”
