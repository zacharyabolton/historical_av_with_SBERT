THE, BUGDES Of GPW! Yoo. DiwinG
a chorus of laughter after each stanza. A
half-grown boy ran into the circle and began a
clog-dance to the gay notes of the banjo and
. the clank of the bones, followed by another and
yet another, all joining in heartily with the
laughing chorus to which their twinkling feet
kept time.
“What children they are,” thought Kate, as
she joined in the laugh. “They weep over imag-
inary sorrows and laugh over fancied joys with-
out a thought of the realities of life. Ah, here
comes Uncle Zeke. Why are you not having
fun down at the cabins with the others? Dear
me, what has happened to please you so?”
“Happened! Miss Kate, why sumpn’s hap-
pened ter mek yo’ Ung Zeke want ter do mo’
dan dance. He wants ter shout lak he’d jes’
got ‘ligion fer de fus’ time.”
“What is it, Uncle Zeke? Do tell me.”
“Well, Miss Kate, Marse Carey’s jes’ come
fum Richmon’ en brung de news dat ’way up
dar at de Norf what Marse Gen’! Lee’s been a
foughtin’, dat we-all’s whopped dem Yankees
en dat we-all’s army’s marchin’ ter Wash’ton
en dat we-all ‘ill be dar termorrer er de naix’
day sho’. Oh, de Jubilee am a comin’, Miss
Kate, it am a comin’!”’
