It was dusk when he dismounted at the
steps and threw the reins to a young negro.
The front door stood hospitably wide in the

As he crossed the porch a little figure came

you have come! I was so afraid — they said
that you— but you are here, my love, you
are here.’’
She lay sobbing brokenly in his arms.
“Nothing matters — nothing matters — you
are here!”
