CHAPTER III
SAILORS’ REST
HEN the Uncle Sam weighed anchor ’
in New York harbor two of her pas-
sengers were standing a little apart from the
others, silent amid the commotion of arrival
but watching narrowly all that occurred and
listening with quiet attention to the conversa-
tion that went on around them, their anxiety
hidden by an air of casual interest. The dark
man they called Cassius stood near them.
When the pilot came on board, the Captain
of the ship, with the eagerness of one who has
had no word from shore for weeks, called out:
““What’s the news?”
“It’s a black squall here,’’ was the reply,
“and it veers north’ard and south’ard till a
man doesn’t know which way he’s sailing.”
“What’s the particular blow today?”
“Arrests for treason and all that. One man
just brought here in a boat in irons. Let’s
see — what’s his name? He’s a Com’dore —
Com’dore Barron, — yes, that’s it.”
