RETURN TO BRIGHTVIEW
“Well, you go in and keep him from getting
up and father and I will just come in slowly
and let him see us.”
The old man turned as he was about to open
the door and said:
“You better let yo’ pa stay outside, Honey,
en come in by yo’se’f firs’.”’
Uncle Pete entered the sitting-room.
“Did you find anything, Pete? Oh, I wish
I could get up.”
“Did I find anything? Well, you'll see in a
minute what I found, Marse Jasper. Jes’
wait en you'll see what I foun’.”
The old man chuckled as he spread over
Jasper, with an almost womanly touch, a lav-
ender-scented sheet from a chest saved by the
servants from the flames. Then he went
around to the other side of the cot and stood
before him, shutting out the view of the door.
“You don’ want no mo’ milk, does you,
Marse Jasper?”
“No; what’s that? I thought I heard a
footstep.”
The sick man started; Uncle Pete moved
away.
“Kate! Kate! My darling; — my darling,
am I dreaming?”
