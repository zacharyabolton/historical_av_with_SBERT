own I think my sword would of itself leap out
of its scabbard.”
His hand went to his side. The Lieutenant-
General was filled anew with wonderment that
so slight a hand could wield so heavy a sword,
but he had seen the flash of that blade in the
front of the battle like lightnings in a storm
and men rushing after its blaze to the gates of
death.
“To choose our ground and let the enemy
attack us is the way to win; as at Fredericks-
burg,” said General Longstreet. ‘“‘There was
a battle! I dream nights of the glory of that
day, and hear General Lee say, ‘It is well that
war is so terrible, else we should become too
fond of it.’”
“Tt must have a horrible fascination if it
could enchain him, when every man who is
killed is a personal loss and sorrow to him.
Dear old ‘Marse Bob’! What a heart he has!”
Thus Lee’s “Old War-Horse” and he who
was called the “Bayard of the Confederacy”
rode down the amber path of sunset.
