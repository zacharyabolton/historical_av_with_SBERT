“Forward!”
Pickett’s men started on their death-march.
They moved out from the forest calmly and
steadily as if drawn up for a grand review.
Two great armies watched them in admiring
awe. Over on Seminary Hill the man on the
gray horse looked on at the costly sacrifice
the South was making for its cause. On Cem-
etery Height the men in blue were silent,
watching the majestic scene.
The rhythmic motion of the thousands of
tramping feet had so taken possession of
Garnett’s imagination that he seemed to have
been for ages walking in that solemn proces-
sion. The resounding tramp, tramp, tramp
filled all the world.
Garnett’s gaze was fixed on the Commander
far away in front, leading his men into the
flames of battle with an air of chivalrous light-
ness and grace such as he might have worn had
he led them in picturesque procession to enliven
a festalday. He marveled over the daring that
could enable a man to maintain a poise like
that at the open door of death. He thought of
what he had heard a commanding officer say:
“Give George Pickett an order and he will
storm the gates of hell.”
