and following its promptings he went down
the line and joined General Garnett and rode
side by side with him to the rim of the slope.
There he paused and held out his hand.
“Goodbye, and good luck to you, old man,”
he said.
“A soldier’s luck,’’ returned General Gar-
nett with serene uplifted gaze, as if even then
he felt the outrushing tide of life-blood which
would on that day wash away the fiery letters
in which ‘“‘Kernstown”’ had been graven upon
his valiant heart.
The line reached open ground under a storm
of balls from Cemetery Ridge. The gaps the
guns had made in the ranks filled up and the
solid, living wall went forward as if the dead
that covered the ground like the fallen leaves
of autumn had added the impulse of their
own lives to the strength of their comrades.
A long blue line sprang suddenly up from the
grass which had hidden it from view, fired and
ran on, loading and turning to shoot again.
The battle-flag in front of Garnett fell. Before
it reached the ground he took it from the hand
of the ‘‘ Baby,” who looked a last farewell and
faintly whispered ‘‘Remember.” Again the
ranks closed up and went on unfalteringly.
