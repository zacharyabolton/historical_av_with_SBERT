THE Army of Northern Virginia was on the
road to Chambersburg. The march was
necessarily slow, for not even the Commander-
in-Chief had any information regarding the
Federal movements.
Colonel Carrington had sent for Garnett
and they were side by side.
“There is something I intended to tell you,”
Garnett said, “‘about that Campo fellow, who
manages to keep himself tangled up with us
in the most incomprehensible way. I did not
tell you of the first time. It was when I had
been mistaken for you and put into a prison-
house to wait for him to pass upon my identity.
The next time was that day in the skir-
mish as we crossed the line; he tried to stick
a sword into you. I thank God I was a shade
too quick for him and he disappeared just as
you downed that Yankee Captain.”
