As Garnett caught the flag one of his com-
rades sprang forward with the same design.
He looked around and saw the smoke-black-
ened face of the man who had bade farewell
to Virginia. Garnett passed the flag to him
and they went on together.
“Left oblique!”
Swiftly and steadily they obeyed while a
deafening roar filled the valley and a rain of
balls swept down from the cannon in front of
them. Again were the wide gaps filled as
were never such gaps of horror filled in the
long story of warfare.
“Front forward!”
Straight down upon the center now — on!
—on!—the glory of the battle sweeping
around them, enfolding them in a mantle of
flame, urging them forward with exultant
feet and hearts on fire.
“Forward! Quick march!”
Where the balls fell thickest and the fire
seemed to center in a condensed heart of flame
Garnett saw the horseman on whom his eyes
were fixed pause and look over the field. Like
a statue he sat while a leaden hail showered
around him. With his comrades Garnett
rushed by.
