“Jasper — Jasper?”
She looked up shyly.
“Yes; didn’t you know?”
He was silent for an instant, gazing out into
the blackness of the pines. Then he said gently:
“T—TI congratulate you, Cousin mine.”
“T knew you would. Now I want you to do
something for me.”
“Anything, to the extent of my power, Kate.”
“Jasper is so brave, so daring, so almost
reckless, — I want you to make friends with
him and guard him from the dangers that he
will not see — take care of him for me.”
Her uplifted face glowed with love and en-
treaty, but in his eyes was the light of self-
abnegation. He took her hand and lifted it
to his lips.
“Tf my life can purchase his it will be freely
given, for your sake.”
“Thank you. Both lives will come back
to make me happy.”
“Tf God wills,” he said solemnly.
She watched him ride down the lane, look-
ing after him until he was hidden in the forest,
the winding empty road lying black across the
moonlight.
