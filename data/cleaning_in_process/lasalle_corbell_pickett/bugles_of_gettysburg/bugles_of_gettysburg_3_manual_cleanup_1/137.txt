lilting down the years from the parted red lips
of a hazel-eyed girl with a forest of song-birds
in her throat.
Over toward the sunset the little band had
swept down the hill beyond his Ment and
hearing.
“YT have kept my faith, Catherine. I send
him back to you and to love,” sighed Gar-
nett, as old Pete’s notes, bugling for his
master, brought him back to consciousness.
He lay still for a time, his lashes sweeping
down upon his cheek, and then as his soul
took its flight her voice came to him on the
golden thread of an old song. A smile lit
up his face, he opened his eyes and whispered:
“TI knew you would come, sweetheart. I
feel the touch of your hand and your sweet
eyes are lighting the way for me. Goodbye,
— goodb-y-e, K-a-t-e.”
