HEN Kate returned home the next
morning she found her father in his
office, leaning back in his big armchair smok-
ing a fig-stemmed corn-cob pipe. A young
man whose face she could not see was talking
to him. Black Pomp was sitting on the floor
making other pipes of corn-cobs and fitting
them to long, fragrant fig-stems.
“Hallo, hallo! here comes my Katydid.
Where have you been, you little runaway?
Nobody on the plantation could tell me where
you were. Come, Lady-bird; account for your
early morning ride. But first, here is a sur-
prise for you.”
“How do you do, Cousin Kate?” said the
“surprise.” “I am so glad to see you. But
you did not expect me, did you?”
“Garnett! How lovely, lovely to see you
again! How and when did you come?”
