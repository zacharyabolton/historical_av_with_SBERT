to wreck our craft and whirlpools enough to
sink us to the depths.”
“T see you think we are adrift upon an
unknown sea.”
“Almost, Captain, though I do know one
harbor alongshore. It is kept by an old sea
captain who is laid up now but never gets far
away from the ocean. He must be where he
can hear it roll and see it toss up its waves to
the sun. He would be lonesome without that,
so he stays down here in a place called Sailors’
Rest, — he says because sailors have never
been known to rest there. He is out of poli-
tics, — has never been in. Says he found the
water treacherous enough for him.”
The silent man knew that his friend was
talking against time, talking against thought,
talking against feeling. He took his hand and
gently spoke his name. The two went on in
silence until they reached Sailors’ Rest, where
they were received by a bluff old seaman,
rollicking and jolly, with a walk like the roll-
ing of the waves.
“Jasper Carrington! Many’s the storm your
uncle, the Commodore, and I have weathered
together, and many’s the voyage we’ve taken
over waves that rocked as gently as a cradle.”
