cover the confusion of his mistake. ‘‘De

Marse Jasper “long home en I fotch him.
‘Here’s de money fer yo’ suspenses, Pete,’ he
say, ‘ca’y him easy, en git all de holp you
needs.’”
A glow of love and reverence lit Jasper’s
eyes as he said:
“That is our General’s loving spirit, always
around us to aid and bless. You can never
know what General Pickett has been to me;
—a strong arm to support, a steady hand to
guide, a wise head to counsel, a gentle heart
to sympathize in joy and sorrow. An inspira-
tion on march and field, he is a living force to
give his men the power to endure and achieve.
The hottest place in the battle is where he is
seen leading his Division, and there is not a
man of us who would not proudly follow him
to death.”
Kate pressed his hand, silent with the deep
feeling that surged through her heart. Then
she turned to the window.
“T must go now; the sun has set,”’ she said
softly. “But not for us; nor for the South.
For all of us a grand, a glorious, sunrise, and a
perfect day, Jasper, dear.”
