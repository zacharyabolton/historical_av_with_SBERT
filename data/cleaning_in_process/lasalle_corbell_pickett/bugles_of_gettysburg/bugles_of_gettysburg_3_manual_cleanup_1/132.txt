taking in every movement. The men rushed
by and Garnett thrilled with ardor as he saw
the motionless, erect figure under the falling
~shot and bursting shells.
On the other side of the line a man in blue
lifted his rifle and took careful aim at the form
standing out so boldly against the light. Then
he lowered his gun and turned back. Three
of his comrades were putting down their guns.
“We can’t kill a man as brave as that,” they
said.
Over on the right a gleam of bayonets and a
fire of musketry blazed into the faces of the
little band. It reeled and fell back, then ral-
lied and pressed on, and the two opposing
forces were intermingled, their muskets cross-
ing in fierce combat. Jasper, dismounted,
was in front of Garnett, resisting the onslaught
of a tall, dark man.
“The Raven!” thought Garnett.
He thrust his sword into the heart of Jas-
per’s assailant, who fell and was trampled
under many feet struggling toward the height.
The man who bore the flag fell and Garnett
would have stopped to aid him.
“Don’t mind me,” said the wounded man.
“Carry the flag to the front.”
