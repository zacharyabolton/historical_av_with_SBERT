The crash of Gary’s pistol broke the still-
ness and sent echoes reverberating among the
hills. Day was ushered in with the ominous
greeting which befitted its awful destiny.
Some of the men, aroused from their half
slumbers, looked in the direction from which
the sound came. A quiver as of a suddenly
awakened force ready for combat thrilled
through Garnett’s veins. The man who had
been at Antietam lay quiet. He was still
asleep.
A deeper silence fell over the ridge, —a
stillness that stretched out in awesome gloom
to the sky and reached down to earth.
After what seemed to Garnett a soundless
eternity the silence was broken by the tread
of horses coming down the line. In the shim-
mer of dawn he could see the faces of the
riders and the color of their horses as they rode
along.
Every man in the Army knew the powerful
gray that carried the Commander. He and
his rider were one, so closely were they iden-
tified with all the exploits of the Army of the
South. Garnett never saw that stately figure
mounted on “Traveler” without a glow of
pride.
