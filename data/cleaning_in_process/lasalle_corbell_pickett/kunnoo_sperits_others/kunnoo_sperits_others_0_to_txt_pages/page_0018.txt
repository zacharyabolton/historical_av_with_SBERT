Xll  PREFACE
sharp-eared  childhood,  sitting  in  the
deepening  gloom  of  twilight,  watching
the  sparks  from  the  flaming  logs  go  glit-
tering up  the  chimney,  wondering  what
message  from  the  glowing  heart  of  the
fire  they  carried  up  to  the  pale  stars,  we
listened  to  some  awesome  tradition  from
the  lips  of  an  old  white-haired  ' '  Uncle, ' '
a  relic  of  his  own  childhood  and  of  many
childhoods  previous  to  his.  Or  it  might
be  some  pathetic  story  of  his  own  exper-

nurse  came  for  the  little  ones,  and  earnest
admonitions  from  parents  or  guardians
would  warn  older  young  people  that
further  indulgence  would  not  be  granted.
We  have  read  many  a  popular  novel
since  then,  many  a  scientific  treatise
artistically  veiled  in  iridescent  romanti-
cism for  the  ensnaring  of  the  unwary,
many  a  sociological  dissertation  cun-
ningly done  into  fiction  to  render  it
