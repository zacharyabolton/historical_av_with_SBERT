A  NEW     ANECDOTE  OF  LINCOLN.
The  day  after  the  great  fire  following  the  fall  of  Rich-
mond  Lincoln,  with  a  small  body  guard,  walked  through
The  sheets  of  the  charred  city.     As  he  approach^ I  the
corner  occupied  hy  Gen.  Pickett's  residence,  he  direct,
the  guard  to  wait,  and  to  their  V***^™™
steps  at  a  time  up  to  the  door  and  rapped.     The  serv-
ants had  fled.     The  "Baby  Bride"  had  never  seen  Pres
dent  Lincoln,  but  she  had  read  his  letters  to  her  hus-
band  and  from  him  had  learned  to  hold  in  the  highe
esteem   the  great   northern   President     With   her   baby
in  her  arms  she  opened  the  door  and  looked  up  at  the
tall,  gaunt  man  with  the  sad  face  and  uncouth  ways.
Without  a  word  of  explanation  he  asked:
"Is  George  Pickett  about?"
To  hear  her  husband's  name  bereft  of  its  title  by  r
Yankee,  at  that  moment,  was  almost  the  limit    e;
cially  as  many  a  rumor  had   floated   about  Richmond
concerning  the  fate  which  awaited  the  leaders  of  the
Confederacy.
With  all  the  proud  dignity  she  could  command  the
Baby  Bride  replied:
"Gen.  Pickett  Is  not  at  home."
The  stranger  seemed  disappointed  and,  as  he  turned  to
go,  remarked:
"I  am  Abraham  Lincoln,  an  old  friend  of  George's."
"Not  President     Lincoln!"      Mrs.  Pickett  exclaimed.
The  tall  man  shook  his  head,  repeating:
"No.    Just    Abraham    Lincoln,    George    Pickett's    old
friend."
Following  the  instant  promptings  of  the  heart  whi<
still  governs  her,  "the  Baby  Bride"  thrust  her  baby  boy
into  the  arms  of  the  gaunt  Yankee,  as  her  best  effort  to
express  her  veneration  and  confidence,  saying:
"I  am"  George  Pickett's  wife  and  this  is  George  Pick-
ett's baby."-[Willard  French,  in  The  World  Today.
