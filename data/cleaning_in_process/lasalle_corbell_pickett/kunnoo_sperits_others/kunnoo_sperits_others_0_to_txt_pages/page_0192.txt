PICKETT  AND  HIS  MEN
BY
LASALLE  CORBELL  PICKETT
(Mrs.  Gen.  George  E.  Pickett)
IN   THE  THIRD   THOUSAND
One  of  the  most  fascinating  pieces  of  biographical  writing
that  has  recently  been  published  in  this  country.
— Review  of  Reviews.
She  writes  without  bitterness,  and  her  sympathy  with
the  Southern  cause  and  its  leaders  does  not  lead  her  into  one-
sided estimates  of  the  war  as  a  whole.—  The  Chicago  Record.
Has  its  peculiar  charms.— New  York  Times.
It  contributes  materially  to  our  knowledge  of  Pickett,  the
man,  and  strengthens  the  impression,  always  cherished  in  the
South,  that  his  magnificent   courage  was   united  with   a  heart
of  womanly  tenderness  and  a  character  in  every  way  lovable.
— New  Orleans  Picayune.
Told  with  a  fire  and  style  that  carries  the  reader  along
despite  himself,  and  makes  him  imagine  that  he  lived,  for  the
time  being,  among  the  famous  personages  and  the  great
events  that  are  recounted.  New  York  Tribune.
She  makes  no  timid  apologies  in  deference  to  changed
conditions,  but  at  the  same  time  she  writes  in  such  sweet
temper  that  her  work  throughout  breathes  the  violet  aroma
of  complete  reconciliation. — Atlanta  Constitution.
