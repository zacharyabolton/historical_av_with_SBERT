PREFACE  XV
legends  to  one  whom  they  do  not  know
well.
Herbert  H.  Smith,  author  of  "  Brazil
and  the  Amazons,"  ascribes  the  origin  of
many  of  their  stories  to  the  South  Ameri-
can Indians, â€” but  where  did  our  negro
come  in  contact  with  them  ?  The  Vis-
conde  de  Rio  Branco,  the  Brazilian  his-
torian, proved  a  relationship  between
them  and  the  ancient  Egyptians  and  Tupi
Indians.  The  animal  stories  and  legends
were  certainly,  however,  brought  from
Africa,  but  whether  they  originated  there
or  with  the  Anahs,  or  with  yet  older  na-
tions, is  unknown.  Whether  the  Indians
got  them  from  the  negroes  or  from  earlier
sources  is  also  unknown.  ' '  Br'er  Rabbit ' '
can  be  traced  back  to  the  stories  of  the
Buddha.  The  Buddhists  regarded  the
hare  always  with  the  greatest  possible
veneration,  and  Jataka  is  but  the  Tar
Baby  story  revived.
