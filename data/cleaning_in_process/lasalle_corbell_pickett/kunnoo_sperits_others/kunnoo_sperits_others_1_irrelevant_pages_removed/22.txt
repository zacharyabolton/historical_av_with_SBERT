xvi  PREFACE
The  negro  has  no  linguistic  laws.  He
imitates  as  best  he  can  what  he  hears.
He  does  not  originate,  but  his  imitations
are  often  so  grotesque,  and  so  far  from  the
actual  thing  which  he  is  attempting  to
imitate,  as  to  pass  among  unaccustomed
hearers  as  original  expressions  evolved
from  his  own  consciousness.  His  dialect
varies,  also,  with  climate  and  geograph-

One  of  the  most  remarkable  character-
istics of  the  old-time  Southern  blacks  was
a  gentleness  of  voice  which  seemed  to
have  persisted  through  all  the  generations
which  had  intervened  between  them  and
their  origin  in  a  languorous  oriental
