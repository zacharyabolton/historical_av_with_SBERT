scientific  world  thereafter  sees  that  mem-
ber in  its  newly  authorized  position,  and

The  primitive  African  mind  regards  an
effort  to  change  the  location  of  that  tradi-
tional foot  as  heretical  and  profane.  Thus
with  each  minor  incident  and  movement
in  the  entire  story.
The  philosophy  of  the  old-time  African
servitor  was  of  the  most  consoling  char-
acter. He  preached  the  gospel  of  con-
tentment, perhaps  as  divine  as  any  other
principle  of  the  moral  law,  comforting  in
this  manner  those  who  railed  against  their
limitations  :
"You  'bleeged  ter  be  satusfied  wid
w'at  you's  got.  Nobody  hain't  got  ebby-
t'ing  in  dis  worl'.  Now,  dar's  de  light-
nin'  bug,  he  hain't  got  no  stinger.  En
dar's  de  moskeeter,  he  hain't  got  no  lamp.
