"  And  near  him  the  she- wolf  stirred  the  brake,
And  the  copper-snake  breathed  iu  his  ear,
Till  he  starting  cried,  from  his  dream  awake,
'  Oh,  when  shall  I  see  the  dusky  Lake,
And  the  white  canoe  of  my  dear  ! '
He  saw  the  Lake,  and  a  meteor  bright
Quick  over  the  surface  play'd —
'  Welcome,"  he  said,  '  my  dear  one's  light,'
And  the  dim  shore  echoed  for  many  a  night
The  name  of  the  death-cold  maid.
1  Till  he  hollowed  a  boat  of  the  birchen  bark,
Which  carried  him  off  from  the  shore  ;
Far,  far  he  follow'd  the  meteor  spark  —
The  wind  was  high  and  the  clouds  were  dark,
And  the  boat  return'd  no  more.
But  oft  from  the  Indian  hunter's  camp
This  lover  and  maid  so  true
Are  seen  at  the  hour  of  midnight  damp
To  cross  the  Lake  by  a  fire-fly  lamp,
And  paddle  their  white  canoe."
