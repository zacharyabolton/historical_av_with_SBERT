WILL  those  of  my  readers  who  do
not  know  the  ways  and  hearts  of
my  colored  people  of  the  Old  South
kindly  read  first  this  explanation,  or
extenuation,  as  it  may  be,  of  my  old
black  mammy's  origin  of  her  race?
As  I  wrote  "In  de  Miz "  memory
took  me  back  across  the  years  to  the
time  when  life's  water  was  wine,
tinted  golden  with  the  sunlight  of
morning,  sparkling  with  the  jewels  of
youth  and  love.  It  made  me  a  child
