There  was  no  want  of  reverence  in
his  comparison  of  his  Heavenly  Father
with  his  earthly  Master,  and  the  rapt
co-partnership  which  he  conceived  to
exist  between  those  two  almost  equally
sacred  beings ;  but,  instead  thereof,  a
sublime  recognition  in  his  simple  heart
of  the  fellowship  of  God  and  man,  and
an  intuitive  conception  of  two-ness
as  one-ness,  of  the  incompleteness  of
man  apart  from  God â€” verifying  the
poet's  thought :
"  So  close  is  glory  to  our  dust ;
So  near  is  God  to  man."
