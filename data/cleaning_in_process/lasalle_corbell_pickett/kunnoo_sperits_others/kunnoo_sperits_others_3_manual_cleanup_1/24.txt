will  all  vanish  with  the  actors  in  the  old
plantation  drama.  There  will  yet  linger
only  the  silent  printed  form  to  convey  to
the  future  some  idea  of  the  olden  dialect,
when  the  western  gate  shall  have  swung,
open  for  the  last  of  those  to  whom  that
speech  was  a  loved  familiar  sound,  and
they  who  told  the  quaint  old  stories
and  they  who  listened  shall  all  alike
have  passed  into  the  glory  beyond  the
sunset.
