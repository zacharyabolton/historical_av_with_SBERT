life  when  it  hung  upon  the  vine,  until  it
crystalizes  into  liquid  jewels.
The  endless  succession  of  pictures  pre-
sented to  the  mind  widens  the  horizon
but  lowers  the  zenith  and  limits  the
nadir.  The  permanence  which  gave
majesty  to  the  tradition  is  superseded  by
the  evanescence  of  the  new  thought  which
shimmers  for  a  moment  upon  the  world
only  to  pass  away  when  a  new  idea  shall
have  been  evolved.
The  tradition  is  garbed  in  its  own
peculiar  form  of  speech.  The  idea  and
the  expression  linger  together  with  the
primitive  races  until  advancing  civiliza-
tion with  its  subtle  devices  of  writing,
printing  and  reading  has  invaded  the
realm  where  poetry  and  imagination  still
dwell  in  the  twilight  of  the  gods  and  has
destroyed,  first,  the  original  concept,  and
then  more  gradually  the  peculiar  idiom
in  which  that  concept  was  draped.
