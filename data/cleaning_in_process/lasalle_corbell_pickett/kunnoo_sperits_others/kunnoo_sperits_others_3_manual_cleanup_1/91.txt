They  made  her  a  grave  too  cold  and  damp
For  a  soul  so  warm  and  true  ;
And  she  's  gone  to  the  Lake  of  the  Dismal
Swamp,
Where  all  night  long  by  a  fire-fly  lamp
She  paddles  her  white  canoe.
And  her  fire-fly  lamp  I  soon  shall  see,
And  her  paddle  I  soon  shall  hear  ;
Long  and  loving  our  lives  shall  be,
And  I'll  hide  the  maid  in  a  cypress  tree
When  the  footsteps  of  death  draw  near.
Away  to  the  Dismal  Swamp  he  speeds â€”
His  path  was  rugged  and  sore,
Through  tangled  juniper,  beds  of  reeds,
Through  many  a  fen  where  the  serpent  feeds
And  man  never  trod  before.
And  when  on  the  earth  he  sunk  to  sleep,
If  slumber  his  eyelids  knew,
He  lay  where  the  deadly  vine  doth  weep
Its  venomous  tear  and  nightly  steep
The  flesh  with  blistering  dew.
