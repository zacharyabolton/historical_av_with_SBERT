"Come in, my little ones!" the mother called,
"What do you?" as she saw them thus enthralled.
The little spade was emptied with due care,
And then the boy with shining golden hair
And azure eyes aglow with purpose high.
With voice like bird-notes sweet thus made reply:
"We're digging to Manila, Mother, dear;
They say that it is straight down under here;
And Papa's there and waiting for his boys;
He says we are his only, teasing, precious joys.
To far Manila we are digging through;
Won't he be glad to see his noisy crew?"
