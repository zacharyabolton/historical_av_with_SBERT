Dear little hands ! At work the whole day long,
With hearts of love and faith so true and strong. â€”
The summer day sinks slowly to sweet rest,
The after-glow burns crimson in the west;
Night's veil falls o'er the dim horizon line.
And far above the first faint starlets shine ;
And still the tireless hands work ever on
Until the sun's last rosy gleam is gone.
With folded hands and hearts aflame with zeal
Upon the sward the faithful workers kneel:
"Oh, God, we leave our Papa dear to you,
Till to far-off Manila we dig through."
