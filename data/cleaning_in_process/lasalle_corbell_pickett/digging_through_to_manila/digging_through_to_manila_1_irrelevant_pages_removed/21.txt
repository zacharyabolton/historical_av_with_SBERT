Through coming years how many little hands
Will strive to reach the sun-scorched island sands ;
And sweet brown orbs and eyes of azure hue
Will look in vain to see the waters blue
That dash against Manila's arid shore,
And break away in sad and solemn roar.
The sun through parted leafage sifting down
Will light gold hair and curls of softest brown
Bent over spades that dig the long day through.
While tender hearts, so loving and so true.
Will rise above in rev'rent, trustful prayer
^ That God will guard Papa "till we get there."
