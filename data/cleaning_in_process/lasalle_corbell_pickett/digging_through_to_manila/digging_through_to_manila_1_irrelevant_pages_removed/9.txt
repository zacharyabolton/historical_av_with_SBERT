I
LOVINGLY DEDICATED
TO
MY OWN LITTLE BOYS, WHOSE TINY HANDS WERE
GUIDED BY LOVE IN THEIR EFFORT TO MAKE A
PATHWAY WHEREON THEIR FEET MIGHT FOLLOW
THEIR HEARTS TO THE FAR-AWAY ISLANDS OF THE
SEA, AND TO ALL THE OTHER LITTLE ARMY BOYS
WHO HAVE WATCHED WITH LONGING EYES FOR
THE RETURN OF THEIR FATHERS ACROSS THE WATERS
OF THE WEST. Â»^,
