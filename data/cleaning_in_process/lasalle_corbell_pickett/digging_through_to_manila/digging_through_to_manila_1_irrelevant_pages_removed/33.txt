From shores of Dawn to far Pacific sands
With tiny spades how many faithful hands
Are digging all the livelong summer day,
In hope to find dear Papa far away,
While on that slope where soldiers lie at rest
With still hands folded over quiet breast.
Beneath the dark and solemn willow shades
Are digging stronger hands with larger spades;
And slowly o'er the ocean's seething foam
The silent soldiers with still hearts come home.
In Heaven waits sweet answer to that prayer: â€”
"God keep our Papa dear till we get there."
