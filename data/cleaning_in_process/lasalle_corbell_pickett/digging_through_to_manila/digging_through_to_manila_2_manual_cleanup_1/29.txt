As slowly rides he through the jungle dim,
His heart afar beyond the island's rim,
The horse's feet enmeshed in tangled grass,
That winds about them subtly as they pass,
Across the turgid air a bullet screams
And wakes the horseman from his sun-bright dreams ;
Against his cheek he feels its burning breath.
His heart beats quickly at the sound of death.
The flash gleams lurid on the dusky day.
And still unscathed he rides along his way.
The Father up above has heard that prayer: â€”
"God keep our dear Papa till we get there !"
