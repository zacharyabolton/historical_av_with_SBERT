And ever linger mem'ries of that day
When to Manila the Sumner sailed away;
Loved ones on deck, close clasped in sad embrace,
In grimy dock eyes vainly seeking each dear face ;
The jarring of the harsh, discordant bell
That rang the signal for the last farewell;
The whistle's scream, the rattling of the chain.
The shudder of the ship in mortal pain.
As if it knew the world of hopes and fears
It bore away 'mid rain of falling tears,
And felt the mighty pathos of that prayer :
"God keep our loved ones in His gentle care !'*
