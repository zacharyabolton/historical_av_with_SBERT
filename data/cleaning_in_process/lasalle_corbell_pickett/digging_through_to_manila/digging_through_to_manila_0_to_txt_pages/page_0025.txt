Far-off in tropic jungle black and dense,
With earnest face lit up by dark eyes tense
With ardent courage, hope and love and faith,
A man rides slowly through those shades of death.
His guards surround them, but he heeds them not.
His lonely heart is far from that dread spot;
Beyond the darkness of that gloomy place
He sees the light in each dear childish face;
The noisy trampling of the horses' feet
Is lost in faintest dream of music sweet ;
Perchance he feels the echo of that prayer:â€”
**God keep our dear Papa till we get there."
