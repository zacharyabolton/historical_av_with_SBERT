Digging Through to Manila
^WO little boys with shovel and with spade
Toiled eagerly beneath the maple's shade ;
Between the leaves the bright sun glinted down;
It tinged with light the clustering curls of brown,
And warmed to vivid glow the golden hair
That crowned one head with wealth of beauty rare.
Bright eyes of blue, like summer skies above.
Bent downward in their earnest quest of love; —
Sweet eyes of brown, with laughing gleams of light.
Aglow with life's fair springtime, warm and bright : —
Blue eyes, — brown eyes, — I wonder what you see
As swift hands toil beneath the maple tree.
