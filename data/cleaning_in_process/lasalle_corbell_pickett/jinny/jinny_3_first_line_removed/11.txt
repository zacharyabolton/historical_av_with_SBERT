To the brave soldier, an officer in Pickett's Division,
whose sword never swerved from duty, the dear
kinsman whose life has made light in my own,
the loyal friend of many years of sunshine and
of cloud, the true heart that spends itself for
the uplifting of humanity, the noble mind that
keeps the purity of the springtime with the wisdom
of autumn,
COL. J. J. PHILLIPS,
This volume is dedicated.
