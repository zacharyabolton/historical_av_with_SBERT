My way led through an opening in
the woods that looked as if the trees
had drawn graciously aside to leave a
glade for the fairies to dance in on
Midsummer night. As they stood in
dignified poise looking down into the
little glen the sun crept between their
branches and lay in golden glints upon
the green sward. I felt as if no foot
but mine and the fairies' had ever
touched the soft grass.
