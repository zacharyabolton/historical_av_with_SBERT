*The Governor of Virginia after his visit to him in
prison said: "They themselves are mistaken who take
him to be a madman. He is a bundle of the best nerves
I ever saw, cut and thrust and bleeding and in bonds.
He is a man of clear head, of courage, fortitude, simple
ingenuousness. The gamest man I ever saw.
