We said good-bye and drove off, calling
and taking in the little children who had
gone on ahead. Their chattering voices,
describing the cones and flowers they

last notes of the quavering old voice as
it twanged through the trees:
"All abo'de de ship er Zion,

Halle-lu-yer!
Come, dar'z room fer young en hoary,
W'ite en brack bofe ef dey's sorry,-
Halle-lu-yer!"
