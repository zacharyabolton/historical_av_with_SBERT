I'd been mos' skeered ter def.

jes' open his mouf wide en laff en laff,
den he pucker hit up tight ober his
big teefs lak dis, en tu'n off en went
'long in de house, w'istlin' de chune
'bout de

But watch dem bees wid stingers in dar feet.'
"I knowed he mean me en Jinny,
en I knowed I'd a 'graced myse'f ef he
had a axed me nuttin', er ef he'd eben

kneed all day long atter dat w'istle
