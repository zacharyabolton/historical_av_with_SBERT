To the brave soldier, an officer in Pickett's Division,
whose sword never swerved from duty, the dear
kinsman whose life has made light in my own,
the loyal friend of many years of sunshine and
of cloud, the true heart that spends itself for
the uplifting of humanity, the noble mind that
keeps the purity of the springtime with the wisdom
of autumn,
COL. J. J. PHILLIPS,
This volume is dedicated.
My way led through an opening in
the woods that looked as if the trees
had drawn graciously aside to leave a
glade for the fairies to dance in on
Midsummer night. As they stood in
dignified poise looking down into the
little glen the sun crept between their
branches and lay in golden glints upon
the green sward. I felt as if no foot
but mine and the fairies' had ever
touched the soft grass.
At a little distance the river rippled
melodiously to the sea. Its plaintive
cadence floated to me faintly mingled with the music of the windblown leaves. Through a parting
in the woods I saw the gliding
waves sun-crowned by the glow of
the perfect June day. I seemed to
look into a sunlit silver world stretching endlessly beyond the rim of earth.
own.
Nature and I were alone and at one.
The heart of summer beat against my
The invisible, intangible life of
the forest made a dreamful chiming of
fairy bells around me. A wood-flower
nestled against a cushion of moss at
the foot of a great oak, its pale pink
petals half hidden in the velvety
green. I passed on through the dell
with soft and reverent tread as one

who crosses the inner court of a sacred
temple.
Beyond the glade a serpentine walk
threaded an amphitheatre of cedars
and wound up a green slope on which
stood a little church. In front of the
church an old negro was industriously
pulling a rope made of grapevines,
keeping time with his swaying body
and bald uncovered head to the strange
sweet melody which his bony, brawny,
tugging hands were making to chime.
from the big church bell.
This bell, however, was not suspended from the church, but from an
old oak tree a few yards away,
for the steeples of Virginia churches
were designed not for utility but
for ornament. Tradition says the
steeple of this particular church,
which bore the King's coat-of-arms,
was, on the day of the Declaration
of Independence, rent lengthwise
by lightning and the insignia of royalty hurled to the earth.
The church was a quaint old structure, a preserved relic of ages gone by,
with its youth's companion, the ever-
faithful ivy, climbing and twining in
more and more luxurious love around
its "ruins gray" as it and the years
had grown.
A beautiful spring gushed from the
rocks a few feet from the stone steps
which led up to the vestibule, and
flowed in a large, clear crystal stream
underneath the church.
Odoriferous plants and blooms regaled the open air with their fragrance.
The clacking of a distant mill was
heard, and from a large weeping-
willow tree, whose trunk was encircled
by flowers of a purple hue, a mockingbird warbled sweetly the sounds of the
echoing wedding bells.
Among the butter-cups and glistening leaves of the Virginia creeper a
snake had thrown her enameled skin.
A copse of trees-oak, cedar, magnolia, aspen and one "juniper-bee-
gum" blessed and protected the
church and grounds from the summer's sun.
The drone of bees came from a
crotch in the juniper, which crotch for
time past had been the fatherland of
the bees of all the surrounding country, for from it every season the old
father and king-bee drove swarm
after swarm of his progeny out into
the world to make new honey and new
homes for themselves. And from this
ancestral home, by the way, must have
come that brown, glistening, knotty,
crawling cluster which I had just seen
settling, guiltless of any intended disrespect, upon the surmounting of the
King's coat-of-arms among the growing leaves on the ledge of an ancient
monument as I had passed along on
my way to the church.
The monument in question was of
black marble and was six feet long and
three feet wide. I stopped to read the
epitaph I saw engraved thereon, but
finding the tombstone was thus occupied I hesitated. The bees, however,
seemed intuitively to understand that
I not only meant them no harm, but
was taking every care not to disturb
"Maybe his objection to churches
was that he did not want to live the
kind of life of which churches approve. There is a commandment
against murder, and your Captain
killed people."
"What do you suppose made the
Captain first think about freeing the
slaves? It was no more his business
than it was any other man's affair."
"And he lived up there?"
"Wasn't that a dangerous place for
him?"
"Do you think the Captain was
right?"
*"If a free person advise or conspire with a slave to
rebel or make insurrection, or with any person to induce
a slave to rebel or make insurrection, he shall be punished with death, whether such rebellion or insurrection
be made or not."
*The laws of the State authorized immediate execution of the death sentence in cases of insurrection or rebellion. By the law, John Brown could have been tried,
convicted and executed all on the same day. He was
charged with conspiracy with slaves for the purpose of
insurrection, treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder in the first degree. His counsel, Mr. George
Henry Hoyt, of Massachusetts, plead for him, and John
Brown declared he was too ill to go to court.
*The Governor of Virginia after his visit to him in
prison said: "They themselves are mistaken who take
him to be a madman. He is a bundle of the best nerves
I ever saw, cut and thrust and bleeding and in bonds.
He is a man of clear head, of courage, fortitude, simple
ingenuousness. The gamest man I ever sawing cherry tree, rocking herself to
and fro in a green-painted flag chair,
was an old white-haired negress,-
Granny Elizabeth. She was holding
on her lap a little colored baby. In
her left hand she had a freshly broken
branch of aspen leaves which she
waved back and forth over the little
black body, dressed all in immaculate
white, keeping time with the fluttering leaves to the "Old Ship of Zion "
as she brushed away the swarming
flies.
A yellow fice dog, taking advantage
of the churner's absence and of our
company, was sneakingly licking from
the sides of the churn the cream
which had been splashed out by the
too energetic churning. Another
broken branch of the quivering aspen
tree was lying on the ground with its
green and silver leaves fringed with
cream, bearing self-evident proof of
having been used to shoo away the
epicurean flies while the dasher was
cheerily moved up and down, making
music to the churner's threatening
and anon pleading song of "Come,
butter, come."
"Good morning, granny. How
are you all? I hope your little baby
is not sick," said my husband with his
irresistible cordiality, handing me the
reins and bounding gracefully out of
the wagon and over the stile and
holding out his princely hand.
"I am very sorry, Granny Elizabeth, for your grief, tempered though
it is with freedom," said my husband
in kindly sympathy, again extending
his hand. I, in my anxiety for my
own little ones, gave expression only
to fear and caution, drawing back into
the wagon instead of getting out, asking with almost indecent haste what
the matter was with the baby.
"Ah-m," groaned Granny Elizabeth in reply, mournfully waving her
blue-checked turbaned head to and fro,
The tragical impress of the calamitous enormity of the disease attuning
her voice, she continued :
"Deed en 'deed, Marse Jawge,"
she said, interrupting herself and
changing her tone and manner as she
suddenly recollected the duties and
hospitalities of her home,
Calling vigorously, but in vain, for
'Mandy's assistance, the old woman
seemingly forgot all her sorrows in the
dispensing of hospitalities.
Meantime my husband had let down
to the bottom of the well by the well-
pole, hand over hand, the old oaken
bucket, which was securely tied to the
end of the pole with a grapevine, and,
drawing it up dripping full, had set it
on the well-curb while he washed out
the long-necked country-grown gourd
to give us a cool drink?
"Where is little Sammy's mother?"
I asked when the thirsty children had
drunk and been induced, though reluctantly, to go ahead with their
mammy; lured, after no little effort on
the part of both of us, to go and hunt
the temptingly-described blue-bells
and crimson and white velvet oak-
balls; for the dead baby, the fice dog
and the hidden Mandy all had a mysterious fascination for these little ones
-impressionable as they were.
"Where is Uncle Ege, Granny? I
hope he is still living," said my husband as Granny Elizabeth paused.
Knitting her wrinkled brow till it.
looked like an empty water-bag, and
snapping her lips together so suddenly
that her nose and chin came into collision and slipped past each other in the
intensity of her emotions, she answered:
"here
is some money to help pay for the little
one's coffin when it comes. We must
move on now, Granny, so good-bye.
""
"Tanky, t'anky, Marse Jawge;
t'anky, honey," she said, getting up
and making a courtesy with the little
dead baby in her arms.
We said good-bye and drove off, calling
and taking in the little children who had
gone on ahead. Their chattering voices,
describing the cones and flowers they
had not had time to gather, drowned the
last notes of the quavering old voice as
it twanged through the trees:
YOUTH has always its famed historian, teller of unswerving truth, to
whose judicial mind all disputed
points of history are submitted for
decision.
Uncle Washington Skutchins was
the encyclopædia of our childhood.
His many occupations, of barber, assistant undertaker, measurer of ditches,
wells and cordwood, had brought him
into close contact with people of information, and his absorbent mind
gleaned from each new field.
"Wax
to receive yet marble to retain," it
never lost a fact or a principle that
had once been impressed upon it. So
accurate were eye, memory and speech
that his measurements were admitted
as undisputed evidence in court and
his statements in regard to past events
were of academic authority.
To us who had just entered on the
pathway of knowledge he was the
court of last resort on historic subjects.
Not even Peter Parley commanded
our confidence when he failed to coincide with Uncle Washington Skutch-
ins. As for ordinary historians popularly accepted by schools and libraries,
they could not stand a moment against
Uncle Washington's disapproval.
"Uncle Washington, hear what my
book says."
He would listen attentively, and
after a pause of solemn significance
would say:
"Now, listen to this."
After close attention to the story
he would shake his head with decision.
Then the whole passage would be
crossed out and the story according to
Uncle Washington inserted in a footnote, and we would feel sure that the
eternal verities of history were ours.
We had no faith in any historical records that did not bear upon their title-
page that seal of authenticity-"Revised by Uncle Washington Skutch-
ins."
We used to ask him about the great
men whom he had known, and to us
they became veritable living figures in
the panorama of our existence.
in which Patrick Henry
made his celebrated speech in the Parsons case.
Uncle Washington carefully distinguished between linguistic suppleness
and mere learning, holding that, while
they might be associated in the same
mind, they were by no means necessarily to be found in conjunction. As
an illustration of the utter helplessness
of scholastic ability and legal acumen
*"If they have that, and I had not given them one
shilling they would be rich. And if they have not that,
and I had given them the whole world, they would be
poor."
when competing with simple "tongue-
suppleness" he was wont to relate the
manner in which "Dick," a groom of
his acquaintance, got the better of his
master, no less a personage than Chief
Justice Marshall.
The home of the Chief Justice in
Richmond was opposite that of Colonel Pickett, the grandfather of General George E. Pickett. The Colonel
was a man of great wealth and distinguished as a wit. He and his judicial
neighbor were opposite in many ways,
especially in the matter of physique.
The gaunt form and meagre face of
the Chief Justice seemed to indicate
that, in addition to having descended
through a line of thin ancestry, he had
lived a life of toil and of abstemious
habits. The Colonel, on the other
hand, showed in his portly form and
genial face the effects of generous
living and years spent in scholarly
leisure.
The same difference was apparent
in every part of their establishments,
even including the carriage horses; the
lean animals which drew the coach of
the Chief Justice showing a painful
contrast to the sleek, well rounded,
handsome steeds of the Colonel. So
noticeable was this dissimilarity that
it led to unpleasant suspicions that
Dick was neglecting the Judge's
horses, perhaps even converting the
supplies provided for them into liquid
refreshments for himself.
The attention of the Judge having
been called to the subject, he sent for
Dick to report to him at once, with the
intention of solving the new problem
which defied Constitutional principles
and Court precedents.
"Good morning, Dick," returned
the Judge sharply, with an air of suspicion and disapproval most unusual
to him.
Perceiving to his astonishment that
the moral atmosphere was thus perturbed, Dick chose to refer the unpleasant condition to some other cause
than dissatisfaction with himself.
"Dick," interrupted the Judge
rather impatiently, "what is the reason that Colonel Pickett's horses are
so fat and sleek while mine look almost like skeletons. Dick, my horses
are neglected. They are evidently
not being properly cared for. I don't
believe they are half fed or half
curried."
This attack from the Judge was so
unexpected that Dick was fairly posed.
He hemmed and hawed for awhile till
he had gathered up his negro wits,
or, as Uncle Washington Skutchins
would have said, had found his supple
tongue.
"That's so, Dick, that's so; I never
thought of that," said the Judge reflectively. "That's so. ""
"No," said the Judge, "decidedly
not."
"No, Mrs. Marshall is most certainly not fat.”
"No, Dick, you are about as lean
as a beanpole.
"Yes, Dick; yes.
Your evidence is
conclusive. It is quite apparent that
my judgment in the premises was
erroneous."
* From which the word "skedaddle" is supposed to
have been derived.
