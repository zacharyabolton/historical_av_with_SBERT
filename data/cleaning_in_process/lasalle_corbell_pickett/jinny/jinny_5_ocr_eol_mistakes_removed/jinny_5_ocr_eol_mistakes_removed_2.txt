To the brave soldier, an officer in Pickett's Division,
whose sword never swerved from duty, the dear
kinsman whose life has made light in my own,
the loyal friend of many years of sunshine and
of cloud, the true heart that spends itself for
the uplifting of humanity, the noble mind that
keeps the purity of the springtime with the wisdom
of autumn,
COL. J. J. PHILLIPS,
This volume is dedicated.
My way led through an opening in
the woods that looked as if the trees
had drawn graciously aside to leave a
glade for the fairies to dance in on
Midsummer night. As they stood in
dignified poise looking down into the
little glen the sun crept between their
branches and lay in golden glints upon
the green sward. I felt as if no foot
but mine and the fairies' had ever
touched the soft grass.
At a little distance the river rippled
melodiously to the sea. Its plaintive
cadence floated to me faintly mingled with the music of the windblown leaves. Through a parting
in the woods I saw the gliding
waves sun-crowned by the glow of
the perfect June day. I seemed to
look into a sunlit silver world stretching endlessly beyond the rim of earth.
own.
Nature and I were alone and at one.
The heart of summer beat against my
The invisible, intangible life of
the forest made a dreamful chiming of
fairy bells around me. A wood-flower
nestled against a cushion of moss at
the foot of a great oak, its pale pink
petals half hidden in the velvety
green. I passed on through the dell
with soft and reverent tread as one

by the glow of the perfect June day."
who crosses the inner court of a sacred
temple.
Beyond the glade a serpentine walk
threaded an amphitheatre of cedars
and wound up a green slope on which
stood a little church. In front of the
church an old negro was industriously
pulling a rope made of grapevines,
keeping time with his swaying body
and bald uncovered head to the strange
sweet melody which his bony, brawny,
tugging hands were making to chime.
from the big church bell.
This bell, however, was not suspended from the church, but from an
old oak tree a few yards away,
for the steeples of Virginia churches
were designed not for utility but
for ornament. Tradition says the
steeple of this particular church,
which bore the King's coat-of-arms,
was, on the day of the Declaration
of Independence, rent lengthwise
by lightning and the insignia of royalty hurled to the earth.
The church was a quaint old structure, a preserved relic of ages gone by,
with its youth's companion, the ever-
faithful ivy, climbing and twining in
more and more luxurious love around
its "ruins gray" as it and the years
had grown.
A beautiful spring gushed from the
rocks a few feet from the stone steps
which led up to the vestibule, and
flowed in a large, clear crystal stream
underneath the church.
Odoriferous plants and blooms regaled the open air with their fragrance.
The clacking of a distant mill was
heard, and from a large weeping-
willow tree, whose trunk was encircled
by flowers of a purple hue, a mockingbird warbled sweetly the sounds of the
echoing wedding bells.
Among the butter-cups and glistening leaves of the Virginia creeper a
snake had thrown her enameled skin.
A copse of trees-oak, cedar, magnolia, aspen and one "juniper-bee-
gum" blessed and protected the
church and grounds from the summer's sun.
The drone of bees came from a
crotch in the juniper, which crotch for
time past had been the fatherland of
the bees of all the surrounding country, for from it every season the old
father and king-bee drove swarm
after swarm of his progeny out into
the world to make new honey and new
homes for themselves. And from this
ancestral home, by the way, must have
come that brown, glistening, knotty,
crawling cluster which I had just seen
settling, guiltless of any intended disrespect, upon the surmounting of the
King's coat-of-arms among the growing leaves on the ledge of an ancient
monument as I had passed along on
my way to the church.
The monument in question was of
black marble and was six feet long and
three feet wide. I stopped to read the
epitaph I saw engraved thereon, but
finding the tombstone was thus occupied I hesitated. The bees, however,
seemed intuitively to understand that
I not only meant them no harm, but
was taking every care not to disturb

"Well, one day 'bout a week er so
atter dat, I recken, Miss Lou Emma

"Lige, yer's a pyar old pants dat I

"Yas'm,' I says, 'I wants 'em, en

she say:
"By de way, 'Lige,' says she, 'wat

Well, mun! I wuz dat shame-
face I jes' didn' know w'at ter answer

bref I hilt up my haid sideways lak
dis, en I say:
"Yas'm, yas'm, we wuz jes' a talk-

"Miss Lou Emma spuck ter me
moughty nice, dough, so ez ter mek

"Miss Lou Emma, she suttinly
knowed how ter manage t'ings, dough.
She seed Marse Jasper 'bout hit all, en

she wuz a foolin' she mus' say so.
But Jinny say, 'No'm, 'deed'm, she

say I's real ole en tricky, anyhow, but
dat I better not try none er my tricks

han's un'neaf his brown tweed coattails en sot his foots fur apart. En no
matter how raggetty en patched de
Cap'n wuz, he wuz allers neat en
clean."
"Maybe his objection to churches
was that he did not want to live the
kind of life of which churches approve. There is a commandment
against murder, and your Captain
killed people."
"Twa'n't de Cap'n's plan ter kill
nobody ef he could he'p hit. His plan
wuz ter dribe de cullud folks inter
freedom. He say de Lawd meked
dem ve'y limestone mountains en
dem caves jes' ter he'p de po' slabe

who wuz jes' ez soun' on de goose

"I suppose the Captain had plenty of
money to carry through his schemes."
"Co'se he wuz 'bleeged ter hab

dey would all keep good-nachured en
lib in lub wid one anudder dey
wouldn' know w'edder de house wuz

"What do you suppose made the
Captain first think about freeing the
slaves? It was no more his business
than it was any other man's affair."
"Well, I yeared dat he gun ter t'ink
'bout hit w'en he wa'n't mo' dan

Mr. Garret Smif, a moughty rich gem-

back en axt Mr. Smif ter gib him a

could show de cullud folks how ter
cl'ar up de new groun' en ter wuk de
craps en all.
"Atter aw'ile de Cap'n start out ez
a missionary sellin' Beecher's Bibles
[Sharp's rifles]. Den atter aw'ile
ag'in he got 'im a ole ricketty hoss en '
wagon en a chain en a compass, en he
en two er his sons tuck out fer Pottawatomie creek. Dey runned a line
by all de farms in de neighborhood en
meked out lak dey wuz gre't Soufern

"He seems to have been a very versatile man. ""
"Nar, suh; I nebber yeard er his
writin' no verses, but he could do mos'
ebbyt'ing else. Anudder time he tuck

comp'ny en went fum house ter house
en called out de owners en say, 'We's
come fer yo' slabes en fer dar prop'ty!'
De Cap'n mos' allers got w'at he come
fer, too.
"En anudder time de Cap'n en his
sons all went mine-huntin' up dar in
Washin'ton County, Marylan'. Dis
time dey called darse'fs Smif. One
day w'en he wuz dribin' long thoo

wid trees on bofe sides de rocky cut,

he met up wid a farmer, en de Cap'n
tole him dat dey had some money dat
dey wanted ter buy lan' wid. De farmer
axt him ter come 'long home wid 'im
en git dinner, en dat atter dinner he'd
tek 'em 'roun' ter de Widder Kennedy's en interjuce 'em, w'ich de farmer

"And he lived up there?"
"Yas, suh; dis yer home er Marse
John Brown's wuz ret whar Gin'ul
McClellan got 'feated endurin' de wah,
en whar de ahmy dat fought up dar at
Gettysbu'g had ter cross ober to git

"Wasn't that a dangerous place for
him?"
"Lah, suh, dat wuz de ve'y place
fer de Cap'n's bizness. Hit wuz a be-
hidesome, outn-de-way place. Eben
den, dough, he allers had his li'l'
daughter-in-law on guard fer him.
She wuz jes' sixteen yeahs ole en she
wuz beau'ful, en her husban' he wus
jes' nineteen. Dey wus de nices' li'l'
pyar er couples, en dey suttinly sot a
heap er sto' by one anudder. De
Cap'n allers called her his li'l' watchdog, kaze she use ter set in de do' en
knit en sing en watch w'ile dey all
wuz insides fixin' up de insurrecshun,
en w'en she saw anybody a comin'
she'd change de chune she wuz sing-

"You know, Marser, dat huntin'

"You kin hab all de freedom you

"Gen'l Washin' ton's two rich nephews libed in dat county, en dey had

Den he tu'n 'roun' en salute Colonel

"Colonel, you en de Cap'n yer is

"Bimeby w'en Colonel Stuart come,

"W'ile de Cap'n wuz sayin' fyarwell

"De Cap'n riz up en onhitched de

*The laws of the State authorized immediate execution of the death sentence in cases of insurrection or rebellion. By the law, John Brown could have been tried,
convicted and executed all on the same day. He was
charged with conspiracy with slaves for the purpose of
insurrection, treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder in the first degree. His counsel, Mr. George
Henry Hoyt, of Massachusetts, plead for him, and John
Brown declared he was too ill to go to court.
"Den de co'te got a dispatch fum
de Cap'n's brudder 'way out in Erhier,
en he axed de State er Ferginia ter

De Cap'n wuz 'dignant

"De State er Ferginia argufy dat

man, kidney er no kidney.
*The Governor of Virginia after his visit to him in
prison said: "They themselves are mistaken who take
him to be a madman. He is a bundle of the best nerves
I ever saw, cut and thrust and bleeding and in bonds.
He is a man of clear head, of courage, fortitude, simple
ingenuousness. The gamest man I ever sawing cherry tree, rocking herself to
and fro in a green-painted flag chair,
was an old white-haired negress,-
Granny Elizabeth. She was holding
on her lap a little colored baby. In
her left hand she had a freshly broken
branch of aspen leaves which she
waved back and forth over the little
black body, dressed all in immaculate
white, keeping time with the fluttering leaves to the "Old Ship of Zion "
as she brushed away the swarming
flies.
A yellow fice dog, taking advantage
of the churner's absence and of our
company, was sneakingly licking from
the sides of the churn the cream
which had been splashed out by the
too energetic churning. Another
broken branch of the quivering aspen
tree was lying on the ground with its
green and silver leaves fringed with
cream, bearing self-evident proof of
having been used to shoo away the
epicurean flies while the dasher was
cheerily moved up and down, making
music to the churner's threatening
and anon pleading song of "Come,
butter, come."
"Good morning, granny. How
are you all? I hope your little baby
is not sick," said my husband with his
irresistible cordiality, handing me the
reins and bounding gracefully out of
the wagon and over the stile and
holding out his princely hand.
"Nar, suh, Marse Jawge; de baby
ain't sick, suh, he daid. But he free,
dough, t'ank God,-jes' ez free ez dew'ites' w'ite chile in de lan' er de
libin'. Yas, suh, dat he is! Free-
free-free! ef he is daid en gone.
But hit 'tain't my own natchul bawn
chile, you know; hit's my gran'chile's
chile. I'm moughty po'ly myse'f,
praise de Lawd, Marse Jawge, but de
res' er de folks is all up en about en is
toler'ble. I much obleeged ter you.
Dar ain't nobody home jes' now,
dough, sep'n me en Mandy en de baby,
en de baby he's daid lak I tole you, en
Mandy she's so shameface she runs
lak a kil-deer en hides herse'f 'roun'
de cornder er de house soon ez ebber
she years de soun' er de horse's footses
en sees a sign er any you-all w'ite

Marse Jawge, Mandy wuz a wah chile,
en wah chillun ain't been use ter w'ite
folks lak de fo'-de-wah chilluns wuz,
so you kin 'count fer de milk in dis
kokenut go'de."
"I am very sorry, Granny Elizabeth, for your grief, tempered though
it is with freedom," said my husband
in kindly sympathy, again extending
his hand. I, in my anxiety for my
own little ones, gave expression only
to fear and caution, drawing back into
the wagon instead of getting out, asking with almost indecent haste what
the matter was with the baby.
"Ah-m," groaned Granny Elizabeth in reply, mournfully waving her
blue-checked turbaned head to and fro,
"de po' li'l' fellow had culludfantum,
wums en fits."
The tragical impress of the calamitous enormity of the disease attuning
her voice, she continued :
"He was de peertes' chile you mos'
ebber seed er yearn tell er, a laffin' en
a lookin' 'roun' en a tekin' notus er
ebb'yt'ing 'fo' he wuz tuck down wid

'Pear lak ter me, w'en I t'inks 'bout
hit, dat de chile tuck de enfloons er

you know, atter his gre't gran'daddy,
Samwell Ege, en his gre't grandaddy
wuz named atter his marser, same ez I

house ('Liz'bef Welsh), which wuz de
same branch er de fambly. But you
know all 'boutn dem w'ite folks,
Marse Jawge.
Howsomebber gre't de

we's yer talkin' 'bout hit, en w'ile his
po' li'l' k'ruptible brack body is lyin'

"Deed en 'deed, Marse Jawge,"
she said, interrupting herself and
changing her tone and manner as she
suddenly recollected the duties and
hospitalities of her home, "you mus'
'skuze me, 'deed you mus'. I cl'ar
'fo' grashus my tribulashuns is so
gre't en so upsottin' dat dey mos' mek

Marse Jawge.
"How is you-all? I ax you now;
en won'-chu git out en res' yo'se'fs,
en hab a cool drink er water? 'Mandy
will git de chany pitcher fer you ter
drink outn ef you will, en ef you'll
wait aw'ile you kin hab some buttermilk, too, fer I yeard de butter comin'
w'en you-all driv up."
Calling vigorously, but in vain, for
'Mandy's assistance, the old woman
seemingly forgot all her sorrows in the
dispensing of hospitalities.
Meantime my husband had let down
to the bottom of the well by the well-
pole, hand over hand, the old oaken
bucket, which was securely tied to the
end of the pole with a grapevine, and,
drawing it up dripping full, had set it
on the well-curb while he washed out
the long-necked country-grown gourd
to give us a cool drink?
"Where is little Sammy's mother?"
I asked when the thirsty children had
drunk and been induced, though reluctantly, to go ahead with their
mammy; lured, after no little effort on
the part of both of us, to go and hunt
the temptingly-described blue-bells
and crimson and white velvet oak-
balls; for the dead baby, the fice dog
and the hidden Mandy all had a mysterious fascination for these little ones
-impressionable as they were.
"His ma! La, chile, she tuck off,
she did, las' night en went down ter
Shirley, Kernel Kyarter's place, ter a
'lasses pullin' gun by some cullud

"Where is Uncle Ege, Granny? I
hope he is still living," said my husband as Granny Elizabeth paused.
Knitting her wrinkled brow till it.
looked like an empty water-bag, and
snapping her lips together so suddenly
that her nose and chin came into collision and slipped past each other in the
intensity of her emotions, she answered:
"Yas, suh, dat limb er Satan is

"La, Marse Jawge, ain'chu nebber

she asked, as my husband expressed
surprise at her not living with her

he hope dat ez I done yeard de trufe

dat he'd meked up his min' dat de res'
er his life should be spent aspecterble
en dat he wa'n't gwine ter lib in dat
niggerfied way dat he'd been a libin',
no longer. Mo' dan dat, he say, dat
he want me ter know dat dat house en

but dat he'd le' me know he wuz Marser

"De mo' dat nigger talk, Marse
Jawge, de mo' audaciouser en de mo¹
sassier he got. I couldn' b'liebe my

I wuz
dat s'prize I couldn' say nuttin' ter

picked up a loos'n brickbat outn de

come home ter tek in my arms, dat
haid dat had slep' on de same bolster
'long side er mine all deze yeahs.
T'ank Gord, but my ole man, ez luck
would hab hit, dodged de lick. 'Twuz
de firs' lick I had ebber aimed at 'im,
en I'm glad hit missed 'im en didn'.
strek 'im.
"I scrambled up in de kyart, en tole
Peter ter dribe 'long. Iwuz jes' ez half-

studied.
"Naix day I tuck all de suckum-
stances er de case en lay 'em 'fo' my
w'ite folks. Dey wuz my ole man's
w'ite folks, too, ez well ez dey wuz
minze, but dey wuz moughty justice-

skanderlized at sich audacious treatment. Dey 'wised me ter res' my

wid de ole man dey knowed de man dat
could fix 'im. Miss Sally she sont

He wuz a young boy lawyer, jes'

"Co'se it hu't my feelin's, my ole

but I thunk mebbe he wuz fixin' up,
too. Den w'ile I wuz waitin' dey

"W'en Sunday come I meked sho'

showed 'im how ter git out er hit.
"Naix day dey sont me a bun'le er
papers all tied up wid a red string dat
I didn' hab no use fer. I tuck de papers en kyared 'em ter Marse Hunter
Marshall en my w'ite folks, en dey say,
'Granny, dey is yo' deforce papers,' en
dey p'inted out de deforce cross-mark
dat I had meked myse'f 'fo' witnesses.
Dey say I had done hit all myse'f,
but you know, Marse Jawge, I didn'
know dat cross wuz a deforce cross, en
I didn' know de mens dat brung hit
wuz witnesses. I thunk de mens wuz
chutch members, en de cross wuz
writin'. I begged en prayed Marse
Hunter en dey all ter do sump'n fer
me, but dey all say dey couldn' do
nuttin' fer me now. 'Pear lak my bein'
insenserble bout de law didn' count fer

"Well, I tuck down ill ter my baid
wid de low groun' feber, en endurin'
dat time ole Sam en dat gal had an-
udder gre't kyarin' on at Moun' Zion
Chutch, en got mar'ed ober ag'in."
"Here," said my husband as the old
woman turned the corpse around (“ter
onkramp dis yer lef' arm, en res' dis
yudder han'," as she explained) "here
is some money to help pay for the little
one's coffin when it comes. We must
move on now, Granny, so good-bye.
""
"Tanky, t'anky, Marse Jawge;
t'anky, honey," she said, getting up
and making a courtesy with the little
dead baby in her arms.
"Tanky.

wuz rich, he wuz one good man. En
dar nebber would er been no wah en
deforces ef he had libed."
We said good-bye and drove off, calling
and taking in the little children who had
gone on ahead. Their chattering voices,
describing the cones and flowers they
had not had time to gather, drowned the
last notes of the quavering old voice as
it twanged through the trees:
"All abo'de de ship er Zion,
Halle-lu-yer!
She's a gwine-gwine-gwine,
Halle-lu-yer!
Fer ter kyar us home ter glory,
Halle-lu-yer!
Come, dar'z room fer young en hoary,

YOUTH has always its famed historian, teller of unswerving truth, to
whose judicial mind all disputed
points of history are submitted for
decision.
Uncle Washington Skutchins was
the encyclopædia of our childhood.
His many occupations, of barber, assistant undertaker, measurer of ditches,
wells and cordwood, had brought him
into close contact with people of information, and his absorbent mind
gleaned from each new field.
"Wax
to receive yet marble to retain," it
never lost a fact or a principle that
had once been impressed upon it. So
accurate were eye, memory and speech
that his measurements were admitted
as undisputed evidence in court and
his statements in regard to past events
were of academic authority.
To us who had just entered on the
pathway of knowledge he was the
court of last resort on historic subjects.
Not even Peter Parley commanded
our confidence when he failed to coincide with Uncle Washington Skutch-
ins. As for ordinary historians popularly accepted by schools and libraries,
they could not stand a moment against
Uncle Washington's disapproval.
"Uncle Washington, hear what my
book says."
He would listen attentively, and
after a pause of solemn significance
would say:
"Yes, li'l' Missis, dat's so."
"Now, listen to this."
After close attention to the story
he would shake his head with decision.
"Part er dat is so, but de ahmy
nebber tu'ned ter de lef'; hit tu'ned
ter de ret en went off dataway."
The necessary correction would be
made and another point introduced.
"No, no; dat hain't so. Hit wuz
dis way."
Then the whole passage would be
crossed out and the story according to
Uncle Washington inserted in a footnote, and we would feel sure that the
eternal verities of history were ours.
We had no faith in any historical records that did not bear upon their title-
page that seal of authenticity-"Revised by Uncle Washington Skutch-
ins."
We used to ask him about the great
men whom he had known, and to us
they became veritable living figures in
the panorama of our existence.

Uncle Washington carefully distinguished between linguistic suppleness
and mere learning, holding that, while
they might be associated in the same
mind, they were by no means necessarily to be found in conjunction. As
an illustration of the utter helplessness
of scholastic ability and legal acumen
*"If they have that, and I had not given them one
shilling they would be rich. And if they have not that,
and I had given them the whole world, they would be
poor."
when competing with simple "tongue-
suppleness" he was wont to relate the
manner in which "Dick," a groom of
his acquaintance, got the better of his
master, no less a personage than Chief
Justice Marshall.
The home of the Chief Justice in
Richmond was opposite that of Colonel Pickett, the grandfather of General George E. Pickett. The Colonel
was a man of great wealth and distinguished as a wit. He and his judicial
neighbor were opposite in many ways,
especially in the matter of physique.
The gaunt form and meagre face of
the Chief Justice seemed to indicate
that, in addition to having descended
through a line of thin ancestry, he had
lived a life of toil and of abstemious
habits. The Colonel, on the other
hand, showed in his portly form and
genial face the effects of generous
living and years spent in scholarly
leisure.
The same difference was apparent
in every part of their establishments,
even including the carriage horses; the
lean animals which drew the coach of
the Chief Justice showing a painful
contrast to the sleek, well rounded,
handsome steeds of the Colonel. So
noticeable was this dissimilarity that
it led to unpleasant suspicions that
Dick was neglecting the Judge's
horses, perhaps even converting the
supplies provided for them into liquid
refreshments for himself.
The attention of the Judge having
been called to the subject, he sent for
Dick to report to him at once, with the
intention of solving the new problem
which defied Constitutional principles
and Court precedents.
"Mawnin', Marse John; mawnin',
suh. 'Skuse deze clothes; but 'peared
lak you wuz in sich a hurry dat I didn'
tek no time ter change 'em, suh."
"Good morning, Dick," returned
the Judge sharply, with an air of suspicion and disapproval most unusual
to him.
Perceiving to his astonishment that
the moral atmosphere was thus perturbed, Dick chose to refer the unpleasant condition to some other cause
than dissatisfaction with himself.
"I moughty sorry you don' feel so
well dis mawnin', Marse John. I allers
feels bad myse'f w'en I feels well, kaze
I knows I's gwine ter feel wus atter-
wards. You see, Marse John, hit's
kind er forchunate ter hab de bad
feelin' firs' sometimes, suh."
"Dick," interrupted the Judge
rather impatiently, "what is the reason that Colonel Pickett's horses are
so fat and sleek while mine look almost like skeletons. Dick, my horses
are neglected. They are evidently
not being properly cared for. I don't
believe they are half fed or half
curried."
This attack from the Judge was so
unexpected that Dick was fairly posed.
He hemmed and hawed for awhile till
he had gathered up his negro wits,
or, as Uncle Washington Skutchins
would have said, had found his supple
tongue.
"Yas, suh, Marse John, dat's so.
Hit suttinly do 'pear dat away; but
den, you know, Marse John, you en
Kunnel Pickett is moughty diff'unt
fum wun-anudder yo'se'fs. Now, de
Kunnel, he libs high. He w'ars fine
clo'es,-fan-tail coats wid de buttons
set fur apart behime,— en li'l' collars

en all; en you, Marse John, you don'
keer w'at kin' er clo'es you w'ar, ner
w'at is sot befo' you ter eat. You
w'ars shorts en plain linen roundabouts en big collars en,-
"That's so, Dick, that's so; I never
thought of that," said the Judge reflectively. "That's so. ""
"Den, ag'in, Marse John, look at
you, is you fat?”
"No," said the Judge, "decidedly
not."
"Well, den, look at ole Missis
[Mrs. Marshall]; is she fat?"
"No, Mrs. Marshall is most certainly not fat.”
"Den look at me. Is I fat?"
"No, Dick, you are about as lean
as a beanpole.
""
"Dat's de same case, Marse John,
wid we-all's hosses. Dey's po' jes'
lak we-all is.
Now, look at Kunnel

Den look at his
wife, Mrs. Pickett, she fat. Den dat

"Yes, Dick; yes.
Your evidence is
conclusive. It is quite apparent that
my judgment in the premises was
erroneous."
"Yas, en dar wuz Marse Henry Clay

(( He deceasted dis life on de Fofer

"But, chillun, de swif'es' en de sup-

"He had purty, wavy hyar, de color
er nice pulled stewed molasses. En
he wuz jes' ez active ez a cat en jes'

walked firm en springy, en he wuz ez

"But I gwine stop talkin' 'boutn

Joe could out-run, out-hop, out-jump,
-out-kick, out-sw'ar, out-pray, th'ow
down, drag out, en whip any man dat
ebber drawed de bref er life. He wuz
de one, you know, dat killed dem two
gre't Injun chiefs in dat turrible han’-
ter-han' scuffle.
"Big Joe wuz ridin' 'long wid his
gun 'cross de pommel er his saddle en
his hat full er bullus grapes res'in'
'pon de gun en de pommel. He wuz
jes' smackin' his lips en eatin' dem
bulluses w'en sump'n' went piff-piff-
bang-bang, en two shots wuz fired fum
bofe sides er 'im. Bofe er de shots
nipped off a piece er Big Joe's breas'
meat, but he slided offn his hoss quick
ez a wink en cock his gun, en dar wuz
two gre't Injun chiefs each side er 'im
gwine 'Ugh! Ugh!' en dodgin' dar-
se'fs behime de trees en loadin' dar
guns. Dey had one-time guns [single-
barrel]. Big Joe's gun wuz a two-time
gun.
"Jes' ez de Injuns wuz gwine shoot

Joe shif' hisse'f quick en fiah de lef’-
han' barr'l at one Injun en bruck his
back en wuz gwine shif' en gib de
yudder Injun de yudder ret-han' barr'l
w'en de Injun flung his tomahawk at
Joe en knocked de gun outn Joe's han'.
Den dey meked fer one anudder. De
Injun he rushed at Joe wid a yell.
Den dey had hit, nip en tuck,-Big
Joe on top, Injun on top; Injun on top,
Big Joe on top, - twel pres'n'y Big
Joe got in a year blow, en dat settled
de Injun. En don-chu know dat w'ile
Big Joe en dis Injun wuz tryin' ter kill

Injun had propped hisse'f up 'g'inst a
tree en wuz tryin' ter shoot Big Joe,
but ez luck would hab hit, ebby time
he'd tek aim en pull de trigger he'd

pullin' de trigger en floppin', en w'en
de Injun seed dat pullin' de trigger
meked 'im flop ober he flung de gun
down en stobbed hisse'f wid his own
knife.
"Big Joe, you know, wuz wid
Pahson Cummin's dat time, too, dat
de Pahson byarly sabed his life by de
hyars er his wig. Dat tale 'bout Pah-
son Cummin's is a moughty ongenteel
tale, but I's gwine ter tell hit ter you
jes' ter show you how eben de ve'y

"Ole Pahson Cummin's libed at

heels-en jes' ez de Injun wuz gwine
ter seege hol' er de Pahson, de Pah-
son's foot slipped en he slid down de
rawine en his big w'ite curly wig cotch
'pon a bramble briah.
De Injun go

wid delightment w'en he seed de ole
w'ite haid, ez he thunk, en he gin a big
wah-whoop en meked one bound ter
grab hit.
"Well my lan'! You ought ter
a seed dat ball-faced Injun w'en he
tu'n dat wig 'roun' en look behime
hit en un'neaf hit en on de yudder side
er hit fer de haid part, en seed dar
wa'n't no haid part. Den de ole Injun
hilt de wig off en look ez shame-face ez
ef he had stole sump'n. Den he go
'hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi!' Den he flung de
wig 'pon de groun', kerblam! en kick
at hit wid his moccasin en spit at hit
en say, 'Damn lie! Damn lie!'
"En so 'twuz. Den de Injun look

den he crope down 'pon his all-fo's en

"Dat bad wud I tole you de Injun

You know dey says we wuz

En dat dar wa'n't no w'ite folks 'twel
one day de good Lawd wuz lookin' down
fum Heaben ter tek a interwiew er His
wuks ter see ef dey wuz good, en w'ile
He wuz tekin' dis interwiew He tuck
notus dat we-all didn' 'preciate w'at
He'd done fer us, en so He meked up
His min' ter tek ret off en come down
yer en tes' our lub en gratichude en
faif in His holy wud, en He 'gun ter
git raidy dat minit. He breshed up
His Sunday boots en put on His
beaber en went 'long thoo de front
gate en on up de golden lane ter whar
de road forked fer ter come down ter
de yeth.
"Twuz de spring time er de yeah
down yer, too, en de whole face er de
yeth wuz a bloomin' en a buddin'. De
paschers wuz ez green ez de grass could
mek em, en de cattles on a thousan'
plains wuz a grazin' in 'em. De buttercups en clober blossoms wuz bescat-
tered all about; de birds wuz all a
chirpin' en a singin' fit ter split dar
li'l' th'oats; de rose bushes wuz all
buddin', de vi'lets en Johnnyquils en
hyercinfs a bloomin'; de trees wuz all
kivered wid leabes en de grape-wines
fillin' de woods wid sweet scents; en
de orchards pink en w'ite en green all
ober; de fishes en crabs a bitin'; de
hens a cacklin' en a layin' eggs, en
de young chickens en ducks en gos-
lin's all a hatchin'; de palin's wuz
all w'ite-washed, en de houses fresh
painted—all han's had on dar new
spring clothes en new spring bonnets.
"De craps had all come up en wuz
a growin'. All de ole sheeps had li'l'
lambs en some er 'em had two. All er de
milch cows wuz gibbin' a gallon ter
de pail. De bees wuz all suckin' de
bref outn de flowers en tu'nin' hit inter
honey.
"Eben down ter de Lawd tuck His
own se'f by s'prize at de glorification
er all dat He seed. He bowed His haid
in humble somilichude at His holy
handy-wuks, en wuz jes gwine ter
pray, w'en sump'n went kerchunk-
kerchunk ret at His foots. He drapped
His eyes down quick, en lo! dar wuz a
mud-tuckle a tu'nin' hese'f 'roun' en
mekin' fer a li'l' pon' er muddy
water. He stopped en looked at de
tuckle en den He looked at de pon'.
Den He tuck some yeast powders He
happened ter hab in His wes'co't
pocket en flung 'em in de pon'. Dat
started de waters, en dey riz en bubbled, riz en bubbled, 'twel dey wuz ez
deep en cl'ar ez cryslum. Den he
bressed de waters en named de pon'
"Thesda.'
"He went 'long den to'ds de co'te-
house, fer 'twas co'te day, en He
knowed de niggers wuz all moughty
apt ter be at co'te ef dey could git dar.
En so dey wuz. Co'se, de niggers
didn' know nuttin' 'tall 'bout de
Lawd's comin' in dar mids', en ef dey
had de Lawd wuz inwisible en dey
couldn' er seed 'Im nohow. But
de Lawd could see dem, dough,
en dey wuz jes' ez thick, too, ez blackbirds, en dey wuz habin' a gre't time
'mongst darse'fs.
"Some er 'em wuz majestricks, en
dey wuz tryin' cases fer chicken-steal-
in' en lock-breckin'. Some wuz con-
stubles en auctiomeers, en dey wuz
auctiomin' off farms fer debt, en
brucken-down ole mules en t'ings dat
wa'n't no 'count. Some wuz sellin'
cider en 'simmon beer en drams.
Some wuz playin' tetch base, en some
mumble-de-peg. Some wuz settin' on
dar ham-bones whittlin' sticks. Some
wuz swoppin' knives, some wuz eatin'
hoss-cakes en water-millions, en some
wuz 'sputin' en quollin' en foughtin'
en jes' gwine on scan❜lous.
"De Lawd's heart suttinly wuz
troubled a heap. He wiped His eyes
en cl'ared His th'oat en spuck ter 'em
in a loud woice. He tole 'em ter all
han's go down ter de pon' er 'Thesda
(en He tole 'em whar de pon' wuz) enter bave darse'fs in hit. Co'se dey all
knowed dey had jes' baved darse'fs en
put on fresh clo'es dat ve'y mawnin',
but dem dat lubbed en serbed de Lawd
en feared His holy name didn'
queschify ner argufy wid 'Im 'bout de
orders He gin 'em. Dey jes' run ez

wud.
Dey

tuck off dar clo'es en dey baved dar-
se'fs jes' lak de Lawd had tole 'em ter

libin' in town all dar libes en been

"W'en dey went 'long back ter de
co'te-house en de yudders seed how
purty dey wuz, co'se dey wanted ter
git obedient den, too, so dey tuck off
en run ter de pon' ez hard ez dey could
