in de naik en slashed 'im on de face
en stobbed 'im in de kidney.
"De Cap'n riz up en onhitched de
sode er Frederick de Gre't en warf hit
in front er de Cap'n-er-Marines en say:
"Coward! Lis'n ter my wuds!
Dis yer is de wuk er Gord-All-
Moughty. 'Twus 'In dat sont me
ter free his peoples fum bondage. My
een' is nigh, but de een' er dis slabe
queschun ain't yit,- ain't yit. En
mark my wuds,-my sons ain't de only
sons dat's gwine ter lose dar libes in
de cause!'
