ble fer w'at he done-dat de ole man

De Cap'n wuz 'dignant
w'en his lawyer showed him de dis-
patch, en he sont his brudder wud ter
min' his own bizness.*
"De State er Ferginia argufy dat
ole John Brown had done en cost her
money en blood en trouble 'nuff en
dey wa'n't gwine gib him no mo' dan
de law 'lowed. En dey tried de ole
man, kidney er no kidney.
*The Governor of Virginia after his visit to him in
prison said: "They themselves are mistaken who take
him to be a madman. He is a bundle of the best nerves
I ever saw, cut and thrust and bleeding and in bonds.
He is a man of clear head, of courage, fortitude, simple
ingenuousness. The gamest man I ever saw.
