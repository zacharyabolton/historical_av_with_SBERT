WITH the passing away of the olden
r√©gime and the dawning of the new
day of business enterprise in the
Southland many beautiful things have
been lost in the dim past.
The oft-repeated phrase, "Before
the war," brings back pictures far
brighter than any which the newer
time has ever hung upon the walls of
Memory. The reminiscence of the
far-away life lingers with us like the
fragrance of the snowy magnolias.
The rose-vines which once trailed over
the walls of the old plantation home
yet creep through the lattice of the
heart and sparkle in the dews of life's
early morning.
When "the bells across the snow ""
ring out the holy chime of "Peace on
earth, good will to men," the heart of
the traveler turns back to the home of
his childhood where those bells first
made music in his faith-abiding soul.
Whether that never-forgotten spot be
amid the darksome pines of the North,
the flowering myrtles of the South,
beyond the towering mountains of the
West, or across the seas that must ever
roll between the wanderer and that
magic fairy-land of home, the musical
chimes ring back to the olden, happy
days.
In the Southern heart the sacred
Christmas-tide is linked with memories
of the old-time plantation, the merrymaking of the affectionate, simple-
hearted colored people to whom the
Christmas holidays were the great
festival of the year, the gratitude which
lit up their dusky faces as they received
their presents, the joy of the pickanin-
nies in the possession of their new toys.
Time has no power to remove those
pictures from the gallery of the heart.
Thus good old Jack, returning, after
years of absence, to the war-desolated
home of his youth, describes the old
plantation Yule log, with its mystic
blaze flaming out in response to the
cheerful note of the Yule log horn:
This alleged threat of Santa Claus,
which was only the bill of lading, that
Uncle Charles, my grandmother's
foreman, took out of his hat and tragically unfolded and waved at us with
one hand while with the other he
fiercely grasped the steer yoke, was
more potent by far than the fear of
being "hooked er trompled ter def,"
so we slunk away and contented ourselves watching with wonder-eyes from
our respective distances.
I, with my face pressed against the
window-pane in my nursery, could seethe unloading, and see, too, the little
colored children all huddled up together on the door-steps of the quarter-
kitchen, pulling down each other's
heads and whispering mysteriously
into each other's ears as the boxes and
barrels, one after the other, were taken
out and stored away. There was the
hogshead of New Orleans molasses,
suggesting the thick layer of sugar at
the bottom; the long, peaked loaves
of white sugar under their thick blue.
"fools-caps," the cases of raisins and
figs and dates and tamarinds, and
barrels of nuts and oranges and crackers, and boxes of cheese, and slyly
pushed back behind them were hampers with the mysterious name of
"sundries," which name we at once
associated with Santa Claus.
We all loved and feared Uncle
Charles, who seemed to us the viceroy
and confidential agent of the king of
childhood, Santa Claus. To the deft'
fingers of his wife, Mammy Borry, we
owed many of our daintily-trimmed
gowns of drawn work and lace.
The blowing of horns and popping
of fire-crackers had made Christmas
many hours old when I was aroused
by a loving Christmas-gift kiss, and,
looking up, saw the beautiful face of
my grandmother bending over me.
Rubbing my eyes awake I saw her
holding out toward me a beautiful
wadded dressing gown of blue and
pink silk, and a pair of warm worsted
boots, her Christmas present for me.
Putting on the boots and slipping the
wrapper over my night gown, she
gave me a cup of hot milk to drink,
then pushing back my curls led me to
the folding doors, which at her touch
opened wide. Was there ever before
so weird and beautiful a picture colored
on a little child's heart?
Up in the top of a glittering Christmas tree laden with presents for all
was a great white-bearded Santa Claus,
and around about it the little negroes
of the plantation were gracefully
grouped. On one of the branches in
a nest of soft white cotton was a little
colored baby six weeks old, unconsciously holding in its chubby black
fist a deed which made him mine-a
Christmas present which "de angels
had sont me by Marse Santa Claus,
fer my coachmans," my mammy told
me.
At a signal from my dear black
mammy all the little ones courtesied
or bowed and cried out: "Chris'mus
gif' Merry Chris'mus en Chris' mus
""
gif', ole Missis, li'l' Missis, en ebby-
body!" Then Santa Claus handed
down the dolls, horns, toys, candies
and bags of marbles to each in turn.
After all had been distributed "Kriss,
the baby, was taken out of his nest
and I was awarded the great privilege
of holding him in my lap on condition
that I would sit flat on the floor, an
honor which Kriss, who was thus
summarily awakened from his slumber,
did not appreciate. "Dat's his way er
axin' you Chris' mus gif', my mammy apologetically explained, as she
took him from me.
The mother of Kriss, my Christmas
gift, did not like children, and was in
the habit of lending out all of hers as
soon as they were six months old to
those of her associates who were
blessed with motherly instincts and
were on the borrow. Uncle Charles'
wife, who had borrowed and reared
twenty-seven children, had already bespoken little Kriss.
Later my dear grandmother, in the
old basement dining-room, standing
beside a large many-gallon bowl of
egg-nogg, a silver ladle in her pink
and white hands, filled up glass after
glass of the delicious white beverage
for one and all. Even the babies
drank egg-nogg on Christmas morning in old Virginia. All above and
around the big brick fireplace, in which
a bright log fire burned and crackled,
hung stockings and socks of all sizes
filled "wid Chris' mus gif's w'at Marse
Santa 'ad fotch down de chimbly."
Uncle Charles stood on a stool to reach
and hand them down. The first one
was "a possum fer ole Missis," the
next "a coon-skin fer li'l' Missis fer
ter kiver ober her doll-babies' flo' wid."
Then as he took the others down he
would sing out, "Chris'mus gif', yer's
yo' sock! Who got de mate? Chris'-
mus gif'! Who got de feller ter dis
one?
Our good old black daddy
rolled up his eyes, wiped his shining
bald head and, suddenly changing his
gleeful Christmas tone and expression
to his stern and solemn preacher manner, said:
And Uncle
Charles rolled down his eyeballs and
waved the dismissal of his impatient
listeners.
The old-time Christmas of the plantation has passed away with the old
Southern homes and the old Southern
life. The Christmas sermon of good
old "Uncle Charles" is now but a
cherished memory in the hearts of the
grave and saddened men and women
who, as children, used to listen with
awe-struck minds to his solemn exhortations. The war soon came to
sweep master and slave alike into a
freedom which is thus commented
upon by Mammy Borry:
Aunt Nettie, or Mammy Borry, for
we always called her by her child-
borrowing name, lived nearly two
years after the war;
During the last year of Mammy
Borry's life she was a great invalid,
and night after night would think her
"time had come" and send Uncle'
Charles post-haste over "ter de gre't
house fer ole Missis ter come en read
de Bible ter her en see her gib up de
ghos'."
"You would better shut your finger
up then," suggested his mistress, "and
not be in such a hurry to speed the
parting soul of your poor little wife."
So night after night Uncle Charles
would stand at the head of Mammy
Borry's bed with his outstretched forefinger pointed at her eyes, watching
the dying face, ready "ter do de las'
ack fer her," while "ole Missis "
would sit by her side and read about
the loaves and the fishes, her favorite
of all the chapters in the Bible.
One night during the Christmas of
1866 Uncle Charles tapped gently at
"ole Missis' " door and said:
THE memories of the last olden-
time plantation Christmas of my youth
spring into bud in my thought through
the branching shade of the years, and
I let them blossom into words merely
as an historical sketch of the times-
hoping to please those who, like me,
have passed through such scenes, as
well as those to whom they are not
even the dimmest of reminiscences.
The story of that novel Christmastide was enacted at my old Virginia
home, near the village of Chucka-
tuck, in Nansemond County. The
ancestral forests of this region had
sheltered the hunting ground of the
Nansemum Indians in the days when
John Smith came prospecting for a
home for his numerous descendants,
and from that circumstance he had
given the county its name of Nanse-
mond. My home was diagonally
opposite Newport News, on a neck
of land which separated the Chucka-
tuck Creek from the Nansemond River.
From a point on the strait I witnessed
the famous naval engagement between
the Monitor and the Merrimac.
Ever since the capture of Roanoke
Island by the Federals and the abandonment of Norfolk and Suffolk by
the Confederates all this part of the
country had been in quiet possession
of the former. The Confederate lines
extended only to the Blackwater River
on the east, where a small force under
General Pryor was stationed to hold
the Federals in check.
Though the Emancipation Proclamation had not yet been issued the
light of Freedom was glimmering like
an aurora borealis in the northern sky.
The negroes knew that they had only
to cross beyond the reach of the power
of the Confederacy to throw off forever the shackles which had been riv-
eted upon them by time, custom and
tradition. Alluring as was that radiance, it was dimmed almost to obscura-
tion in their loving, loyal hearts, by
the darkness of leaving their old
homes. Tender memories, ties of affection formed through many years of
dependence and protection, trammeled
their reluctant feet as they timidly
crossed their Rubicon. The hand of
Time had unlocked the floodgates and
a river of blood had rolled on and
swept away the ancient barriers.
Master and servitor alike drifted onward with the tide.
"WELL, dis is Chris'mus ebe's ebe,
demorrer will be Chris' mus ebe, en day
atter demorrer Chris'mus day in de
mawnin'," I overheard Aunt Serena
saying to herself, though with anything but the wonted Christmas glee
in her usually cheery voice, as I went
into her kitchen all cleaned and ready
for Christmas. The last finishing
touches had been given to it and cedar
wreaths and bright holly berries picturesquely adorned its whitewashed
ceiling.
Since we had no sugar in Virginia,
sorghum, an Asiatic plant with succulent stalks recently introduced into
this country, from which we made a
syrup, had to serve all its purposes.
We ingeniously managed to concoct a
great many things out of it that tasted
very good to us then, in those war-
starving times. With the aid of our
native fruits-dried currants, cherries,
apples, pears, peaches, figs, whortle-
berries and citron-we succeeded in
making a delicious fruit cake.
The shelves in the old tin safe now
were filled with sorghum puddings,
sorghum pies, sorghum cakes and
sorghum candies, made into all manner of shapes, some plain and others
filled with walnuts, peanuts and hickory nuts. To me, as I remember them
all now in the long distance of time,
they looked very tempting and inviting, in spite of the uncanny sugges-
tion of a "nigger Santa Claus.‚Äù
"The hog-killing" (quite an event
on a Virginia plantation) had been
over with for nearly two weeks, and
much of the time since then had been
spent by us in preparing and sending
off the Christmas boxes for our loved
ones across the lines. Besides the many
sorghum-made dainties which we put
into these boxes, there were sausages
and spare-ribs and chines and cheese-
souse and pigs' feet, and crackling
bread and chitterlings and turkeys
and pickled oysters and baked sweet
potatoes (yellow and white yams). All
had been lovingly packed and smuggled safely across the Blackwater,
upon the opposite banks of which
"the Johnny Rebs swapped tobacco
for coffee with the Yanks."
By this time their singing had
cheered her in spite of herself, and
before they had begun this last verse
she was standing in the doorway patting time to the music of their voices.
"May we-all look in de safe?" said
the twin sisters, Mary Francis and
Arabella, as they ran in, followed by
the others.
"You-all kin ef you wants ter; but
ez fer me, ole ooman, I ain't gwine ter
aggerwate my stummuck wid my eyeballs, en I don' want ter look," said
Uncle Battus; "kaze I's feared I 'ud
chomp my toofs in dem puddin's 'fo'
I knowed w'at I wuz doin'.‚Äù
"Dat'll do; dat'll do. You done
been browzin' 'roun' dat safe long
'nuff. Come 'way fum dar 'fo' de
debil temp's you. Den, ag'in, you
better put some er yo' tennence on
de j'is'," called out Aunt Serena, and
immediately they all looked around
and then up at the joist, from which,
peeping in and out among the evergreens, were the bladders they had
blown up "at hog-killing" and hung
there to be popped on Christmas Eve.
Christmas Eve had come and gone.
The stock had been fed early, the
cows milked, the supper was over, the
Christmas presents were distributed,
the bladders had been popped, and the
last flicker of light from the burning
lime-kiln and tar barrel had died away.
My little brothers and sisters had been
put to bed to give Old Santa Claus a
chance to come down the chimney
with his reindeer, though they had
all been told not to expect many
things this war Christmas, because
poor Santa Claus would have to run
the blockade, and could not get
through the Federal lines without
risking his life in passing "the Yankee
sentinels."
"Come," said my father, "it is
growing late, and time to lock up and
turn in."
"All right," said my father sadly,
and then he called them back and said:
"Do you know why I gave you
your Christmas suits and gifts this
evening? Well, it is because you are
all going to leave your old master's
home to-night. I hoped you would
come and tell me before you went.
Here is a little change for each of you;
Battus will divide it equally, and if you
ever need a home come back to this -
the one that you and your fathers'
fathers before you helped to make."
"I mean that I have read your
minds and that your arrangements are
all made to leave to-night. I see that
you are feeling very bad over it, and I
hoped to the last you would be
straightforward and come and tell me,
so that you could have packed up and
gone away in the open day and said
good-bye honestly instead of sneaking
off like this in the night. You know
that ever since the evacuation of Norfolk you could have gone at any time
you wished and I could not have prevented you.
The manner of your
going makes it hard to bear for both."
Ain't you got no tongue?"
"Keep the money, and remember
what I have said. Now, good-bye,
and don't hurt your souls by any more
stories,"
"Do not wound their feelings,
papa," I plead, "by doubting them,'
though in my heart I felt his intuitions
were correct.
About an hour after this Mary
Francis crept slowly to my bedside
and put on my finger a little ring that
Miss Mary Hutchins had left her as a
legacy. There was a doll trunk which
I had given her, made of shells, and in
it were some little keepsakes very
precious to her, which she had stored
away from time to time. This she
put under my pillow, while a sob escaped her as she stole away, thinking
I was asleep, and I would not undeceive nor pain her.
A few minutes later Arabella came
in and, accidentally stumbling against
a chair, said:
Poor girl! There were tears in her
trembling voice as she thus sought to
assure me that her last thought in
parting from the old life was of the
"li'l' Missis" who had been the object
of her loving care through their joint
lives.
The light-wood, which she mentioned as "light'ood," is the heart of the
pine tree. It gives a most brilliant
and beautiful light, though the black
smoke is disagreeable. At that time
candles and oil were very scarce and alight-wood torch was the best substi-
tute we had. Previous to the war the
servants used it in the quarters and at
the corn-shuckings and campmeetings, their black faces gleaming out
wierdly in the glare as they danced
and sang and shouted.
When morning dawned no "Chris'-
mus gif! Chris' mus gif!" sounded
through the house as in the olden
Christmas mornings. No cheery voices
rang out from the quarters and kitchens. The sable servitors who had so
earnestly protested their undeviating
loyalty the evening before had taken
the midnight steamer from Barrett's
neck and gone across to Newport
News, leaving desolation behind them,
for "Marse Da'" and all the family
were deeply attached to the household
servants, as well as dependent upon
them for personal services. Most of
the field hands had gone long before,
but those who had just departed were
like members of the family.
After we had eaten our sad Christmas breakfast and tried to enjoy the
delight of the little ones over their
home-made babies with hickory-nut
heads and rag bodies, and sorghum
candy shaped into men and animals,
all of an African hue, my father and I
went down to the quarters to look
around and lock them up. Just as
we were returning, mamma, who had
joined us, called our attention to a pile
of corn husks lying in the corner.
"Look! What can that be? I saw
those husks move. Look, look!"
As they moved again the weak, pitiful wail of a child came from among
them. Patsy in her haste had left her
baby-poor little thing! We quickly
but gently took the half-starved, half-
smothered little one out, but, alas! it
had not been left, as we first supposed,
accidentally. It was warmly wrapped
in its blanket, its clothes in a bundle
beside it. A barrel hoop was curved
carefully around it to prevent its being
smothered by the covers, and a rag
with mashed sweet potato and flag-
root tied up in it was in its mouth.
The little thing was only five weeks
old, and the mother instinct had been
overcome by the apprehension of the
care and inconvenience of taking so
helpless a being on a difficult journey.
Mamma carried the little waif into
the house, where we fed, bathed and
dressed it. Then we called the children and told them that we had a real
live baby which old Santa Claus had
left for them, and, as it belonged to
them all together, each one must feel
the responsibility and care of it. They
were wild with delight, and asked
many questions about how old Santa
had evaded the Yankee sentinels, and
why he had brought a black real baby
and mulatto doll babies and black
candies and colored things? Was it for
truly a black Santa Claus this year?
Perhaps there never was an uglier,
more weazen-faced little pickanninny
than our Charity, as we named the
Christmas baby, but neither was there
ever one brighter or more cunning.
The possession of such a prize not only
made that Christmas day a happy one
for the children but brought comfort
and help to us all as the years came
and went.
With the gentlest, tenderest heart
she ministered to the suffering, whether
of the human family or of the yet undeveloped tribe whose souls look dumbly
through eyes that silently question of
the great mystery of pain. The lambs
which were motherless or ill fell to her
care. All the deserted little chickens
and ducks appealed with irresistible
force to her maternal heart and found
a congenial home with her. When a
little calf chanced to be thrown helpless and unprotected on the shore of
life it was at once adopted into her
happy family.
All such waifs flourished under her
fostering care, and she became the
owner of a herd of stock branded in
her own name. She accumulated a
nice little bank account, not only from
the sale of her eggs and chickens, but
for the "worth of her service," which
my father began to put to her credit
when she was six years old.
Charity's mother, after fifteen years
of shiftless wandering, accidentally
learned of these possessions, and,
through the aid of a would-be philanthropist, came back and claimed her
child.
We had all become tenderly attached
to the little baby left us by old Santa
as a Christmas gift to lighten that
desolate morning long ago. The
dear little children who had come tome in the meantime were devoted to
her, and never wearied of her stories
about "Br'er Byar en de creeturs, de
tar baby, de briah patch, Sis Cow en
Br'er Buzzard." With the supernatural yearnings of the undeveloped
mind, their favorite history was of the
acquisitive negro who, having stolen
the dollars from a dead woman's eyes,
was ever after pursued by an avenging
phantom with ghastly orbs "flapped
open."
"Scare me to def', Charity;
scare me to def!" they would cry, and
would listen with delicious shudders
of fascinated terror as she tragically
recounted the tale of horror.
The passage of the years had increased her ugliness, if possible, and
she was the blackest negro I ever saw.
Her immense hands and feet, thick
lips, flat nose and poppy eyes, her
short upper lip, rolled back, showing
her little short teeth just coming outside of her gums and looking like two
rows of popcorn, did not render her
"a thing of beauty." Nevertheless,
she was a perennial joy to our household.
Although her mother's entreaties,
arguments, and the tempting pictures
she drew of city life were but slight
attractions to her simple, contented
mind, yet her intuitive sense of filial
duty, supported by the influence which
our appreciation of the maternal claim
impelled us to bring to bear upon the
situation, directed her to the new life
which was offered her. But here was
home. Here were the memories of
childhood. Here were all the associations of her loving, gentle, merry life.
Here was the protection which had always shielded her from the unknown
world, terrifying in its mystery.
The battle of these opposing moral
forces was the first conflict of her
peaceful life.
She had reached the
most tragic battle-ground of the soul-
the place where duty and pleasure
part company. As the tears streamed
down her face she looked to my father
for help.
"She is your mother," he said.
"Go with her, but whenever you want
to come back to us you shall come."
It was not a scene to arrest the attention of the dignified historian. Its
figures might not have claimed the
brush of the artist or the pen of the
poet. It was only a little black girl
going out from under the roof which
had sheltered her merry, care-free,
contented life. Yet of all the black
and white tragedies which the war
had placed upon the stage of Southern
life none would appeal more strongly
to a heart that had been bound by the
olden ties of affection and mutual dependence once uniting the two races.
The Chuckatuck packet answered
the signal to stop, the sound of her
horn jarring discordantly upon our
hearts. Little Charity's effects were
put on board and the last farewells
were said amid falling tears. My
father pulled his hat over his eyes and
walked away. The last view we had
of our faithful, loving little servitor
was as she sat in solitary grief, clasping her knees and rocking herself to
and fro, wailing:
"I am very glad you had such a nice
time," I said, "but you have not told
me anything about the bridegroom.
How did he look?"
"How perfectly dreadful!" I said.
"Why, this seems almost heathenish..
It is absolutely shocking that you
could all have had such merriment
when your friend, for whose sake the
feast was partly made, had just met so
horrible and tragic a death. Especially does it seem heartless in the
bride to have entered into such festivities when her bridegroom was a corpse
of a day. I should think she would
have folded up all her beautiful clothes
and locked them away and spent the
Christmas eve in prayer and in weeping for her dead rather than laughing
and dancing and marching and singing with the living."
"Twa'n't me, Ung' Charles!
'Twa'n't me !" echoed from a chorus
of frightened voices, and though the
little "ragged muffins," as Uncle
Charles called them, each and all
knew that there was no harm in doing any one of these things, yet Uncle
Charles' threatening tone, together
with the fear of his disapproval, kalei-
doscoped their innocent pastime into
a heinous crime.
"Touch one of them if you dare!"
I said. "I made this trash."
My little friends could not stand my
humiliation and discomfort any longer,
and between their sniffling acknowledged that they were the culprits.
We were always glad of the privilege of going to Mammy Borry, but
this time we hailed the opportunity
with peculiar delight.
they say Uncle Charles used to whip
all the children on the plantation when
he caught them in stories or mischief
or telling tales on one another."
I had often found a pleasure in observing the extreme care with which
Mammy Borry kept her pretty little
home. Simple as it was, it far
outshone in neatness and attractiveness many a grand mansion which I
have since known. The immaculate
bed with its ruffled valence and pillow
shams and unruffled smoothness of
snowy counterpane invited to sweet
repose. Curtains of white dimity
draped the windows and were drawn
back in soft folds to give free entrance
to the bars of light that the sun
threw across the bright rag carpet,
which looked always as if it were just
from the loom. The flag-bottomed
chairs held no threat of damage to the
most delicate muslin gown fresh from
the iron.
Through the clear glass doors of the
cupboard I saw the strange, many-
figured blue china which was at once
the puzzle and the delight of my
childhood. What remote and mysterious land could produce such won-
derful blue trees with branches drooping earthward under the weight of a
burden of blue leaves? A perennial
interest centered in the guileless indigo
maiden with apron brimming over
with variegated blue roses. The
astonishing poses of the deep-blue boy
filled my childish mind with bewilderment. To apply those dishes to any
of the ordinary purposes of tableware
seemed like an unwarrantable interference with the internal economy of a
far-off and unknown country.
The nest of crickets in the corner
"fer de chillun ter set 'pon" were
thrones of happiness.
High art was represented by plaster-
of-Paris figures purchased from wandering peddlers. One in particular
which delighted me was a nondescript
animal hitherto unknown to science
and very striking in its individuality.
I had studied it with greater attention
to detail than I had ever bestowed
upon any other zoological specimen.
It had never impressed me as strictly
beautiful, but there was an unfailing
fascination in its blue head and green
body, saffron-tinted tail and red paws.
In the bottom drawer of the dresser
were carefully placed our thimbles and
picture books and playthings, "g'inst
de naix' time we come," and the tin
box of cakes and beaten biscuit which
was always the reward of our behavior,
whether good or bad.
To Mammy Borry's we went to
weave our daisy love and clover luck
chains. On our little crickets we
would sit with long-threaded needles
around a big tin pan filled with apples
or pears or peaches peeled and cut into
quarters ready for us to string, the
many little black hands and the one
little white pair vieing with each other
to see which could make the neatest
and greatest number of strings by "de
time Ung' Charles come ter hang 'em
up 'g'inst de back side er de cabin fer
ter dry." I can still feel the thrill of
admiration with which we would gaze
up at the fruit-garnished walls-the
fruit of our hands.
When the nut-gathering time of au-
tum came Mammy Borry's walls were
ornamented with our long strings of
shining "chinkapins." In the snowman days, when with purpling lips
and benumbed limbs we would warm
ourselves by Mammy Borry's fire, she
would blow her breath on our tingling
fingers and cuddle them in her apron
"ter keep 'em fum stingin'," sometimes making us play "'round and
'round the mulberry bush" "ter suck-
ulate de blood, 'kaze 'twuz too cole ter
go ter de fiah 'twel we got het up
some."
She taught us to make our doll
clothes and sew carpet rags, telling us
the while her folk-lore stories. Nothi-
ing tasted so good as the sweet potatoes
and ash-cakes baked in the ashes in
Mammy Borry's fire-place; no corn
ever popped so white or even as that
which she popped.
She tried in her own subtle way to
point our little feet to the right path.
We never went in vain to her for help
or sympathy.
One day when through our disobedience we had gotten into trouble with
the overseer's children and went to her
to settle it she said:
Out came our little crickets and
down upon our knees we went, Mammy Borry herself kneeling with clasped
hands in front of her own chair.
"Now I lay me down to sleep,'
we all began.
Mammy Borry took her hands down
and looked around, saying:
Up went our little hands again and
up went our trusting voices to our
Heavenly Father, saying:
Over and over again with a few variations we prayed this prayer, peep-
ing through our fingers to see Mammy
Borry take down her hand and give
us the signal to rise. It came with,
"Lawd, we beseech Dee ter year de
prahers er dese Dy sinful chillun en
lead dar hearts inter de stre't en narer
paf. Amen!"
One rainy day on the eve of Christ-
we had run the entire scale of our
pleasures and grown weary of looking
out of the windows at the sad-eyed,
bedraggled cows with their clanking
bells that sounded like mourning
chimes through the heavy air. The
wet, disconsolate, drooping chickens
each stood on one leg as if preparing
to play "Chick-a-my crany crow";
the impatient, lonesome-eyed dog
peeped out of his tub, and the little
birds fluttered their dripping feathers,
until we were tired of ourselves and
everything we could see.
We begged
Mammy Borry to tell us again, though
we had heard it so many times before,
about the golden crowns and the
silver-haired lady and show us again
her lockets and things.
"Yer is de ring," she said, and we
each in succession tried it on all our
fingers, reluctantly giving it up. Then
she took down the little box covered
with shells and unlocked it and allowed us each in turn to try on the
other treasures. Looking at them
with caressing eyes she locked them
up and began :
The ghost of my youth with palpi-
tant wings sits this Christmas Eve in
that clean little cottage with its snow-
white bed, its tidy-covered rockers, its
unrocked cradle. It looks into the
great open fire-place where I used to
see beautiful flame-pictures of the
world's wonderful past, and of my own
deep, wide, high, triumphant, impossible future. Between it and the
glowing pictures it sees my own cradle
left empty, and the lost faces of love.
It knows that as memory muffles its
steps in the snow of my hair, all the
blossoms in the garden of life which
have been untouched by the frost are
faith and love.
"De ole man lis' en 'twel he got his bearin's stret."
YEARS ago in Virginia the greatest
day of all the year was Christmas. It
was a celebration, in fact, of all the
other feast-days, combining the horns
with the fire-crackers of Washington's
Birthday and the Fourth of July, the
Easter Monday eggs with the New
Year's egg-nogg and the goodies of
Thanksgiving. It was the holiday of
holidays, especially to the plantation
negro.
Looking back through the long vista
of years I recall the shifting scenes of
the first Christmas which impressed
itself upon my baby mind, and of all
the mystic and unexpected delights
which make up the blessings of childhood.
Christmas had dawned upon a calm
world, spirited in white. Tall and
tiny ghosts, ghosts of rosebushes and
tombstones, of trees and violets, stood
as dazzling sentinels in the unbroken
paths of this lamb's-wool earth, peacefully smiling to a perfect heaven-all
snow-capped and bejewelled with crystal fringes and anon glistening with
green trimmings beset in myriads of
sparkling diamonds; all shimmering
and shining in the wealth of downpouring, golden-glowing, sun-kissed rays.
Presently the breathing stillness is
broken. A mingled chorus of voices,
childish, mature, and aged, each, however, intoned with Christmas glee and
happy expectancy, cut through the
lines of jingling icicles, glassy twigs
and snow-clad boughs, and was under-
voiced in the shrill, jangling, yet
jocund blast of the Christmas horn
on which Uncle Charles, my grandmother's foreman, with great zeal and
strong wind sounded the Christmas
reveille to muster the hands, old and
young.
"
Uncle Charles was a conspicuous
figure and a noted character, even in
his day and negro-generation. He
looked like a priest, with his round, fat,
jovial face and sleek bald head. He had
a full set of false teeth, and while he
held a rather exaggerated admiration
of his general external appearance and
his moral beauty, it paled in the vanity
and pride which he felt in his false
teeth, worn more for ornament than
use carried conspicuously on his
watch-chain, grinning in a ghastly
manner against his inherited black
velvet vest on Sundays and holidays,
and taken out, too, whenever he ate,
drank, or talked.
He was a preacher and class leader
and the raiser of hymns in his own.
congregation, and sexton in the Methodist Church, as well as foreman-
overseer for my grandmother. Thus,
with so many offices of importance,
his people of course held him in constant awe.
His manner, except with
children, was always deliberate, dignified and peculiar. He never under
any circumstances forgot himself into
being perfectly naturally-affected, not
even when on one occasion the barn
caught on fire, and he thought it his
duty to acquaint my grandmother of
the fact. He gently tapped at her door
and said: "Skuze me, Missis, fer
wekin' you up so ontimely, but de
barn is on fiah." "Well, put it out,"
she replied with perfect security and
confidence.
On this particular Christmas morning of which I am speaking all the
plantation and house negroes, little
and big, old and young, all the dogs
(curs and thoroughbreds), the two
pet nanny-goats, the hand-fed lamb
and the vain, inquisitive pea-fowls
had assembled and were standing in
waiting before Uncle Charles had un-
puffed his fat jaws and taken the horn
from his crowded mouth.
When he had made an instantaneous but shy inventory, and seen that
all his flock were present, he took out
his red bandanna, shook out the folds,
and carefully wiped the horn inside
and out and hung it up in its place on
the porch. Then he rubbed, polished
and adjusted his spectacles, slowly took
out his teeth, and, wiping them with
the same bandanna, hitched them on to
his big brass watch-chain. He then
solemnly closed his eyes for a moment
as if in deep and silent prayer, opened
them in a startled manner as if for the
time he had been lost to the world,
and slowly raised both hands and
eased up the string behind his dwarfed
ears, which, imbedded in the little rim
of kinky wool at the base of his bald
head, was attached to the bows of his
spectacles.
Looking subduingly and reprovingly over the glasses for another mo-
ment, he said, with an ill-timed tragic
air, unfitting his non-tragic words:
My old mammy had dressed me,
chattering the while of the mysteries
of Santa Claus, of the dangers of his
many miles of travel, of the prancing
reindeer and of the good things he
had hung upon the Christmas tree.
Then my mammy took me down to
the great room known as the office,
where the Christmas tree-"the bound
holly and cedar"-stood in the middle.
of the room, a blaze of dazzling color
and light. An immense log fire burned
in the huge hearth and shed its genial
glow upon the toys and candles and
upon the dusky faces of the darkeys
who came trooping in with a low courtesy and a gleeful "Chris' mus gif'!
Chris'mus gif'!" and a blessing on
me, whom our good old Uncle Charles
had taken from my mammy and was
holding up in his arms towards the lights
and the gifts so that I could take down
a Christmas present for each one.
Then my beautiful grandmother,
with folded hands, smiling at the
happy grinning faces around her, impressively reminded them of Him who
was born that day to bless them, and
how it was all in His Name the Christmas joy and gifts were made.
They all, for their Christmas enjoyment, followed the bent of their own
inclinations-molasses and honey pulling, corn-popping and nut-cracking,
fireworks and racing, coon and rabbit hunting, the entrapped "old
molly cotton tails" set loose to be
recaught, though this time with a
chance of escape and a knowledge
of the bliss of freedom,-then the
mid-day Christmas dinner, presided
over by my black mammy and Uncle
Charles.

Later in the day gay jokes and
laughter floated across the long table
about which our own united family
were assembled. How plainly I seethe roast pig with the orange in his
mouth, "kaze pigs kin hab apples en
taters ebby day, but come a Chris'-
mus, co'se eben pigs mus' hab sump'n
extry," my mammy explained; and
the lurid flames of the plum-pudding
still burn brightly in my memory.
The night came beflooded with silver moon-rays-with every breath and
ripple of wind in Christmas leash that
the softest glee sound might not be
broken. The sand-man was on his
way. The Christmas gifts had all
been distributed-the good things
eaten the
egg-nogg had been
drunk melodies and dance-songs
and the shuffling and pattering of
dancing feet, mingled with the thrum
of the banjo, bones and fiddle, floated
from the negro quarters to the house.
Soon old mammy and her turban,
Uncle Charles and his gold-mounted
grinning teeth, the myriad of black
faces, the hand-fed lamb, the goats
and dogs, the coons and the rabbits,
the peacocks' gorgeous big-eyed tails,
and long-whiskered Santa Claus, my
dear, beautiful grandmother and the
blessed Babe in the manger, all got
mixed up and came sliding betwixt
the peeping, twinkling stars through
the window on a moon-beam into the
room-a tangle of shadows and
danced around my trundle bed.
At last, with my tender little heart full
of child-love and unwavering faith in
my kinfolks,-God and Santa Claus,-
my wee, new-born soul borne on, even
by this first Christmas influence, to
higher sentiments of love, adoration,
faith and spiritual sympathy, my
Christmas dolly clasped close in my
arms in the sweetness and strength of
that first subtle instinct, the blessed,
sacred peace of motherhood, my lips
wreathed in mysterious smiles, I
laughed-and-a-n-d-a-n-dChristmas was over.
*
Over and gone now are all my
childhood's merry Christmas days.
The tree with its beautiful burden of
gifts and brilliant lights has withered
away and died, to become a perennial
growth shining in inextinguishable
glory in memory.
Uncle Charles closed his eyes upon
the world long ago, but how often,
even now, do I feel his strong clasp
lifting me over the rough places in the
pathway of life and holding me aloft,
where I can see the lights and gifts on
the Tree of Life.
My quaint, kind old mammy rocked
me to sleep for the last time away back
in my childhood, but even yet I seem
to feel her loving arms hold me to her
bosom and chafe my tired feet.
The lovely face of my grandmother
passed away from my sight years ago,
but when has there been a moment
that it has not dwelt in the depths of
my heart?
All gone, and I stand alone and look
upward at a great white star shining
high in heaven, the brightest and most
beautiful of all the luminous globes in
the wide expanse of radiant sky.
I wonder if it is the Star that shone
over the shepherds who watched their
flocks by night. I fix my eyes upon
it with a longing that will not be denied. It seems to draw nearer and
nearer, and to shine upon me with a
tender glow. How large and softly
radiant it is. It sends down to me
long, brilliant rays, like beautiful
white hands beckoning with irresistible love.
It widens and deepens, as if to
fill all the world with light. It bends
over me with a tender pity. It grows
yet more intensely radiant and seems
to open wide and form a doorway to
heaven. The illimitable space glows
with supernal light. Through the
open doorway I see all the joys that
I have lost on earth. All the dear,
dead Christmas days of my happy
childhood, the pets and playmates of
my sweetly-remembered past, the
loved and loving faces that have gone
with me in memory through all my
life, good Uncle Charles, dear, dainty
Mammy Borry and my own kind old
mammy, and my grandmother's dear,
sweet face, lovely as in the old days,
all come to greet me on this Christmas
night. Above the portal I see in starry
letters the sweet inscription, "God is
Love!"
