"All right," said my father sadly,
and then he called them back and said:
"Do you know why I gave you
your Christmas suits and gifts this
evening? Well, it is because you are
all going to leave your old master's
home to-night. I hoped you would
come and tell me before you went.
Here is a little change for each of you;
Battus will divide it equally, and if you
ever need a home come back to this -
the one that you and your fathers'
fathers before you helped to make."
