Through the clear glass doors of the
cupboard I saw the strange, many-
figured blue china which was at once
the puzzle and the delight of my
childhood. What remote and mys-
terious land could produce such won-
derful blue trees with branches droop-
ing earthward under the weight of a
burden of blue leaves? A perennial
interest centered in the guileless indigo
maiden with apron brimming over
with variegated blue roses. The
astonishing poses of the deep-blue boy
filled my childish mind with bewilder-
ment. To apply those dishes to any
of the ordinary purposes of tableware
seemed like an unwarrantable interfer-
ence with the internal economy of a
far-off and unknown country.
