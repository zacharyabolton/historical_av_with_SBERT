WITH the passing away of the olden
r√©gime and the dawning of the new
day of business enterprise in the
Southland many beautiful things have
been lost in the dim past.
The oft-repeated phrase, "Before
the war," brings back pictures far
brighter than any which the newer
time has ever hung upon the walls of
Memory. The reminiscence of the
far-away life lingers with us like the
fragrance of the snowy magnolias.
