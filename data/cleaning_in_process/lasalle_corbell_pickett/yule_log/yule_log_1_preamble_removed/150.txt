MAMMY BOKRY
The ghost of my youth with palpi-
tant wings sits this Christmas Eve in
that clean little cottage with its snow-
white bed, its tidy-covered rockers, its
unrocked cradle. It looks into the
great open fire-place where I used to
see beautiful flame-pictures of the
world's wonderful past, and of my own
deep, wide, high, triumphant, impos-
sible future. Between it and the
glowing pictures it sees my own cradle
left empty, and the lost faces of love.
It knows that as memory muffles its
steps in the snow of my hair, all the
blossoms in the garden of life which
have been untouched by the frost are
faith and love.
