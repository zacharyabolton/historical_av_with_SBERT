A CHRISTMAS VISTA
161
that first subtle instinct, the blessed,
sacred peace of motherhood, my lips
wreathed in mysterious smiles, I
laughed-and-a-n-d-a-n-d-Christ-
mas was over.
*
Over and gone now are all my
childhood's merry Christmas days.
The tree with its beautiful burden of
gifts and brilliant lights has withered
away and died, to become a perennial
growth shining in inextinguishable
glory in memory.
Uncle Charles closed his eyes upon
the world long ago, but how often,
even now, do I feel his strong clasp
lifting me over the rough places in the
pathway of life and holding me aloft,
where I can see the lights and gifts on
the Tree of Life.
