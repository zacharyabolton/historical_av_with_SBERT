MAMMY BORRY
I had often found a pleasure in ob-
serving the extreme care with which
Mammy Borry kept her pretty little
home. Simple as it was, it far
outshone in neatness and attractive-
ness many a grand mansion which I
have since known. The immaculate
bed with its ruffled valence and pillow
shams and unruffled smoothness of
snowy counterpane invited to sweet
repose. Curtains of white dimity
draped the windows and were drawn
back in soft folds to give free entrance
to the bars of light that the sun
threw across the bright rag carpet,
which looked always as if it were just
from the loom. The flag-bottomed
chairs held no threat of damage to the
most delicate muslin gown fresh from
the iron.
