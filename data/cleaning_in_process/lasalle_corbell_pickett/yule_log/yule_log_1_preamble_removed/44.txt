DE OLE OX KYART
wife, who had borrowed and reared
twenty-seven children, had already be-
spoken little Kriss.
"I wuz a borrowed baby myse'f,"
she explained, "en I's tryin' ter pay
back de borr'in' ez well ez tryin' ter
season my heart ter de def' er my li'l'
Horner."
Later my dear grandmother, in the
old basement dining-room, standing
beside a large many-gallon bowl of
egg-nogg, a silver ladle in her pink
and white hands, filled up glass after
glass of the delicious white beverage
for one and all. Even the babies
drank egg-nogg on Christmas morn-
ing in old Virginia. All above and
around the big brick fireplace, in which
a bright log fire burned and crackled,
hung stockings and socks of all sizes
