MAMMY BORRY
tum came Mammy Borry's walls were
ornamented with our long strings of
shining "chinkapins." In the snow-
man days, when with purpling lips
and benumbed limbs we would warm
ourselves by Mammy Borry's fire, she
would blow her breath on our tingling
fingers and cuddle them in her apron
"ter keep 'em fum stingin'," some-.
times making us play "'round and
'round the mulberry bush" "ter suck-
ulate de blood, 'kaze 'twuz too cole ter
go ter de fiah 'twel we got het up
some."
She taught us to make our doll
clothes and sew carpet rags, telling us
the while her folk-lore stories. Nothi-
ing tasted so good as the sweet potatoes
and ash-cakes baked in the ashes in
Mammy Borry's fire-place; no corn
