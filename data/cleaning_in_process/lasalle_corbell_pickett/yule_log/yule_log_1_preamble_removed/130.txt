MAMMY BORRY
you don' stop dis 'soshatin' en famil-
iousness wid 'em.
"Dat'll do. Mammy ain't gwine
scol' her chillun no mo.' Set down
dar, my darlin's, 'pon yo' li'l' crickets
'twel mammy gits you some sweet
cakes en some beads ter string, en
don' drap no crumbs 'pon mammy's
flo'."
One rainy day on the eve of Christ-
we had run the entire scale of our
pleasures and grown weary of looking
out of the windows at the sad-eyed,
bedraggled cows with their clanking
bells that sounded like mourning
chimes through the heavy air. The
wet, disconsolate, drooping chickens
each stood on one leg as if preparing
to play "Chick-a-my crany crow";
the impatient, lonesome-eyed dog
