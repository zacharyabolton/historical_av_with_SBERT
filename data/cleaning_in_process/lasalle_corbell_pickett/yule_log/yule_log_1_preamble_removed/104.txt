suttinly did hab a splimmy, splammy
time, too, mekin' drams outn hit, jes?

"How perfectly dreadful!" I said.
"Why, this seems almost heathenish..
It is absolutely shocking that you
could all have had such merriment
when your friend, for whose sake the
feast was partly made, had just met so
horrible and tragic a death. Espe-
cially does it seem heartless in the
bride to have entered into such festiv-
ities when her bridegroom was a corpse
of a day. I should think she would
have folded up all her beautiful clothes
and locked them away and spent the
Christmas eve in prayer and in weep-
ing for her dead rather than laughing
and dancing and marching and sing-
ing with the living."
