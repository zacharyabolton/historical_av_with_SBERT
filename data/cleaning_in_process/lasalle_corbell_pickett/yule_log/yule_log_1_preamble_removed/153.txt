A CHRISTMAS VISTA
YEARS ago in Virginia the greatest
day of all the year was Christmas. It
was a celebration, in fact, of all the
other feast-days, combining the horns
with the fire-crackers of Washington's
Birthday and the Fourth of July, the
Easter Monday eggs with the New
Year's egg-nogg and the goodies of
Thanksgiving. It was the holiday of
holidays, especially to the plantation
negro.
