YULE LOG
The rose-vines which once trailed over
the walls of the old plantation home
yet creep through the lattice of the
heart and sparkle in the dews of life's
early morning.
When "the bells across the snow ""
ring out the holy chime of "Peace on
earth, good will to men," the heart of
the traveler turns back to the home of
his childhood where those bells first
made music in his faith-abiding soul.
Whether that never-forgotten spot be
amid the darksome pines of the North,
the flowering myrtles of the South,
beyond the towering mountains of the
West, or across the seas that must ever
roll between the wanderer and that
magic fairy-land of home, the musical
chimes ring back to the olden, happy
days.
