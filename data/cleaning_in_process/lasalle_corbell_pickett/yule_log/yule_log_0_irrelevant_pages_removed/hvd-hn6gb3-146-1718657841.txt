knowed den my mudder wuz daid. All
night long I lay dar en cried en called

en retched out my arms atter her.
"De naix mawnin' I went ter yo'
gran'ma en tole her I want ter go in
mo'nin' en axt her ef she couldn' let
me hab one er her crape weils en brack
frocks en a pyar er brack silk glubs.
She say, 'Nettie, is you los' yo' min'?'
I say 'No'm, I los' my mudder.' Den
I bu'st out cryin' en drapped down on
de cricket at her foots en tole her
ebbyt'ing, 'kazÄ™ I knowed my tellin'
our secret now didn' mek no diff'unce,

ma cried jes' lak you en me is cryin'
now, en she say, 'Nettie, you shall go
