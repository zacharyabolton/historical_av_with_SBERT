MAMMY BORRY

"Now I lay me down to sleep,'
we all began.
Mammy Borry took her hands down
and looked around, saying:
"No, chillun, no; you ain't layin'
yo'se'fs down ter sleep now, en you
ain't axin' fer no daily bread, needer,
fer you ain't hongry. W'at you wants
ter ax fer is good comp'ny, a high-
tone dispersition en a clean sperit, so
dat you won' seek bad 'soshates en
low-sperited folks. Hit all 'pen's 'pon
how you treats de bee w'edder you gits
honey or gits sting. Now, let us
pray."
Up went our little hands again and
up went our trusting voices to our
Heavenly Father, saying:
"Good Lawd, gib us chillun a high-
tone dispersition fer good.comp'ny, en
