THIS volume is affectionately dedicated
to Mrs. James Tanner, who first discovered
merit in my dialect sketches; to Mrs. J.
Sewall Reed, whose love has been over
me as I have written; to my ever
loyal friend, Elsie Pomeroy McElroy;
to Helen H. Gardener, whose pen is
always found in the fore-front of the
battle against wrong; to Margueritte
Stedman, whose home has been the inspiration of my best thought; to my lifetime friend Addie R. Haxtun, who has
strewn flowers of faith and affection along
my way; to Mary Lowe Dickinson, whose
heart is ever open to the cry of humanity,
and to Mary E. Torrence, who has given
me courage and sympathy in my work.
RELIGION and romance are the dominant sentiments of the human mind.
In the races which yet linger in the
morning twilight of evolution these elementary principles are united into the
all-powerful, tyrannical forcSuperstition. In the shadows which environ
the slowly awakening intellect lurk
phantoms more impressively real than
any figures that dance in the sunlight of
noonday. Over the cramped lives
hemmed in by near-lying mental horizons mysterious forces wield irresistible
power for good-unrelenting power for
evil.
In the world of higher thought and
more 'clearly defined action these forces
do not lose their strength nor fall into
decay. They merely exchange their
names for other titles more acceptable
to the advanced stage. Superstition
evolves into science. The phantoms of
the night become the living realities of
the new day.
The most dreaded power known in
the philosophy of the plantation negro
was the Evil Eye-precursor of hypnotism. The victim upon whom the malevolent orb cast its malign glance instantly fell a helpless prey to a diabolical will. Though personal desire might
point to a certain line of action, the
course pursued was the direct opposite.
The will was not perverted; it was only
drugged with some strong ethic poison
and rendered powerless. However it
might silently strive for the right, the
wrong was consummated.
Having once fallen under the malignant influence, it never recovered its
erect attitude. Through all remaining
life it was in chains, and there was no
hope of relief except that death might
shake the power of the Evil Eye. All
the glow died out of life as the roses
die when the frost falls suddenly on a
blossoming garden. All the radiance of
hope fades away as the light of the sun
is blotted out by the storm-cloud.
the garden rose may bloom again when
June kisses the earth with her warm
lips. No flower will ever again blossom

in the life that has been blighted by the
Evil Eye. The sun may again shower
its golden wine upon the world when
the cloud has passed. No light can ever
again dawn upon a life across which
a glance of the Evil Eye has cast its
gloom.
There was an expression in the pale
brown face of my washerwoman which
suggested this dismal fatality. It had
haunted me persistently since I first
saw her.
Her calm, serene countenance seemed the outer page of a mysterious palimpsest wherein a dark tragedy had been written. I had wondered what the story was, and wished
that I could read below the surface
writing.
For several years I had observed her
passive, aristocratic face as she came and
roon.
went "wid de cloze." I had watched,
almost with envy, the perfect repose and
grace of manner of the ignorant octo-
She had sometimes talked with
me as she lingered to do little services.
about my room with a thoughtful kindness which had won my appreciation,
but she had given me no key to any
mystery that might be recorded on that
hidden page.
I had never even heard
her surname until one morning as she
came down the long corridor some one
of the servants called her "Mrs. Roebuck."
How came you by the name of Roebuck?" I asked later on as she went
noiselessly about my room, arranging
the ornaments in her subtle, tidy fashion and wiping off every speck of dust.
"Was it an inheritance from your master, or were you always free?"
"Would you mind telling me your
history, please?" I asked-"mind telling me just a little about your life, so
that I may make of it a character sketch,
as well as a guide for others of your race?
I know intuitively that it has many a
landmark to show the way, many a lesson that will be found useful and helpful."
"This is a revelation to me, Aunt
Rowena," I said, "for while you were
quiet and grave, you seemed always so
cheerful and bright, that I imagined
your life had been a very happy one."
Some of the most renowned
men were born within its borders-
Washington, Richard Henry Lee, and
his three brothers, Thomas, Francis,
and Arthur; General Henry Lee, Monroe, and Judge Bushrod Washington,
and many others.
The birthplace of the "Father of his
Country" was only half a mile from the
junction of Pope's Creek with the Potomac River. Mr. G. W. Curtis has
placed a stone to mark the spot, bearing
the simple inscription: "Here, on the
11th of Feb. (O. S.), 1732, George
Washington was born," so this beautiful county is the "Southern cradle of
American Independence."
Among the distinguished residents of
this famous old county was the Mayo
family, descended directly from the
Campbells. The Rev. Archibald Campbell was a minister of that parish in
1754, and the preceptor of Thomas Marshall (brother of the Chief Justice), Monroe, and Madison. He was an uncle of
Thomas Campbell, the poet. His granddaughter married Robert Mayo. His
nephew married the daughter of Patrick
Henry. Thus historian, poet, orator,
and politician formed a famous family
constellation, whose names are a priceless inheritance, and by none more
proudly cherished than by their family
servants, who, like many of the slaves
in Virginia, took the name of their old
master.
Did you ever see a "real live Wes'-
mo'lan' Ferginny nigger?" It is a species fast dying out. There are but few
left. The genuine article is always an
endless and refreshing source of merriment, especially in a household where
there are little folks. Priscilla Almi-
randy Mayo was an excellent representative of her species. She was of a ginger-bread color (as she described it herself), with a flat nose, poppy eyes, big,
thick lips, with her kinky wool, or hair,
wrapped in different colored strings allover her head, and as is usual with the
native negro, she had a very pretty figure and a mellow, musical voice. It was
thus that I met her:
One Fourth of July I bought some
packages of firecrackers and a couple of
tin horns, and started off to look after
some friends who, poor innocents, had
been lured to Washington by the hope
of reward for great political sacrifices
and services during the last campaign,
trusting that thus their impoverished
condition might be improved. Their
aspirations met the fate common to expectations based upon campaign promises. After their money was all gone
death came suddenly to the disappointed
father. The poor, widowed mother was
eking out a bare support for herself and
five children by making bags for the
Agricultural Department.
I had sent to them the week before a
little gas stove, which I had been so fortunate as to receive in exchange for an
old, useless sewing-machine, and which
I knew would be a great comfort in their
crowded rooms during the summer.
The door was opened by an oldfashioned servant, who, in answer to my
question, "Is Mrs. T. at home?" said:
The neighbors called to ask if the
children were ready, and if I had not
sent Randy back to inform her mistress,
she would have continued her conversation and efforts at hospitality indefinitely.
When the children were gone, my
little friend explained to me how she
came into possession of her new servant,
thus:
"Worn out with the trials of Washington help, and longing for one of the
good old-time servants of the South, I
heard with delight that my Mammy
Dilsey had recently moved here from
Westmoreland County, and was living
not far distant. I called my little son and,
after directing him how to go, and cautioning him to be careful of his manners
(for our old mammies are very critical,
you know), I told him to say: "This is
Ralph, Mammy Dilsey, and my mamma
sent me to bring you back with me.
She sends her love to you and to daddy,
and hopes you are well. She says to ask
you in these words, are
you both 'still
in the land of the living' (an old West-
moreland salutation) 'and to say that
she is anxious to know how you are
getting along so far away from old
Westmoreland.'
"Ralph soon returned, his face beaming with smiles, and the old negress
tottering after him.
"Between long-drawn breaths she
exclaimed:
"After gratifying the dear old soul's
curiosity about all the old people of
Westmoreland, a place of deep interest,
not only for its associations, but for its
natural beauties, and sending my little
girl off to fill a basket of odds and ends
for Mammy Dilsey to take back with
her, I inquired about Uncle Harry.
This was the way my friend secured
her maid of all work, who rejoiced in
the euphonious title of Priscilla Almi-
randa Mayo. She called her "Randy,"
as abbreviated by the youngest of the
little T-s.
"She came to me on Saturday," said
my friend, "and was installed, much to
my comfort and the delight of my little
ones. She had never seen a gas stove,
and, while the range stood in the kitchen,
yet we used this little Fire-King, your
gracious Fourth of July gift. When directing her to make bread over night, I
put on the oven all ready for use. Going
to early devotions in the morning, I
stepped into the kitchen to see how
she was getting on, and was greeted
thus:
"I took a match, lighted the gas, and,
opening the oven door, put in the pan
of rolls. With eyes fairly poppping out
of her head, and an expression that beggars description, she asked:
"I am not so sure of that, Randy. Just
wait and see. Perhaps it may surprise
you and bake the rolls very nice and
brown.'
"Have a little patience,' I said, encouragingly; 'they will not be spoiled.
On the contrary, I think you will find
they will be baked so nice you will be
proud of your work.'
"Certainly, I expect it.'
"Yes; going to do all of that,' I said,
"in this little tin box with this little
blue light.'
"I went out, leaving the astonished,
bewildered maid talking to herself, and
presently I heard her singing, with birdlike notes:
"On my return from church Randy
met me at the front door, holding the
pan of rolls in her outstretched hand,
saying, in the most subdued tone:
"There's a welcome in the sky for all,
Good news, good news!
For the angels brought the tidings down,
Good news, my Lord!"
"While we enjoyed the results of that
little blue light, we could still hear her
talking to herself, and when, after breakfast, the dishes were washed and the
house had been put in order, she came
in to ask 'Ef hit wa'n't time ter mek a
fiah in de 'jitimate stobe a sottin' in de
cornder.' She opened her eyes still
wider when I said, 'No.'
"You hain't gwine ter hab dat baken-
ham fer dinner, den, is you?' she asked
eagerly, referring to an old Smithfield
ham which had been sent me from your
old home.
"Yes,' I said; and went in and showed
her how to put it on to boil.
she moaned, and silently
put the ham on to boil, and watched and
waited.
"Looking in after a while, there she
was, stooping over, with one hand on
each knee, her eyes fascinated by the
little blue light, her head rolling from
side to side, muttering, and anon singing a verse of some old song, as if to
comfort and reconcile herself.
'Suiting the action to the word, she
squeezed the supply pipe, putting out
the light. With a face full of terror,
as the odor of the gas filled the room,
she rushed to meet me, blubbering,
"I relighted the gas and reassured her,
but I am afraid I shall not be able to
keep her, for, as she says, 'she's mought'ly
pestered in her min' 'bout w'at she
spe'unce w'en she 'zamine inter en
squoze dat green t'ing, en smell dat
brimstone smell, en dat her daddy useter
say dat "a blin' hoss don't nebber fall,
w'en he foller de bit," en she's gwine
ter 'member de hoss.'
"She seems very cheerful now," I
said as I heard her singing an old
familiar plantation song:
With a sigh at the first line of the
chorus ("Gitter long down town") she
stopped short, moaning to herself:
A SERMON from the text "Us" was
preached with much influence, and is
illustrative of the methods of certain
phases of intelligence in dealing with
scriptural subjects.
In reporting this sermon I do not
wish to be regarded as sacrilegious.
Whether one approaches the Bible
merely as a poet to gain from its sublime thoughts and picturesque imagery
inspiration for higher and purer song,
or comes as a little child with a heart
full of love to learn the will of an adored
Father, no other work bears so long and
deep a study.
Opening with the creation of earth
and man, it is the starting point of
philosophy and religion, as well as of
the physical world. Whether its words
be regarded as typical, figurative, traditional, or mythical, they are the deepest
and truest we know. The thought
comes that they are too beautiful and
sacred to be recklessly given to the
ignorant, lest, translated by the light of
their pale brain, they might be hurtful.
My intention in transcribing this discourse is no more irreverent than was
that of the good brother who delivered
it, and whose earnestness of diction and
solemnity of demeanor forbade all suggestion of levity.
Rather would I dwell upon the wondrous power of that divine philosophy
which embraces within its unimaginable scope all the variant grades of
mentality. Rather would I that my
written word might open up some heart
to a new phase of the great Fatherhood
and that my influence might linger as
the memory of a rose when the flower
is gone.
"This I learned from the shadow of a tree,
That to and fro did sway the wall,—
Our shadows' selves, our influence, may fall,
Where we can never be !"
When the swords of the South were
turned into plowshares those implements
of husbandry were guided by the erstwhile gallant officers who had worn the
glittering blades of war before their
transformation. The army of the Confederacy, from general to private, was
to be found among the wheat and cotton, or patiently following, up and down
rows of corn in the sun-parched field,
the steed that once sniffed the powder
of the conflict.
Six days of the week were consumed
in such labor, and the great day of rest
found the tiller of the soil and the no
less busy keeper of the home ready fora pleasant ride to the house of some
comrade in the honorable warfare against
the hostile forces of poverty. These
meetings were held in different houses,
so that each in turn became the scene
of the Sunday hospitality.
General Rufus Ingalls, General Grant's
Quartermaster-General, had bought at
auction a convenient and roomy ambulance and sent it to Turkey Island with
his compliments, and one of these Sundays, when it was filled to its utmost
capacity with neighbor friends, we set
out for the home of our host of the day,
Colonel Haxall.
As we drove on we
accidentally lost our way, and, going
along a woodland path, we saw smoke
drifting out from the forest on one side
and heard voices singing in the distance. We followed the direction of
the sound and soon came to a little
chapel in the grove, in front of which
were some colored people.
Not far away was a brushwood fire,
whence came the smoke.
Over it,
suspended on two forks, was a huge
iron pot containing what seemed to be
a particularly savory stew. It was
tended by an old colored woman who,
with a staff in her hand, limped around
the seething cauldron, stopping to stir
the stew with a big wooden paddle and
murmur her charm:
"Good morning, auntie," said the
"How are you this beautiful
General.
day?"
"Good mawnin' ter you, Marse Jawge;
t'ank you, suh, I'm tolerble, praise de
Lawd," she said, leaning on her stick
and looking up into the General's face
with an expression of deep interest.
"You know my name? You know,
then, who I am, auntie?" said the
General.
"What have you in your big pot,
mammy, that smells so good?"
"Then you are Aunt Melissy?"
"Yes; everybody has heard of Aunt
Melissy and the wonderful potency of
her rabbit stew-how she brews into it
the most delicious flavors, and the power
to eliminate forever from all those who
are so fortunate as to partake of it all
the ills and aches that flesh is heir to."
"We shall be delighted, Auntie, to
taste your stew. Thank you very much.
Nobody ever yet refused a paddle of Aunt
Melissy's rabbit stew."
One and all of us tasted this magic.
stew and straightway felt immune from
at least one of the important ills of life,
and perhaps if our faith had been as
strong as the brewer's we should never
have been deluded by will-o'-the-wisps
or suffered the aches to which we have
since fallen victims.
"I see, Auntie, that they are holding
service in your church this morning.
Is Uncle Tim preaching?"
"Uncle Tim is a brave man to have
the courage of his convictions, and we
should all like very much to hear this
celebrated sermon if you think we would
not disturb the congregation.'
When we entered the church the discourse was about half finished. The
preacher stopped speaking and the congregation arose to show respect to us.
There were several white people in the
audience, drawn thither by the fame of
Uncle Tim's eloquence. The sable divine apparently did not share the antipathy of the cloth in general to latecomers, for he amiably asked if he should
begin again at the opening of the sermon. Being unwilling to take advan-
take of his complacence, to the possible
fatigue of both preacher and such of the
congregation as, according to Aunt
Melissy's suggestion, might be "weked
up," we signified the desire that the
discourse should proceed from the point
which it had reached. Thereupon the
good brother went on to the conclusion
of his sermon, saying at the close:
"Br'er Tim Clark," as he was commonly called by all classes and conditions of people in the district in which
he lived, was born in Henrico County,
Virginia, and was noted for his skill in
herbs, as well as for the originality of
his sermons.
He was, so far as I have
been able to learn, the first one on record to select and preach from this
strange, brief text, "Us."
The name Tim of our "Br'er Tim »
was not the usual abbreviation of the
old Greek name Timothy, as "Br'er"
Tim himself indignantly asserted on one
occasion, when the recorder of deeds of
Henrico County found it necessary to
record his full name.
'Br'er Tim's" last two names were
an inheritance from Col. George Rogers
Clark, "The Hannibal of the West,"
who not only saved Virginia's back settlements from Indian fury, but planted
her standard far beyoud the Ohio. Colonel Clark extended Virginia's western
establishments and erected fortifications,
among which was Fort Jefferson, on the
Mississippi. At great risk he captured
Rocheblave, the obnoxious governor of
Canada, who took every possible method
of exciting the Indians to hostilities.
He captured Kaskaskia and other
smaller towns, intercepting a convoy
from Canada, taking sixty prisoners and
""
fifty thousand dollars' worth of goods.
"Br'er Tim was as proud of his ancestors and of their deeds as he was of
his name, artistically notching on a juniper stick each generation, with each
event of note pertaining to it, till he had
traced his ancestry back to the first
office boy of the first loan office opened
at Williamsburg, which office was to
effect two resolutions of Congress for
the obtaining of a loan of continental
money for the use of the United States.
Another loan office was established by
the State for borrowing on the part of
the Commonwealth one million dollars,
to supersede the necessity of emitting
more paper money.
Having given you the origin of
"Br'er Tim's" Christian name and a
brief sketch of the hero for whom he
received his surname, I will herewith
give you his sermon, with his unique
and original translation of the text he
selected, and written as he delivered it
in his own musical dialect.
It is as
follows:
THE superstitions and the fascinating
tales of those golden yesterdays, silken-
woven by the tongue of fancy, when
we knew things because we believed
them, when our wisdom was our faith,
and the authenticated tragedies told as
history had, to our view, made awesome
shadows around the place they called
Sandy Bottom. Otherwise, it would
have been nothing more than a gloomy,
insignificant little valley in a mixed,
unattractive body of woods, with a
quiet-looking stream of water running
across it, where a great army of bullfrogs unceasingly called for a “jugarum," "jug-a-rum," and where, the
legend says:
The warp of this melodious jargon
woven in the clang and pang of such a
"woof of woe" was further impressed
by the words of Uncle Remus:
"For the ears wreathed low,
Like a laurel wreath on the lifted brow
Of the frog that chants of the why and how."
To my mind, the mysterious knowledge ascribed to the bull-frog was confirmed by the fact that the bed of that
murky little stream placidly crawling
across the pathway of Sandy Bottom,
over which the frog croaks his never-
ceasing sentinel croon, is the dismal
grave of many a trusting heart.
In its dread deathbed, by the side of
priests and Indians, fair-haired maidens
and dark-eyed savages, sleep the wife
and children and servants of an English
nobleman. The infant child, because
of its appealing helplessness, was saved,
while the great, strong horses and the
coach with its freight of human lives,
gold and jewels, were silently swallowed up by the treacherous quicksand.
The rescue of this little child purchased the freedom of a dark, strange
race from slavery-the race of Freni-
gike, whose restless spirit, so the legend
goes, has haunted for these hundred
years this spot of tragedy, witchcraft,
and ghosts—“Whar de mos' ongodlies'
creeturs peels dar hides ober dar haids
en gits outn dar own skins en swaps
dar 'pearunces;" where the wail of the
child, the song of the maid, the moan
of the loon, and the croon of the frog
all tangle together the tale of their woes
with the "long, limp rune" of Frenig-
ike.
The English tragedy was enacted in
the year 1789, when Sir Henry Clinton projected the plan of humbling the
pride and destroying the resources of
Virginia. He sent a powerful fleet to
Hampton Roads and landed a force
under General Mathews to advance and
perfect this object.
General Mathews took possession of
Norfolk and Portsmouth and the surrounding country, committing extensive depredations. On the expedition
Suffolk was burned. Girardeau in his
graphic description says:
"Added to the horrors of the burning
town, the heads of thousands of barrels
of tar, pitch, turpentine, and rum which
had been on lots contiguous to the
wharves were knocked out and their
contents, which flowed in a commingled
mass, catching the blaze, descended to
the river like torrents of burning lava.
As the winds blew from the wharves
with great violence these substances,
with difficulty soluble in water, rapidly
floated to the opposite shore in a splendid state of conflagration, which they
communicated to the thick and decaying herbage of an extensive marsh, the
growth of the preceding year.
"This immense sheet of fire, added
to the vast columns of undulating
flames which ascended from the burning houses in the town, the explosion
at intervals of the gunpowder in the
magazines, the consequent projection
through the air of large pieces of ignited timber which flew like meteors
to an astonishing distance, all contributed to form a collective scene of horror and sublimity and desolation such
as could not be viewed without emotions not to be described."
The family of an English nobleman
were so frightened at the ruthless de-
vastations of their own people that they
fled for safety, and were trying to make
their way to a place on the Nansemond
River called Holyday's Point, opposite
which a part of the fleet was lying in
waiting. Passing Sandy Bottom en
route, the driver stopped to water his
horses, and, turning their heads to the
right, was about to urge them further
up the stream where the water was
deeper and fresher, when a runaway
negro named Isaac sprang from the
bank, shrieking out a warning of the
terrible danger of the quicksand, and
with all his might struck the horses
with the fishing rod he had in his hands.
When both driver and mistress refused
to listen to his warnings or heed his
entreaties he dashed up to the carriage
and snatched the sleeping baby from
its nurse's lap, saying:
Before the negro's words could find
their last echo, before even the frightened child could catch sufficient breath
for a second shriek, carriage, horses,
driver, footman, maids, children, and
mistress were all sucked in and swallowed up in the dark water- a few
bubbles and ripples here and there the
only signs of its treachery. The helpless, horrified horsemen had followed so
close that the dash of their horses' feet
splashed drops simultaneously on the
screaming child and over the bubbling
water, which marked the fatal spot of
its mother's doom.
Isaac, the negro, who, as a reward
for humanity, was given his liberty and
a home, was, I am told, the first one of
his race ever set free in Virginia, and
was thereafter impressively distinguished
by the (to them) opprobrious epithet of
"Free-nigger-Isaac," which name was
soon jargoned into "Frenigike,” and
after a time, through culture and prosperity, metamorphosed into Freeling,
which is the present family name of the
descendants of "Frenigike."
The old place where Free-negro-Isaac
lived is still called "Frenigike-town,” or
"Free-nigger-town," and it was in
passing there as a child that I saw
for the first time one of the descendants of the hero of the tragedy, and I
recall to this day his peaceful tranquillity,
and the lessons of resignation and predestination taught by his untutored
mind.
I remember he looked like an overladen walking quarter kitchen-rack as
he moved slowly down the middle of
the road, keeping time and step to the
song which he sung:
I was going to Suffolk with my
father, who was always courteous and
gallant, always solicitous of and interested in his people, and always thoughtful and considerate of every one.
reined up his horse as we came in sight
and, taking out a nine-pence and a piece
of tobacco and handing both to me,
said: "You can give this to the old
man, my baby."
"The old man" stopped, and then
turned and looked around for the first
time as my father drew up to his right
and called out:
"Good morning, good morning,
Uncle Frenigike; good morning. Is
that you, old man? How are you?”
Impatient in my childish haste to be
polite, that I might present my little
gift and receive Uncle Frenigike's
thanks, I chimed in before my father
could make his reply, and said:
"How do you do, Uncle Frenigike?
Here is something for you."
The old negro looked at me for a
minute, and then, laughing heartily,
said:
"You are very welcome, old man, and
I'm glad to see you so well and happy.
We could hear you singing away down
the road as we drove along."
Some readers may not understand the
old man's mention of "Ole Bringer."
"Ole Bringer" was the "ha'nt dawg"
of which the old colored people stood
in great awe, his bark being supposed
to bring misfortune or to betoken death
or some calamity to the one who was so
unfortunate as to hear it.
"You are very plucky, old man; I
have always known that. But you seem
to be carrying quite a load—and in pain,
too, as you say. It is too bad."
"I'm very sorry, old man, to hear this,
very sorry. You were singing so merrily and seemed to be so cheerful and so
happy that I had no idea you were in
any trouble."
"It is well to be philosophical if we
can, old man, and I am glad you look
at it in that way; but your wife's death
was very sudden, was it not? I hope
she did not have the yellow fever."
"Is that so? Are you not afraid of
taking it?"
"Perhaps you are right, but I am
very sorry you have lost such a good
wife and companion, old man.'
"Why, you surprise me; I thought you
got along so well together."
"You both simply looked at things
from different standpoints, old man,"
said my father, interrupting him. "It
was merely a matter of faith, after all,
with her and with you. You were perhaps both right. Now, I must say
good-bye and be going. But, by the
way, I want to have some rails mauled,
and if you would like the job, I shall
be glad to give it to you in preference
to any one else."
"Where is your daughter?"
We said good-bye, my dear father and
I, and drove on, leaving the old man,
the descendant of the hero Free-negro-
Isaac, the first freedman, singing:
