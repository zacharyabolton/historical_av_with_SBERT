THIS volume is affectionately dedicated
to Mrs. James Tanner, who first discovered
merit in my dialect sketches; to Mrs. J.
Sewall Reed, whose love has been over
me as I have written; to my ever
loyal friend, Elsie Pomeroy McElroy;
to Helen H. Gardener, whose pen is
always found in the fore-front of the
battle against wrong; to Margueritte
Stedman, whose home has been the inspiration of my best thought; to my lifetime friend Addie R. Haxtun, who has
strewn flowers of faith and affection along
my way; to Mary Lowe Dickinson, whose
heart is ever open to the cry of humanity,
and to Mary E. Torrence, who has given
me courage and sympathy in my work.
RELIGION and romance are the dominant sentiments of the human mind.
In the races which yet linger in the
morning twilight of evolution these elementary principles are united into the
all-powerful, tyrannical forcSuperstition. In the shadows which environ
the slowly awakening intellect lurk
phantoms more impressively real than
any figures that dance in the sunlight of
noonday. Over the cramped lives
hemmed in by near-lying mental horizons mysterious forces wield irresistible
power for good-unrelenting power for
evil.
In the world of higher thought and
more 'clearly defined action these forces
do not lose their strength nor fall into
decay. They merely exchange their
names for other titles more acceptable
to the advanced stage. Superstition
evolves into science. The phantoms of
the night become the living realities of
the new day.
The most dreaded power known in
the philosophy of the plantation negro
was the Evil Eye-precursor of hypnotism. The victim upon whom the malevolent orb cast its malign glance instantly fell a helpless prey to a diabolical will. Though personal desire might
point to a certain line of action, the
course pursued was the direct opposite.
The will was not perverted; it was only
drugged with some strong ethic poison
and rendered powerless. However it
might silently strive for the right, the
wrong was consummated.
Having once fallen under the malignant influence, it never recovered its
erect attitude. Through all remaining
life it was in chains, and there was no
hope of relief except that death might
shake the power of the Evil Eye. All
the glow died out of life as the roses
die when the frost falls suddenly on a
blossoming garden. All the radiance of
hope fades away as the light of the sun
is blotted out by the storm-cloud.
the garden rose may bloom again when
June kisses the earth with her warm
lips. No flower will ever again blossom

in the life that has been blighted by the
Evil Eye. The sun may again shower
its golden wine upon the world when
the cloud has passed. No light can ever
again dawn upon a life across which
a glance of the Evil Eye has cast its
gloom.
There was an expression in the pale
brown face of my washerwoman which
suggested this dismal fatality. It had
haunted me persistently since I first
saw her.
Her calm, serene countenance seemed the outer page of a mysterious palimpsest wherein a dark tragedy had been written. I had wondered what the story was, and wished
that I could read below the surface
writing.
For several years I had observed her
passive, aristocratic face as she came and
roon.

almost with envy, the perfect repose and
grace of manner of the ignorant octo-
She had sometimes talked with
me as she lingered to do little services.
about my room with a thoughtful kindness which had won my appreciation,
but she had given me no key to any
mystery that might be recorded on that
hidden page.
I had never even heard
her surname until one morning as she
came down the long corridor some one
of the servants called her "Mrs. Roebuck."
How came you by the name of Roebuck?" I asked later on as she went
noiselessly about my room, arranging
the ornaments in her subtle, tidy fashion and wiping off every speck of dust.
"Was it an inheritance from your master, or were you always free?"
"Nar'm; 'twa'n't my Marser's name,
en 'twa'n't no 'heritance, needer; ner
needer was I bawn free, dough I wuz
sot free 'fo' my senses had hardened 'nuff
ter know w'at free wuz. Yas'ın, I wuz
sot free w'ile my li'l' haid wuz all mellow 'pon de top, but dat wuz a longtime 'fo' de wah. Roebuck," she dreamily soliloquized, "Roebuck, I reckon,
mus' a been my granny's daddy's name;
some say, howsomebber, dat 'twuz de
name er de ship, en dat my mammy's
daddy's name wuz Dunmo', en dat
Cap'en Dunmo' wuz de cap'en er de

so how is anybody gwine ter know fer

"De tale I yearn, dough, 'bout my
fambly wuz dat my mammy's granny's
young Missis, w'at wuz libin' at Occo-
quan den, went ter a party gi'n at de
Brentses. De Brentses libed at Erquier
Creek, you know. Well, my mammy's
granny's young Missis tuck my mammy's granny, who wuz her maid, 'long
wid her ter wait 'pon her, en dat same
night dat dey git ter de Brentses house,
Marse Gen'ul Dunmo'-he wuz one er
dem dar Britishers dat books en ole
folks tells 'bout, who wuz yer de same
time de Injuns wuz-well, Marse
Gin'ul Dunmo' comed up de riber, dey
said, en sot fiah ter Marse Billy Brentses'
house, en dey say he was gwine ter bu'n
de whole country up ef hit hadn' er
been fer de Prince William merlishy en
de yudder merlishys. De Prince William merlishy wuz mustered out, en so
wuz de yudder merlishys fum all de
'j'inin' counties. At de firs' gwine off
de merlishys didn' know wunner-nud-
der, but jes' ez soon ez dey wuz inter-
juced en git 'quainted good, en foun'
out dat wunner-nudder wuz de yudder,
en wa'n't Britishers, lak dey thunk dey
wuz at firs', dey stopped being' skeered
ter def; en stopped runnin' fum wun-
ner-nudder, en skaddlin' thoo de bushes;
en j'ined in tergedder en tuck a whole
passel er de Britishers pris'ners, en driv
all de yudder ones dat dey couldn' kotch
back ag'in 'boa'd er dere wessels.
"All de res' er de Britishers atter
dat-dat is, dem dat didn' pe'ish fum
de elerments (kaze de elerments comedown in torrents, dey said), en dat didn'
die wid feber-en-ager ner fum bad water,
ner wummy perwizhuns-tuck dere
th'ee bigges' boats (dey had bu'nt a lot
er dere wessels ter keep we-alls fum
habin' 'em) en cl'ared out, en went 'way
ez fas' ez de win' en de tide could kyar
'em. Some folks say dey nebber stop
'twell dey got smack 'cross de 'Lantic
Oshun.
"Dat wisit ter de Brentses 'counted
fer we-all habin' de name 'Roebuck,'
wich wuz my mammy's granny's gran'-
son's name firs', en den 'twuz his chil-
luns' name. He wuz jes' ez faderly,
too, 'bout chillun ez a ole ma-possum is.
He had eleben haid er lakly-lookin' boy
chillun, widout countin' de gal chillun
he had. His chillun en his chillun's
chillun fum dat day ter dis (men-folks'
chillun en women-folks' chillun bofe)
is all called de 'Roebuck tribe.'"
"Would you mind telling me your
history, please?" I asked-"mind telling me just a little about your life, so
that I may make of it a character sketch,
as well as a guide for others of your race?
I know intuitively that it has many a
landmark to show the way, many a lesson that will be found useful and helpful."
"My life, marm? My life? Cl'ar
up de new groun' en show all de stumps
en underbresh in de paff er life dat my
foots is trod? Put all de 'flictions en
all de worryments, en all de 'dentifi-
cations dat I's been thoo wid, down on
paper-in brack en w'ite? Write my
life out, en hab all de buzzards in de
settlement a comin' ter de gray mule's
fune'al?
Lawd, honey," she said
mournfully, rolling her head from side
to side, "dat's mo' dan I's eber done
fer myse'f.
"Yas'm, 'stead er talkin' 'bout myse'fer eben down 'lowin' ter myse'f in de soli-
chude er de brackest midnight, dat t'ings
could a possibly happened ez is happened,
I shets up my jaws tight en draws in my
mouf, lak dis, en eb'by night dat de
Lawd sends I rubs dat day out; I rubs
hit out, too, 'fo' I goes ter baid, en wid-
out sayin' hit ober by name eben ter
de Lawd in praher. I jes' bows my haid
en sez, 'Lawd, Dy will be done.' Den
I bunches de whole bizness up terged-
der, en puts hit inter de Lawd's han'sen lef's hit dar. Ef I didn' I couldn' git
ter sleep. Den ag'in, how would I be
able ter git 'long wid all dat I has ter
byar de naix day ef I had ter tote yis-
tiddy's tribulashun-burdens 'long wid
dat day's tribulashun-burdens. Nar'm,
I'd pe'ish un'neaf de load er restress ef
I did dat, so I jes' libs one day at de
time.
"W'en I gits thoo wid my yistiddys
I leabes my termorrers ter de bressed
Lawd. Co'se de empreshun er de yis-
tiddy's yoke is 'bleeged to be on yo'
heart somewhar, en leabes hits skyars
en hits smears, fer somehow er 'nudder
a praher-rubber kyan' rub de skyars out.
Skyar-writin' is lak de writin' on de
wall, only dem dat he'ped ter mek de

soul's red skyarlet blood, en sopped in
de same dish wid you, en has stuck dar
fingers in de prints er de nails in yo'
side, kin mek out de skyar writin' 'pon
yo' soul. Yudder folks may guess, but
dey don' know fer sho'."
"This is a revelation to me, Aunt
Rowena," I said, "for while you were
quiet and grave, you seemed always so
cheerful and bright, that I imagined
your life had been a very happy one."
"Well'm, ez de tom-cat said ter de
real Tommy w'en de tar'pin kotcht holt
er his tail on de yudder side er de fence en
hilt on ter hit so tight dat he couldn' git
nuttin' sep'n his haid en fo' paws on
dis yer side whar a fat mouse wuz a
nibblin' a piece er cheese, en lookin' jes'
ez tempshus ez a fat mouse kin look ter
a hongry cat, 'You kyan' jestify yo' min'
'bout nobody ner nuttin' widout you see
bofe sides.' You see, de boy, de real
Tommy, didn' know nuttin' 'tall 'bout
de tar'pin habin' de tom-cat's tail in his
mouf. De boy Tommy wuz on dis side
er de fence, en all he saw wuz de tomcat's haid ober de fence lookin' down at
de fat mouse, wid de tears a trickerlin'
down his face. De boy, de real Tommy,
couldn' see bofe sides er de fence endur-
in' de same time, en dat's de reason he
had sich a contempshus un'erstan'in' er
de tom-cat's way er doin' bizness-sot-
tin' dar, lak he wuz paddelized 'pon top
er de fence a weepin', 'stead er jumpin'
down en wukin' fer de wittles dat wuz
jes' 'kumerlatin' hitse'f ret 'fo' his eyes.
'Twuz bad 'nuff on de tom-cat, ez 'twuz,
widout habin' de real Tommy flingin'
rocks at 'im, fer de po' tom-cat couldn'
jump for'ards, en ez de case stood, he
didn' want ter jump back'ards.
"Well, w'en you has clum ez many
stiles ez I has, you'll fin' out dat ebby
fence, w'edder hit's a red fence er w'ed-
der hit's a brack fence, er w'atsomebber
kin' er fence 'tis, has got two sides ter
hit, en 'pear lak bofe pyars er Tommys
hain't nebber on de same side er de fence
at de same time. Ef dey wuz dey'd see
dat mos' ebby Tommy is got a tar'pin
cotchin' on ter en hangin' holt er him.
"Hit's proned inter me ter look happy,
marm, en I allers meks my bes' en-
deabor ter keep my dorgs at de back
gate, fer ef I's 'bleeged ter eat dirt, I
hain't gwine ter let folks tromple ober
hit 'fo' I eats hit. I's gwine ter try en
eat hit clean ef I kin. But I'll tell you
a secret, en you kin keep hit in yo' own
secret 'session, en dat is dis: I hain't
nebber seed a real, sho-nuff happy day
sence I wuz ten yeahs ole. My po'
mammy died den, en my granny
swooped down 'pon ole Marser 'fo' he
knowed hit, wid de law, en probed dat
I 'jitimately b'longed ter her, now dat
my mammy wuz daid en bur'ed, en laid
away in de 'sylum er de grabe.
"You see hit wuz lak dis: Marser sot
my mammy free de ve'y naix cote day
atter I wuz bawn, dough co'se my
mammy didn' leabe my Marser den, ef
she wuz sot free. She stayed dar wid
'im, en be his housekeeper jes' lak she
wuz all dem yudder cote days 'fo' dey
tuck outn her free papers.
"I don' disremember nuttin' 'bout
dem good ole times dat hain't nebber
gwine ter come back yer no mo' on dis
side er de grabe. I use ter be dressed
spang clean ebby day den, en I had ez
fine cloze ez any rich w'ite chillun had.
Dar wa'n't nuttin' in de sto' ner on de
plantashun too good fer ole Marser ter
git fer his li'l' yaller gal, ez he called me.
I kin rackerlack how I use ter run ebby
mawnin' en klum up on de cheer by de
sideboa'd, en watch my ole Marser mix
his peach en honey. He'd sip hit wid
his spoon-sip hit en jingle de spoon
en de glass 'g'inst one anudder 'long
'twell breffus wuz brung in; den he'd
drink de res' down wid a gulp, en smack
his lips en groan at de goodness er de
tas'e. Den he'd say, 'Yer, li'l' gal!' en
han' me de dreenin's dat wuz lef' in de
bottom er de glass fer me ter groan ober
de goodness er; en I'd groan ober hit,
too.
"I 'member jes' lak 'twuz yistiddy
how he'd mek me cut de pigeon wing
en jump Jim Crow fer de gemmens w'en
dey'd come ter see 'im, en how de dif-
funt gemmen use ter pat me on de haid
en say dat I suttinly could out-dance
creashun. I 'member how I use ter set
on de cricket by de fiah-place ebby day
'twel Marser would git thoo eatin', en
den he'd cut up my wittles on de ve'y
same plate he'd eat his'n offn, en set me
up on his own cheer w'ile I eat mine.
"One day w'en he come back fum de
sto' he fotch me some blocks wid
countin' on one side en letters on de
yudder; en I'members de pains he tuck
tryin' ter totch me my A, B, C's, en my
1, 2, 3's; but I didn' hab no un'erstainfer 'rifmetic ner book larnin', needer
one, en so atter aw'ile he gin up tryin'
ter totch me hisse'f, en w'en I wuz
gwine on eight yeahs ole he sont
'way out yondah ter Erhier, en got a
gubment fer me; but de gubment nebber
tuck no pains ter totch me, fer she
nebber laked me fum de firs', en needer
did she lak my mammy; en nobody
didn' lak her, kaze she wa'n't on de
place no time 'fo' she tried ter be we-
alls Missis, wid her prewzenprizen mouf
a 'guessin' so' en a 'guessin' so,' at
mos' ebby wud she spuck.
"Fo' long we seed, too, dat she wuz
sottin' her cap fer ole Marser, perlaber-
in' 'roun' 'im, en 'tendin' lak she want
ter he'p 'im fix up his 'counts en papers.
Dressin' herse'f up, en braidin' en plait-
in' her hyar ebby day, jes' lak she wuz
'spectin' comp'ny, er wuz gwine wiz'-
tin', 'twel bimeby she got 'bove herse'f
onti'ely. Den one day w'en ole Marser
wuz gone, she tarryfied me so wid her
a'rs, I gin her a piece er my jaw. Wid
dat she ju❜ked down de cowhide fum de
rack (de cowhide whar Marser whip de
houn's wid), en you know dat gubment
tuck en whip me! Yas'm, she whip
me-whip me jes' lak she'd been a ober-
seer all her life; en ebby lick dat she'd
streck, she'd call me outn my name,
jes' lak de oberseers does, sep'n she
didn' cuss. I wuz so mad, en so scan-
d'lized, I nebber stop ter study 'bout w'at
I wuz a doin'. I jes' up, I did, en flung
ebby las' one er my books ret in de
blazin' fiah, en called her outn her
name some, too; en mo' dan dat, I
sassed her.
"De naix day mawnin' w'en I seed
ole Marser come trottin' down de lane,
w'ile de gubment wuz dressin' en fixin'
herse'f up ter splimmy splammy wid
'im, I run ter meet 'im en open de gate,
lak I allers does; en 'fo' I tole 'im
howdy, er eben axt 'im w'at he got in
de saddle bags fer me, I pulled down
my stockin's en showed 'im de prints
er de licks whar de gubment hed meked
wid de houn'-dorgs' cowhide. Dey wuz
de onlies' licks den dat I ebber had had,
kaze ole Marser nebber 'lowed nobody
ter tetch me.
"Well, you jes' orter see my ole
Marser ra'r w'en he seed dem whelps
on my laigs. He tuck his hoss-whip
outn de carriage-shop en start ter de
house; en say, he wuz gwine ter w'ar
hit smack out on dat 'fernal Yankee
gubment. He cussed her up en down.
I hain't nebber yeard ole Marser cuss 'fo'
dat, en I dunno w'at he'd a done,
needer, ef one er de kunnexshuns fum
de Eas'e'n sho' hadn' happened ter a rid
up in de yard jes' den. He wuz one er
de high-flyer kin-folks whar Marser
wa'n't much 'quainted wid-dat is, not
sence dey wuz bofe boys tergedder.
"W'ile ole Marser wuz a stoppin' ter
be perlite ter dis yer new kunnexshun,
en show 'im his manners, en wuz axin'
'im 'bout de pedigreens er de fine bay
myar he wuz a ridin', en wuz a mekin'
inquirashuns 'bout how he lef' de res'
er de fambly, hit 'stracted his min' en
qualified 'im some, en sorter subjewed de
wuses' er his temperashun, en 'swaged
de proudness er his dignitary; but he
say, dough, all de same, dat dat 'fernal
Yankee gubment kyan' come in his
sight no mo'.
"Atter he wuz thoo at de lot, he
went 'long ter de house, en meked his
kunnexshun a julep; en den he axt 'im
won't he please 'skuze 'im fer a minit,
w'ich he did. Den he tuck me by de
han', en tuck me ter de haid er de
styars, en holler up en tole de gubment
ter pack up all her t'ings en git outn
his house-en git out blame quick at
dat. Den he went ter de back do' en
call Ung' Pomp, en tole 'im ter hitch
up de carriage en de kyart bofe, en ter
kyar dat 'fernal gubment, bag en baggage, ter de boat.
"Den he went 'long back ter de
libra'y, en onlocked his desk, en tuck
outn his lebber bag, en count 'nuff
money out fer de whole er de endurin'
time er de gubment-dat is, ef she had
a stayed 'twel de een' er de terminashun
dat she wuz begaged fer. Den he sont
me fer my mammy; en w'en my
mammy come he gin de money ter her,
en tole her ter count hit out ter de gub-
ment, en git a deceit fum her fer ebby
cent.
"Ebbybody on de whole plantashun
wuz glad 'nuff dat de gubment wuz
gwine 'way. De preacher en all Marser'skin-folks, en all de naybers besides, had
been talkin' moughty scan'lized 'bout
her bein' dar, anyhow, 'kaze, fer one
t'ing, dey didn' totch cullud folks book-
larnin' much in dem days.
"W'at did I do atter I come ter lib
wid granny?' you ax.
Ah'm! dem wuz
wilderness days, dem wuz. You know,
my ole granny had hyard me out 'fo'
she been come up ter Merrylan' atter me!
En po' me-I didn' know how ter do
nuttin' in de Lawd's worl'. I hadn'
been brung up ter do no wuk, nohow,
en I missed ole Marser so, en my
mammy. I missed de chickens, en de
ducks, en de li'l' w'ite en yaller buttah-
flies, en de hummin' birds, en de chirp-
in' birds, en de dorgs en cats, en de
bees, en de dirt-dobbers, en de green
leabes, en de flowers ebbywhar, en de
woods, en de water, de tree tops, en de
clouds, de nice fresh a'r, en de sof' win'
a blowin' thoo de lattices, en de sun a
mekin' shadders ! Oh, de Lawdy! de
Lawdy! I missed hit drea'ful, drea'ful!
I eben down missed myse'f, fer de happy
li'l' yaller gal I use ter be wuz lef be-
hime, too, 'long wid de sperits in de
grabeyard, I reckon.
"Dat firs' night w'en dey gin me my
baid cloze en tole me ter go en spraid
my pallet 'pon de flo', my heart mos'
busted wide open; but I didn' say nut-
tin', I done jes' lak dey tole me. 'Way
'long in de middle er de night, w'en
ebbyt'ing wuz quiet, en ebbybody wuz
'sleep, I crawled out fum un'neaf de
raggety blanket, en got 'pon my knees
on de foots er my pallet, en tuck outn
my beads, en wuz sayin' er my prahers,
en pres'n'y I tried ter peek outn de
crack in de winder ter see if I couldn'
see whar Gord libbed, anyhow; but
dere wa'n't no sky in sight, needer no
Heaben, ner needer no styars ter he'p
me, lak dere wuz in de country at ole
Marser's. Somehow de lonesomeness
got sich a holt 'pon me w'en I foun'
out 'bout Heaben en de styars bein' outer sight, dat I got ter snifflin' en cryin'
'fo' I knowed hit.
"T'inkin' 'bout ole Marser, en mammy, en all de yudder folks on de ole
plantashun, meked me fergit myse'f
onti'ly, en pres'n'y de w'ite ooman dat
hyard me fum my granny wuk up, en
sot up in her baid, en holler out at me,
en flung her shoe 'g'inst de do', en tole
me ter hesh up my fuss dat minit; ef I
didn', she'd gib me sump'n' ter cry
'bout.
"Dat ooman wa'n't no lady, nohow-
she wuz one er deze yer swampoodlers,
dem kin' dey called po' w'ite trash in
Marylan', en she seed I knowed hit,
too; en she say I wuz too sulky en
igno'unt fer her ter bodder wid, en dat I
wa'n't wuff my salt-en 'fo' I'd been
wid her a week she pulled my hyar en
boxed my jaws, 'bout nuttin', too; en
'kaze I didn' cry, but stood en tuck hit
widout openin' my mouf, she say I wuz
a dan'jus, 'seetful niggah, en dat she
wuz 'feared er me. Dat fer all she
knowed I mought sot de house on fiah
en bu'n hit down in de daid er night.
"De naix day atter I didn' cry 'bout
de whippin', she sont me back ter my
granny, en she say I kin cry fer myse'fall I wants ter now; en she grin up her
mouf at me, lak dis. My bein' sont
back meked granny ez mad ez fiah, en
she gin me a reg'lah larrurpin' herse'f,
but I didn' cry fer her whippin', needer.
I stuffed myse'f up wid some er ole
Marser's pride, en helt my bref, en grit
my teefs, en dat he'ped me ter hide my
inside feelin's. Granny wuked me be-
yonst my strenkf, dough, en meked hit
so hard 'pon me fum firs' ter las', dat I
wuz moughty glad w'en she got anud-
der place fer me.
"De ooman my granny hyared me ter
dis time had a heap er pashunts wid
me, en tuck a heap er pains ter l'arn me;
but she didn' mek much money herse'fen her husban' not onlyes' drunk up all
er his'n dat he meked, but de bigges'
part er her'n besides, so dat at de een'
er de six munfs time (w'ich time de po'
ooman 'greed ter plunk down ha'f er my
wagins) she had ter put granny off. At
de een'er de yeah she didn' hab it den,
so co'se granny wa'n't gwine ter stan'
dat. She tuck me 'way fum her ter
wunst, en brung soot 'g'inst de ooman's
husban', en git me anudder home.
"Dis naix place de wuk wuz diff'unt
fum de yudder two places.
I had across, teebin', sp'ilt chile ter nuss, en I
don' keer how low-sperited er how sol-
umcholly I wuz myse'f, I had ter laff,
en sing, en be funny, so ez ter 'muze de
chile en mek him laff; en no mattah
how tired I wuz, I had ter tote 'im, en
he wuz a moughty onras'les', heaby
chile, too. One day I wuz kyarin' de
po' li'l' t'ing up styars (he wuz cross,
en hongry, en sleepy, en tired, en didn'
hab no reasonment, po li'l' t'ing), he
wuz pullin' my hyar, en beatin' me in
de face lak he thunk I wuz ter blame fer
all er his bad feelin's. In tryin' ter
dodge his li'l' han's, I los' my stephold
'pon de styars, en stumpled my toe, en
fell down. Co'se I drapped de chile.
De li'l' t'ing wa'n't hu't, dough. He
wa'n't nuttin' 'tall but skeered dat
meked 'im holler lak he did; but de
ooman beat me jamby ter deff 'bout
hit, en sont me back ter my granny a
flyin'; en my granny tuck a han'at me
ag'in, too. Dis time she wo' a bunch
er hickory switches out on me, 'buzin'
me, too, endurin' de ontire beatin'. I
didn' cry w'en she whipped me, neider,
en bad ez de smartin' wuz, de 'buse hu't
me a heap wusser, 'pear lak, dan de
whippin'.
"Dat night w'ile de whip places wuz

WESTMORELAND County, the "Athens of Virginia," extended in 1653 from
the Machoactoke River to the falls of
the Pawtomake above the Nacostin
Towne. Some of the most renowned
men were born within its borders-
Washington, Richard Henry Lee, and
his three brothers, Thomas, Francis,
and Arthur; General Henry Lee, Monroe, and Judge Bushrod Washington,
and many others.
The birthplace of the "Father of his
Country" was only half a mile from the
junction of Pope's Creek with the Potomac River. Mr. G. W. Curtis has
placed a stone to mark the spot, bearing
the simple inscription: "Here, on the
11th of Feb. (O. S.), 1732, George
Washington was born," so this beautiful county is the "Southern cradle of
American Independence."
Among the distinguished residents of
this famous old county was the Mayo
family, descended directly from the
Campbells. The Rev. Archibald Campbell was a minister of that parish in
1754, and the preceptor of Thomas Marshall (brother of the Chief Justice), Monroe, and Madison. He was an uncle of
Thomas Campbell, the poet. His granddaughter married Robert Mayo. His
nephew married the daughter of Patrick
Henry. Thus historian, poet, orator,
and politician formed a famous family
constellation, whose names are a priceless inheritance, and by none more
proudly cherished than by their family
servants, who, like many of the slaves
in Virginia, took the name of their old
master.
Did you ever see a "real live Wes'-
mo'lan' Ferginny nigger?" It is a species fast dying out. There are but few
left. The genuine article is always an
endless and refreshing source of merriment, especially in a household where
there are little folks. Priscilla Almi-
randy Mayo was an excellent representative of her species. She was of a ginger-bread color (as she described it herself), with a flat nose, poppy eyes, big,
thick lips, with her kinky wool, or hair,
wrapped in different colored strings allover her head, and as is usual with the
native negro, she had a very pretty figure and a mellow, musical voice. It was
thus that I met her:
One Fourth of July I bought some
packages of firecrackers and a couple of
tin horns, and started off to look after
some friends who, poor innocents, had
been lured to Washington by the hope
of reward for great political sacrifices
and services during the last campaign,
trusting that thus their impoverished
condition might be improved. Their
aspirations met the fate common to expectations based upon campaign promises. After their money was all gone
death came suddenly to the disappointed
father. The poor, widowed mother was
eking out a bare support for herself and
five children by making bags for the
Agricultural Department.
I had sent to them the week before a
little gas stove, which I had been so fortunate as to receive in exchange for an
old, useless sewing-machine, and which
I knew would be a great comfort in their
crowded rooms during the summer.
The door was opened by an oldfashioned servant, who, in answer to my
question, "Is Mrs. T. at home?" said:
"Yas'm; she home, but she washin'
de chillun, en gittin' 'em raidy ter go
out in de woods a-pickernickin' wid
some er de nayberses en dar chilluns
whar's been berfo' en knows de way, so
you kin walk in, Marm, en tek a cheer
en set down en mek yo'se'f at home.
Miss Libbie will be thoo wid de chillun
d'reckly, en she'll be moughty glad ter
see you, I know. Will you hab a glass
er water er anyt'ing?
"Ain't I nebber seed you berfo'? You
you does.
suttinly does faber we-alls' w'ite folks
den, ef I hain't-manners en all—'deed
does. You don' know 'em, dough,
does you? My name's Perscilly Almi-
randy Mayo, but dey don' gib me my.
whole nom'nashun yer; dey jes' calls me
'Randy' fer short. I is Aun' Dilsey's
sister Judy's chile. Mebbe you mought
er knowed Aun' Dilsey? She wuz a
heap mo' beknowensome 'mongst dew'ite folks dan my mammy wuz. I's
been a libin' wid Miss Libbie dis yer
gwine on two weeks now comin' Chuze-
day, but I hain't satusfied in my mind
perzackly en I's been studyin' mought❜ly
'bout gwine back to Wes'mo'lan' ag'in
jes' ez soon ez ebber I kin. T'ings is
mo' natchul down dar in ole Wes'mo'-
lan', en you kin put some kin' er 'pen-
dunce in 'em, but in dis yer town t'ings
is so moughty curisome; 'deed dey keeps
me skeert en worrit de whole endurin'
time. Aun' Dilsey say, dough, hit's all
kaze I hain't got gumpshun 'nuff ter
satusfy my un'erstan'in', en dat I mus'
g'long en not min' 'em."
The neighbors called to ask if the
children were ready, and if I had not
sent Randy back to inform her mistress,
she would have continued her conversation and efforts at hospitality indefinitely.
When the children were gone, my
little friend explained to me how she
came into possession of her new servant,
thus:
"Worn out with the trials of Washington help, and longing for one of the
good old-time servants of the South, I
heard with delight that my Mammy
Dilsey had recently moved here from
Westmoreland County, and was living
not far distant. I called my little son and,
after directing him how to go, and cautioning him to be careful of his manners
(for our old mammies are very critical,
you know), I told him to say: "This is
Ralph, Mammy Dilsey, and my mamma
sent me to bring you back with me.
She sends her love to you and to daddy,
and hopes you are well. She says to ask
you in these words, are
you both 'still
in the land of the living' (an old West-
moreland salutation) 'and to say that
she is anxious to know how you are
getting along so far away from old
Westmoreland.'
"Ralph soon returned, his face beaming with smiles, and the old negress
tottering after him.
"Between long-drawn breaths she
exclaimed:
"Gord bress you, honey? I suttinly
is monst'ous glad ter see you, en w'en
I cotch sight er dat boy-chile er yo'n
('co'se I done clean gone en fergit 'im,
kaze old Dilsey hain't seed 'im sence he
wa'n't no bigger dan nuttin', you know)
I feeled a kinmemb'unce bubblin' up in
my heart to'ds 'im. En soon es ebber
I laid my eyes 'pon 'im, I said, "Whose
chile is you, honey? Ain't you some er
our folkses chillun?" En he say, jes'
lak his gran'ma fer all de worl', "Guess
whose chile I is, mammy. I bet you a
dollar, dough, you kyan' guess." Den
he gin me yo' message. Pres'n'y, w'ile
I wuz studyin' 'bout whose chile he wuz,
he say, "Mammy Dilsey, mamma wants
to know how is Ung' Harry?"
"Jes' ez de chile spuk out lak dat
'bout my ole Harry hit distracted de
intention er dat audacious Jemimy,
who wuz at de i'nin' boa'd i'nin' dew'ite folkses shuts, en she up en say,
"Granny, ain't dat Miss Simpkins's
chile?" "You nigger," says I, "hain't
you nebber gwine ter l'arn a grain er

"After gratifying the dear old soul's
curiosity about all the old people of
Westmoreland, a place of deep interest,
not only for its associations, but for its
natural beauties, and sending my little
girl off to fill a basket of odds and ends
for Mammy Dilsey to take back with
her, I inquired about Uncle Harry.
"Dat ole Harry, Miss Libbie?" she
asked. 'Yo' ole brack daddy? Is you

This was the way my friend secured
her maid of all work, who rejoiced in
the euphonious title of Priscilla Almi-
randa Mayo. She called her "Randy,"
as abbreviated by the youngest of the
little T-s.
"She came to me on Saturday," said
my friend, "and was installed, much to
my comfort and the delight of my little
ones. She had never seen a gas stove,
and, while the range stood in the kitchen,
yet we used this little Fire-King, your
gracious Fourth of July gift. When directing her to make bread over night, I
put on the oven all ready for use. Going
to early devotions in the morning, I
stepped into the kitchen to see how
she was getting on, and was greeted
thus:
"Miss Libbie, how in de name-er-
Gord is I gwine ter cook my breffus
widoutn any fiah, let 'lone nuttin' ter
mek one outn? Dar's de rolls done en
riz mos' ter de top er de pan en jamby
a sp'ilin', en no fiah nowhar.'
"I took a match, lighted the gas, and,
opening the oven door, put in the pan
of rolls. With eyes fairly poppping out
of her head, and an expression that beggars description, she asked:
"Lawzy! Miss Libbie, w'at is you
gwine ter do? W'at you light dat ar
li'l' blue light un'neaf dat ar w'at-you-
may-collum fer, en put my nice pan er
rolls in dat li'l' tin box fer? You sut-
tinly don' reckon dat dat is gwine ter
he'p de cause none, does you? Fer ef
you does reckon so, you is gwine ter get
fooled clean outn yo' sun-bonnet. Yas'ın,
you gwine git fooled jes' ez sho' ez you's
bawn, en dat's all's 'bout hit.'
"I am not so sure of that, Randy. Just
wait and see. Perhaps it may surprise
you and bake the rolls very nice and
brown.'
"Yas 'm; I suttinly should be s'prised
sho-nuff ef hit beked 'em 'tall, much less
beked 'em nice en brown, but endurin'de
time, Miss Libbie, dat I's waitin' en a
seein', lak you say, ter git myse'f s'prised,
dem dere nice rolls will git sp'iled en
ruint, en my wuk will all hab ter be
flung 'way.'
"Have a little patience,' I said, encouragingly; 'they will not be spoiled.
On the contrary, I think you will find
they will be baked so nice you will be
proud of your work.'
"Miss Libbie, w'at on de face er de
ye'th is dat talk you's a talkin'? Does
you mean ter say dat dem dere rolls is
gwine ter bek in dat li'l' tin box-is
gwine ter bek wid jes' dat one match en
dat li'l' blue light-is gwine ter bek
derese'fs, I mought say? Namergrashus!
Don-chu tell me nuttin' 'tall lak dat,'
she gasped. 'Fer deze yer times hain't
endurin' dem days w'en de marikles er

deformed. De time w'en de mulchude
eat so much off fibe po' teensy li'l'

""Tain't in no common reason fer dat

all is been projeckin' wid cunjer. I
b'liebe dem li'l' fishes in de Bible mus'

be a talkin' ter year yo'se'f talk. Now,
ain-chu? You sho❜ly don' aspeck no
sich a stronagin t'ing ez dat w'at you
says you does. Now, does you?'
"Certainly, I expect it.'
"W'at 'm? Cook en bek my breffus
rolls en brown 'em, too?'
Bed my breffus rolls-en brown 'em, too, wid dat one li'l' light?"
"'Yes.'
"Dat tin box, en dat one match, en
dat li'l' blue light, Miss Libbie?'
"'Yes.'
"Br'ile de beefste'k en bile de coffee?'
"'Yes.'
"Gwine ter do all dat in dis yer?'
"Yes; going to do all of that,' I said,
"in this little tin box with this little
blue light.'
"Well, ef hit does, Miss Libbie, cun-
jer is suttinly got de inturn on hit, sho',
en 'fo' I tetches hit I's gwine ter straddle de broomstick, en tipple-topple my
fingers en uncunjer myse'f de bes' I kin.
Ef you say hit's gwine ter do all dat,

wid sperits bofe, how dat one match en

en dat, too, in de broad open daytime, is

"Deze yer w'ite folks nowadays is
so curisome, en so fitified, en dey's up

""Deed, I b'liebe, ole ez I is, dat my
maminy would be so put out wid me ef
she knowed it, dat she'd be moughty apt
ter let me feel de weight er her han'.
"De missis say so, dough, en she
ought ter know, I s'poze. Maybe hit
mought cook, en bek, en fry, en do all
lak dat, but hit hain't proned inter me

De ole boy

But lis'en, lis'en, mun! lis'en! W'at's

"I went out, leaving the astonished,
bewildered maid talking to herself, and
presently I heard her singing, with birdlike notes:
*"""Dere's a bell-cow in de sky fer all,
Good news, good news!
Fer de Injuns brung de tigers down,
Good news, my Lawd!"'.
"On my return from church Randy
met me at the front door, holding the
pan of rolls in her outstretched hand,
saying, in the most subdued tone:
"""Fo' de good Lawd, Miss Libbie,
dat 'ar li'l' blue light did cook 'em atter
all-atter all-atter all. Yas'm; hit's
all jes' lak you said 'twould be, Miss
Libbie. De rolls is cooked skrumpshus,

br'iled. Breffus is raidy, de table is all
sot, en de chillun is hongry.
I hope
you'll all enjoy hit, but ez fer me, I
"There's a welcome in the sky for all,
Good news, good news!
For the angels brought the tidings down,

hain't got no ap'tite myse'f. Jes' ter
t'ink,' she moaned, 'jes' ter t'ink dat wid
all my mammy's raisin' er me ter pick
upchips en pile'em 'roun' de libe coals, enter blow 'em, too, ontwel dey'd kotch, enter tote cinders en ashes-en eben down
sif' de ashes-dat I should do de ontire
cookin' wid one match, widout no ashes,
no chips, no libe coals; widout nuttin'
'sep'n one li'l' blue light. Sweet Canaan, sweet Canaan!
"W'ite folkses hain't 'feared er cunger,
but 'deed, I ought ter knowed better dan
ter projeck wid hit. I b'liebe hit's de
debil's doin's, dis yer mekin' one match
en one li'l' blue light do all dat wuk.
But g'long, Miss Libbie, en eat yo'
breffus; hit's all gittin' cole. I dunno,
dough, mebbe hit mought er tu'nt back,
en git raw ag'in, 'long er bein' cooked
wid jes' onlyes' one match en dat li'l'
blue light.'
"While we enjoyed the results of that
little blue light, we could still hear her
talking to herself, and when, after breakfast, the dishes were washed and the
house had been put in order, she came
in to ask 'Ef hit wa'n't time ter mek a
fiah in de 'jitimate stobe a sottin' in de
cornder.' She opened her eyes still
wider when I said, 'No.'
"You hain't gwine ter hab dat baken-
ham fer dinner, den, is you?' she asked
eagerly, referring to an old Smithfield
ham which had been sent me from your
old home.
"Yes,' I said; and went in and showed
her how to put it on to boil.
"Does you aspeck ter bile dat meat
in dat li'l' tin box, Miss Libbie?' she
asked in a plaintive, resigned, despairing tone. 'Well, ef you does hit's de
beatines' t'ing I eber yearn tell on.
Cookin' a whole baken-ham wid one
match en one li'l' blue light, widout eben
any smoke. Ole-Man-Know-All didn't
die las' yeah,' she moaned, and silently
put the ham on to boil, and watched and
waited.
"Looking in after a while, there she
was, stooping over, with one hand on
each knee, her eyes fascinated by the
little blue light, her head rolling from
side to side, muttering, and anon singing a verse of some old song, as if to
comfort and reconcile herself.
"De t'ing is a b'ilin', a b'ilin' jes' lak
Miss Libbie say hit would b'ile,' she
presently whispered, in terror. 'W'ite
folks is turerble, dey is up ter setch aw-
dashusome tricks. W'at in de name er
goodness is dey gwine ter do naix, I
wonder. I'speck atter a w'ile dey'll cook
widout eben de one match. I reckon,
dough, ef de missis says hit's all asspon-
serble fer hitse'f dat a po' nigger lak me
orter b'liebe her. She 'low dat I hain't
got no 'kazhun ter be a worryin'.
"Hi, hi! W'at's dis yer green t'ing?'
she said, noticing for the first time the
rubber tube. 'Hit looks fer all de worl'
like a snek. Hit suttinly is a imerta-
shun er de 'pearunce er dat sarpunt ole
missis read' 'bout in de Good Book, dat
riggled up ter Miss Ebe w'en Marse
Adam wuz a-lookin' atter de gyardin en
a killin' tater-bugs en caterpillers offn
de fruit trees, en wumin' de cabbidges.
I wonder w'at 'twould do ef I wuz ter
mash it, er ter squeeze hit?'
'Suiting the action to the word, she
squeezed the supply pipe, putting out
the light. With a face full of terror,
as the odor of the gas filled the room,
she rushed to meet me, blubbering,
'I's gwine ter pack my chiss, en go
stret back ter Wes'mo'lan'. I b'liebed
fum de firs' dat dis wuz ole Satan's wuk
en now dat I's done smelt his brimstone
en sulphur I knows hit. En mo' dan
dat, I knowed fum de ve'y firs' dat I
didn' hab no bizness ter be projeckin'
'long no sich ongodlishness, but ef I'sfer-
gibben dis time I'll stick ter de fiah dat
bu'ns, en I'll nebber fool wid no mo'

proudness don't count w'en yo' haid is
done en laid low. Nar, suh! Dat hit
don't, en I hain't a gwine ter splunge
my po' onmottled soul inter eberlastin
torment, no fudder dan hit's splunged
a'raidy.'
"I relighted the gas and reassured her,
but I am afraid I shall not be able to
keep her, for, as she says, 'she's mought'ly
pestered in her min' 'bout w'at she
spe'unce w'en she 'zamine inter en
squoze dat green t'ing, en smell dat
brimstone smell, en dat her daddy useter
say dat "a blin' hoss don't nebber fall,
w'en he foller de bit," en she's gwine
ter 'member de hoss.'
"She seems very cheerful now," I
said as I heard her singing an old
familiar plantation song:
"De ole bee he meks de honeycomb,
De young bee he mcks de honey,
De niggers dey meks de cotten en corn,
En de w'ite folks dey gits de money.
With a sigh at the first line of the
chorus ("Gitter long down town") she
stopped short, moaning to herself:
"Dem w'at wants ter kin, but ez fer
me, I hain't gwine ter stunt hit no longer. I's gwine back ter Wes'mo'lan'.
Ef a nigger is a nigger en hain't got

A SERMON from the text "Us" was
preached with much influence, and is
illustrative of the methods of certain
phases of intelligence in dealing with
scriptural subjects.
In reporting this sermon I do not
wish to be regarded as sacrilegious.
Whether one approaches the Bible
merely as a poet to gain from its sublime thoughts and picturesque imagery
inspiration for higher and purer song,
or comes as a little child with a heart
full of love to learn the will of an adored
Father, no other work bears so long and
deep a study.
Opening with the creation of earth
and man, it is the starting point of
philosophy and religion, as well as of
the physical world. Whether its words
be regarded as typical, figurative, traditional, or mythical, they are the deepest
and truest we know. The thought
comes that they are too beautiful and
sacred to be recklessly given to the
ignorant, lest, translated by the light of
their pale brain, they might be hurtful.
My intention in transcribing this discourse is no more irreverent than was
that of the good brother who delivered
it, and whose earnestness of diction and
solemnity of demeanor forbade all suggestion of levity.
Rather would I dwell upon the wondrous power of that divine philosophy
which embraces within its unimaginable scope all the variant grades of
mentality. Rather would I that my
written word might open up some heart
to a new phase of the great Fatherhood
and that my influence might linger as
the memory of a rose when the flower
is gone.
"This I learned from the shadow of a tree,
That to and fro did sway the wall,—
Our shadows' selves, our influence, may fall,
Where we can never be !"
When the swords of the South were
turned into plowshares those implements
of husbandry were guided by the erstwhile gallant officers who had worn the
glittering blades of war before their
transformation. The army of the Confederacy, from general to private, was
to be found among the wheat and cotton, or patiently following, up and down
rows of corn in the sun-parched field,
the steed that once sniffed the powder
of the conflict.
Six days of the week were consumed
in such labor, and the great day of rest
found the tiller of the soil and the no
less busy keeper of the home ready fora pleasant ride to the house of some
comrade in the honorable warfare against
the hostile forces of poverty. These
meetings were held in different houses,
so that each in turn became the scene
of the Sunday hospitality.
General Rufus Ingalls, General Grant's
Quartermaster-General, had bought at
auction a convenient and roomy ambulance and sent it to Turkey Island with
his compliments, and one of these Sundays, when it was filled to its utmost
capacity with neighbor friends, we set
out for the home of our host of the day,
Colonel Haxall.
As we drove on we
accidentally lost our way, and, going
along a woodland path, we saw smoke
drifting out from the forest on one side
and heard voices singing in the distance. We followed the direction of
the sound and soon came to a little
chapel in the grove, in front of which
were some colored people.
Not far away was a brushwood fire,
whence came the smoke.
Over it,
suspended on two forks, was a huge
iron pot containing what seemed to be
a particularly savory stew. It was
tended by an old colored woman who,
with a staff in her hand, limped around
the seething cauldron, stopping to stir
the stew with a big wooden paddle and
murmur her charm:
"Fly,-Ebil Sperits, sin en colic;
Fly,-Br'er Rabbit's on a frolic;
Fly,-ober de park en ober de pale ;
Fly,-ober de hill en ober de dale;
Fly,-thoo de bresh en thoo de briah ;
Fly,-thoo de water en thoo de fiah ;
Fly,-thoo win' en rain en dew;
Fly,-Br'er Rabbit's in de stew.
"Good morning, auntie," said the
"How are you this beautiful
General.
day?"
"Good mawnin' ter you, Marse Jawge;
t'ank you, suh, I'm tolerble, praise de
Lawd," she said, leaning on her stick
and looking up into the General's face
with an expression of deep interest.
"You know my name? You know,
then, who I am, auntie?" said the
General.
"Co'se I knowed who you is. I
knowed you de minit you spuck.
I
knowed you wuz Marse Jawge Pickett,
de Gin'ul; en dough I nebber sot eyes
on you berfo', I knowed jes' ez soon ez
ebber I seed you dat you wuz de Kun-
nel's chile (Marse Robert's). I knowed,
'kaze you is de spittin' imige [spirit and
image] er yo' pa, en he suttinly wuz a
moughty fine man, de Kunnel wuz.”
"What have you in your big pot,
mammy, that smells so good?"
"Law, Marse Jawge, you mus' er los'
yo' smellers up dar at Gettysburg
foughtin' 'long dem Yankees, ef you
kyan' smell rabbit stew, ez smellsome ez
rabbit stew is."
"Then you are Aunt Melissy?"
"Eng-huh! 'Pear lak you knows me,
too, Marse Jawge."
"Yes; everybody has heard of Aunt
Melissy and the wonderful potency of
her rabbit stew-how she brews into it
the most delicious flavors, and the power
to eliminate forever from all those who
are so fortunate as to partake of it all
the ills and aches that flesh is heir to."
"I reckon w'at you say is de trufe,
Marse Jawge, en dis yer stew is de firs'-
fros' stew, en hit's got mo' er dem w'at's-
uz-names you jes' callt dan my stews in

"We shall be delighted, Auntie, to
taste your stew. Thank you very much.
Nobody ever yet refused a paddle of Aunt
Melissy's rabbit stew."
"Nar, suh, dey nebber done hit de
secon' time, en 'sides bein' tasty, hit sho'

keep you fum foll'in' atter wull-er-de-
wisps."
One and all of us tasted this magic.
stew and straightway felt immune from
at least one of the important ills of life,
and perhaps if our faith had been as
strong as the brewer's we should never
have been deluded by will-o'-the-wisps
or suffered the aches to which we have
since fallen victims.
"I see, Auntie, that they are holding
service in your church this morning.
Is Uncle Tim preaching?"
"Yas, suh, hit's yo' Ung' Tim preach-
in'. He's preachin' dat same sermont,
'Us-Us-Us,' dat dar's been so much fuss
en talk 'bout wid de high en de low, dew'ite en de cullud. En dey's all be-
sotch Br'er Tim ter tek anudder tex',
but Br'er Tim say he won't be besotch.
He says he knows de gorspil en he
knows w'at is ret, en he ain't gwine ter
keep back de trufe en shame de debil
fer nobody's besotchin'."
"Uncle Tim is a brave man to have
the courage of his convictions, and we
should all like very much to hear this
celebrated sermon if you think we would
not disturb the congregation.'
""
""Sturb de congregation! You
kyan' 'sturb dem niggers, Marse Jawge,
widout you weks 'em up, en yo' Ung
Tim will be moughty proud ter hab you,
'deed, he will. T'anky, suh. Imoughty
glad you lak de stew."
When we entered the church the discourse was about half finished. The
preacher stopped speaking and the congregation arose to show respect to us.
There were several white people in the
audience, drawn thither by the fame of
Uncle Tim's eloquence. The sable divine apparently did not share the antipathy of the cloth in general to latecomers, for he amiably asked if he should
begin again at the opening of the sermon. Being unwilling to take advan-
take of his complacence, to the possible
fatigue of both preacher and such of the
congregation as, according to Aunt
Melissy's suggestion, might be "weked
up," we signified the desire that the
discourse should proceed from the point
which it had reached. Thereupon the
good brother went on to the conclusion
of his sermon, saying at the close:
"I see by de shadder er de sun dat
hit's time fer you all ter be gittin' 'long
home ter feed up en cook de w'ite folks'
dinners, so I will bring my conclusions
ter dar conclusion by singin' de dox-
oligy en bein' dismissed by de grace er
our Fader in Heaben fer ebber mo’-
Amen."
"Br'er Tim Clark," as he was commonly called by all classes and conditions of people in the district in which
he lived, was born in Henrico County,
Virginia, and was noted for his skill in
herbs, as well as for the originality of
his sermons.
He was, so far as I have
been able to learn, the first one on record to select and preach from this
strange, brief text, "Us."
The name Tim of our "Br'er Tim »
was not the usual abbreviation of the
old Greek name Timothy, as "Br'er"
Tim himself indignantly asserted on one
occasion, when the recorder of deeds of
Henrico County found it necessary to
record his full name.
"Nar, suh," said "Br'er Tim"; "nar,
suh; scratch out yo' Timothy, fer dat
hain't me. Ef you's a gwine ter put
down my whole full name in writin',
put hit down ret; put down de trufe,
fer Timothy hain't me. Nar, suh; I
hain't dat kin' er Tim. My full name
is dis: 'W'at-tim'rous-souls-we-mawtals-
be Rogers Clark.' Dat's me, suh. Dat's
de name my daddy gin me w'en I wuz
bawn. 'Twuz his fab'rit chune, en I
wuz his fab'rit chile, en so dey named
me atter hit, en 'tain't no Timothy
'bout hit."
'Br'er Tim's" last two names were
an inheritance from Col. George Rogers
Clark, "The Hannibal of the West,"
who not only saved Virginia's back settlements from Indian fury, but planted
her standard far beyoud the Ohio. Colonel Clark extended Virginia's western
establishments and erected fortifications,
among which was Fort Jefferson, on the
Mississippi. At great risk he captured
Rocheblave, the obnoxious governor of
Canada, who took every possible method
of exciting the Indians to hostilities.
He captured Kaskaskia and other
smaller towns, intercepting a convoy
from Canada, taking sixty prisoners and
""
fifty thousand dollars' worth of goods.
"Br'er Tim was as proud of his ancestors and of their deeds as he was of
his name, artistically notching on a juniper stick each generation, with each
event of note pertaining to it, till he had
traced his ancestry back to the first
office boy of the first loan office opened
at Williamsburg, which office was to
effect two resolutions of Congress for
the obtaining of a loan of continental
money for the use of the United States.
Another loan office was established by
the State for borrowing on the part of
the Commonwealth one million dollars,
to supersede the necessity of emitting
more paper money.
Having given you the origin of
"Br'er Tim's" Christian name and a
brief sketch of the hero for whom he
received his surname, I will herewith
give you his sermon, with his unique
and original translation of the text he
selected, and written as he delivered it
in his own musical dialect.
It is as
follows:
"US"
"I s'lecks my tex' dis mawnin', my
brederin, fum de fif' wud er de firs' line
er de twenty-sixf verse er de firs' chapter er de book er Genesis-'Us'-'Us.'
"You year folks all de time talkin'
'bout gibin' de debil his due-gibin' de
debil his due-but does dey? Nar, my
brederin, dat dey don't. Dey don't gib
'im no dues er no kin'. Mo' dan dat,
dey not only don't gib 'im his own dues,
but dey don't gib 'im nar' speck er
creddick fer nuttin' but jes' meanness;
en w'at is mo', dey puts de blame er
ebbybody else's meanness 'pon 'im ter
byar, too, 'sides his own. Dey don't
treat de Ole Man ret. W'y, ef he wuz
a low down chicken t'ief, er a good-fer-
nuttin' runaway nigger, dey couldn'
treat 'im wid no wusser 'especk dan dey
does.
"De ve'y baddes' name, too, dat dey
kin call a pusson w'en dey's mad wid
'em, is, 'You ole brack debil, you!'
En I'd jes' lak ter know whar any er

You wouldn' hab no whar'bouts.

"My belubbed brederin, de Scripshun

Lawd meked de ye'th en de sea en all

Well, you has seed de yet'h, en you has

"Yas, yas; en I gwine ter gib you
sumpn ter tink 'bout, en dat is dat
ef de debil hadn' a run out er ter-
backer (you see hit wuz de las' er de
week), en hadn' a happened ter a come

"Ez hit wuz, my brederin, de debil

(so dey said), en wuz a gwine 'long home

rozin un'neaf his arm, en wuz jes' ez
happy ez a lark. Hit had been drizzlin'
some, en had 'gun ter sleet. De debil
wa'n't no jedge er wedder, nohow, en
firs' t'ing he knowed his foots slipt fum
un'neaf 'im, en dat tripped up de whole
er de yudder part er 'im, en meked 'im
lose de balunce. 'Fo' de Ole Man could
kotch up
wid hese'f, he, en de fiddie, en
de bow, en de rozin all fell head ober
heels tergedder in de bottomless er de
pit-kerblip!
"De debil wuz ez light on his foots
ez a cat, en he lit ret plunk on de een's
er his toes. Big en heaby ez he wuz,
en comin' down lak dat, wid all his
weight, ret on his fo'-foots, hit bruck
ebby one er his toes smack off suddent.
De ole toad-frog, who's allers hangin'
roun', waitin' fer sumpn lak dat ter
happen ter somebody, jes' jumped en
kotch de Ole Man's toes in his jaws en
swallowed 'em all down whole by de
time dey tetched de groun'. Dat, my
belubbed brederin, is de kazhun er de
toad bein' all mouf en stummuck ter dis
day. De po' debil suttinly wuz in a
moughty bad fix. Dar he wuz, wid all
his toes in de toad-frog's stummuck, en
he 'way down dar in dat deep, dark pit,
wid nuttin' but his heels (de behime
parts er his footses) fer ter stan' 'pon, en
de heels dey a bleedin', en es raw ez a
horg-haslett. Co'se heels lak dat wa'n't
no manner 'count ter 'im ter scramble,
ner klum, ner jump up wid.
"Po' Ole Man! he wuz jes' 'bleeged
ter lay ret dar whar he fell. Mos' folks
would er gone 'stracted, but de debil,
my brederin, de debil had a backbone
full er pluck, en a heap er 'durance en
f'loserfy roots growin' in him, too, en he
'termined ter mek de bes' er hit, en
not git low-sperited nohow, 'kaze he
knowed ef his spunk gin out he wuz
done fer. So he tuck his fiddle, en his
bow, en his rozin' en chuned up his
fiddle en rozined up his bow, en struck
up dat ole sweet fermilyus song, dat
we all er us knows, en played en sung
hit ober and ober ag'in :
"Oh, Miss Lucy Neal,
God bress her head en heel,
En ef I had her in my arms
How happy I should feel.'
"Now, hit suttinly tuck a heap er dis-
persishun fer anybody in de Ole Man's
fix ter be able ter sing en play lak dat
'bout happiness en bressin's.
"Well, my belubbed brederin, de po'
Ole Man, a layin' down dar widout mob-
in'; layin' ret in de sun, en in de jew
en de rain, lak he wuz 'bleeged ter
lay, en a playin' on de fiddle ter subjew
his pain en ter mek 'im fergit his rack-
erlaction-w'y, firs' t'ing he knowed
he 'gun ter tek root. He felt a itchin'
in his heels en he 'gun to scratch one
er 'em 'gainst de yudder one, en foun' data pyar er hoofs had growed out on de
een's er bofe his foots.
"Pear lak de minnit dat dem hoofs
'gun ter grow, my brederin, hit mongrel-
mated de res' er de po' Ole Man's
blood. En all his folks' blood 'mejitly
'gun ter mingulate en curdle 'twel in
no time hit had tu'nt ter mo' dan ha'f
animal blood. Bimeby, you know, a
pyar er hawns growed out 'pon de top
er his haid, en de Ole Man, he a layin'
dar a playin' de fiddle en wisserlin',
en de hawns, dey a growin'. Atter
a w'ile a long, forked tail 'gun ter grow
out on de Ole Man fum behime,-en
hit growed, en growed, en growed, de
Ole Man a playin' de fiddle en wisser-
lin' en de forked tail hit a growin'.
"Well, hit come 'long, hit did, ter de
fof er July. De Ole Man wuz layin' dar
a pattin' Juba en a playin' dat - fab'rit
chune er his 'bout Ole Joe, jump up be-
hime en befo', en de yaller gal jump up
behime Ole Joe. De Ole Man wuz a
swishin' his tail en a clappin' his hoofs
ter keep time wid de chune, w'en all
er a suddent he tuck notus dat his footses,
er hoofs, w'ichsomeber dey wuz, had
done en got well, so he put down de
fiddle en de bow 'longside 'im, en start
ter git ret up. W'en he start ter mobe
he foun' dat he wuz stuck tight inter de
ye'th, but he moughty soon wiggled his-
se'f 'roun' en loosened hisse'f up, en
klum out de bottomless pit, en w'en he
got out he didn't stop fer nuttin'. He
meked stret fer de gates ajar, but de gates
wa'n't ajar,—en mo' dan dat, his fam-
bly wa'n't gwine ter ajar de gates fer
'im, needer. No, en dar wa'n't one er
de debil's fambly, my brederin', glad ter
see 'im, ner didn' na'r one er de whole
kunnexion, fum de li'l'es' ter de big-
ges', eben down ter git up en offer de
Ole Man dar seat on de damp cloud,
ner gib 'im back his harp ter play on,
ner gib 'im a drap er milk en honey ter
moischen his parched tongue. Dey all
had 'gagements, en all er 'em 'skuzed
darse'fs ter 'im. Hit suttinly wuz
scan'lus!
"W'y, my belubbed brederin', donchu
know dey wouldn' eben let de Ole Mango back in de kitchen en warm his po
han's Co'se dar wuz a law 'g'inst
lettin' anyt'ing dat wa'n't perfick enter
inter de Kingdom er Heaben, but den
de Ole Man wuz one er de fambly. Is'poze de Ole Man nebber had no brack
inammy. Ef he had a had one, I'll
berboun' she'd a smuggled 'im in dar
somehow er nudder, en gin 'im a locus' er
two en a plate er manna ef she couldn'
done nuttin' else fer 'im.
"Hit suttinly did hu't de debil's
feelin's moughty bad fer all er his kin-
lashuns ter treat 'im lak dat. Hit not
onlyes' mos' bruck his heart, but hit
sot 'im 'g'inst de whole worl'. Po'
man, he soon went ter de bad, en tuck
ter drinkin' drams en playin' kyards.
Yas, my brederin', ebber sence dat day
de Ole Man klum out'n de pit en
meked stret fer de gates ajar-his own
home-en his own flesh en blood onwel-
comed 'im, lak dey did, en shet de do'
in his face, he's been a reg'lar ole Satan,
en been a gwine 'roun' lak a roarin'
lion, seekin' whom he may dewower.
"Oh! my brederin', we mus' not fer-
git ter do hit unter de leas' one er
deze en Debil er no Debil, Satan er
Bad Man, Ebil Sperit er not, frien❜lesser orfan', ez he is-wid his hoofs en hist
hawns en his fawked tail, wid all er his
formentities en all er his back-slidin'she hope ter mek us-'Us.'
"De Scripshun doan't spechify, my
brederin', perzackly w'ich part er we-
all de Ole Man hope ter mek, so he
mus' er had a han' in de whole bizness.
De Scripshun does say, dough, en say
hit pintedly, dat 'Us' meked you, en
meked you in 'our' imige, en hit sut-
tinly is de trufe. Hit shows fer hitse'f,
fer some er you is de ve'y libin' imige
er de Ole Man. Co'se, some er you is
meked mo' 'zackly in his imige dan
some er de yudders er you, but all er
you teks atter 'im, some way er nudder.
De lakness comes out mo' in yo'
manners, dough, dan hit does in yo'
faces.
"De faber er we-all's outside imige
ter de Ole Man's outside imige hain't ez
gre't now ez hit use'ter be in de ole
times. You see, wid de doctors a cuttin'
en a splintin' en a splicin' en a straight-
enin', en wid all de yudder kin' er
inwentions, false teefs en false noses, en
powder en paints en t'ings, dey's woted
a heap er de Ole Man's imige out er
our outside imige; but ef we wuz ter
tu'n ourse'fs wrong sides out'ards we'd
see a moughty strong lakness in our
inside imige ter bofe er de patterns dat
we wuz meked atter. Yas, my brederin',
we would see mo' er de Ole Man in us
dan we t'ink fer. I know dat de Golden
Cyalf would be dar, en dat dat ole long-
tail Sarpent (dat ole eye-opener), he'd
be dar, a skoopin' 'roun' (er she, I dis-
remembers now ef hit wuz a female
snek er not). Cherybus, wid his flam-
in' s'ode, he'd be dar. De Baby de
bull-rushes would be dar; de bu'nin'
bush; de fibe li'l' fishes; Lazarses wid
his dorgs en his so' laigs; Job's salty
ole ooman, she'd be dar, sho'; en all dat
big fambly er de Begat's, dey all would
suttinly be dar a tekin' er dar inturn
wid de imiges er de lakness-'Us-
Us.'
"You see, my brederin, de bressed
Lawd en his party had all de enfloons,
dey had ontire 'session er de whole
premuses atter de Ole Man's fall. Dey
owned Heaben en ebbyt'ing dar wuz up
dar-en you know, my brederin, hit's
all gole up dar in Heaben; no silber-
not a single piece er silber. (Dar neb-
ber wuz but thutty pieces er silber in
de whole place, en ole Judas 'Skariot
buried dem thutty pieces in de potter's
fiel', en ebby single piece er hit tuck
root, en growed, en growed, en growed,
en dat's de 'kazhun, my brederin, er all
dis trouble yer now-dat potter's fiel'
silber.)
"De houses en de streets en de styar
steps en de breas'-plates, en eben down
ter de shoes, is all meked out'n gole up
dar in Heaben. Dey owned all de banks,
en all de kanal-boats companies. Dey
owned de ontire line er packet-boats
fum Tallypoosy ter Nober Skotia. Dey
owned all de niggers, en all de plantations, en all de rich noperleys en
krupterrations.
"En de Ole Man, you see, my bred-
erin de Ole Man, he didn' own nuttin',
he wuz ez po' ez Job's ole tuckey hen
en de mef'dis' chutch-mouse bofe put
tergedder. He didn' hab nuttin' 'tall
but hisse'f-en he didn' hab de whole
er hisse'f, at dat, fer a part er 'im got
maimed in de fall; but I'll tell you, my
brederin, he had spunk en backbone,
en he had de sperit to wuk, en de han's
ter wuk wid. En a 'nur t'ing, he wan't
sleepy-haided, en needer did he hab a
lazy bone in his whole body.
"Po' ez de Ole Man wuz, en mean
ez dey said he wuz, my belubbed bred-
erin, he suttinly wuz we-all's frien', en
he suttinly hope ter mek us. You'll
fin' de Scripshun dat probes all er dis,
dat probes dat de Bad Man, er de debil,
ez some calls 'im, hope ter mek us, writ
jes' whar I tell you hit's writ, in dat
firs' chapter er de Book er Genesis, in
de twenty-sixf verse.
[And God said let us make man in
our image after our likeness, and let
him have dominion over the fish of the
sea and over the fowls of the air and
over the cattle and over every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth.—
Genesis 1:26.]
"You'll fin' de Scripshun says 'Us'
meked you en let you hab 'dominion,' en w'at hit means by lettin' you
hab 'dominion' is dis-dat dey all gin
ebbyt'ing on de ye'th, en in de a'r, en
in de water under de ye'th ter you, fer
yo'n fer ter keep en ter hab jes' ez long
ez you libed (dat is, ef you could git
holt er hit), but dat w'en you come ter
lay down en die, you couldn' kyar nut-
tin' 'tall away fum yer wid you, en dat,
my brederin, is yo' ‘dominion.'
"Saddy de sixf day wuz de ve'y firs'
time de Lawd mention anyt'ing 'bout

d'y He got 'long all ret wid de ‘Light'
dat He meked, en w'en He got thoo
He saw hit, en say hit wuz good, but
ret yer, I's a gwine ter tell you, dat dar

THE superstitions and the fascinating
tales of those golden yesterdays, silken-
woven by the tongue of fancy, when
we knew things because we believed
them, when our wisdom was our faith,
and the authenticated tragedies told as
history had, to our view, made awesome
shadows around the place they called
Sandy Bottom. Otherwise, it would
have been nothing more than a gloomy,
insignificant little valley in a mixed,
unattractive body of woods, with a
quiet-looking stream of water running
across it, where a great army of bullfrogs unceasingly called for a “jugarum," "jug-a-rum," and where, the
legend says:
"De bull-frogs jes' ez soon ez ebber

I'm right at home, my joy, my joy,
Clang the pang, Ingle-go-jang,
Ingle-go-jang, my boy-joy-boy.'
The warp of this melodious jargon
woven in the clang and pang of such a
"woof of woe" was further impressed
by the words of Uncle Remus:
"Ef folks now-a-days knowed ez
much 'boutn de bull-frog langwidge ez
dey use ter de blood-cu'dlin' tales dey
would l'arn 'bout sperits en t'ings would
be turrerble fer dar rackerlakshun, en
would mek 'em moughty lonesome uver
dark nights"-
"For the ears wreathed low,
Like a laurel wreath on the lifted brow
Of the frog that chants of the why and how."
To my mind, the mysterious knowledge ascribed to the bull-frog was confirmed by the fact that the bed of that
murky little stream placidly crawling
across the pathway of Sandy Bottom,
over which the frog croaks his never-
ceasing sentinel croon, is the dismal
grave of many a trusting heart.
In its dread deathbed, by the side of
priests and Indians, fair-haired maidens
and dark-eyed savages, sleep the wife
and children and servants of an English
nobleman. The infant child, because
of its appealing helplessness, was saved,
while the great, strong horses and the
coach with its freight of human lives,
gold and jewels, were silently swallowed up by the treacherous quicksand.
The rescue of this little child purchased the freedom of a dark, strange
race from slavery-the race of Freni-
gike, whose restless spirit, so the legend
goes, has haunted for these hundred
years this spot of tragedy, witchcraft,
and ghosts—“Whar de mos' ongodlies'
creeturs peels dar hides ober dar haids
en gits outn dar own skins en swaps
dar 'pearunces;" where the wail of the
child, the song of the maid, the moan
of the loon, and the croon of the frog
all tangle together the tale of their woes
with the "long, limp rune" of Frenig-
ike.
The English tragedy was enacted in
the year 1789, when Sir Henry Clinton projected the plan of humbling the
pride and destroying the resources of
Virginia. He sent a powerful fleet to
Hampton Roads and landed a force
under General Mathews to advance and
perfect this object.
General Mathews took possession of
Norfolk and Portsmouth and the surrounding country, committing extensive depredations. On the expedition
Suffolk was burned. Girardeau in his
graphic description says:
"Added to the horrors of the burning
town, the heads of thousands of barrels
of tar, pitch, turpentine, and rum which
had been on lots contiguous to the
wharves were knocked out and their
contents, which flowed in a commingled
mass, catching the blaze, descended to
the river like torrents of burning lava.
As the winds blew from the wharves
with great violence these substances,
with difficulty soluble in water, rapidly
floated to the opposite shore in a splendid state of conflagration, which they
communicated to the thick and decaying herbage of an extensive marsh, the
growth of the preceding year.
"This immense sheet of fire, added
to the vast columns of undulating
flames which ascended from the burning houses in the town, the explosion
at intervals of the gunpowder in the
magazines, the consequent projection
through the air of large pieces of ignited timber which flew like meteors
to an astonishing distance, all contributed to form a collective scene of horror and sublimity and desolation such
as could not be viewed without emotions not to be described."
The family of an English nobleman
were so frightened at the ruthless de-
vastations of their own people that they
fled for safety, and were trying to make
their way to a place on the Nansemond
River called Holyday's Point, opposite
which a part of the fleet was lying in
waiting. Passing Sandy Bottom en
route, the driver stopped to water his
horses, and, turning their heads to the
right, was about to urge them further
up the stream where the water was
deeper and fresher, when a runaway
negro named Isaac sprang from the
bank, shrieking out a warning of the
terrible danger of the quicksand, and
with all his might struck the horses
with the fishing rod he had in his hands.
When both driver and mistress refused
to listen to his warnings or heed his
entreaties he dashed up to the carriage
and snatched the sleeping baby from
its nurse's lap, saying:
"Dis po' chile kyan' he'p hitse'f, en
I hain't gwine ter let hit git gulched
down dat ole quick-sandy-debil's th'oat
ef you-all is so hard haided ez ter git
gulched down wid yo' stubbo❜nness."
Before the negro's words could find
their last echo, before even the frightened child could catch sufficient breath
for a second shriek, carriage, horses,
driver, footman, maids, children, and
mistress were all sucked in and swallowed up in the dark water- a few
bubbles and ripples here and there the
only signs of its treachery. The helpless, horrified horsemen had followed so
close that the dash of their horses' feet
splashed drops simultaneously on the
screaming child and over the bubbling
water, which marked the fatal spot of
its mother's doom.
Isaac, the negro, who, as a reward
for humanity, was given his liberty and
a home, was, I am told, the first one of
his race ever set free in Virginia, and
was thereafter impressively distinguished
by the (to them) opprobrious epithet of
"Free-nigger-Isaac," which name was
soon jargoned into "Frenigike,” and
after a time, through culture and prosperity, metamorphosed into Freeling,
which is the present family name of the
descendants of "Frenigike."
The old place where Free-negro-Isaac
lived is still called "Frenigike-town,” or
"Free-nigger-town," and it was in
passing there as a child that I saw
for the first time one of the descendants of the hero of the tragedy, and I
recall to this day his peaceful tranquillity,
and the lessons of resignation and predestination taught by his untutored
mind.
I remember he looked like an overladen walking quarter kitchen-rack as
he moved slowly down the middle of
the road, keeping time and step to the
song which he sung:
"Lemme tell you w'at de Lawd hab done fer
my soul,
Clim'in' up de golden styars.""
He
I was going to Suffolk with my
father, who was always courteous and
gallant, always solicitous of and interested in his people, and always thoughtful and considerate of every one.
reined up his horse as we came in sight
and, taking out a nine-pence and a piece
of tobacco and handing both to me,
said: "You can give this to the old
man, my baby."
"The old man" stopped, and then
turned and looked around for the first
time as my father drew up to his right
and called out:
"Good morning, good morning,
Uncle Frenigike; good morning. Is
that you, old man? How are you?”
"Sarvent, Marse Da'. Good mawn-
in' ter you. Yas, suh; dat's me, suh;
unless I done been los', en ef I been
los' I ain't nebber seed myse'f abbertised
yit. How is you, Marse Da', yo'se'fen how is all de fambly?"
Impatient in my childish haste to be
polite, that I might present my little
gift and receive Uncle Frenigike's
thanks, I chimed in before my father
could make his reply, and said:
"How do you do, Uncle Frenigike?
Here is something for you."
The old negro looked at me for a
minute, and then, laughing heartily,
said:
"Look yer, little Missis, w'at does
you season yo' rackerlackshun wid ter
mek hit so strong? I hain't nebber
'member ter sot my eyes 'pon you 'fo'
dis minit in all my bawn days. I'm
glad ter see you, dough, honey, all de
same; en I's moughty bleeged ter you
fer dis terbacker, yas'm; t'anky, marm.
T'anky, marm, fer bofe de terbacker en
de nine-pence, too. Somehow, 'pear
lak you don' look lak none er yo'
fambly-yo' ma ner yo' pa, ner none
er 'em. No, honey; 'deed you don't,
dat's de trufe. You is moughty purty,
dough; en, come ter look ag'in, you's

Da', 'kaze I knows you gin li'l' Missis

*Spirit and image-
"You are very welcome, old man, and
I'm glad to see you so well and happy.
We could hear you singing away down
the road as we drove along."
"Yas, suh; Marse Da', hit's de trufe.
Happy suttinly is got de inturn on dis

w'en dat yearlin'-bull er Mr. Towlin's
kotch her hawn in my lef' sides. But
all de same, Marse Da', I hain't nebber
yeard Ole Bringer bark yit."
Some readers may not understand the
old man's mention of "Ole Bringer."
"Ole Bringer" was the "ha'nt dawg"
of which the old colored people stood
in great awe, his bark being supposed
to bring misfortune or to betoken death
or some calamity to the one who was so
unfortunate as to hear it.
"You are very plucky, old man; I
have always known that. But you seem
to be carrying quite a load—and in pain,
too, as you say. It is too bad."
"Nar, suh, 'tain't too bad, en 'tain't
too much uver load, needer. Hit's jes'
my chattel 'state I's totin', dat's all; en
totin' dat don' mek my aches no wusser
dan dey would be anyhow, but den ef
hit does I kyan' he'p hit. I 'bleeged
ter do hit, kaze I's boun' ter mobe 'dis
ve'y day. I's gwine ober ter Sis Dilsey's
house ter lib atter dis, kaze you see my
ole ooman is daid en bur'ed, praise de
Lawd! She tuck ter wom'tin' day 'fo'
yistiddy twix' dust en sun-down, en
she deceasted hit yistiddy-night jes'
'bout two hours ter daybre'k, en dis
mawnin' I bur'd her po' k'ruptible de-
mains 'bout sunrise."
"I'm very sorry, old man, to hear this,
very sorry. You were singing so merrily and seemed to be so cheerful and so
happy that I had no idea you were in
any trouble."
"Look yer, Marse Da', I hain't neb-
ber said I wuz in no trouble, is I? Dis
yer is Gord's worl', en I b'longs ter
Gord, en if He puts hit inter my heart
ter be happy en ter sing I haint a gwine
ter keep my mouf shet on account er
no sich li'l' trifles ez defs en bur'els."
"It is well to be philosophical if we
can, old man, and I am glad you look
at it in that way; but your wife's death
was very sudden, was it not? I hope
she did not have the yellow fever."
"Dat wuz de ailment, suh; dat's jes'
'zackly w'at dey said she had, Marse
Da', de yaller feeber."
"Is that so? Are you not afraid of
taking it?"
"Did you-all kotch hit, Marse Da',
week 'fo' las' w'en you-all had de same
chance ter kotch hit dat I got, now?
Den, ag'in, w'at's de use er bein'
afeard?
Ef de Lawd wants me ter kotch
dat yaller feeber, I'll kotch hit, en ef
He don' want me ter kotch hit, den I
won' kotch hit-dat's all dar is 'bout
hit. En 'sides dat, I ain't a gwine ter
tek hit no quicker ef I sings. I lay,
Marse Da', you mought go 'roun' dis
yer Barrett's Neck en you'll fin' mo'
niggers en w'ite folks, too, dat's kotch
dis yer yaller-jack dat don' sing dan
dem dat does sing. Yas, suh, dat's my
spe'unce 'bout ailments en singin'."
"Perhaps you are right, but I am
very sorry you have lost such a good
wife and companion, old man.'
"Dat's kaze you didn' know dat
ooman lak I knowed her, suh."
"Why, you surprise me; I thought you
got along so well together."
"Nar, suh, you didn' know hit, kaze
I allers kivers ober my buzzard meat
wid lime, but we didn' git along terged-
der ez well ez we did apart, suh. W'y,
Marse Da', dat ooman wuz kantanker-

Marse Da', I tell you dat ooman

my lonesome se'f, skeered ter def-skeer-
ed ter stay dar wid de daid corpse, en
skeered ter go out en go thoo de woods

wuz all out en a prowlin' 'roun'. Marse
Da', I 'bleeged ter tell de trufe, dat ole
nigger er mine outniggered me, suh, up
ter de ve'y las'. Yes, suh, ter de ve'v
minit dat she tuck hit inter her bal'face

"She wuz sulky ez de debil, too, Marse
Da', en eben w'en she wuz ret well she
wuz fer ebber mo' a groanin'. She
nebber laff herse'f, en w'at's mo', she
nebber want ter see nobody else laff.
But I gwine gib de debil his due, dough,
ef I 'spozes my own nakidness, en dat
is, dat dat ooman could stan' flat-footed
en mek de bes' pies en cakes en bread
you ebber eat, en she could allers mek
de rashuns run out eben en squar'. En

her cloze wuz allers ez w'ite ez indigo,
no matter how muggy de well wuz er
how cloudy de wedder wuz. En, suh,
she wuz all de time at wuk, too, doin'
sumpn. 'Deed, I suttinly shill miss
her.
"Dar warn't nar' 'ceitful bone in my

Anudder t'ing sartin en sho', Marse

"Anudder t'ing-she'd a gone wid

"You both simply looked at things
from different standpoints, old man,"
said my father, interrupting him. "It
was merely a matter of faith, after all,
with her and with you. You were perhaps both right. Now, I must say
good-bye and be going. But, by the
way, I want to have some rails mauled,
and if you would like the job, I shall
be glad to give it to you in preference
to any one else."
"Me, Marse Da'? I don' want ter

Nar, suh, ef I ebber hu't myse'f wid

"Where is your daughter?"
"I speck she en de cows is got ter Sandy Bottom 'fore dis."

We said good-bye, my dear father and
I, and drove on, leaving the old man,
the descendant of the hero Free-negro-
Isaac, the first freedman, singing:
"De raccoon he's a cur'ous man,
He nebber walk 'twel dark;
En nuttin' nebber 'sturbs his min'
'Twel he years Ole Bringer bark.”
