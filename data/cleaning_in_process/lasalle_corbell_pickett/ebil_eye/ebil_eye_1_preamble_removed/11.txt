DEDICATION
THIS volume is affectionately dedicated
to Mrs. James Tanner, who first discovered
merit in my dialect sketches; to Mrs. J.
Sewall Reed, whose love has been over
me as I have written; to my ever
loyal friend, Elsie Pomeroy McElroy;
to Helen H. Gardener, whose pen is
always found in the fore-front of the
battle against wrong; to Margueritte
Stedman, whose home has been the in-
spiration of my best thought; to my life-
time friend Addie R. Haxtun, who has
strewn flowers of faith and affection along
my way; to Mary Lowe Dickinson, whose
heart is ever open to the cry of humanity,
and to Mary E. Torrence, who has given
me courage and sympathy in my work.
