US
A SERMON from the text "Us" was
preached with much influence, and is
illustrative of the methods of certain
phases of intelligence in dealing with
scriptural subjects.
In reporting this sermon I do not
wish to be regarded as sacrilegious.
Whether one approaches the Bible
merely as a poet to gain from its sub-
lime thoughts and picturesque imagery
inspiration for higher and purer song,
or comes as a little child with a heart
full of love to learn the will of an adored
Father, no other work bears so long and
deep a study.
