not far distant. I called my little son and,
after directing him how to go, and cau-
tioning him to be careful of his manners
(for our old mammies are very critical,
you know), I told him to say: "This is
Ralph, Mammy Dilsey, and my mamma
sent me to bring you back with me.
She sends her love to you and to daddy,
and hopes you are well. She says to ask
you in these words, are
you both 'still
in the land of the living' (an old West-
moreland salutation) 'and to say that
she is anxious to know how you are
getting along so far away from old
Westmoreland.'
"Ralph soon returned, his face beam-
ing with smiles, and the old negress
tottering after him.
