hit's sump'n dat's entended. I hain't got
nobody ter blame fer hit all, needer, but
my own se'f. I suttinly has tried ter
mek de bes' I could er hit all, too.
Some folks says 'hit's better ter hab
graby dan no grease 'tall,' en mebbe 'tis ;
but, ez fer me, I hain't had no grease,
en moughty li'l' graby in dis life. I's
been Moses' en Moses' chilluns' cook
en waitin' maid ebber sence dat damp,
rainy day, nigh onto forty yeahs ago
now, w'en he driv me thoo de woods,
back ag'in inter ole Merrylan'. Hit
didn' rain ret out, dough; de heaby
wet jes' sifted down, sifted down, way
un'neaf de dun-colored sky; en needer
de clouds ner needer de sky 'pear lak
dey budged wid drizzle. Seem lak I
hain't nebber see no raw day lak dat,
needer 'fo' den ner needer sence den.
