I hear that I can send my Letter in the morning and I will add a few lines. You must direct one at Swope's Depot Augusta Co., Va. as we have orders to move tomorrow to that neighborhood. I suppose we remain there for some time. Could you see any chance to send out a Letter direct as follows: D.C.S., Qt. M. Dept. 11th Reg. Va. Cav'ly, Rosser's Brigade, near Swope's Depot, Augusta Co., Va. I wish our move was in the direction of home rather than another direction. I fear I shall not hear often from home. You must write me on all occasions. Do all you can to find opportunities to forward. I have been made very sick tonight. I am not sick or dangerously so - will explain when I see you. Jimmy can give you an idea of the cause if you see him for he frequently is called upon to undergo such a dose as I have had tonight. I only wish he had been here tonight to enjoy the sickness and swallow the dose I had to take tonight. I shall put in for a Furlough as soon as I see a chance to get it. Has Mrs. [unclear: Nunn] been to see you? I shall call and see her as I go through Harrisonburg. It will take us 3 days to go to camp. We will camp 12 miles west of Staunton at Swope's Depot.
