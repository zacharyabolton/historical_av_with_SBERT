Having heard with surprise that complaints have been made against Mr F S. Tukey Ast Supt of Freedmen's Bureau of this place therefore this is to certify that I am a Union man and was a refugee from here during the war and went to Washington D.C. and was in the service of the U.S. Government Q. M. Dept during nearly the whole of the war. I came back here soon after the surrender and opened a Livery Stable which I kept for awhile and then changed my location and bought out a colored man who had been in the same business here for many years and then hired him to remain with me his extensive acquaintance among the colored people naturally brought many of them around the Stable and gave me a free opportunity to mingle with them in conversation. I often heard many of them speak in the highest terms of Mr Tukey and so far as I recollect never heard one of them say anything against him and I know that his course here during his former period of service was entirely satisfactory to the Union men and Freedmen and also forced the Rebels to respect him. During a portion of the time  Lieut Cook was here he boarded a Government horse in my Stable, which Horse he traded off with another man after he was relieved he came to me in a state of excitement and said some hard things against Mr Tukey among others he said that Mr Tukey had undermined him and lied about him and had reported him to Hd Quarters and swore he would have satisfaction and said he meant to come back here again and from all that I have heard since I am satisfied that the comaplaints against Mr Tukey have been made in a spirit of malice and revenge.
