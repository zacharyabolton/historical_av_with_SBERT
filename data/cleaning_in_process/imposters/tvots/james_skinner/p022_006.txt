I enclose the [unclear: Memorial] of Mrs. Clara W. Skinner and the instructions thereon of Major Gen'l Howard. I doubt not you will find pleasure in issuing your orders in conformity therewith for the restoration to Mrs Skinner of her house & lot in Norfolk City. I will authorize some friend of hers in Norfolk to call at the office of the Freedmen's Bureau in that city and [unclear: take] possession for her.
