As John Beard starts back this morning to join your company I will endeavor to write a few lines to you. We are all in our usual health We have had a great deal of anxiety about you for the last eight or ten days past It is about three weeks since the last letter we got was written June 23 I thought you were certainly Sick. We tried to find out but you were not named in any of the letters that came into this neighbourhood And it was not till day befour yesterday that we heard you had the measles, and then through letters written to persons four or five miles distant. I want to send you a piece of Cheese and a few cakes if John can take them. We will also send you three dollars Gold and silver And now I will say in conclusion if you wish to come home and your friends think you ought to come Mr Steele has gone down and I think will take charge of bringing you home if you want to come. If you do not come I want you to send a particular acount of your case and situation. And now I will close hoping and praying that your health and strength may be restored and that you may use it in Gods service
