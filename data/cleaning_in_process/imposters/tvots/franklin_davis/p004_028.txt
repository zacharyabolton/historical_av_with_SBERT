Your note of August 30 th  is before me & as you request I will not send the trees ordered. In regard to a Nursery man to work your grounds I may say that it would afford me pleasure to recommend a competent man to you were any such within my knowledge, that could be had I sometimes see persons advertising in our Horticultural journals for situations but so many of them are not much having, that I should be very careful about employing unless I was personally acquainted with them or the could produce very good reference. there is no doubt but a nursery on a small scale would pay well in your vacinity & would probably be the best desposition you could make or you could let it out to a competent person to work for a share & if I hear of any one that I think will suit you I will let you know. I am or will shortly be in want of a Foreman as the one I have is going to attend to a place that I have purchased on James River below Richmond we are going into fruit raising there on a pretty large scale for the Northern Cities. I look upon it as the best paying business that a man can embark in at present. I shall be pleased to see you when you come to Staunton -- this fall.
