This will inform you that we are all well at present I hope that you are enjoying good health, at this time we started your Box weighing two hundred & 30 lb, on the Day that I promised you by, & in the care of Mr. [unclear: Snyder] & Mr. [unclear: McCamry]. They were going to the Army: your pa saw Mr. Snyder on Tuesday afterwards & he said he delivered it to you on Saturday Night & saw you but I did not know whether it was so or not as I waited all last week for a letter from you & have gotten none yet, but as tomorrow is Mail Day I look for a Letter & hope I will not be disappointed, if so I will write on if I get one I will write to you again, I hope that you have been enjoying the Contents of the box that I so carefully packed up for you. Your pa has been to see your grand Ma [unclear: Doke] & has just returned, he saw Charles they were all well Charles thought he would go back this week but I do not think he is fit for the Army yet. I am getting you a flannel shirt knit, but so not know how soon I will get it done. I hope you are not suffering yet for it Let me know how the shirt that I sent you answered, & how you were pleased with the socks. I will send your new shirt when I get it knit. We have had three snows & bitter cold weather for three weeks. if its as cold there as it is here I fear some of the poor soldiers would freeze I think of you at night when I lay down to sleep the weather has moderated here now & it will keep so for a while. Johnny you must excuse this short note if I get a Letter from you tomorrow I will write soon again. Your Pa has not been well for a Month is hardly able to so any thing your pa & all the Children send their love to you & receive the same from your Mother
