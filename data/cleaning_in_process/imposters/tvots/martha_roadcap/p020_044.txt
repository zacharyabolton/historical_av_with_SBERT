It is with a troubled mind I now seat myself to pen you few lines horrible thought that we are likely to be overrun by the vandal foe what a sad trial to our brave men who have fought so vigorously for nearly four years now to think that all is to be lost but yet I can hardly give up to it nothing but distress prevails now throughout our land hearts are breaking to know the fate of loved friends what has been the fate of your neighborhood boys who are safe & who are lost where is your dear brother I hope he is safe I have not heard a word from my Charlie since you wrote until a few days ago I heard through a letter from one of our neighborhood boys who saw him before the fight he was well at that time but should he happen to get home as you will be sure to see him before I will you must press him to come to see me immediately be sure and find him - I received a letter this week from Mr. Heist it was written from Staunton concerning Johnnies death he has not been home since the sad occurrence but saw a lady who succeeded in obtaining a passport from General Sheridan to pass his lines he was mortally wounded a short distance from the town the ball penetrating his head just back of his ear he requested his friends to have him removed to the Heists house which was accordingly done but before they  his house with him he expired & was interred in his lot in the Winchester cemetery he thinks the death of Johnnie's death has been productive of a change of heart in his son in whom he counciled a reform which his death has caused him to remember & also to practice for which he seems to be very thoughtful indeed - he says his daughter will write to me the full particulars as soon as the way is open I will keep the letters for Charlies perusal you will have to excuse this short letter this time as I feel so unfit for writing but will try and write again when I become more composed give my love to all the family & write to me soon Allie sends love to you
