I have received last week two letters from Harpers Ferry giving me the cheering news of your continued health. I have written to John last week, I sent it to Staunton to be sent from there to H.F. by Gen. Harman. I do not know whether you received that letter; if not I wish you would enquire of your principal Officers for it - or if you see Genl H ask him for it. There is no news of interest about Goshen - the War and incidents connected thereto is the all absorbing topic. There are several volunteer Companies now drilling in the County, awaiting orders to march, making an agregate of Several Hundred beside what has gone. Old Rockbridge is thoroughly aroused and prepared to contribute a full share in resisting the Military Despotism now operating at Washington. We are all well here at home and our hearts as well as your friends about here beat with anxiety for you, praying  you may escape unharmed from your Campaign. I want you to write to me as often as possible giving me some account of your Camp Life, how you fare, in Eating, Sleeping & Lodging, anything connected with your situation will be received & read with pleasure. I also wish you to give me a direction how to address my letters so you may get them and I will write to you as often as I can. Tell Charles to write also, and then I will be kept advised of events as they occur. Sallie B. wrote to you did you get her letter write soon & often and the prayers of your Mother & friends will continually rise in your behalf. Abraham send his love to you and the children also desire to be remembered to you both tell Charles I am extremely anxious to hear from him and want him to write to me immediately. The weather is cool & windy more like the month of March than May. Crops look well with a prospect of abundant harvest, farmers are planting Corn in great abundance together with other things that we hope will give plenty to all. Write soon. And a Mother's love & prayers attend you.
