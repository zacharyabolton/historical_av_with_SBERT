I rec your favor of the 11th [unclear: inst] & now seat myself to answer first let me offer an apology for my long delay I was prevented from writing sooner by sickness in my family the children have had the diptheria James Samuel has been quite poorly for better than a week indeed his recovery was thought very doubtful but is now improving & two of our neighbors children have died with it & I had to be in attendance there so you see I have not had much time for writing. I got Johnnie one shirt knit & it took twelve cuts to knit it & it waid but half a pound when it was done so you may know what I think of it when you only took three for yours. I was sorry indeed to hear of your Grandmother's death give my love to your Mother & the girls I wish you still to write to me when you hear from Charlie tell your Pa the leather which I spoke of for him Mr. Roadcap has never come across any suitable for a collar as he is busy working for the government - we had a great fire in our neighborhood Mrs Sloans house caught fire on Sunday week & from it Mrs. Bears house caught & some other buildings thereby consuming some ten buildings, the fire originated from the black woman making on too great a fire a sad disaster indeed you will have to excuse this short letter as some company has come in & I will have to close by desiring you to write very soon & often I remain
