I regret to say that on my return home I find that the Ledger of P Brady & Co. Bankers has been taken from my Office, by some interested person, I can only suspect DCEB, As he is the only party who could wish to have it out of the way. I left it in a large trunk with at least thirty other books, and that is the only one that has been taken. The Cash Book was left with the others My office is in a large building with many others under the care of a Janitor whose business it is to open the same in the morning, to dust & clean it. I suspect him and have placed the Matter in the hands of the detective of Police. I hope to find some Clue to taking of the Book. I beg you will take great care of the papers in Your hands particularly the deed & the [unclear: ajc] in pencil taken from the Ledger, which I can prove by the Gentn. who took the Same, any thing from Mr. Davidson since I left What is your opinion of the abduction of the Ledger and what this would to Me with the Court in case I Cannot produce it. Waiting your favor.
