I have Yours of the 21. to hand this morning. I wrote you the same day in reference to the abduction of my Ledger, to which I refer you. It is difficult for me to say what Sum I would be willing to accept in Settlement of my claim against Brady, taking all the Circumstances in the Case into account I beg you will try and get the best offer possible when I will advise You at once whether I will accept it or not. I have no desire to expose him in Case I can get a great settlement from him.
