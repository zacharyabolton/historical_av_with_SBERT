It gives me great satisfaction to reccommend the enclosed petition for aid. I have known Benjn Fraser Col'd for some time, he is Crippled, and has a large family depending on him for support, he is a sober industrious man but owing to his condition, his labor is not sufficient to clothe his family and I know them to be in a suffering condition. If you have any power to help any, I know him to be entitled to some aid, and hope you will give it your early attension, he has four small Children, I hope you will pardon the Liberty I have taken in addressing you.
