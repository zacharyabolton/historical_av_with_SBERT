Though suffering this incarceration within the prison - walls of Pt. Lookout - thoug banished from [unclear: friends] and the society of much loved ones, I rejoice to feel the assureance that God is with us, and, we hope, will turn back our captivity when we are sufficiently humbled - that we may meet once more the kind - the sweet embraces of our dear relatives, and friends.

But may be, you would ask Why is it that I appear as willing to continue the correspondence which has been so soon, and unexpectedly, cut short? I would answer now, the same that I would have answered on that ever memorable morning, that it is as motive no less, than a desire to cultivate the friendly relations do not say, "there is none [unclear: ]] in existence between us. With your sanction our correspondence (though it will be rather slow) will continue. I am pained when I think of my uncivil conduct, when in your presence that morning, and also, those complicated mysteries that I had boldness to write [unclear: since] at the expence of one so truely innocent - Let me ask you to forgive me, and not only to destroy these letters, but even tho recollection of them for ever. I can write no more now. I will send you a stamp all I have. Brown landed here a few days ago & we both have slight colds, with that exception we are  well  In form my mother that I have heard from Danville and Mr. Kelso - they are well Their school is still going  Their children (two daughters) are well also.
