 It has been a long time since I had the pleasure of writing you, but I hope you still think enough of me to answer my short note & if the Lord's willing I will write you a long letter when I hear from you. how is Cousin Sam & Annie oh I forgot they had a boy how is he, how I could enjoy myself if I were with you all as I once was but that is past forever until we meet in a better world. if you see any of your Uncle [unclear: Adams] people ask them why they did not answer my last letter to Father & Wilford mailed the Same day nearly 2 months ago if they are mad it would be more gratificatious to me to know what it is about than to be treated with silent contempt if I wrote any thing wrong it was ignorance not intentional. Dear Bob if I could only see you to day how I would love to talk to you as in days past & gone, write & tell me all the news good & Bad So good boy until I hear from you & I hope that will only be a few days write the minute you get this. my love to all.
