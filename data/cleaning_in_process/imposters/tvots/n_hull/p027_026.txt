I have been tossed to and fro, here and there, until I have lost all I had, and necessity compels me to ask you for money let the amount be great or small, I am on my own farm again, but I have no plow, no cow, hog, sheep or any thing, but just the farm, and no person but Calvin to do any thing on the farm, and you know he is young and an inexperience hand, but if I could get started to live again I think he can make a living. If you can possibly send me some money just what you can let me have, it will be doing me agreat favor, for I never truly knew what it was to want before. Every thing in the produce line is very high corn $8,00 per  flour $8.00 per hundred potatoes $1.50 to $6.00 per bushel, bacon is cheaper now than it has been, it is rating from .14 to .16, cent per pound. I would like for you to write soon if you please, Remembre me kindly to your family. I remain as ever
