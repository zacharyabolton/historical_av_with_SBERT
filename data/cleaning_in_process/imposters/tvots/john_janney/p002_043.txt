I hereby resign into the hands of the General Assembly of Virginia the Office of Commissioner to West Virginia. The condition of my eyesight renders it impossible for me to perform the duties, and not being aware of any other authority to fill a vaccancy in the recess, I make this communication now that you may, before the adjournment, take such action as may be proper.
