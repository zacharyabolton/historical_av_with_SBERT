I hereby resign into the hands of the General Assembly of Virginia, the Office of Commissioner to West Virginia. The condition of my eye-sight renders it impossible for me to perform the duties, and not being aware of any other authority to fill a vacancy in the recess, I make this communication now, that you may before the adjournment take such action as may be proper.
