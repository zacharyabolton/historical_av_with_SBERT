I received yours of the 10th inst about 10 days after the date & I have taken 10 more to see if I could make up my mind definitively on the subject of [unclear: reorganizing] my office. I have concluded the next year in Richmond on the 1st of February & that day will meet you & Mr [unclear: Martin] provided the Legislature should meet before that time take the matter into their own hands and settle it by agreeing to pay 2/3 of the debt and repudiating the balance leaving the [unclear: endebtors] of the state to look to West Virginia to pay the minimum. I think you have acted unwisely in deciding to take your seat in Congress at the present session. Have the people any   upon the subject of the Gubernatorial or is it time to move? What are your own views on the subject? It is rumoured here that Ex Gov Smith will be in the field. Where should I find you in Richmond if I go--At Ballard, or the Exchange? Please let me hear from you. I am so nearly blind that I cannot see here to write and have much difficulty in seeing what I have written.
