I have delayed writing to you in consequence of a letter I received a few days ago from R. M. Bentley Esq. informing me that he had held an interview with Mr. Baldwin & Mr. Martin in which they insisted on his writing to me to urge me not to resign at present. No reasons were assigned and I was at a loss to conjecture what they were. I am now satisfied that the condition of my eye sight will render me unable to perform the duties of the office and I now send you my resignation, to be laid before the Gen.l Assembly unless you shall be in possession of sufficient reasons for withholding it. But if you send in your resignation mine must be sent also.
