This forenoon Wm Hunter called at my house, to try to get a horse to hunt a man named by the name of Fitzgerald, who had murdered a Freedman in your place a few days ago. While at dinner a man called at my house filling the description of Fitzgerald given me by Hunter, I questioned him very closely & was immediately satisfied that it was he and asked him his name which he gave me - I determined to arrest him and in order to do so strategically I proposed to go with him a mile or two (to Mr Hunters father who is on the district road to the place that he (F) was enquiring for) & put him in the right road it was raining very hard & I prevailed on him to remain till it would cease a little, he did so, during which time he took me apart from my family and divulged to whole case to me making me his whole confidant seemingly as such, seeing Mr. Hunter riding up I advised him to walk out of the porch into my parlor (which is strongly protected) until I could get my horse. At this juncture Mr Hunter came up and asked me where he (F) was, I showed him into my parlor where he arrested him without any resistance.
