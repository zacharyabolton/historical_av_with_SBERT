I am well & hav been so for some time as Jacob has given you a discription of our moves I will not attempt it our friends & relations in the army are all well. I stayed all night with Aunt Lou on last Thursday night they are all well Uncle Cyrus Rhodes buried his son Dalas week before last Mary & [unclear: Joce] are very porly they had the diphtheria the rest of the relations are all well. I thought when we stared towards the Blue ridge that we were going to give up the valley to them  us off from home this made me feel very sorry but I am glad that we can hear from home yet I hope that God is on our side & will do all of the best my love to you all I hope it will not be long untill we will see home and may God bless you all
