After I Wrote the letter on Yesterday I have Come to the Conclusion that We had better not start business in Staunton as John is opposed to us and Will do all he can against us= if he was favorable to us We Could do better= I think it is selfish in him I will not think as Much of him hear after= let us try some other Point= I would give the room up if I was You= but if you want to go in I will put half the Mony in and I will Keep My situation and if it pays I will then come to Staunton= Write Me What you think ofit= them Factrys will be a big Drawback to Our Business up there
