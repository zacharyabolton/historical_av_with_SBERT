I am well & doing as well as can well expect. I offered my resignation again & am waiting anxiously to hear the result which I hope will be the final acceptance & relieving me from duty, then I hope we can make some better arrangement about living. I am sorely tired of this way of living I have endavoured to bear it patiently without [unclear: m--mor] but I hope we soon can make change. you either come here or I Come home. I am so anxious & concerned about you & the children I have had but one short note from you since I left home July last which seems singular. I have written you a Bushel of letters I think. I still hear in general terms that you are all well but this is not like getting letters detailing all our private & domestic matters do write me dont write me anything about service & I cant see any objection to it. Capt B- gets letter from home about once in 1 or 2 weeks they come safely Can t  you have Portograph taken of you and all the family & send to me have several copies taken Have you tried to move out why dont you write on this subject If you could come up I would be so glad to see you & bring Freddy. The little girls might be left with [unclear: sister] Mary & Miss Jane It would not do to come when there is any movement of the troops as could not pass the lines & would be unpleasant. If you do come when you get to Confederate lines make yourself know to the Military & or civil authorities & you will be allright & be helped on your road Do try & write me I sent by several for a lace stocking but have not yet got one would like to have one or two for a change. I have plenty chances to send down, so many moving out C S but see but few chances up this way I will write you so soon as I know or hear from my resignation and then we will know better what to do Keep the children at school but don t  keep them too much confined see to it kiss them all for me give my love to all friends
