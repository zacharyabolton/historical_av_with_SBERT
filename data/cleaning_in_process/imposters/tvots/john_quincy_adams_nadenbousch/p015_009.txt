I have an oppertunity today to send you a few lines and embrace it I wrote you a few days ago but for fear it may not reach you I write now hoping Some may reach you. I have gone to house keeping here with some other officers among them is CaptJas S Brown who is here with me I have got Louise, Hen, & Jenny here none with me, just reached here last night I am now out of the field & posted here, and if I only had you & the children here with me would be satisfied. I am trying to buy Some place here for a home & if can will try & get you out it is impossible to rent a house here now all are full up. See in the mean time if you will be allowed to pass through the lines with all of your property [unclear: Come] &c. & see if teams could be gotten for the purpose & if you can get a good trusty person to live in the house &c. & if I can get property I will write you Mr Schoppert & family are here well but not very well satisfied property & everything else here are quite high & hard to get I am sick & tired being by myself and must have a change I hope the Valley may be soon opened & there will be no difficulty in getting out You put up all the fruit you can & prepare well for the winter & spring if you do move I suppose you are as anxious as I am for a move. Mrs Schoppert is quite anxious to see the girls & particularly Jane if you come out Jane or Mary or both must come out with you. I will try & get entirely out of the service so soon as I can My Physical condition will not justify my remaining in service This is a place not liked by most of people but the people have been exceedingly kind & courteous to me about all of the 1st gentlemen here have call on me & I the pleasantness of the place depends upon a mansown conduct all have been quite attentive to me. Tell Mr Riddle that the tobacohere is all right. Write me soon & all the news send out by some safe person Tell Mary Kelley to write fully also
