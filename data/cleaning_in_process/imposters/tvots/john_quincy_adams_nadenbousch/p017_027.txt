I have an oppertunity & write you by US mail. I am here at home and quite well except some of the Rheumatism still remaining in my bones. The Federal forces are here in force most of the officers are stopping at my house I have had Gen l  Hunter & staff here most of the time all have behaved quite gentlemanly here & treated me exceedingly kind. nothing has been interrupted here except somethings of minor importance. I met with Col D H Strother whom I formerly knew. he has been quite kind to me Owing to the stopping of the Rail Road trains here & the stage lines the business of the house will be quite limited, and I will close it up as soon as possible and will close up my matters and make some dispose of my property here in some way or soon as possible & return to my home to remain I assure you that I am sorely tired of this life and am anxious for the change My pecuniary interest here of course is too great for to pull up & leave it I suppose what I have around here will bring some two Hundred Thousand dollars in Confed t  money one half of which is mine being about 100,000 00  which is a fair little sum and should be looked after closely, at even the expense of privation I have not come across any one yet who knew you & could tell me about you, but I hope you are all well & getting along well. Keep the children at school but not too closely allow them plenty of liberty. I hope soon to be at home and relieve you in these matters to some extent Remember me kindly to all friends and tell them that I will soon be at home I have no particular news to write you, if the way is open down the Valley cant you come up & bring Freddy along if you come bring food & feed to last you on the way. be sure to write me
