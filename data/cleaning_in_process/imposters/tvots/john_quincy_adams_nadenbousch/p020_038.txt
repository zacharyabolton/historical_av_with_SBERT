As I have an oppertunity I write you again. Whilst I write this Sunday night about 9 ohc PM sitting by the fire little F is leaning on the bed looking at me & dictating the words for him We are quite well & have every thing comfortable & full & plenty Jack & family & Louise are quite well Jerry has gone off with the last raiding party. he may have gone home if so you will see him Let M r  S know that he has gone The R Road has been much distroyed here which cuts off the travel & makes it quite dull here nothing doing I am still at the Hotel & keeping it open I have been trying hard to make some disposition of it but it seems impossible to do it & I fear the only way to save it until after the war is for me to keep it open & dont know now who to get in it & for the present will have to stay here myself Sometimes I think it best for you to come out here & live & when I think of the risk of all of our property I hesitate & cant decide what is best for us all round but I think it will not be long until we will be able to judge more fully what is best & what to do I assure you I am very anxious to be with you but I cant ask you to abandon home with all its comforts to come here with me for my own comfort & pleasure & of course I have concluded to try & stand it longer. The people here from our town are quite well Robert Hunter was here some few weeks ago. he is well Drebbing was here he is well &c Jack Harrison is allright M Locke has been Married in Richmond B Kilmer was married last spring in this neighborhood Robert Stewart I have seen lately. his wound seems to trouble him some he is not doing duty now George Schoppert & family are still here & well Jacob Light & family are here all well but him who is not so well now Miss Ellie is quite well & heard from her sister not long ago Sometime since I heard from you Sister M- wrote me in Dec- & Feb Moses wants to know if I applied his funds I have not applied it in property as none valuable can be gotten here for less that 20 to 50 of old prices & it is not desireable to invest in it. I keep it so employed that in any event it will bring something. tell him I will try & take care of it for him at least & if possible put it in such funds as he can use there as oppertunity offers which I think the best investment for him Tell him to say the same to J. Wilson for his. I will try & save it for them as best I can. good chances for investment here are rare Let me know if you received all the drafts I sent you & if you have collected them if not collected try & have them collected so soon as can Write & let me know the news Michael Sincindever started home a few days ago to remain I have not time to write more now remember me kindly to all friends & may god bless & protect you & Our little ones
