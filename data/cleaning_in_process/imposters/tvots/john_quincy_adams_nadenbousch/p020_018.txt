I have got him a Michels geography which he is studying hard I also got him a latin grammer which he is studying & learns quite fast. He frequently wishes to be at home but says he would not be satisfied there, but wishes you were only here with us (& I say so too) From present prospects I think very probable we will be home in the spring. I long for that time to come I am soarly tired of this life nearly 4 years separated loosing this much time in the prime of life (too bad) But it is no use to grieve after spilt milk but provide for the future. I am still in the Hotel yet, seems no hope for a change yet We change our plan of keeping it tomorrow, furnish rooms & prepare meals & let persons call for what they want & pay for what they get. I think this mode will pay much best. I am conducting the store with M r  Herring we sell a great many goods from $2500 00  to $8000 00  pr day Can make more money at this than Hotel keeping by far & much easier. I have bought some drafts for your use payable in northern funds which I think I will send in this letter If I do conclude this a safe oppertunity I will enclose them & note at the bottom & if not I will send by the first oppertunity & do you have them collected as soon as can Get Moses or Henry to have them collected or some one else One in Misouri one in Illinoise & 2 in Jefferson amounting in all $1005 00  in northern funds The bearer of this letter may call to see you if so, extend your hospitalities Jack & Ellen is here with me Louise is somewhat broke down.
