Notwithstanding your entire silence since I left home I propose [unclear: to] write you again. I have been setting in my room this entire day desolate & alone except a doctor came in & remained with me an hour or so I am ever [unclear: afflicted]  my eye [unclear: something] better but by no means well I have been blistering my temple today which is quite severe. In the [unclear] here alone I assure you I have the [unclear] if there be such [unclear]. I am anxiously waiting to hear from you to [unclear: know] [unclear: from] Mr P if it is best for me to remain here until my [unclear: cures] are passed over or for me to [unclear: return] at once. If not particularly to my advantage to thus remain away I will return at once even in this condition. I wrote you on Friday last also before that & am anxious to know how all things are going and to my surprise you have not written me since I left (You must have another spell on you) If anything important is going on a Telegram will reach me here in few hours & an answer return M r  Riddle can give you all information as to his & my affairs I wrote M r  P. & expect to hear from him tuesday In my last I stated fully what G Kilmer had better do as to moving farming &c &c If George has note plowed any on your land yet, under all the circumstances he may let it alone & not plow it unless he thinks he will have full time to plow that & the land where he moves. As he moves late I fear he may not be able to put it all in, & the both fields can be put in wheat in the [unclear: fall] & will pay better but if at it let him go on if he can accomplish it all in time Now I am anxious to know all these things if you intend to write me & give me such information as you can do so And if you dont intend writing just drop me a note saying so & then I will not look for any, and not be disappointed. As this course is to bad for any one to pursue My love to all
