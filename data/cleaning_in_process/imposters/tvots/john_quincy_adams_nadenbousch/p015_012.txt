I avail myself of another opportunity to write you I am still stationed here in this place & as commandant of the post I am very comfortably fixed here but  cant  say that I like the place. Capt James S Brown is here with me here & I s  & myself keep house we have Louise, Henry & Jenny keeping house for us and do quite well & if you & the children were only here I would be fixed I am trying daily to get a house even in the country but cant as yet get one The one we have is one the Doctor had & is quite small & could not be gotten for us I hope to succeed in getting a house soon. I heard of a house in Waynsboro 12 miles off & rode there on Sunday but it had been sold to Smith & [unclear: Dallinger]. I rode out 7 miles yesterday to see a property but could not get it. I have joined a gentleman here in the purchase of a large Hotel property here at thirty thousand Dollars $30,00000 Said to be one of the finest stands in the Valley it is a large building & is at the Rail Road all say it is quite cheap It is now occupied as Hospital at a rent of $360000 pr year & cant be got now. If it was furnished & conducted now as Hotel would make I think $100,00000 pr year Hotels here charge $8 pr day & but little to eat There is no chance now to get a portion of it to occupy. You pave the way to move out when I can get a place See if you will be allowed to bring out all your things & Then put up all the fruit you can if you have to get [unclear: packin-] to put it in & make full preperations with everything needed for a long time so that if can move out that you will be prepared Get your self & childred plenty of clothing & material & get several pairs of shoes each some too large & get Freddy plenty shoes & boots get some of Mr Snyders & some at James Hills or elsewhere so that persons will not know your preparations. if you get some coarse goods & shoes for the blacks make these arrangements & perhaps by this time the Valley will be open & there will be no difficulty in getting out & if should not get out of course the preparation would not be amiss have the hogs fattened as I directed & if you should come out have Henry S. to Kill & put up plenty of Pork for us this fall Save all your bacon & lard Bacon here 150c beef $1. butter 175 a $2. lard 150 a $200 Boots $40 to $60 Shoes $20 to $4000 they are not scarce but every person seems to be [unclear: --ing] Make every arrangement necessary to come out & live on what you bring except bread meat & butter &c-- Teams would have to be gotten there to come say to woodstock & there reload an other teams Billy & James [unclear: Chennowith] & Kneadler I think would come & John with carriage with you Moses might have wheel fixed on our carriage perhaps he would come out there with you. Thomas or Staub must furnish you with funds funds I have learned that H Thomas was sent off & imprisoned but cant learn if correct if so I feel concerned about the mill property Try & write me & let me know how things are and if you will be allowed to move out, if come, bring Jane or Mary C. along  Mrs Schoppert is living here in [unclear: --ns] & well she is exceedingly anxious for you to come here, and if can get a house to suit will try & all get together it would be best to bring say 2 cows & it will be necessary to put some careful person in our house also the house Moody lives in I suppose he will not keep house longer Aug & Peggy would move in the home property. If I can I will get a house already furnished in that event our furniture need not be brough except bedding if this can be done you could buy a team & get your uncle James G.'s large wagon he said he would sell it to me when I was there. In fact One team, One carriage & horses might all be bough as there would be nothing lost in such a purchase as they could be sold here readily at an advance on cost I cant find a farm here yet for sale In short arrange all your matters & have them in train to move out here so that when it suits all will be ready to move out with plenty of every thing you [unclear: need] but dont move without communicating to me first Unless you mistreated & have a very unpleasant time there in that event pull up stakes & move on out & notify me as soon as can I wrote several letters to you lately & no reply try & give me word Send a letter to John or some one for me You need not sign your [unclear: name] for fear it might be intercepted I will know who it is from O Some one can certainly send me a letter say how the mill is, how the children get along how you are all provided for whether interfered with in any way or not I dont ask any information as to the troops &c remember me kindly to the children tell them to be obedient & good also to all enquiring friend say how you get along for help God bless you all
