As I have an oppertunity I again write you hoping it may reach you soon I & F are well & still living here in the same wayll Times here are exceedingly dull nothing scarcely doing in any way I have for sometime been on a stand to know what is best to do & think seriously of closing out & returning home let the result be as it may I might not be much interfered with in so doing. if I knew that fact it would take but a short time to decide the matter F is going to school & learning fast Grammer, Geography, Latin grammer, &c &c I understand that the little girls are learning fast. this I am glad to hear & hope they may continue to do so. but dont let them study too hard as their minds might be somewhat impaired in it Keep yourselves supplied with what you may need. dont stint yourselves on account of costs. in using funds hold back any coin you may have until the last as it is the most valuable & safest I will soon determine what I will do & I shall write you again soon In the meantime cant you ascertain whether or not I could return home to stay & remain without taking any Oath & write me the result see A Bowman, A S Chambers &c & ask them to ascertain I would not consent to take any Oath now a part from my feelings on this subject it would in future be a barrier in my way with all present friends I sent a note to old W- did you deliver it, & has he interfered any farther with you Answer Have you the Tobacco safe yet or was it interfered with if you need the funds you can sell Some for the purpose. Tell Moses I have not invested his funds yet. There is no chance here for judicious investment in real property but I have it so invested as not to loose it now & will watch it closely & if have any good oppertunity will invest as he suggested James W the same I think northern funds the best for them as they can use it there to advantage I am still in the store with M r  H- and doing quite well but rather be home. The money made here takes so much to amount to anything. Prices are so high Tell Mother & all that I am well & would be glad to hear more often from them F Still has his little pony & enjoys himself in riding out often I wish so much that I had you all with me & am temped often to ask you to move out but perhaps it is best for you to remain where you are & you are more comfortable than might be made here Write me by return fully God bless you all
