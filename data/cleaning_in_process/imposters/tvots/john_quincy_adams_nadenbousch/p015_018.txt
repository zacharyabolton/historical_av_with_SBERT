I have written almost daily to you since I have been here & received no answer from you. I suppose you fear difficulties in writing if so tell Cousin Mary about our domestic & private matters & she will write me say nothing of Military matters & there Can t  be any difficulty. I heard a few days ago that you were all well. I dont know what help you have whether the children are being schooled or not whether you well provided for whether the mill is moving or not & a host of other little matters I desire to know which there is no impropriety in the service in knowing if you can t  write a letter just give a list of these matters, or write a family letter & submit to the Provost Marshal there for his approval & with his endorsement it will come without difficulty I wrote you so many letters that I suppose you know all about my position & condition I rented a house above this place for you but fear you can not get out with your household effects just now have you tried let me know I can t  say how soon I can get out of the service & of course cant come home to stay until I am clearly & honourably out of the service take good care of yourself & children provide well as can put a school in the office if not no [unclear: one] there & send the children to school I wrote cousin Mary to get me a pair shoes if she will give her the money to pay for them My love to you all I am well
