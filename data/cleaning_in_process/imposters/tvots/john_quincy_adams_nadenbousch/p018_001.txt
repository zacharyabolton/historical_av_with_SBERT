I suppose you are anxious to hear how we got home. I had written to you & forwarded with some money $100 Maryland 20$ green backs but the carrier could not get it through and brought it back to me again, & now I start it on again hope it may reach you safely this time. We reached here safely after a hard tiresome time camping out each night Freddy enjoyed the trip very much. we are well now. Freddy enjoys himself here very much [unclear: nocking] about the Hotel running errands, carrying messages for me &c &c I find him of great help to me he stands in the office & collect tickets at the dining room door thus making himself quite useful. I write this & send both together. I hope you are all well Freddy wishes for you daily & I too I do wish you were all here we are doing a good business here now. I had a bidder for the hotel yesterday I think we could have sold for $200,000 00  two hundred thousand Dollars furniture & all. but this we would not take. gold is 25 for one which would make but Eight thousand dollars in coin and to hold the property until after the war it will always bring about fifty thousand dollars in good currency & from this it would seem best to hold on to it as we could not apply the money now to any advantage. I would much rather rent it out but if I have to stay away from home, I dont see any better chance to make money than this although it is a disagreeable business I wish we could have had more time to consider this matter and have come to some definite conclusion on this subject The things I had with me I got through safely the articles groceries &c, I sent out are still at the place I sent them near millcreek I could not get a wagon to bring them out M r  T- disappointed me. I suppose he was afraid to venture out here. I will still try & get them out Capt B- is going down & will try & get them out. I still hope the way home will soon be open again if so I will try & get home again Freddy dont want to go for fear he wont get back again Use the money enclosed as you desire. if from time to time you can, you might collect up such things as we will need here, you can tell what is most needed. I forgot the letter paper & pencils & small long narrow memorandum books if have a chance try & send them out to me Freddy is in bed sleeping soundly all here make a greateal of him think he is sharp & keen I learn bad news from Jack & family he had fully fixed to leave upon the Yankees return I will make a change with him remember me kindly to all. May god bless & protect you all. try & keep some help with you
