As I have an oppertunity I concluded to write you I am well and still in this place. we are now operating the Hotel and doing a good business receipts daily amounting to $1000 00  to $2500 00  I have offered my resignation again & expect it will be accepted & I then will run the Hotel myself. I now am superintending it myself besides my other duties all of my old acquaintances who pass by this way stop here. we are full up every night I learn a note I sent you by M rs  Dr Colston has been taken possession of by the Federals It wont do them much good as there is nothing but private matters in it and nothing of importance I only wish you were up here with me. it would be so much pleasanter for me. We have the house fit up fair we still need some articles such as sheets pillar slips & plad cotton bed spreads if we had some of these we would be quite well acquiped I hope we can at least in the spring make some arrangement to be together I am sorely tired of this life attend to our matters as well as you can. do try & write to me tel me now the particulars as to how you are getting along remember me kindly to all
