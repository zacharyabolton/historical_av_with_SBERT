Having an oppertunity I again write you but have not much to say I am well in health but my afflictions bother me considerable, but do as well as can expect I received your reply to my request to purchase some articles &c but am not in the condition you think (Crazy) but if should be so unfortunate I have the Asylum close at hand and will try & take advantage of its convenience We have the house open at last. we have a fine sum of travelling customs house full every night keep it in good order receipts $1000 00  per day everything going on smoothe. We have all things fixed in running order need some linnens blankets comforts & groceries such as coffee & tea But I shant ask you to send me anything more except a few articles I need at once viz a young lady of about 36 years old slender light hair fair complexion & blue eyes & 4 little [unclear: flax] head fellows one boy & three girls I desire these goods & chattels sent through to me at once with their clothes & bedding If I had you all here with me I would be much better satisfied & think you would be too we get plenty of supplies but at quite high prices rates $15 pr day Cant you manage some way to move out if it the be at the risk of our property no matter I think we can make something here but if come bring all kinds of clothing you may need as it is scarce & high just here I think I will be out of the service between this & spring & can be with you constantly My impression is that we will do a good business here now I am anxious to make some money here as we have lost so much since the war Porters brother inlaw wants the Porter property. I think I will let him have it it has not been paid for & he can take it at $900 00  lift the notes & pay you the ballance if I do conclude to let him have it I will make deed herear & you can acknowledge it there before Notary public but do nothing in the matter unless I give him the papers. I have much to say to you but cannot say it on paper but hope soon to see you. I have just got 2 Shirts 1 pr shoes 2 pr socks & 1 pr drawers which will be a great benefit to me now If I only could have gotten some collars I would have been glad. Do try & write me fully all about private matters I am so anxious to hear from you tell me how the little fellows get along and all domestic matters. I learn the mill has been released from what I learn John must be about frightened to death He seems quite anxious about the property &c just say to him he need not fear about any money I may owe him. if all we have there is lost I hope still to have enough here to pay him & all I owe any person & then keep my family well These chicken hearted people won t  do. These times persons must have nerve I hope that all these croakers will in the end be disappointed They seem to deprecate my position losses risks &c &c but I hope to come out right in the end You keep perfectly calm dont grieve or be concerned about property. This is but dross. My greatest ambition now is to be with you all I have written to you so often on this subject that I have but little else to add but hope it will not be long until we meet Do the best you can with the property whilst there & if leave put it in the hands of some good person Freddy I hope you are a good boy & attending to businiess for ma going to school & taking care of your little sisters. dont run about with bad boys nor ride strange horses this is dangerous you keep close about home and be a good boy Sissy, Lila & Jinnie you be good girls obey your ma stay about home & attend school help your ma all you can My love to Miss Jane Kiss her for me tell her I will pay her back when I see her Remember me to Moses, Henry, Mary H Aunt & Uncle Aunt P- & Lute & all others
