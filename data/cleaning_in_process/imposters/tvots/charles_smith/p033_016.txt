Your letter to Miss Blackburn is just received as I have been absent from home in Loudon County, the letter is of date 2nd inst. At the request of Emily Williams I will reply to the letter. She says that she has a good situation and does not want to go up the Valley, and that she would not go in any event unless her mother would come for her. She wishes her mother to know that she lives with my family and she believes that I am known to her mother. Perhaps you may be acquainted with Major Lawrence U.S.A., who is stationed in Berryville. As I am a stranger to you I would refer to him.
