 I received yours dated Dec 30th to day while at dinner, and also a small bag of peaches. I am very thankful to you indeed for your kindness and thoughtfulness. I am very sorry indeed that you were disappointed in sending me a box. I would of liked very much to have gotten it. I have not got but one box from home since I left the last time. I would be very thankful if I could get what clothes I wanted to wear from home let alone anything to eat.

Henry I intended writing to you and Bell some time ago-but delay followed after delay until the present time and now I have no news to write of interest except that I have plenty to do all the time. I have been on Gen. Courts Martial ever since we came over here on this side of the mountain. I have understood that it is a permanent thing I am getting very tired of it.
