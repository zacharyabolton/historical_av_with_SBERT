I have just recd your note of this Inst. Am sorry to learn that Jeffn is complaining -- we have had several cases, with similar Symtoms in my family recently, which terminated in a very violent cold -- and hope his will result in nothing worse. I am going to Town in the morning and will send Doct. Donaugh out to visit him -- and if he should deside his case to be serious -- I will make an arrangement to bring him home, Though very illy prepared to keep him -- being now very much crouded.
