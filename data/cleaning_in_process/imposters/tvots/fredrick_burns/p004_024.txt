I have a Son who wishes a situation as School Teacher and I thought perhaps you might know of a situation in your region of country that would suit him & that he would suit. He has had some little experience in teaching previous to his going to College. He has just returned from Emory & Henry College & has testimonials as to his standing while at College & also his qualifications. He is prepared to teach the usual English branches, Nat. Philosophy, Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Surveying, Plane & Spherical Trigonometry & Latin. If you know of a situation & will let him know of it at your earliest convenience you will confer a favour which will be gladly reciprocated should an opportunity occur. Please excuse the liberty I have taken in troubling you with this
