We received the school registers last evening. You are aware I suppose of the condition of the Freedmen in Staunton. Also of the inconveniences of our school-room. It is now so crowded that we feel obliged to have another room. So I wished to acknowledge the receipt of the registers I thought at the same time I would ask you to whom we should look for the money to pay for the room. We shall also be obliged to have some desks for it. Can you inform us where we can get them. We have now one hundred and [unclear: fifty] day scholars and nearly that number of night scholars with new members coming in every day. If you can give us a little advice and information we shall be much obliged. I would like to know also where and at what price a set of maps can be obtained.
