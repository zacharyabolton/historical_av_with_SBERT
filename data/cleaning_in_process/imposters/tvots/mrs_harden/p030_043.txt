I hired a woman Horner Tines in the spring by the month to cook, She was not Stout and dont suit as a cook, and we find her so quarrelsome and disagreeable with the other negroes that they wont agree to stay with her, They have gotten it in their heads that she is a conjurer and are all affread of her, we cant get along without other hands on the farm, all say they will leave if she dont, we dident rent the house to her only hired her by the month her time is out and we have paid her two weeks ago, now she says she wont leave before Christmas, that we have no right to put her out We dont want any fuss or trouble with her So I write to you to know what to do about it, she is a very disagreeable creature, hard to get along with We want the room she is in very badly, you will please answer this immediately and let me know what course to persue.
