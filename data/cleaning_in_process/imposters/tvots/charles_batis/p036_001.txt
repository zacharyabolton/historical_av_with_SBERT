Yours of the 10th has been rec'd and read. I am glad you sent on my name as a Candidate for U.S. Storekeeper of one of the Distilleries of Augusta Co. I know I can attend to the business as well as any other man. Grateful for past favors, I will try and be more vigilant in the discharge of all Public duties entrusted to my care, and hope you will always remember me when a vacancy occurs.
