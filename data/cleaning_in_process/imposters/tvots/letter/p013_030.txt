 Your letter by Jimmy Burns[2] was received this evening. Charles' letter came yesterday, after looking for a letter for a week. I had begun to think you had forgotten me, it was so long coming. He mentioned that Johny had gone to somewhere (but didn't say where) except that I would no doubt see him before I got his letter. He didn't tell me what he had gone for, or anything about it, nor did you except that he sent to Genl Lee a recommendation for my detail. What sort of a thing is it and who recommended me. I suppose he was in Richmond and took the contract to the war office. I havn't gotten the letter you say he wrote me and have never gotten but one letter from him since I left. I have been very anxious to hear from him, and know what is doing at the Furnace. It will now soon be time it was put in blast. When I commenced writing I had just returned from preaching, which we have every night. Dr. Hoge[3] and Mr. Lacy [4] are gone. There is a chaplain with each regiment of the brigade, two Presbyterians and three Methodists. Lieut Culton[5] has resigned - unable to stand infantry service. I dont know who will get his place, if his resignation is accepted. We heard considerable firing across the river yesterday, but havent heard the cause. Wednesday morning, I will get the box today -am very much obliged to you all for it -I am not much afraid of it being much like what y I get here, there is but one place I ever saw that I got such rations. I am sorry Miss Sue Harden is about to leave the neighborhood -young people are sadly scarce there. Emmett is on another trip to Uncle John's, wonder if he will get ther this time. I heard Mary Susan [6] was to atttend a small party at Dr. Dold's -a kind of farewell to Jim[7] I suppose. I am very well. Love to all the friends.
