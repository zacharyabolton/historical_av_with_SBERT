I reached this place on  Monday by Central RR, and though  I have learned nothing with certain ty of Charles and John am satisfied  they are unhurt in the great strugg le so far [1]. There is much difficulty in  getting a pass and means of conveyance  to the army and having procured the  former should have gone to Jackso  ns division to day, but for the heavy  and constant rain that have been  falling. I shall go tomorrow if poss  ible. It is not possible to get a sub  stitute in for Charles [2] until something  decisive has taken place betweeen the  contending armies, Jackson is [unclear: move ing] and fighting every dayâ€” this con  stancy of action precludes the possib  ility of getting in a substitute. The  news from the army is of the most  thrilling and complicated character;  the enemy is still unbroken and  formidable, and disputing every  inch of our advance with the  energy of despair. Our loss in killed  and wounded is frightful.[3] It is re  ported that Jackson was very seve  rely cut up yesterday in an effort  to storm the enemies batteries. He  finally succeeded but at great  loss. Our army commands the fla  nk and rear of the enemy but  the admirable order of the latter  leaves it much to be feared that  the crisis is yet to come. There has  been no Bull Run on this awful  field. It is quite a mistake to  suppose McClelland yet whipped,  the bloody catastrophe has yet to  come.[4] You may expect to hear from  me again as soon as I see the boys,  and should it be necessary to telegr  aph you I will do so. Mean  while write me by return m mail if you wish me to remain  until I can get a substitute  received in the place of Charles. If I find any misfortune has bef  allen him I will bring him home.  I have not heard anything of Mr.  Read with certainty no of Samuel  Brooks. I hope to be able tomorrow  to give you certain information  with regards to them.
