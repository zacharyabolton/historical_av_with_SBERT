We continued our march on yester- day and reached this place about 3 o'clock. The march  was very disagreeable on account of the heat and  dust. Today we are resting in camp. It may be  we will go on tomorrow, if so I hope they will  find us on the cars. It is said that the troops have been  getting off at Louisa Court House; that is near enough Richmond for me in this warm weather.[1] I reckon  they were a little disappointed at home that I did  not return with you. I hope Dryden will be more suc  cessful next time.[2] I suppose Gen. Jackson is still in  Richmond. No answer yet to Capt. White's request to return  to Staunton.[3] Write soon and often as I feel anxious  to hear from Moffet [4]. Love to all.
