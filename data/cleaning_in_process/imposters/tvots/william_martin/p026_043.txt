On my return from Franklin County on Wednesday last I found a letter from you appraising me that you & Mr. Lowning, were in Richmond. I left home the next morning & reached the city on the same evening & was surprised and disapointed to learn that you had returned home. Being home for several days & not engaged in settling accounts between the two states, I have turned my attention to the general race for Govr that is likely to take place in the spring. Many of our friends in the Legislature prefer you for Govr & with our Conservative friends on the South Side of James River you are decidedly their choice. Fayette McMullin is in the field & says he will be at your next court in Augusta. Genl. Thompson or Genl. Mahone will be the regular [unclear: Secesion ] Candidate. Our friends here are inclined to put you, myself & Nelson in the field & if your Townsman & kinsman was were out of the way, there would be no difficulty about the success of the ticket. Nelson is willing & anxious to go on the ticket for Attorney Genl. I learn that Govr. Boreman has appointed companions to meet us. Would it not be well for us to meet here on Wednesday the 13th of March. & if we agree upon any satisfactory basis of settlement Govr Pierpoint can convene the Legislature & fix the question of the payment of the States interest on the public debt, which I learn will be adjourned till we make our report. I had a long interview last evening with Alexander Mosby, who has taken charge of the [unclear: Ticking] & who prefers you for Govr & is very desirous that you should become a candidate for the office. Nelson & I will pursue any course you may adopt. I shall remain here till Wednesday at 2 oclock. Write me fully either here or at Home -- Posts Slow.
