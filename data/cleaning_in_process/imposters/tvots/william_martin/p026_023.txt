I wrote some days since suggesting that we would meet in Richmond on the 14th of Feby, but to day I received your letter proposing the 1st of [unclear: Feby ]. My engagements compel me to be at Henry & Franklin Feby courts on the 1st & 2nd Mondays. So I hope it may suit the convienence of yourself & Mr. Jany to meet me at the Balland House on the 14th as I am extremely anxious to see you.
