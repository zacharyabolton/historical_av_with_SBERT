We wrote you last on the 25th inst. and now have yours of the 24th, 26th, & 28th inst. which we have carefully read. We expect to get away so soon, that we do not consider it necessary to send you funds for paying the debts you have incurred, as they [unclear: wd] hardly reach you before our arrival at the mines--our [unclear: next] will advise the day on which you may expect us. The Manganese you have mined & sent to [unclear: Canada] we are satisfied, is not fit to send across the Ocean; indeed nothing short of 70% would bring Cost. The bbls. marked W. which we presume, are filled with the [unclear: Clayey] stuff, you sent on here for analysis, marked A & B, would not be worth the . There is no sale for Manganese here, beyond probably 25 tons  and which must be of superior quality--therefore, in all your operations, keep it always in View, that nothing need be packed, which is not of the best quality. to the mind of the writer, there does not appear the slightest difficulty in selecting it by the Eye alone. The metallic character always predominates in the article of good quality.
