Your note of the 16th inst. I didn't receive until this morning, in reply to as for anything coming to Harriet Lee, she has gone off or run off in my Debt some $3.90= When I say Run of she left in the night with 2 Two of her children & left one at my house of no service to me, I found out where she had gone & sent her child to her, which she didn't like as she wished to get clear of the Trouble of attending to this Girl - she is some 15 years old. But foolish & hard to manage. My wife attended to this Girl & made her clothes &c as long as she was at my home. H. Lee had no trouble with her. I keeped all three of her children & clothed the older Girl & gave her $2 per month. Since Xmas- before that time I have been giving her $3.00 per month & informed her at the time if she could do better to go & do so as her children were all of espence & no service to me. She had no objection & left for  But she wished high wages, she wanted $5.00 with her children as high as women who had no incumbrances Those who persuaded her [unclear: oft] also got her to come to you. You can ask Mr. H. Risk about me or any person who ever heard of me or any colored & white man about Waynesboro who know me from childhood if I ever did or had the means of not paying my debts. Never had a law sent in my life with any .
