My personal affairs have taken such shape that it is very much to my future interest to go to Pennsylvania, where very favorable inducements are held out to me; I regret exceedingly to leave the very pleasant family down here, but justice to my own obliges me to give up my own inclinations in the matter. When I came down, Mr. Tukey very kindly advanced me some $25, to pay the Hotel Bill I had contracted here, and I shall in addition to that am't, be indebted to him for my boarding while in his family; I propose to leave about the 15th, and having [unclear: free] passes over the roads from Harpers Ferry, will take that route, stopping at Winchester, where I can sign your Receipts Rolls for my pay. Is there any way in which it can be managed that I can draw my pay before leaving here, so that I settle with Mr. Tukey before at the time? I should feel under considerable obligation if you could aid me in the matter, and would be glad to have reply as early as convenient.
