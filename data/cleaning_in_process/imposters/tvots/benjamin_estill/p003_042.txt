By Mr. Hotchkiss I beg to write you for the purpose of requesting you to [unclear: raise] me the $100 loaned you, in the course of next week so that I may set off for Ky (on a very "matrimonial enterprise" perhaps?) immediately thereafter. I hope it may not be inconvenient for you to comply with this request by next Wednesday, Thursday or Friday at fartherest. Allow me to present you my heartiest congratulations for your  & happiest employment & enjoyment of this new year upon [unclear: whose] threshhold we have just entered. May you & I & all dear to us be so prepared for whatever events or realities may await us in the developments of the present year, that we shall bear them with the purpose & in the spirit of true Christian philosophy, and if called = as many of our beloved friends have been called in the year just closed = in the providence of God -- to cross the Jordon of death before the dawn of "59" may we be fitted & permitted to enter into the blessedness, the happiness & the glory reserved for the righteous in heaven!!
