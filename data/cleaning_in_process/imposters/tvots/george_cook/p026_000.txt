I have the honor to make the following report of Criminal Trials in this Sub-Dist for the Month ending Oct. 31st 1866. The number of trials has been very light this month and I think the Magistrates are improving in their manner of conducting such trials. The evidence of colored persons is accepted with more fairness but the sentiment of the community is still such as to prevent impartial trials.
