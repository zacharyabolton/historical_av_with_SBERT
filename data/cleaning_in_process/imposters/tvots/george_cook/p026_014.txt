I have the honor to request that I may be again allowed to employ a clerk. My last clerk was discharged on the 30th of September 1866. I consider it very essential that I should be at liberty to visit the different portions of my Sub-Dist. that I may be thoroughly acquainted with the condition of the Freedpeople and the disposition of the whites. As I am now situated I am obliged to be at my office almost constantly to attend to the wants of those who come. I believe that much can be done toward securing just treatment of the Freedpeople by traveling about; noting their condition; and when necessary reasoning with their employers. There is already much destitution among the Freedpeople and before the winter is through there will be much more and it is quite necessary that I should know of the extreme cases of destitution that I may endeavor to have them properly cared for by the County Poor Commissioners. Hoping that this application will receive favorable consideration.
