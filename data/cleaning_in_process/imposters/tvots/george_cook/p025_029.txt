I have the honor to submit the following report of Criminal Trials in this Sub-Dist Comprising the Counties of Augusta, Highland and Bath for the Month ending Augusta 31st 1866. The trials have mostly consisted of accusations against the freedpeople by whites of Larceny: in most cases the freedpeople accused have been sent to jail in default of bail. The law respecting evidence has been well carried out.
