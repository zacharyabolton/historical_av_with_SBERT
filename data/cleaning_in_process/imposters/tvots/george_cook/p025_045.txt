I have the honor to enclose herewith an acknowledgement of the receipt of Circular No. 10 from War Dept. Bureau R. F. and A.L. dated August 22d 1866 signed by the Superintendent of Board of Overseers of the Poor of Augusta Co. Va. I have heard nothing in reply to  my letter accompanying the Circular forwarded to Highland Co. the colored population of that Co. is very small and the Bureau has not been supporting any freedmen of that County.
