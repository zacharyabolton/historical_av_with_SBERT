I have the honor to report that in all the "Criminal Trials" of Freedmen which I have attended during the month of December I have witnessed a degree of fairness I had not expected to see in this Sub Dist. The only trials I have attended have been in this Town and before Magistrates, I have not been notified of any out of Town. Several cases in which Freedmen were interested came up on the 25th and 26th inst. but so far as the power of the Magistrates went, justice was administered, it now remains to see whether or no the Grand Jury, which meets in February next, will cause whites engaged in assaults upon Freedmen to be indited, and if Juries can be found to try such cases impartially.
