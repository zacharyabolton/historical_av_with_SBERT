I have the honor to report in compliance with the requirements of Circular No 10 C.S. from Hdqrs Asst. Comr State of Virginia - that I have attended all Criminal trials to which I have been summoned before the Civil Courts of this Sub-Dist., in which colored persons were concerned. The result to the interests of the freedman of restoration of jurisdiction to the Civil Courts, has been to make it very difficult for him to obtain preliminary hearing before local Magistrates who seem to dislike taking notice of complaints of Freedmen unless directed to do so by this office. I do not know of an instance in which the complaint against a white man has been noticed upon application of the freedman. In the Circuit Court the Judge has treated all cases in which Freedmen were concerned with impartiality and fairness, and the law respecting their testimony has been carried out in good faith.
