I have the honor to submit the following Report of Bureau Affairs in this Sub-Dist for the month of November 1866 The condition of the Freedpeople is very unpromising I have had a large number of complaints from them to the effect that their employers refuse to pay them, and when they find that their only redress is through the Civil Courts they prefer to let the debts go, as they have no confidence in being able to obtain redress through that channel, and even when they try that method the Circuit Court is much behind in its trials, and while waiting they might starve; besides they would find it a very difficult thing to obtain work were it known that they had instituted suit The only way I can see to stop this systematic imposition on the part of employers, is to re-establish "Freedmen's Court" and support it with suitable military power for a time; such a course vigorously persued for even one month would be very beneficial to the Freedpeople. It would convince the whites generally, as well as the Courts that they Freedpeople have rights which white men are to respect. Most cases of refusal to settle with Freedpeople are flagrant attempts to defraud.
