I have the honor to make report of Bureau affairs in compliance with Circular from HdQrs Sixth Dist Va. Augusta County. In this County I am informed by my predecessor the freedmen are as a rule working steadily, during the month rations have been issued to sixteen (16) persons - mostly women and children. Complaints of various kinds have been entered upon the books but mostly for small sums of money. Highland County I have not visited as yet but learn that the freed people do not number more than one hundred (100) person in the County - have received no complaints from them. Rockingham County has never had an agent of the Bureau for any length of time - the better class of whites are inclined to treat the freedmen fairly and are I think willing to give them opportunities to improve and have subscribed quite freely toward building them a church - but there are a large number bitterly opposed to them. I had two or three cases of assault brought to my notice by freedmen about the middle of the month and referred them to Civil Magistrates but have received no notice to attend trials - some freedmen complained that they were often threatened with violence if they went to the "Bureau" - I do not apprehend that much can be done for them under the present restrictions of the "Bureau." I have registered in compliance with Circular No 11 HdQrs Asst Comr - in the County of Rockingham one hundred and fourteen couples with their Children and since coming to this County one hundred and seventy (170) couples additional enclosed please find a blank form which I filled and gave out in both instances as an incentive to them to come forward and also to make it easier to find their names in future if required - It has been suggested to me that by putting a [unclear: Rev.] Stamp on, it would be a legal instrument for them to retain and with which in case of the husbands death the widow could claim property I think the idea worthy of mention but do not feel at liberty to take such a course without authority.
