I have the honor to submit the following report of the Action taken by Civil Authorities in the following case of Floyd Adams, freedboy, vs. Madison Dooms, white, Adams is employed as porter at the Virginia Hotel at this place, on the afternoon of Tuesday the 26th of June 1866, while calling his Hotel at the Railway Station, an employee of the road named Madison Dooms stepped up to Adams and after ordering him to leave the platform, according to the testimony of some witnesses, in the preliminary hearing, before the Mayor of the town, and according to the testimony of others, without saying anything struck him a severe blow with a heavy Club knocking him down - the affair created considerable excitement it not being the first instance in which the man Downs has struck the porters - the proprietors of the Hotel interested themselves about the affair to such an extent that one of them was bound over to keep the peace in the sum of $500. The boy Floyd Adams complained to me and I referred the case to the Mayor of the town, who after hearing the evidence, bound Madison Dooms in the fund of $100 to answer to the Grand Jury. The Grand Jury, who commenced their session on the 4th inst., failed to find any inditement against Dooms, and he was therefore discharged. The plea in favor of Dooms at the preliminary hearing, was, that he was obeying the instructions of the stationmaster, who had instructed him to keep the platform clear of the Hotel porters, that the platform was the property of the Rail Road Co. Such a plea could not have covered an assault upon a white person. In my opinion the action of the Grand Jury in discharging Madison Dooms from accountability was an act of gross injustice and the case from its [unclear: prominence] should receive attention, the jury having literally given the white man permission to knock the negro down without fear of molestation. The Corporation Attorney informed me that he furnished the jury with the law and does not know how they came to act as they did.
