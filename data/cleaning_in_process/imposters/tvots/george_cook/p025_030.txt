I have the honor to submit the following report of Bureau Affairs for this Sub-Dist Comprising the Counties of Augusta, Highland and Bath. There have been comparatively few complaints of ill treatment on the part of freedmen which is in part attributable, I think, to a feeling on their part that proper redress cannot be obtained. Arrests of freedpeople on charges of Larceny have been frequent in Augusta Co. though for petty offences, the evil seems on the increase.
