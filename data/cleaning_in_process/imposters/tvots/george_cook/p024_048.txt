In compliance with directions this day recd from Brevet Major W. S. How Supt Sixth Dist, Va I have the honor to forward report required by Circular No. 18 Current Series, direct. Although I have given publicity to the Order I have as yet received no notice that there are any cases of necessity in this District. I think probable that by the 1st of June some such cases will be reported to me from Rockingham Co. if no others, having only assumed Command of the Counties of Augusta and Highland on the 20th inst. and the order not having been previously acted upon in those Counties I cannot speak from certainty in regards to their reception.
