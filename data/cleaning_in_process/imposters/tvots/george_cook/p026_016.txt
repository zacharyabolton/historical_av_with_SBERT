I have the honor to submit the following Report of Bureau Affairs in this Sub-Dist for the Month ending Dec. 31st 1866 But few complaints of Violence on the part of whites, have been made by Freedmen, and those made are of a trivial nature. Complaints in regard to pay have been quite frequent and I have assisted them all in my power by making out their accounts and instructing them how to proceed. I have talked with several Magistrates about such accounts and tried to convince them that the interests of the County require them to see that accounts for services should be settled, else the County will have the Freedpeople to care for as paupers. It will, I fear, be difficult to make the Poor Commissioners attend to the destitute Freedpeople there are many cases of whites, and it is hard for them not to make a marked distinction in favor of the whites. I have a present several cases of destitute Freedpeople in view of which I shall make seperate, detailed Reports, if the Poor Comrs do not take them in charge. The whites seem to think, so far as personal Violence is concerned that it is better to let the Colored people alone but they are nevertheless retaining a firm control of them through the system of low wages. The average according to the Census returns so far as completed, will not exceed $9 per month for able bodied males, and between three and four dollars, for females. This average is only among those who receive any wages. Many do not get more than board and clothing. Instances in which aged Freedpeople have been turned off by their former owner, utterly destitute are quite numerous.
