I have the honor to submit the following Report of "Criminal Trials" for the month ending Nov. 30th /66 as required by Circular No. 10 C.S. from Hdqrs. Asst Comr State of Va. I have not been summoned and have therefore not attended any Criminal Trials in which Freedmen or persons of Color were concerned. I find it almost impossible to get hearings before Magistrates for Freedmen in Civil Suits against Whites every possible obstruction to such trials is made and many Freedpeople are suffering for want of money due them but which they have no means of collecting.
