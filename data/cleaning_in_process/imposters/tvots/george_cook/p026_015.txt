Esther Scott (cold) has a daughter Susan Berry (cold) who is now in one of the General Hospitals (W.S.) at Richmond Va. The child has had both limbs amputated and was taken from this place to Richmond in the early part of January 1866. She wished to ascertain her address and also wishes to know if the girl will be given her provided her present husband will go to Richmond for her.
