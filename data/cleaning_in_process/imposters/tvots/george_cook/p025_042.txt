I have the honor to request information as to whether a favorable action is probable on report of schools made from this Officer, under date of August 18th 1866. The freedpeople are making preparations to build and wish to know whether the "Bureau" can give them any assistance - it is essential that they receive the information as soon as possible. With the assistance recommended they will be able to erect a good building - without the assistance it will be poorly done and leave them in an embarrassed position.
