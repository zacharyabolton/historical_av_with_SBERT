I have the honor to make the following report of Bureau Affairs in this Sub-Dist.  There seems to be a growing spirit among the whites of resolve to keep the freedpeople "in their proper place" as they term it, or in other words to keep them as nearly as possible to their former state of servitude. Assaults have been quite frequent and the Magistrates to whom the cases are referred for trial do not give impartial decisions - the trials during the past month have resulted unfavorably to the freedmen. I have talked the subject over with the Judge of the Augusta Co. Court Common Wealth Atty, and others, and feel convinced that it will be impossible to get just decisions before Magistrates until the sentiment of the people changes. The Magistrates holding office as a mere honorary title will not give decisions contrary to the sentiment of the communities in which they live, and until these preliminary trials are properly conducted, the Freedmen cannot get justice. Grand Jurors have in a very aggravated case refused to indite - the case has been duly reported.  Freedpeople have conducted themselves well during the month, labor has been in good demand. I have registered since last report in compliance with Circular No. 11 C.S. 37 Couples and 144 children making a total of 758 couples and 213 children in the Co. of Augusta.
