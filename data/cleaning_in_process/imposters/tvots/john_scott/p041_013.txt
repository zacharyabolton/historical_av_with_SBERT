I do not write a letter of necessity--but want to let you know how we are situated more particularly in regard to board as Miss Burke seems a little dissatisfied and may speak of it to you in Report. She is weary and half sick though she is an excellent teacher, and under favorable circumstances could not fail to be successful as indeed she is under these circumstances. Our boarding house is of Brick so that it is warm in winter and cool in summer--and the ladies say it is one of the prettiest places in the city Beside this our cook is neat and skillful. We obtain the rooms however from the colored man whose wife is our cook. We do not allow these people to use at all our sitting room--nor do we eat with them, of course and the woman is no more than cook and chamber maid,-- yet Miss Burke insists that because the room was obtained from a colored man--therefore we are Boarding in a Colored family--which she objects to. Should we rent a house and pay 50 dollars to furnish it or perhaps $100. even then as we have not matron we should have to employ a colored cook which would place is in nearly the same relations to them that we are now so far as their living with us is concerned The cook notwithstanding her good qualities is sometimes a little cross--but I am doing all I can to make it pleasant for Miss Burke--as she is a good woman and a good teacher I have not talked with her scarcely any on this subject--yet she may write you--and I wished to forestall any bad impressions that might be made by a good yet weary and half discouraged lady.
