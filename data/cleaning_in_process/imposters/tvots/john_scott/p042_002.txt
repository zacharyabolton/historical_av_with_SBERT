You will perceive by reference to my Acct (you perceive) that by the timely aid of the Government I have been able to pay the rent on the school house for the month of April. The rent for the present month (May) is demanded in advance, and all my attemts to raise it seem fruitless. We have 10 days of grace yet left and if it is not obtained by that time we shall have to see the school turned out of the building, or I shall have to advance the money from my own pocket. Can not you apply again to the Gov't for aid this month, as you or Mr Smith were successful in April
