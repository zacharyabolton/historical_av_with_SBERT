I am receiving the Tribune--for which I am much obliged I first read it then hand it in the school room where it is perused with interest,-- and will tend to form a habit of reading among the pupils. The Blanks for Reports came also to night but my assistant did not. My number in school has gone up to 120 and more are coming The streets are yet full of scholars not attending any school. Some are coming in from towns 20 miles distant to board and attend our school My room is full On Saturday I tried to go, although I was advised not to attempt it on account of the rain which had raised the North Branch of the Shenandoah river so that it was not considered fordable It still rained some and before I left town my horse fell, throwing me from the saddle, but doing no other injury than daubing himself and the saddle and me in the mud. I tried again but the horse slipped so that I did not consider it safe to ride and especially to attempt to ford a deep river with a smooth shod horse. It was to late for further experiment and I sent a note down there by a man who happened to be going at night (He said the river event then was very high and unsafe for strangers.) I asked Mr Cockran (the man who made the application for teacher) to have the People take a vote to pay the teacher if they had not done it--and to inform me immediately what was the result of the vote. If they would vote to do as he represented they would--also if they were still in want of a teacher. The mail was due yesterday but did not come I hope it will tomorrow. I find by examining the records kept by the Bureau Agt that there has been for a month or two a little school kept there by a Colored man with but 15 scholars.--after learning their reply--act as you chose--Yet If he comes his work will not be lost This opinion of mine in regard to your sending a teacher forthwith or without further intelligence, is only to be taken for what it is worth, as the facts stated in the Application about their willingness to help pay and their intense desire for a teacher are supposed still to be the same
