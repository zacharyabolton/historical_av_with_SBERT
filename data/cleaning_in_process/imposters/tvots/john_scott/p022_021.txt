We Arrived safely, at about dark. Stayed at Richmond from 10 1/2 on Friday until this morning. Proceeded first after landing there to the Depot and found that we could not proceed until this morning Called on Col Brown who after some delay refered me to Chapl'n Manley and after further delay he was found, but as his house was already full of Teachers, and as the A. M. A. had no teachers staying in Richmond he could only refer us to the Monumental Hotel as a good place to stay. And we are now in Staunton I will keep you informed in regard to our movements.
