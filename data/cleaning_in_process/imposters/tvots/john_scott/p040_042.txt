I have had three applications for teachers of small schools near here. Greenville,  and Mt Solon. The last named place is about 15 miles from here and in the vicinity of several Union families This is the nearest point of Rail Road: There may be 30 scholars,--perhaps 40--: They are very anxious, and pledge themselves to board a teacher and pay ten dollars per month in addition. They are able and one of the men (colored) wanted me to inform him as soon as possible if you couldn't send a teacher. I haven't seen the place. I told him I would write. (over) I hope you will conclude to send me another teacher as per yesterday's request--if you can
