We shall close school two or three days before the first of June, or soon enough next week to permit the ladies to reach home before Saturday night. Will send your Reports in time. Please see that vouchers for rent are sent in time. The colored people are quite anxious now to erect a school house  your visit, but as they owe $1200 on their cemetery which they are trying to pay for, and as the Spring finds them mostly destitute of funds having used their surplus during the winter, I dont see as anything can be done, at least it does not appear to me expedient to attempt it until Autumn, unless it is likely that the Govt. money will be exhausted by that time so that no aid can be had from that source. If that is likely to be the case and you have any means of making an estimate in regard to it, plase give your opinion.
