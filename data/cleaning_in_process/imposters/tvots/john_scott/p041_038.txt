I am unexpectedly happy to inform you that our lost box about which I yesterday wrote you has arrived. Will acknowledge it in due [unclear: form]--when examined I sometimes wish that I had some kind of commission or license from you to "Exhort" or "Preach."-- or that the word "Preach" was introduced in my Commission. Not that I desire to turn minister father than now and in case of absence of the pastor here or as I might have opportunity to speak to the people in addition to what the pastor might say--or now and then as occasion might offer. I have enough to do with my school duties, but when I see how much these people need instruction from the Bible rather than a religious "Pow-wow" over it - I long to help them. And while the intent and nature of my mission is such as to make it my duty perhaps to do this in some way--yet I have not in this place said scarcely a word in any religious meeting except the Sabbath School since I have been here;--for I knew that even in case of a few remarks from me, that the spirit and disposition of this most arrogant colored minister is such that through his ignorance and jealousy and even malice he would be likely to ask me for my Credentials. He so monopolises all religious meetings that I could not do much if I had your Authority--nor do I think at would be best at all to disturb regular organizations or appointments, but once in a while, I might quietly do good if I was thus armed with my papers
