The Boxes numbered 28 came 2804 + 2805 came and were found to contain all represented in the accompanying Invoice. But the Eureka Chart--are marked $15.00 which must be a mistake. The charts are not mounted or varnished nor on pasteboard but only on thin sheets of paper, and there are but two numbers 1 and 2.--and perhaps--a doz. of each no. (which was more than was needed all of the same kind)--Now the maps, an excellent set are only marked $16.00 all mounted and with cloth back etc. These charts should not cost over $4. by any means and probably not that. You may wish to correct that. Please inform Mr Smith that as the month is nearly up, I shall need Blanks for Monthly Reports very soon.
