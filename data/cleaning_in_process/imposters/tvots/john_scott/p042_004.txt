I have enclosed two letters in behalf of the Colored Baptist Church After reading please forward with accompanying note of your own or such endorsement as you see proper--or without any if you think proper--and if there is any reason of which you know, why these letters or either of them, should not be forwarded at all, you may destroy them, but if it is best--send them on, and I really hope they will do good. I have forgotten the address of that Home Missionary Society and am not certain as to the exact title--but think it is the American Home Missionary Society,-- (I know it is not the Presbyterian)--Please supply if I have omitted in the address
