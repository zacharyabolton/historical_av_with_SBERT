I received a note from the rooms, I suppose as it was written on paper with the printed heading of yours, but signed S R. Montross in which letter was stated that there are th four boxes of clothing on the way for Freedmen Now as it is summer almost and the people are at work I think the most of them will be able to pay a trifle on these clothes, What I wish to ask is. What I shall do with the money? Shall I hand it over to Mr Tukey as I do book money at the end of each month and then use it to mitigate your expenses? The church in which we teach is not yet secure as there is $166. yet due on the first installment of $666. At your suggestion it might be applied to help pay that and would be of advantage. I dare not leave the thing so insecure to go home at vacation for no one knows what these secesh negrohaters would do The colored people think of holding a fair the first of May to raise the money and I think they will nearly do it We have just held a concert of religious pieces mostly, among the children of the day school and raised 54 dollars to help pay for the church.
