I ordered one dozen [unclear: Lid] lamps with chimneys and wick in sufficient numbers,-- also 3 or 4 bells to call our different schools, and a few Testaments for family use, Those things cannot be had at Staunton; therefore [unclear: I] sent to the rooms. But for the want of these things I have sent home to Connecticut for a bell to call my school together and have received it. But as to the Lamps--we are to borrow one and place it upon a table in the centre of the room for 40 or 50 scholars.  In another room it is almost impossible to write by our tallow candles and yet scholars are bending over their books and writing with no other light; Yet to furnish sufficient light from tallow it requires nearly as many candles as there are scholars, Now if you have not sent the lamps will you do so at your earliest convenience. I am unexpectedly obliged to send another order as we are nearly out of some kinds of books and are wanting some not sent in our last  box. You will please send by next Steamer or express without fail the following--invoice 300 copies of Sanders pictorial Primer (green back) 50 " Sanders 3rd reader 24 " Writing books No 1 36 """" 2 36 """" 3 Some paper and envelops 100 copies of "Infant Sabbath School Questions" or some other Sabbath school question book suitable for Freedmen who have just learned to read, or are beginning to read. Also One Set of Sanders Charts
