I have already stated the trouble that I have had in regard to the colored people about a school house. I never before was turned out-doors by any-body until the school with their teacher was driven out of the church by the colored minister. And the school will never be very successful until there is a school house here. We want a building large enough to accomodate 800 scholars. Now how can we obtain it. The colored people ar already in debt - having just purchased a cemetery for $1200 and the baptist denomination are now trying to build a church. I have made application to the Gov't for aid and find the appropriation exhausted. The colored people have land here, now, can any money for the building of school houses be obtained from the Peabody fund on any condition, and if so, on what condition. Have you any circulars or printed information. There is I suppose an Agt. in this city, but I am entirely unacquainted with the business methods of applying for this fund or with the specific object of it further than the newspaper acct of such a fund having been left for the benefit of schools in the country. If it can be properly used for such a purpose I would like to obtain something for a school building.
