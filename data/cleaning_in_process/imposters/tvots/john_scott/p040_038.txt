(Appendix to Vol. 1) Being in doubt about the propriety of sending this letter, I have held it over until now to see what circumstances might be developed This lady (Miss Davison) works well in the Sabbath school and is going to be, of considerable use in the day school. Still it is an unfavorable place for a teacher to improve herself in the field, and particularly in this field, where even more seems demanded of a competent teacher than she would be able to perform; And while I could get along in some way, by hiring a colored assistant, without any change or any more help from you, still the previous letter and the reasoning therin remains in nearly all the force in which I have written it. I suppose that the church in Chester  would pay Miss D's board in case another teacher should come, as these people would not  than support two. My Books have arrived and as soon as I can see if they are all right according to the Invoice--I will send the receipt.
