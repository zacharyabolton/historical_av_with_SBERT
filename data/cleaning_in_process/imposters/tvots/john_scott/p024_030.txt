The Boxes No. 1608./9/10/12/13, containing clothing, came on the 20th and your instructions were received on the 21st. We shall abide by the latter. Miss Dewey is rejoicing over your acceptance of the resignation, based upon a request that she hastily importuned me to Approve. All I have to  is that you did not receive my letter of explanation on the subject at the same time you did her letter and had not the facts before you upon which to act, but she seems determined to go any way The explanation was this (if you did not get my letter) That as she made it appear necessary to leave, upon the spur of the moment I signed my approval But upon a more careful consideration I could not endorse the fact which she stated that the numbers would become less in school in the month of June except in night school (and they will there I almost hope, for we can't do them justice, there are so many.) And in case they do not fall off in numbers we can not take her school as we have our hands full already. I remarked last eve that very likely my letter did not reach you at the same time hers did and in consequence of which you might see fit to reconsider, your decision But mayor  (in whom she seems somewhat interested) intimated that it would not make much difference if you should reconsider I want at least to discharge my duty in regard to this matter. If she goes (as she doubtless will) and the numbers continue and you do not see fit to send any body in her place, Shall I hire one of my best, first class, scholars to take charge of the school, as it is under my eye, in the same room,-- provided such an one can be persuaded to do it, and will work for a small sum, for four weeks?
