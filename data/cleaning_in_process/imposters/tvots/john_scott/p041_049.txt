Do the schools [unclear: at] Wilmington close early? Can you tell when for I want to see Bro Beals before his school closes. In regard to our school here and its early close I am more and more convinced that if we expect to continue a school here another year, that it is expedient to send a teacher for the summer, and close early if necessary to do it, for I think one teacher for 3 months will be of much more use now than three teachers one month.
