Believing that I was carrying out your wishes and acting in accordance with the best interest of our work I have closed the school this day--and have myself left Staunton after more carefully considering the question; as to the expediency of remaining to put up a school house. You advised me to remain if I could raise money for that object--and labor to that end for a month.--but after consulting the most interested among the colored people. I called a meeting last night and the result was a decision that we should not succeed in raising money at this time I waited still for advice from you but as I received nothing further, and as sickness and other causes had reduced the school--therefore I thought it your wish to close The reason why we can not raise money at this time I gave in another letter I will inform you fully on my return to New York The meeting was very encouraging in favor of building I am going to Hampton, Norfolk Beaufort and Wilmington A letter would reach me at Wilmington  early part of next week--or a Telegram at Norfolk--tomorrow (Wednesday)
