Y.,-- and also if teachers still go to No 2 Nelson place to board in passing through the city if so--near what st and ave. is it Welcome on Friday the 21st as they have troubled me about rent and I think that, tho a week before the first of June will please you I don't know as I shall come directly on to N. Y. as I want to see the work and may go to Norfolk Hampton Beaufort and Wilmington before I come home. I want to see how school houses are made and get facts to collect on [unclear: it] the north.
