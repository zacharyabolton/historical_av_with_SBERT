I write to inquire how boxes are to be directed now so as to come by Government Transportation from the Rooms of the American Missionary Association in N.Y. to me in Staunton Va. Heretofore the Bills of [unclear: Leading] were signed by the Agt. of the Bureau, but now that there is no Bureau I don't know how to get packages boxes of books and clothing. Yet as the Educational Department of the Bureau is to continue I suppose that there a way to get books from N.Y. by Government. I thought either yourself or Maj. White C.Q.M., Bureau F. R. & A.L. would be able to inform me.
