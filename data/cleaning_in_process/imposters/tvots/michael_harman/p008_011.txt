I send out today four (4) horse wagons and and two horse wagons & harness, all property which I have directed to be turned over to your command, part of them loaded with corn for Greenbrier River. Do me the favor to write me if it will be necessary to impress additional transportation if I can send you 6 to 8 wagons & teams [unclear: along] belonging to the Confederate States. I desire if you can do so, that you will demit the teams impressed to be returned as fast as I send out state teams to take the place of them. Capt. Hull, Quarter Master at Greenbrier River says his horses are suffering for corn & it cannot be supplied from that county. He also wrote he wanted a large quantity of clothing of various sorts, which I sent to the Quarter Master General. He [unclear: answers] me that he has a very small quantity of clothing & that Capt. [unclear: Hull] does not make a requisition allowance to support that. It would be well for a regular requisition to be put in for what clothing is required for any portion of your command, as winter is approaching & the [unclear: county] you are now in [unclear: requiring] comfortable clothing & c. Please tell me & I will get any article that can be had, that is necessary for your command. Maj. [unclear: Corley] being on the other line I must hear from your [unclear: company] &  like to be kept well posted as to your wants.
