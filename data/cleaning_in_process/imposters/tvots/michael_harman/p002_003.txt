I have your letter The fact that Mr. [unclear: Pulz] says he has no one to drive his impressed team but his son who has volunteered (or is at least subject to Military duty) is an excuse often made to get rid of the military duty -- the Government will hire or impress a careful driver. Judge Thompson has refused a half dozen writs of Habeus Corpus during the last few days mostly from your county to cause the surrender of volunteers between the ages of 18 & 21_-- under 18 he grants the writ & requires the surrender. Mr. Moore gives the [unclear: issue] interpretation of the Law but the Judge says that he has given the matter due consideration & read all the reported cases carefully & decides as I have stated -- an infant over 18 is compelled to perform military duty - & being called into service he goes into a volunteer company as a choice over the militia. I must further say that if yourCountys quota is reduced and I apprehend it will be and the loss is not made up I am directed to again call the militia out - I hope you will so arrange it as to prevent the disagreeable necessity of such a step. I am surprised to learn from many of the applicants from your county that they were induced or seduced to join by improper and undue means; of this I know nothing and do not credit it, but it is bringing a change against your commands which ought to be desired, at least. Under the circumstances I cannot let off young [unclear: Pulz] to drive his fathers team - or from his volunteer company unless another acceptable volunteer is furnished in his place. If the team is not sent I will be compelled to send a [unclear: force] for it which Mr. [unclear: Pulz] should not permit as there is a penalty attached to the offence. My instructions are [unclear: positive] to see that your quota is full. The place of every one exempted before they are marched away must be followed up or the militia must go enmasse is the order of the Governor -
