I have purchased some 8000 bushels of corn, knowing your want am sending it forward rapidly, together with company supplies of all sorts. Major [unclear: Corly] the quarter Master for the north west being stationed off your line at Hardy [unclear: V] the business in that Department from some cause is badly arranged on the Monterey line,for instance I have sent out thousands of bags with grain & c & not one has ever been returned for supplies. I have again been compelled to commence the impressments of wagons & pledge the farmers that their teams shall only be kept one trip. My object in writing to you direct, is to ask the favor of you to direct the return of all the bags & also all the wagons & teams that can be spared. I will return them immediately with corn & oats for the horses, which you so much need. Col. J. B. Baldwin also wishes grain & c. sent to the Petersburg Line. With your aid I trust I will be able to keep both lines well supplied, but it is a matter of utmost importance that there should be a prompt return of any spare wagon, empty bags &c &c. Teams are of little use when feed cannot be supplied. With great consideration and respect I am,
