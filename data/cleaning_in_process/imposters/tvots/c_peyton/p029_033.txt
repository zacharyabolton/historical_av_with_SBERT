The boy James is not willing to go with Richard. That is: was not some time ago. I have not mentioned the matter to him since Richard's last application for him. The boy James also stated that Richard did not marry a sister of his. There can be no doubt but what the boy is better cared for & his condition better every way, then if Richard had him [unclear: bound] his mother she died when James was an infant. Since then I have taken good care of him. He is just getting large enough now to do a little something, which is the sole cause of Richards anxiety concerning him. I shall not give him up until compelled to.
