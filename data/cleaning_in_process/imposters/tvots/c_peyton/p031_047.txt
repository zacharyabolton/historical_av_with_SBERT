I am due Sarah Skinner $7.10/100 balance on wages. She notified me yesterday of her intention to quit & did so immediately upon said notification, leaving me without in an awkward position with no one to take her place. She applied at the office this morning for her money. I informed her that I could not settle with her until my sister returned as she was Chamber Maid & I did not know what charges she might have against her for lost towels, sheets & &--& this is our  not to settle with floor servants until we know how their [unclear: acts ] stand in this particular & in her absence I cannot get at it. Sarah is a  unreliable servant, I can assure But I am justly due her $7.10 provided we have no counter charges, and I will pay her as soon as I ascertain that fact. I cannot do so before.
