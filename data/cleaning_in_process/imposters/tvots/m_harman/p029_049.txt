Your note is at hand, and I am unable to give you any information in regard to Elisabeth Galloway, my information is she was sold to N M Lee of Richmond, but I am not certain of that fact. A letter addressed to N.M. Lee at Richmond [unclear: will] receive a prompt reply, as he doubtless keeps a register of all he purchased & sold.
