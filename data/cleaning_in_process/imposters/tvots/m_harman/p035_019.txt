I made the arrangement with Wash Swink Jr. to take [unclear: Dinna's] Baby Boy John for one year at $4 Dollars per month he commenced about 17th January 1867 and left Mr. Swink about 5 April 1867, [unclear: remaining] 2 mos & 20 days. he states he bought him a pair of shoes for which he paid $3.50 and gave him a shirt & pair pants worth $2.50 as he would have received if he had complied with his contract $10.47 for the time. In my opinion taking into consideration the time of the year, he kept him, when he was of but little Service to him. I think he has paid him enough unless the Boy is made to comply with his contract & serve the Balance of the Year in which event Mr. S. ought to pay Balance & not otherwise.
