well Mag I suppose you have heard that I have moved here. I heard the other day that you were living at Mr Dulls, and I write this to know wheather you will come and live with me a while. I would like you would come if you posibly can. I want you to work as soon as you get this and let me know wheather you can come or not and what you charge a week if you can come Mr. Cook will go for you. I think I would rather have you as I am acquainted with you or used to be, it is a long while since I saw you I have been looking for you to see me ever since we came here I will have to close the stage will be here directly and I want to send it if you get this I want an answer forthwith just as soon as you can write it. for if you cant come we will have to try some one else.
