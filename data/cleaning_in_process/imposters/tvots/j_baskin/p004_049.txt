As you are aware I failed in getting an appointment to West Point. Since that time I have been offered very flattering inducement by a gentleman of Iowa. for the purpose of gaining and education and Mother is very anxious that I should go. She told me to write to you. to know if in your opinion there is any likelihood of an early settlement of those cases as she wishes me to go to Iowa. as it is entirely out of Grand Pa's power to aid me as he has recently bought a farm which he has to pay for this year. or to know if there is any Surety of anything being realized from those suits. if that was Sure I might get Some kind friend to advance a Small Sum for me. indeed it would take but $500. (five hundred) for my whole education. You may think it strange that I did not get information on these points from Grand Pa But he says he knows very little about it. Please answer this as early as convenient you will also accept my thanks for your efforts on my behalf in regard to West Point.
