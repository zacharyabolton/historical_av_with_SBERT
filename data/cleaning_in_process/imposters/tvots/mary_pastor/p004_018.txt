I will vary the general rule by writing to you instead of Mother & thereby give you the pleasure of w----- opening the letter before you get home. First I know you want to know how we are. I am very well only a little too cold. Georgie is out here with me & as well as ever. Mr Smith has taken a great fancy to him & says he likes him better than any Cochran he ever saw. Willie is in Staunton I believe he is very well & intended going to Mr Swopes to day- Howe Peyton I saw yesterday he had been a little sick but was getting very well He had not been in bed at all. The 4th was celebrated here in a grand style. The Winchester company were here & their uniform was that worn in 1776. Buckskin pants & large boots & ruffle shirts. I admired it more than any I saw at all. The Charlottesville company was very pretty & the best drilled by far. They were so much pleased that the Capt. went off & left them all in Staunton. The dinner was in the bottom of Mr Greys yard & he invited us up to his house where we took our dinner & saw every-thing without being in the crowd at all Of course there were a few fights All the Mickies, Harmans, & Garbers got in a fuss with the "West Agusta Guards", because a Garber Harman got drunk & tried to force through the guard & the officer pointed his musket & threatened to fire. Bo Jimmie said out loud that "he thought Mr Garber Harman ought to be put in jail & his father heard it & told Jimmie that he inter took that as a personal insult & would see him, but Jim in his way laughed it off & said it was nothing but the truth. Every thing was very quiet when we left town yesterday evening I suppose the Ch-ville co left this morning- The [unclear: Carringtons] got here Monday and are staying at Mr Imbodens. We all went to see them. Cousin Sue Baldwin invited them to her house last night. I don't know how long they will stay in Town The Peytons are quite delighted with cousin Campbell & cousin John Preston; so much so that they have invited them up every day & evening since they have been here. Aunt Sarah & Lizzie are fixing to go to Bath. They will go some time next week. Has Monty Lewis ever sent the curls or has he written about them. May be he is waiting for the money-I wish you would send them on by express to Uncle Ben Crawford - Last night we had to have a large fire & this morning it is still cold, a very great change from the 29th of June in Charlottesville. Aunt Maria got a ripe tomato out of her garden yesterday. Georgie says he would have written before but could not get Pen, ink, or paper at Uncle [unclear: Miffetts]. He will write while out here, as I can supply him with those articles. Aunt Sarah says you had better send Georgie his winter jacket to wear out here How is the gas gotten on - Have you gotten the [unclear: Chan deli-- ] yet[unclear: ?] & what kind are they to be? I do not like the brass ones at all. I like bronze ones with green enamel let in - The people in Staunton talk of nothing else & last Sunday cousin Sue Baldwin wanted us to go to the Presbyterian Church to see the gass - Well I believe I have written all I know. I hope to hear from home soon.
