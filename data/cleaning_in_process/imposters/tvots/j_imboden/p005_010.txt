I got home from Richmond Saty. evening & found your letters here- I purposely delayed writing to you till I could do so Satisfactorily- I have made a contract with the Waddells- I paid them $500. for the exclusive right to Sell their invention for 5 years throughout the United States- I am to pay all my expenses and account to them for 2/3rds of the amount of Sales, every three months,- They binding me not to dispose of my 1/3rd interest to any one during the 5 years- I have been to Richmond- Have had a number of these Couplings made for trial- They will be put on the Central road today, and worked up on the mail train West, tomorrow- I haveno doubt of its entire success- I now make you this proposition Take any State you choose except Va & Maryland (& here you may still have the Va & Tenn R.R.) do your best at it and after paying your expenses first out of the 1/3rd I am entitled to from the Waddell's divide equally with me- And then, if after you have made this experiment, you are willing to go on with other States, on the same terms--it's all right- By this arrangement I don't ask or expect you to pay any part of the $500- If you agree to go into it, come over and we will fix all the necessary papers- The Waddells were not willing to sell to any one but myself individually- & would not contract to sell to me till I agreed not to sell out- But under their deed to me I can employ any agents I choose on any terms I please- & under this clause you & I can arrange matters- Ritchie & [unclear: Dunnarant] are Lithographing it for me, so that a circular may be sent to every RR office in the U. States- I am greatly encouraged by what has been said of the invention by RR men. I have made arrangements to put it on the Baltimore & Ohio RR in a few days- I have no doubt of a sale to them- Gill must be mistaken when he says McDaniel has seen this coupling. I am sure he never has- He has seen one invented & patented by an Alexandria man about the same time- I have examined it- It will couple pretty well- but there is no provision made for uncoupling the cars- It wont answer at all. He has it in Richmond, but mine knocked it into such a [unclear: cocked] hat that the fellow left- I write in much haste-Give our love to Coz. Liz-Mary's Sisters are here-
