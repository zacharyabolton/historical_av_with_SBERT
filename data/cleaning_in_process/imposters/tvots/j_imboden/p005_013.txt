I have just read your note in regard to the "ways and means." I am sorry you did not mention the matter to me a day or two sooner. I had plenty of money a day since--but The Major was in a tight place yesterday, and I let him have nearly all the funds I had on hand--However I will endeavor to collect some money tomorrow, which, together with what I have, will answer both our purposes, so that I want you to come on to Charlottesville with what money you have, and I will supply the deficiency for the trip--I do not expect to go with you to Philadelphia. I shall stop in Baltimore to get the thing put through the Balt & Ohio R. R. Compy. if possible, and leave you to put Phila. through on your own hook--
