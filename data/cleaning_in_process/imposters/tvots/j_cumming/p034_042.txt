Your favor dated 21 inst. has been received and I say in reply that I do not know where her parents live now. This time last year they were in this city and they called on me and at that time Dr James Miller being in the city I gave his address and I directed them to obtain all necessary information from them him Dr. J Miller in reference to the girl about home you write, I have on several occasions put them on the track of finding his girl but they seem to be such shiftless people that they did nothing. It only remains now to advertise in the "Balti Sun."
