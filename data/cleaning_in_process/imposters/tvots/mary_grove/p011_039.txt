I seat myself this evning to write you a few lines to let you know that I am in the land of the living. I have not heard from you for so long, that I do not know wheather I writing to the living or dead. I know that you will be anxious to hear from Daniel, I have not heard from him since the fight at Manassas I dread to hear from him. I have heard of a good many from Augusta being killed but we have a hope if he is killed that he will be prepared to meet death. I thought he had changed a great deal. he staid here a week after he was wounded at port. I thought he went back too soon before he was able for duty. Abe was wonded at the Richmond fight by a minne ball in the side an inch more would have killed him he has got well, he is staying in Staunton now but expects to start to the army next week he came home yesterday evning he had a statement of the killed and wounded but it did not mention any thing about Daniel, but that dont console me, for I know sevral who have been sent home that were killed that was not mentioned on the paper Cap Patrick was buried yesterday but I suppose you will see an account in the paper, it is a dreadful state of affairs many a poor soul burried in to eterny unprepared. John hired a substitute papa would like to put one in for Daniel I am afraid he cant papa was hear the other day he was anxious to hear from Daniel george is a big boy and can talk any thing, I want you to send me a name for my little boy he looks like george. he is 7 months old he can walk around a chair. it is late, I must retire, good night. Please write soon and in future I will try and answer more prompt the friends are generaly well but Aunt Lizzie Corner is not well. when do you expect to come to Agusta will you not come this fall? excuse this no more
