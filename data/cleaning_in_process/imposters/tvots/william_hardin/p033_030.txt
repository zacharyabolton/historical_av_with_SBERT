I am sorry to say the boy Jeff. whom you hired me some two weeks ago, left during my absence without any cause or provocation. I had furnished him with several dollars worth of clothing & thought he was well satisfied, he is a good boy & any steps you can take to recover him for me will be thankfully recd. He is probably going in the way of Lexington & Lynchburgh. Will you be so kind as to inform the chief of the Bureau of each of the above places of the fact.
