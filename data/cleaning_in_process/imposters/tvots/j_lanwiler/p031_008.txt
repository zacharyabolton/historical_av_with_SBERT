In answer to communications addresssed to Head Quarters of Bureau by you in regard to the supply of medicines for indigent sick Freedmen I will state that if a list is made out of articles which are absolutely essential for the treatment of indigent sick, and but a moderate quantity of the several articles is asked for, I will try to furnish them. You will see that this requisition must be small, as there is no one who can formally receipt for the medicines at Staunton and I must furnish them from the Dispensary supplies receipted for by a medical officer here.
