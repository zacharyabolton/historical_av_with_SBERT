As President of the Board of Overseers of the Poor of Augusta County, I beg to make the following reply to your communication of the 26th inst. I cannot undertake to anticipate what the County Court of said County (the only body having power to raise money for County purposes) will do at its annual levy courts in June next, but I feel authorized to say that the Board over which I preside will ask that a sufficient sum shall be levied for to meet the necessities of the destitute persons having a claim upon legal residence in the County without regard to color or class, and I entertain no doubt but that said Court will make such levy and to that end, will assess an equal poll or capitation tax on all male inhabitants of the fixed age & who may not be exempt on account of physical infirmity. We expect to provide as heretofore for all the destitute alike if [unclear: our] people can stand the burden. We have a house of reception for the paupers (to which is attached a farm) capable of accomodating about sixty persons and have always made special appropriations (administered by members of our board) to aid in the support of poor persons not inmates of the poorhouse. In asmuch as we cannot forsee what number of helpless or idle persons may be thrown upon the charity of the county for support, and as it cannot be [unclear: expected] that any large amount of tax will help [unclear: amply] or be collected of the freedmen it is impossible to anticipate [unclear: whether] the amounts we may have levied will be sufficient to meet all wants of the poor & needy. I cannot say now what the poll or other tax will be. We have our [unclear: stated] meeting to fix the sum   apply for in the [unclear: deemed]  in next month. If an estimate shows [unclear: f---] that of the population in view it will be because there are more from in our county having [unclear: d------], than we are aware of or because our people are too poor, under present circumstances, to meet the demand, and if there should be a deficiency we [unclear: have] the Federal Government will [unclear: continue] it and its funds. Nothing can be expected from the [unclear: contemplated] levy until the end of the present year as the collection cannot account for the time & any help given before that time must be in the faith & credit of the County. I am not the representative of the Town of Staunton, but feel justified in saying that the overseers of the Poor acting in its behalf are [unclear: activated] by sentiments similar to those I have expressed for my board, but in as much as there has been an  influx of freedmen into the corporation from surrounding counties, I think it   at present the people can well meet all demands the destitute may make on its means, and [unclear: consequently] help may be needed of the Federal Government. Of one thing we can speak with certainty, everything humanity & justice may require within our ability to come up to will be done to [unclear: alleviate] & make contented & compatible the freedmen who have been thrown upon us for support, protection & .
