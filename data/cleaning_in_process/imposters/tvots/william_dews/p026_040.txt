Having heard that complaints have been against Mr F S Tukey, Asst Supt Freedman's Bureau at this place, I hereby certify that I was appointed by Mr Tukey (immediately after the order of Gen Howard organizing the Freedmans Court) to represent the Freedmen in said Court; as soon after [unclear: need] the appointment of Clerk in his office which places I held several months, and during that time I considered he administered the affairs of the Bureau with fairness and impartiality and I never knew or heard of his collecting any costs from either Whites or Blacks, or that he was guilty of any unfair dealings towards either party, and I am satisfied from what I [unclear: conceive] to be reliable information, that Mr Geo. Graham of the U S Burial Corps has been making himself very active in this matter, and as he has been making himself very prom officious among the Freedmen in regard to these complaints the inference I draw is that the whole thing is done in malice and for the purpose of injuring Mr Tukey. It may be proper for me to add that I have always been a Union man and have no sympathy with Rebels whatever and have been much persecuted by them during and since the war.
