Respectfully returned to Capt. R.S. Lacy Agent 7 Sub Dist Va with the information that I visted Bath County and could find no record in the clerks office in regard to the binding of Mary Gordon by the Court to S.C. Slavin To settle the matter definitely I obtained the enclosed letter from the clerk of the Court who told me he had them in the office this been years + could see no note of such a transaction in any of his books.
