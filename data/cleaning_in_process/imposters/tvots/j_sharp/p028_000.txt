The horse referred to by you in your communication of the 26th ult. was the property of the United States, but was appraised by an inspecting officer for the purpose of being sold to Col. Austin of the [unclear: 21st] Regiment. I am every day expecting him to be sent for by Capt Lacey. But should be not be sent for, I have concluded to keep him myself, as I have considerable territory under my charge and may need two horses. Very sincerely regretting that I cannot oblige you
