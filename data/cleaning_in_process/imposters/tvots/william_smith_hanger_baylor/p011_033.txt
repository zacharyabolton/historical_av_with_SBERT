We are no doubt preparing for an important movement - 3 days rations to be put into Haversacks - the enemy are not very far off - but we believe have fallen back - May God give us a great victory & preserve me to you & my child - I am in command of the Brigade - feel my inability for such a responsible position & rely only on heaven for wisdom & strength in the discharge of my Duties - All of the fellow officers present in the brigade and the Captain of batteries signed a most complimentary petition to have me made Brigd & Gen Jackson expressed regret that he did not know the wish of the Brigade and the he could not sign the papers - he had signed a letter on behalf of another person - you know I had told you before that I had told Gen Jackson I did not want promotion - Gen Jackson told them to send the petition to Richmond which they they did - I believe fully that my own conduct & [unclear: reservation] with Gen Jackson stopped my promotion - I have no regrets so far as my judgement is concerned, but of course my ambition is like everybody's. Gen A.P. Hill I understand wrote a complimentary recommendation. Say to father that my friends may do as they choose in this matter - To know that I am considered worth of so high a position is certainly a compliment long to be cherished. Harman I am satisfied cannot get it.   I had jacques with me yesterday - we are lying quite close together and no doubt will be near together in the fight may a kind Providence protect us both. I hope you & Lottie both with all at home are well - I do not feel well - but must keep   not to be sick again. Love to all -
