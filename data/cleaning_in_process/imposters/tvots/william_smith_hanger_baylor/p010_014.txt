I have not heard from you for sometime - but it is owing to the want of a mail - we have left the Valley and are now between Standardsville & Harrisonburg, about halfway between the two places. The enemy are now in the valley at Harrisonburg - their advance guard - but I do not think they will move very rapidly upon Staunton, for fear of being flanked by us - and we hope soon to be able to do so - that our force will allow us again to give them battle and by the blessing of Providence drive them from our homes.  Of course the people seen in great trepidation in Staunton and the accounts of the panic, on Friday and Saturday last, were exceedingly ludicrous & amusing -- women & children & negroes & especially the men & more especially the office-holding men - Quartermasters & Commisioners were seen running to & fro through rain & mud begging & hiring passage to some other point of safety - It is said that the Virgina Hotel was so completely deserted as to require it to be closed up - and all this panic when the enemy was at least 30 miles from them. I feel very anxious about Father & Mother &  I advised father to leave mother & may at home - but I heard they were all going to leave. I am almost sorry to advised at all - Trusting in a kind Providence to look over & take care of them I hope that it will be His pleasure to restore us all to our homes with liberty & peace & happiness smiling upon us & hearts full of gratitude for His mercy & goodness - It is a hard matter to give up home to the ruthless  of an enemy seeking our destruction and the  wisdom of God can alone see why it is done. Let us submit & pray for his blessing to restore us to him soon again & in His own good time. I forgot to tell you before that I have been promoted to the Colonelcy of the 5th Regt by its unanimous vote - But for the gratification of being thus restored to a position of which I was deprived so unjustly 12 months go I do not know that I should not decline the honor conferred & shrink from the great responsibility it imposes - It is no pleasant thought to have the care of the lives of 800 to 1000 men - I will use every effort to look after them - to be a father & leader - and I beseech you and all to pray to Heaven to give me the ability and assistance necessary for so hard a task & so responsible a position - I will have a fine regiment - one that loves me & will do everything I can to make it a pride & noble defence of the country - I do not like to say how you shall send your letters - for I do not know - send them however to Maj Gen Jackson army - Dear Lottie when shall I see her - I trust she is still improving - I will soon be allowed to see her father - the enemy are fast drawing their coils about Richmond & within them I fear you may come - If so remain at home & act as many of our noble women have done & you need fear no harm for God will protect you - Oh when will this avenging sword be drawn & wielded in the cause of the  - It cannot be that our cause is not just - It cannot be that we have so sinned as to be worthy of destruction - No it cannot be - He may be scourged [unclear: & we deserve it - we may be to the last extremity,] but if we rely upon God & do our duty the result will be our success.  The result at Yorktown I trust will be in our favor - a great success there would be glorious for our cause - It would almost put a stop to the War - I feel much confidence in the result as we have noble Generals & brave troops to rely upon. I am not so well as usual - though not sick - my liver is torpid and I fear it may result in dispepsia or jaundice - I will go into the field tomorrow and will be considerably more exposed than I have been - but will take care of myself. I am in a considerable strait about my mess and have written to McBell to buy me a full set of everything and bring a good cook. He promises to be with me & he will be very useful - He is now at home making arrangements to send off his cattle & everything - & will be back in a few days - write me a long letter - love to all - Kiss Lottie Remember me to Jacques -
