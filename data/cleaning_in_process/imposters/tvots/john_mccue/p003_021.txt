It has been several days since I have written to you and several since I heard from you. I am anxiously expecting a letter from My Dear Absent Honey: Your presence my love is indispensable to my happiness. The longer I live in the world the more necessary are you to my peace of mind. The more I know you, the more is my love strengthened. It increases daily. May God in his mercy spare us to each other years to come, for how long could one live without the other! During the day, when my mind is absorbed with business, its perplexities & annoyances, I do not so sensibly experience that you & my children are from me, but when night begins to settle around me in glooming silence, there is an aching void. My thoughts revert to you & them. I wish I could but hear your sweet [unclear: ceurding] angelic voice & the merry laugh of my merry & interesting children. God bless them! Do they ever speak of their absent Papa, and express the desire to see him? That laughing, merry, ever moving little [unclear: Olie]--How I miss her as mornings breaks into my chamber! No little cherub [unclear: lum] to crawl upon my breast, wake me with a kiss and whisper "Papa." It is now past eleven at night: to the commencement of this letter, Mr I & myself have been engaged in business with two gentlemen in Mr. I's parlor: He has gone to bed, and I am now athis table in the parlor engaged in holding sweet commune with my wife! Wife!! How endearing that name. How many lies and associations connected with the past, and hopes connected with the future are embraced in that simple word wife!! But this is indulging in reflections that make me sad: the distance is short, separating us. The time I trust will not be long before I shall see you, kiss you and embrace you in my arms. I saw Otelia C. this morning. She will not depart for Martinsburg before Saturday, in as much as James [unclear: Daman] as informed her thro letter that he will be here Friday to see her. His last letter to her recd yesterday, is long, most interesting & shows his affection to be strong as ever. She regrets exceedingly to leave without seeing you. Says she loves you as a sister, and fears her visit to you was not as pleasant to you as it should have been- -&c. I assured her to the contrary. I think she is a noble girl--& her resolve to teach, to be useful, to live to a purpose is the strongest evidence of her elevation of character & nobleness of soul. I believe I told you of Mr Castleman's call to Baltimore at a salary of $2000. An effort is now being made to raise his salary here to $1400 as an inducement for him to remain amongst us. He has greatly improved of late as a preacher and if he is not retained, I fear another as acceptable cannot be had. But $1400 is too much for a villagechurch to pay, and give a house. More anon. Mr Wilson has accepted the call of the Presbyterian's & will be here in the spring. Dont fail to have Mr. Imboden invited to Conny's wedding. He will go if he possibly can. Our Special Court commences the 24th and not the 10-(to day) as I supposed. If we go, you must, if you expect to return home the last of the month, make your arrangements to return the day after the wedding, for we have been retained in the big suit of McDowell Exon vs Hugh John Crawford, which may be called up the first day of the court. I expect to go to Roanoke in a few days, probably Friday. If not then, on Monday next. If we go [unclear: South], it will be out of our power to do so, until after the rising of the Court. It will then be later in the Spring and decidedly more pleasant. At the season of the year proposed by you, we might have a terrible time of it. Dr. [unclear: Seehass] is here & family. Cousins Sally & Eliza called on her to day. They report her to be a most pleasant lady. The Dr has thrown himself into our hands, and we have provided a snug place for him. You know [unclear: Moupin] acting no doubt under the advice of Stuart threw him off because Dr H would not consent to make his paper the organ of him, Sandy. He Dr H is to go into the Messenger as a partner of   and that sheet is to be known as the "American Reformer" and tooadvocate the principles of the American party, known by some as the Know Nothing party. This is to be a profound secret until the paper is issued, which will not be till next week. So my love you must not speak of it to any one. For I would not be the means of divulging it for the world. Sandy has become very cool towards us. Never comes to our office, & never calls us into his. He has all this time been making a tremendous effort to win us to his support for governor, but we would not be caught in that [unclear: way]. We are determined to let the K. N.s nominate & then we will support their ticket. This is the advice now of all the Whig papers & Stuart is bound to yield. Save now to our dear Small Mama, God bless her. A thousand kisses to you love--& my children--love to Annie, [unclear: Leil] & Nellie. Mr I, Cousin E. & Maj. E, send [unclear: march]  Good night. You are dreaming I know, of your absent husband--[unclear: Ihercam on] darling--[unclear: the wishes of the pass] & innocent are always pleasant. May god protect you from harm & my children & our dear [unclear: nickted] &  is the prayer of your
