I have a chance by my "Dutch" neighbor Fredk. Baker to say a word, and it is that you write me by him if you have not done it, in answer to mine of yesterday by Mr. Brodt which I hope you have recd. Also get me a Spectator this evening if possible and send by him--I get it two days sooner--  Talbot Coleman is here since yesterday mng. fr. the Augusta [unclear: Spns.] taking another sketch of our town from another point below mybarn. He thinks the scenery around, water included, the finest he has seen any where. Mr Beyer & lady came down with him in the stage on their way to Harrisonburg, where he designs sketching the city of the "Suabians"--He was much very much pleased with our town as also [unclear: was] his "brow"--  Two of our young friends, Allen Trimble Thompson & Saml Hubben Jr are on their way horseback from Hillsboro to see us--So wrote Gen Trimble to me on Sat. They are in delicate health, having first finished their collegiate course are both preparing for the ministrythe first in the Methodist the other in the Presbyterian church--and are both unusually clever--Hibben is a nephew of Thos. Barry, Thompson a gr. son of Uncle Allen Trimble-- Be sure & drop me a line this evening--
