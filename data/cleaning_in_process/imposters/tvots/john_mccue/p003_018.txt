By Mr. Hotchkiss & wife who expect to be in Staunton, tomorrow, I drop a note to trouble you as usual with enquiries &c--and it may be some matter of business in a small way--Has J. D. I. got back--if so what was the fate of the Dora rail-roading privilege bill in the House (the charter &c I see passed)? If the former passed--was it, as from the Senate? How are the prospects of the Cent. & Cov. & Ohio--& especially what of the chances for ejecting Crozet? Pray do not become frightened at the extent of my queries--  I return you the letters sent by me--I have recd now  a letter of apology from D r . Converse of Phild a  in regard to a mistake in insertion--the  of [unclear: Lima], in the Observer--I do not exactly know hwat it is, until I see the paper My neighbor D. M Fall cannot last much longer--consumption doing its work rapidly. Have had a house full of young friends for a day or two, Coz. Nannie Reid, Sallie & Bettie Crawford, Mollie Eubanks, Robt Poagers, D. N. & B. Van Lear, B. Estill &c-- Mr. Hotchkiss has a small package that I have directed to Dr Harris, which I wish you will embrace an early & safe transmission for to him, by some one going to Richmond--Can you not? It may be, I will send two packages--one quite small & containing some "jewelry"--of this am not entirely sure now. Write me, if you can. I am quite anxious to hear the news from Richmond. Call & see Mrs. H. if you have time. Pease send me word for Eliza--if you have heard anything since I left. My love to Coz. [unclear: Sig.] & family--
