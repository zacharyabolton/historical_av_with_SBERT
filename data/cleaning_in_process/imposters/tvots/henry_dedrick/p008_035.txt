I have  your most affectionate letter. I will send you a few more lines to let you know that I got it. I had wrote a letter and sealed it up and I tore it open again. Dear wife I was glad to hear from you. You don't know how much good it done me when I got it. I received it with....  Dear brother and sister I have an opportunity to send you a few lines to let you know that I am well at present, and I hope these few lines may find you all enjoying the same state of health. As I have an opportunity to send you a few lines in with H. H. Dedrick letter I thought I would do so, as I have sent two or three to my wife and I have got no answer yet I thought I would try it in his and see what is the matter. Give my love to aunt Rebecca and Amanda and all of my inquiring friends. We have good preaching here and prayer meeting regular. As it is getting dark I have to close my few lines and so nothing more at present but remember your affectionate brother until death Hiram Coyner to brother and sister. I want you to write to me Lissa you will please hand this to John or Beck & oblige Hiram Coyner
