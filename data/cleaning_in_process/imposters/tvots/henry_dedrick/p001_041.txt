Dear Lissa you said in your letter that the little boy weighed 28 lbs. I don't think he has gained much. I want you to kiss him for me as I don't have no chance to kiss him myself and when you kiss him think of me. I weighed some three weeks ago and I only weighed one hundred and seventy eight and William Offlighter weighed 177. There was but one pound between us. Well I must bring my. William Offlighter sends his love to you all also Hiram Coyner. Give my love to all. I heard that they had sent for Gerard and David Gray. I thank god that they have not had the chance to send for me. I thank the lord for his kindness towards me that he has give me good health. If I don't meet you on earth I hope to meet you in heaven above where parting will be no more. I must close for this time. Please excuse me for this time. Write soon. So nothing more but remain your affectionate husband until death.
