I take this opportunity  I have not for some time. I have not wrote since I saw father. I am well at present.  ...all the creek boys is well and hearty. E. W. Sillings has come here last Thursday. He is well. If you see his wife or can send her any word tell her that he is here. I must close as the man that I want to send it by is about to start. I have more news but I have no time. You must write soon and direct your letters as you have heretofore. May god bless you all. So nothing more but remain your affectionate husband until death separates us from this world. Fare you well dear wife. I hope I will soon get home again. I want you to kiss Willie for me. Give my love to all.
