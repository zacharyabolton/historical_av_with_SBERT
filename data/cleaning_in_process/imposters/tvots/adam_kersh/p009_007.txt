I take this opportunity to write a few lines home I received your letter dated on December 15th on the 19th and was glad to hear from you all I wrote a letter home on the 9th of December and on the 16th I suppose you did not get all the letters I wrote home Some must have been mislaid I have been writing nearly every week on an average We have been trimming and burning brush ever since the fight we had no fortifications for the canon the day of the fight we have five now we have been blockading some roads also and extended our trenches around further we will have a better chance at the yanks if they come now the brush being burnt from around our fortifications they had a better chance then we had the day of the battle they could lay behind the brush and logs concealed and when we would raise up to look for them they would fire at us they knew exactly where to look for us in the trenches we had a false alarm here last Monday we were ordered in our trenches about five o'clock in the morning all the regiments were ordered in the trenches we waited for the Yankees till about an hour by sun and no yanks come so we went home to our breakfast disappointed the way the alarm got out was that some of our men slipped the pickets that night to hunt some liquor and When they returned the pickets heard them and took them to be yanks and fired a couple rounds on them and run in no one was hurt Wm Cupps is doing pretty well now since he has been put on duty he had done no duty since he belonged to the army worth naming until a few weeks ago the Doctor would not have him on the sick list no longer so he had to go on duty Wm H Fry is well and bustling around Jacob Harvey Craun is nearly well again he is taken off the sick list and goes on duty again Adam Craun is not well & has not been for some time having a kind of diarrhea and jaundice Adison L.
