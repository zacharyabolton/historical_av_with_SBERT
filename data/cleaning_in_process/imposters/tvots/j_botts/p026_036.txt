This is to certify that I have been Mail Agt between Richmond & Staunton for about eighteen months and during that time have been acquainted with Mr F S Tukey Asst Supt Freedmens Bureau, after visiting his office and house and that I have never to my recollection heard one word of complaint against him neither by whites or blacks until since Lieut Cook was relieved here and I believe that he is generally respected by the Freedmen and Union Men. I never heard anything about his being intimate with rebels but believe he has conducted himself at all times in a manner becoming a Government Officer.
