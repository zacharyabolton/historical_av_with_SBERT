Yours of this date in reply to my note of yesterday is duly received & I beg leave respectfully to say: As the party I represent is in possession of the Church edifice referred to we must, I presume be in the position of a defendant against some adverse claim. Occupying this position, I submit for your consideration whether it is not in accordance with what is usual & proper that we shall know, before we answer the claim or complaint which we are called upon to respond. I had supposed that the investigation was founded upon some assertion of right adverse to ours, but it now appears that the conflicting claims are to be asserted before you & that you have already received a statement of the plaintiff's pretensions. I beg leave respectfully to ask that we may be allowed to examine the claim thus filed in order that our congregation may meet it fully & with precision upon all its points. It is proper to say that we are actively engaged in preparation for our defense & that we will ask no delay that can by possibility be avoided.
