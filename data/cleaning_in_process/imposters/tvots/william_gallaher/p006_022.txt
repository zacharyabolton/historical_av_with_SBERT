I got here today and found all well & very glad to see me and got my office. Capt Patrick seemed glad to see me he said he intended writing to Pa but had been very busy. I was about leaving for Shepherdstown when we got orders to get ready to leave at once but after we were told to march at 8 oclock tomorrow morning. I expect we will go to Shepherdstown. Everyone is talking about the way they were treated at Shepherdstown & are anxious to go there again they were so well treated. I will have no difficulty in getting along. I went down to see Eddie Waddell. He was glad to see me & said he wished he was in our company. Saw also Lipscomb. Both are looking well. Camp life seems to agree with them. I left Clinton at Stroudsburgh & gave him money to pay his way home. I wish he could have come to the Ferry. There is about 11000 men here now. You can see tents & soldiers all over the place. We are in camp in a large brick house in the upper part of Bolivar. It is only a few hundred yards to Capt Baylors company. There is a regiment of 1100 men just left here for Shepherdstown or Martinsburg. I will write you from where I am to go. I think to Shepheredstown I will go & see the folks. Tell Pa I will write to him next & will write to you all the first chance I have. The Capt myself & the officers all sleep in the same room. I will sleep with Irvine. I am very well pleased with camp life. Give my love to all. Excuse this short & badly written letter as I am very busy fixing things. I am very glad you put so many little articles in my trunk. Write soon. I got Charley letter with no trouble and a piece of the Dispatch. I will read it and take good care of myself. You need have no fears of me keeping bad company or anything of that kind.
