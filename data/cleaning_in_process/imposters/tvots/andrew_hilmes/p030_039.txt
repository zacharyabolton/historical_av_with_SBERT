Your communication of the 31st ult. containing inquiry with reference to Nelson Fields is at hand. In answer I would say that his prospect for making a comfortable subsistence are very good. He has been working very diligently and has a garden which promises an abundant supply of vegetables. Since living in my property he has conducted himself very well. He will, I have no doubt, provide comfortably for the girl if intrusted to his charge, and I think needs her services very much at this time.
