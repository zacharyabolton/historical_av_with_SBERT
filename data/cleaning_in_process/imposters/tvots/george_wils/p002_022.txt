Your came to hand this evening and the contents were noticed very closely. I suppose Green & his darling will go down to Strasburg to live I wish him a happy time Mollie I will most certainly comply with your request that of not answering your her letter, I am not anxious to answer her letter if I get one from you. I must differ with you about [unclear: Lollie] thinking any thing of me I am sure she does not but we will soon see. I know you had a nice time out at W.G. you could not help it for I know it is a nice place to visit, I think [unclear: Pet] has abandoned the thought of writing to me or is too much taken with [unclear: Dr] so [unclear: he] can't find any time you would like me home saturday. I may be there and if I had money enough I think I would come sooner. I am sure Ma will let us come and if she does look for us on Saturday. you must write Wednesday night and get her to add a note and the mony for us to come home, use your influence for us once try and persuade her to let us come dont forget to write at the time above mentioned wether we come or not for we dont want to start on friday untill we get an  deffinite  answer,
