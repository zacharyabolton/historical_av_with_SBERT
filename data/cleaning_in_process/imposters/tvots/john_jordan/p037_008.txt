In accordance with instructions contained in Par VI Cir. No. 10 from Hd Qrtrs. Asst Comr. B of R.F. & A.L. Va dated Richmond Va March 12th 1866 concerning the result of the operation of the "Order" restoring to the "Civil Courts" jurisdiction over colored persons in criminal cases. I have the honor to report as follows, viz. I have no cases to report in which any authority vested with the power of regulating the institution of criminal proceedings has refused justice to a colored person by improperly neglecting a complaint or by declining to receive an oath or sworn information tendered by a colored person &c. At the last term of the Augusta Co Court there was but one case before the Court in which a colored person appeared as a party to the action which case was continued by reason of the absence of material witnesses. It is my intention as soon I become acquainted with the Magistrates in my new field of operation to permit no cases to go before those officers in whom I have no confidence and to continue as far as is possible the adjudication of difficulties in which freedmen are interested in my office.
