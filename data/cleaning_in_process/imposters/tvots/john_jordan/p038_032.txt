In compliance with instructions contained in Circ No VI from H.Q. Asst Comr &c dated Richmond Jany 29th 1866 I have the honor to submit the following "Report" showing the condition of "Freedmens affairs at this date in the above named Division. Nothing has occurred during the "Month" which is calculated to change the opinions hitherto expressed as to the capacity of the colored race in the matter of becoming a thrifty self-supporting population. Occaisionally I meet with one who seems disposed to remain poverty stricken by declining to take advantage of opportunities by which employment &c might be secured but with these exceptions the race as a race are evidently advancing in intelligence and industry - and I am convinced they would show more [unclear: earnestness] in embracing education & other advantages if any substantial encouragement was given them by the whites. I believe that the feeling of distrust cherished by them toward the white people which was engendered by the disposition betrayed (immediately after the war closed) to not allow them any of the rights & privileges of the citizen, has been strengthened by the indifferent and [unclear: careless] manner in which the interests of the freedpeople are handled in the Courts and by the whites generally. I am not prepared to produce any particular instances wherein the aforementioned facts can be established but my conclusions have been arrived at after close observation of the workings of public sentiment. The crops have so far as a general thing turned out better than was generally expected thus demonstrating the fact that the farming interests have not been injured by the change in the larbor system and if all of the employers would deal justly and honorably with the laborers many of the evils of which they complain would be lost sight of entirely but when they impose all kinds of charges &c upon the laborers reducing the balance due to almost nothing and frequently bringing the latter in debt they must expect that dissatisfaction would grow out of such injustice and it becomes very reasonable when it is [unclear: remembered] that by reason of the ignorance of the laborer in connection with his suspicion of the white man the nature and details of business transactions cannot be explained to him in many cases. Intemperance does not seem to be increasing to any marked extent among the colored people. The Schools have been closed during the summer months but it is expected will open in few days with much larger numbers than ever.
