I have the honor to request "Leave of Absence" for Ten (10) days from this Post for the purpose of visiting a younger brother in Chicago Ill. who has recently met with a terrible accident and whom I have not seen for years. In this connection I desire to call your attention to the fact that this is only the second time I have requested leave of absence to go beyond the limits of this District since being assigned to duty in this state, Jany 26 1866
