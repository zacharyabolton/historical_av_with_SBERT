I have the honor to apply for an additional appropriation of Twenty $20 Dollars for the benefit of the Waynesboro Freedmens School House &c for the following named reasons. The building is very nearly completed & all that is wanting now to [unclear: reuse] same is a matter of 4000 Shingles for the purchase of which the appropriation is called for. I earnestly hope the appropriation will be made as there is no possibility of our being able to raise the amt required from any other source.
