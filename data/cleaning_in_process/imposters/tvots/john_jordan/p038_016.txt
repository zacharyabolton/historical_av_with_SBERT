By reason of the operation of the "Act of Congress" of July 16, 1868 concerning the B of R.F. & A.L. I notice that all officers [unclear: who] are on duty in the Bureau must be re-appointed in order to be retained. Now as the [unclear: obstacles] which were in the way of my advancement have been very nearly removed, I have the honor to request to be recommended for [unclear: retention] on duty in the Bureau.
