In compliance with instructions contained in Par VI Cir No 10, from Head Quarters Asst Comr. &c Va dated Richmond Va March 12 1866 in the matter of the result of the operation of the "Order" restoring to the "Civil Courts" jurisdiction over colored persons &c. I have the honor to submit the following Report viz. By reason of the fact that an impression prevails among the Magistrates in this Division that their term of Service has expired and that consequently they are not authorized to act officially in connection with the masked reluctance betrayed by them toward adjudicating or trying cases in which colored persons offers as parties, I have sent but few cases to them during the last month. The [unclear: careless] manner in which such cases have been disposed of - their marked indifference to the interests of the freedpeople - their [unclear: unconquerable] prejudice against the colored race &c &c all tend to deepen the conviction in my mind that the necessity for the establishment of Provost Courts in each county of Va is more evident than ever and especially is this the case in this portion of the state. I have at the same time no cases of injustice to report by reason of the aforementioned fact viz. most of the difficulties in which Freedmen are concerned are not sent to the Civil Courts but settled in this office.
