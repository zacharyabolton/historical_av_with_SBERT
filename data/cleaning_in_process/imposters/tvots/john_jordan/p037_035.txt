In compliance with Par VI Circular No 10 from Head Quarters Asst Comr. B of R.F. & A.L. Richmond Va. March 12 1866 relating to the result of the operation of the "Order" restoring to the "Civil Courts" jurisdiction over colored persons in the trial &c of criminal & civil cases I have the honor to report as follows, viz. There were but few cases in which colored persons appeared as parties to the action brought before the Courts in my Division during this month. While I am convinced that these Courts cannot as a general thing be entrusted with the class of cases alluded to yet this month I have no instances to report wherein any injustice was inflicted upon a colored person by reason of prejudice &c neither has my attention been called to any complaint coming from a colored person reflecting upon any authority vested with the power of regulating or instituting proceedings in criminal or civil cases. Every effort is made by me to bring about peaceable & just adjudications between all parties i.e. between white and colored and between the colored themselves, thus preventing useless expense and unnecessary risks to the freedmen -- This line of policy saves much unkind feeling between the races and has evidently contributed [unclear: vastly] toward bringing them to a more just comprehension of each other. The Criminal Dockets bear evidence of a marked decrease in crime as among the Freedmen and I hear of but few instances of theft and disturbances of the public peace complained of as being perpetrated by this class.
