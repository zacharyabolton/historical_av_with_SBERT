I have the honor to request that an agent be appointed for the Shenandoah Valley to look after the interests of the Freedmen. Many persons wish to get rid of the old men & women left on their places that they may hire [unclear: white] laborers and I am constantly applied to on the subject. I think it would be well to [unclear: find] an Agent of the Dept. here to take charge of their affairs generally as I am thus far totally ignorant of all Orders, Circulars and policy of the Bureau.
