I understand that you will not be in Waynesboro, and as I will not probably see you. I drop this line- asking that before leaving you will make some satisfactory arrangements with D S Bell relative to that note. He tells me it must be settled, & I have no means of meeting it without selling property which I could not well dispense with. Please give it your attintion & greatly accomodate me. I would like very much to see you & hope you will at least call before returning.
