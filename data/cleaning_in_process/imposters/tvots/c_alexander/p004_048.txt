I saw D S Bell a few days since, and wants the money on that bond which I signed for you. My funds are at a low ebb. and it would greatly inconvenience me to have it to raise. Please make some arrangement of the matter & greatly oblige me. Let me hear from you about it at your earliest convenience. We are all well--Baby's flourishing How is Liz:-we heard of her confinement but nothing from her since. Why Dont you "come over". no news of interest
