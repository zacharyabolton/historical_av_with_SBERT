Your dear, & twice welcome letter of Tuesday came safely. I was so thankful to hear that you were well. If I had known last night that pa was going to Staunton this morning I would have written to you by him. I thought of you so often Sunday night during your lonely ride, & did wish that I could have been with you. I went off to myself just to think of you after you left. I love to think of you always. How much I want to see you to night. It will be such a long & weary two weeks before you can come again. I wish that important day wasalready here so you could come & just to think I cannot see your dear face until 9 O'clock & then we must meet in the presence of others & only shake hands with no warmer greeting for two days I don't like to think of it. Ada & Hamie M'Fall are not going to wait on Rennie. she rec'd a letter from Cousin David to day. he will bring a lady, & gentleman with him you myself, & those two will be the only attendents. Pa objected to H. M'Fall. I was sorry on Ada's account but it can't be helped now. I wrote to Ella by pa this morning before D. Sibert's letter came & told her Miss Link was not coming so brother David wrote in his letter of Monday but now he writes that he has asked another lady& so we can do nothing but let them come. I objected to this last arrangement but it did no good for he had already asked the lady. I only hope we all shall have a happy time. Cousin David wants us all to spend Wednesday night in Bridgewater as their Minister will preach that night a special sermon for the Groom, & his attendants so he wants us all to go to church can you stay? I hope you can if you do not, I will come home with you, for I would not care to stay there without you were with me. The two Miss  were married this morning. Several other lady friends of mine are to be married in a few days. I hope they will all be very happy & so they can be if they will. I wish I was with you nowI would be happy too. Mr. Estell called in twice this week but I was too busy to see him. you see he is still in Mt. Solon he has heard that it is Rennie who is to be married, & not Miss Mollie. I do not care about seeing him any more Rennie sends thanks for the buttens  they were the kind she wanted. I enclose [unclear: 25]  It will be so long so long [unclear: befor] can come. sometimes [unclear: I] feel like I can't wait. I love you so truly & so devotedly that I want to have you near me or I am not happy & contented my only & greatest joy & pleasur is to be with you who I love with all the strength & devotion of my heart & entire nature. Yes I do indeed love you & only you. no man in all this world can ever take my heart & all of its deep & fervent love from you. I have yours  they are truly yours my heart, & its love shall never belong to any but you while I have life, unless you yourself refuse to have them & even then I will still love you.
