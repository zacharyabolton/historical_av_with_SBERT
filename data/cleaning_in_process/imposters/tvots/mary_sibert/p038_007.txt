As I leave to morrow for my long promised visit to Mr. Ferror's if I live, & as I am anxious for you to get an answer to your dear & welcome letter which came to me a few hours ago I thought I would write to night if I did not you could not hear from me until next week. I was so glad to hear of your safe return home. You don't know how much I did miss you Sabbath evening. I would have given any thing if you could have staid until Monday morning with me my love, for I do love to be with you. Oh! I did dislike to give you up so soon. I wish John Noon had told you that he would go & let you stay. Mr. Sam Ferror did not call. Did you think when we met him coming up that I knew he was coming Sunday to see me? I did not know it. he had not told me he was going to call. I just then supposed he would do so to hear from pa that was all. You hope in your letter that I will have a pleasant visit I will no doubt, but shall not be happy as I should be were I going where I could see your dear face.
