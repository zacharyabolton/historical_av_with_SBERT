My heart & soul both thank you for your dear precious letter of to day by Ada it came to me like a bright ray from Heaven, cheering my lonely heart as nothing else could in all the world but your own dear self. I was so glad so truly glad to hear from you whom I love with all my Soul. You & your precious love are all the world to me I could not live if you did not love me. it is the dearest & sweetest blessing of my life to have your love. The world would be desolate to me without it. The one cry of my heart to you is Oh love me love me only I know you do my love & that fact is the most precious joy of my life. I have been trying to day for dear papa's sake to be cheerful & contented with our Mountain Palace but I do not feel as I can ever be pleased to stay here you & dear Ella are right in saying a mountain life does not suit my taste it does not & never can unless I could be with you. perhaps if I had never known & loved you I might have been more satisfied but you my love fill all my heart & thoughts now. before I loved you I was contented at home with my dear pa & Ma but now I am happiest with you any where for you are more to me then all on Earth father Mother sisters & brother I love but not with the deep absorbing devotion of heart & soul I have for you. You are my all of Earthly happiness & you only. I beleive my heart would break if you would cease to love me Oh how I did want to go back with you Sunday eve. I felt as if I could not give you up & that my very life had gone when you left me. To day when the cars passed by I cried to think they were going where you are & I could not go too I did wish to be in them & go to Staunton. Three trains went down & two came up. Capt Walton stoped the cars just above us & let Ada off we were standing on the porch   Capt Walton Mr. Dunlop & another gentleman waved their hands at us until the cars passed out of sight. Capt Walton says he will stop for us when ever we want to go or come. Dear pa leaves on the morning train for Baltimore we will be made lonely   , without him & [unclear: may] God bless dear papa & let him come back to us soon is my Earnest prayer. I am so anxious to go with you to Staunton Sunday if we live but pa is not willing for me to leave home until after his return from Baltimore. what must I do duty calls for me at [unclear: home] & love calls me at Staunton. To my heart it would be sweetest to obey the call of love & go with you. I cannot leave Ada only with the children they would be so lonely pa & ma both gone
