I think we shall all be very happy in our new home this winter if we live & can keep pa with us all the time, & I think we shall have the mail arranged all as we wish. I could not be contented two long weeks without hearing from you. one of the greatest pleasures I have is getting your dear letters & answer -ing them. & I do hope that pleasure will not be kept from me at Buffalo. I hope for the best in this as in all other affairs of life. I know you will still love me but then I like best during the two weeks that you are away from me to read the dear, & sincere expressions of your affection in your letters. I do love to read them.
