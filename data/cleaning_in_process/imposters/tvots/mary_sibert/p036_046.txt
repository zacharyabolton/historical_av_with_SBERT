I hope this will reach you to morrow & save me the anxiety of mind which occured last week. Your dear letter of Tuesday gave me so much relief to hear you were not angry with me. I felt like a new being after reading it. I very willingly Excused its shortness as I know you had but little time to write an answer but it seems to me that your last three letters have all been short, & cold. I am not mistaken in this. there is something between our happiness. what is it? I know of nothing that I have done. if I have it was an Error of the head, & not of the heart. Do you Ever see any change in my letters to you? are they not always long, & affectionate? there again I am ready to forgive for I know that I have more time to write & when I am writing I am not so often interrupted as you are by persons. I will think & say no more about it, my love I know you can't help it & in return I now ask you to forgive me for complaining. Your letters are Everdear & welcome, & if they are brief I must be satisfied for they are from the one I love best. I did wish for you this morning Jennie Douglass & I took a long walk before breakfast, & wanted you so much to be with me. then I should have been very happy & enjoyed the lovely Spring morning, the pure & refreshing air, & songs of birds so much more with you who I love then with all others. Jennie asked about you she said she loved to see us with each other for she knew that we were then very happy. I told her yes I was happy always with you. Ma just came in with a letter from dear pa & one from Ada which came a few moments ago by the Harrisonburg mail. pa was in Washington City when he wrote. left the same day for Baltimore. had gone to Washington to close up his business at the Patent Office Gen'l. Imboden, Gen'l. Barton, Mr. Gordon & Mr. Brady were with him there. Ada is having a nice time she wants to stay during the Summer in Orange she & cousin Fronie have a trip to Washington City in view before she returns home. she writes that she has one of the handsomest beaus we ever saw. This is just like Ada. I did not Expect to hear any thing else then that she had a nice, & handsome beau. I thank God for His goodness in taking care of my noble & beloved papa, & May God let him come home to us again for we are very lonely without his dear, & joyous society. he may come the last of next week if he does not go to New York. I will send his letter, & Magnus will read it to you. I do hope you will come Saturday if you live, for I do want to see you so badly. I can say now that it has been long since I saw your dear face. come. I am at home. I did not know whether I should be angry with you or not for not coming because you thought I was absent. if I had been going away I should have written to you before I went, & if I had been called unexpectedly from home you should have known it. I wrote to you how greatly I was disappointed by you not coming I have not gotten over it yet nor will I until you really come. last Sabbath was a long sad day to me without you If I had been a bird I should have winged my way to Staunton, & saw you & then I would have only let you touch the tip end of one of my wings for treating me so badly, & after seeing that you & Ella's family were well I would fly home, but not until I told you that I loved you & how sadly you had disappointed me. then I would kiss my hand at you, & fly away, or perhaps I would have kissed your own dear hand if you would let me get that near you. I love you with the same unchanging devotion of heart. I cannot write, or tell the depth, & fervency of my love for you. All the world cannot take it from you. Come Saturday if you live I am so anxious to see you again I will be so glad & thankful to have you with me. I will love you & do all I can for your happiness & comfort. Do come. Hamie left Jim in B. I thought I could have the pleasure of sending for you & Magnus but was disappointed there again. I have so much to tell you. This is a long letter for your two short pages. I love you, & love to write to you I will have a warm supper ready for you & a bright fire if it is cold to warm & cheer you up, & my heart full of love & thankfulness all for you. Ma & all send love to you I send a loving kiss, & all the love of my heart & nature. I must write to dear Ella come to the one who loves you best of all others May God bless you & let you come. Goodby until we meet Saturday. I love you only now & ever come
