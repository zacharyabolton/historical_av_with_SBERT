I wrote to you by Mr. R. this morning. hope you have rec'd it safely. As Hamie is going to your town in the morning I will write you a few lines by him, & if you did not get my letter to day this note will tell you that I wrote. Hamie will stay in Staunton until Saturday evening. Can you not come home with him I do wish you would then you would not be so lonely riding. Can't you come? I do want to see you my love. This week has seemed very long to me as you were not here last Sabbath. I wrote a long letter to Rennie on yesterday the first one I have written to her since my arrival at Mountain Palace. I tried to give her a description of my new home but failed in the attempt. Mr. John Rippeton & Miss Ella Stafford are to be married next Thursday if they live. I wish you were here to night my love. You must come Christmas if you live & stay all the week. I know we shall have a delightful & happy time. Pa will be at home then. Cousin Gordon is coming to go on a hunting tour over the Mountains with you & Hamie. he May not come, but I want you to come my love. We are looking for papa this week. I love you with all my heart & soul & think of you every hour & wish I could see you & be near that you could come to see me often. I love to have you with me my heart is light & happy when you are near My love Can't you come with Hamie Saturday evening? I want to see you so much more then I can tell I hope you will come with him your ride will be so much more pleasant to have some one with you I do not like to think of you coming that road so late at night alone. I am always anxious about you until you get here safely I love you with all my heart & soul & ever shall while I live. Come my heart says come. I send you a loving kiss.
