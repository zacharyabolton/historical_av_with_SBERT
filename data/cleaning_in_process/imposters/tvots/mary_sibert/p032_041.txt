Your dear short letter of Tuesday was truly welcome as it was from you I read it with thankful pleasure. It told me just what I was most anxious to hear that you were well, happy & loved me. I was so glad to know you are still cheerful & happy I do hope you will always be so that nothing in the future will drive from your heart its new found joy. I know how very delightful it is to be happy. Oh I am so glad you are coming down Saturday for I am so Eager & impatient to see you again it seems to me so long since you were here last two long & dreary weeks but the time seems much longer then that for me not to see you. I like your last arrangement for leaving Staunton you will then not be so late riding by your self. Now this time you may be sure to find a warm supper, bright fire & glad welcome for I believe you will come if you live. it shall not be as it was when you came the last time, no fire, & no Mary to meet you. all shall be just as will please you & make you feel contented & happy. It makes me so happy to have you come to my home & know you love to come. I love to have you here. wish you could be here always with me. I told John Noon totell you cousin David Sibert was here on Sunday he asked me if I had no other messages to send you I told him I had just written all I wanted to say to you that time. he then wanted to take my letter to you I told him "no," Magnus would see you first, so we parted. John is a good boy. I like him because he thinks much of you. he said "he was going to tell you I went to church with Mr. Pemerton." "I told him he would tell you a story for I went & came back with Magnus." Mr Estill called Tuesday Evening eat supper with us asked if he might go with me to church that night I declined going.
