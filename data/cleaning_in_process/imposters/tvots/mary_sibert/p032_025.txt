I have just finished a heavy day's work & the closing of Monday finds me seated alone to answer your dear letter of Friday. I was so happy to hear from you thankful to know you were well. How much I wish I could see you this evening. I can not wait until Saturday arrives with calm patience I am wanting the day to come & hurrying time for it seems it does not pass swiftly enough to bring you near me. I was so glad & thankful when I read that you were coming this week for I do want to see your dear face more than I can tell you or than you can ever believefor I love you so truly & entirely with all the deep devotion of my heart & nature that I am only happy & contented when you are with me. Oh I do indeed love you more & more every hour of my life. I feel that I am sinning by giving to you the love of both heart & soul I sin because I think more of you then of my God which makes you my Idol. I know this should not be & my most earnest prayer is that God will moderate my affection so it will receive His holy blessings & smiles. I fear in God's jealous anger that He might take you from me for loving you more then I do "my father who art in Heaven." I will with HisDivine aid love you in a way pleasing to Him then He will love & bless us both as nothing in this world can do but God Cousin David Sibert brought Rennie home yesterday she will not return to Bridgewater till she is the bride of cousin David when you come I will tell you when they are to be married. Can't you leave Stauntin before 7? it will be so late for you to ride alone & such a long ride by your dear self Magnus must come with you. some one to keep you from being lonely. be sure & come Saturday evening don't please disappoint me as you did the last time you promised to come Saturday & did not I was so disappointed then& so anxious about you thinking something serious had happened to you. Now if you will only come you will find a warm supper a bright fire, a sincere, & most cordial welcome from Ma & my sisters, & a loving welcome from the one who loves you more then she can fully tell in all her life I will try & have my home bright & pleasant as possible for you so you can be happy & feel that you would rather be here then any where else & my face shall be so bright that you may know how truly happy my heart is to see & know that the one I love more than all the world is with me. Do come. I will pray that God will let you come to me Saturday for He knows it will give me more pleasure then any thing to see you. Write to me by Friday's mail & tell me you will come. I hope it won't rain. I wish you were here now. Oh! I do want to see you. Ma, Rennie, & all send love & say you must come. I send love & a kiss God bless you for you are dear, dear to me. "Goodnight." Come my heart says come Saturday.
