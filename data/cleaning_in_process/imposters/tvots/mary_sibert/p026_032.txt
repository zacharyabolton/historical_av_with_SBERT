I promised to send you my photo graph this week & for fear you may think me unfaithful by not doing so I write to tell you why I did not I could not have one taken this week. I shall not forget my promise. Will you forgive me for being so uninteresting during our drive to Mossy Creek last Sabbath? I felt silent, & sad, & could not arouse my spirits enough to prove how much I reallyenjoyed the ride & your kindness in taking me to church Well it seems that I am always doing something over which I must grieve with [unclear: regretful] sorrow after. You must come down soon & tell me you sincerely, & willingly forgive me. then I shall be satisfied My dear pa is gone again. Home is not home without the love, & cheering presence of a kind, & beloved father. Lula sends love, & a kiss to you she has not been home-sick yet
