I can scarcely thank you sufficiently for the exquisite bouquet you sent me. It would give me more pleasure to acknowledge in person the sincerity of my thanks, & [unclear: tender] appreciation with which I received, & will keep this , but beautiful, & expressive token of your valued remembrance. I cannot deside which I most admire, its  fragrance, the rich variety of its huesor the artistic arrangement of the entire collection. All are alike admired, & enjoyed as a gift from you I love flowers, but [unclear: more] especially when they come to me culled, & arranged by esteemed hands. With the beauty & fragrance of your gift, there came a regret resting like a blot upon each flower, & bud, a regret that its loveliness will so soon perish, that I cannot keep it always fresh, & blooming as now. The faded remains, & remembranceshall be min, pointing back in future years to the bright days when I enjoyed your friendship. May the pathway that God has marked for you to tread bloom with flowers of unfading beauty, & happiness. And may the fair & tender hands of her you select as your wife gather for you flowers without thorns & lead you onward to Heaven.
