My brother John J. Sibert. Searg't Major of the 5 Reg of Va. Infantry "Stone Wall Brigade," was missing the 12, of May, 1864. in the battle at Spottsylvania C.H. Va, & has not been heard of since. It is my earnest request that you inquire if he is a prisoner at Elmira. All trouble & expense, shall be amply repaid by his father. If you please, let us know if he is there, & if living. I enclose a Confederate stamp for the letter you'll enclose to Rob. [unclear: Guld]. Exchange Agent Richmond Va. The blessings of an anxious, a bereaved, & loving sister shall follow you Ever. For your trouble
