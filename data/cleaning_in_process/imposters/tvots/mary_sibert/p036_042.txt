I was so much disappoined last Friday after I found out the Mail had gone to Staunton without my letter to you, which I had ready for the Office Thursday. Capt Curtis started for Sanger's Ville came back saying the river was too high to cross, & that Mr Jones could not get to town the next day. Hamie & others said the river was too full to ford, & there would be no mail the next day. I did not like for my letter to lay in the Office until Saturday Evening so I did not send it over, but thought I would watch for Mr. Jones in the morning & if he went give him the letter to mail at SpringHill to my utter surprise & great disappointment he left sooner on that morning then he has done since carrying the mail. I was so sorry, & grieved about it that I have not felt happy since, & if Jim had been here I would have sent the letter to you. You must not be angry with me or think that I no longer love you, & if you could only know how deeply I was grieved, & disappointed by you not getting my letter, you would never think unkindly of me. I did wish I could see you & tell how it was. I hoped & looked for you Saturday & Sunday. when the horse & buggy came without you & Magnus, the disappointment was so bitter that I cried all the morning I was lonely& truly miserable, because you did not come & my letter was not sent. I knew the roads were bad, but still I wanted you to come. Oh! how Earnestly I did wish for you to come it seems that I never felt more anxious to see you then this time you did not come, & my heart ached under the disappointment it was so hard. I wondered what you would think of me for not answering your last dear letter, & if you did not come it would be so long before you could know how it was, & all that time would he think unkindly of me I only hope you did not blame me. If I did not love you I should tell you so & not treat your dear, & welcome letters with indifference. Icould not be so unkind to one I had loved so devotedly as I love you. the neglect was not caused by any change in my affection for you. You are the same dear & beloved object of my heart, & thoughts, just the same only if possibly more dear, for the past four days of suffering by not seeing your dear face & what you would think of me by not getting my letter taught me how necessary you are to my happiness, & how keen the anguish would be for me to give you up, & your precious love. I feel in the deepest recess of my Soul that I love you only with a love that I never gave to living man before, & cannot love another as I love you, & nothing but death can take it from you, & then I will love you in Heaven, for I am trying with God's aid to live a life He loves, so I can go to that Land of rest when called away from Earth, & my loved ones, & My daily prayer
