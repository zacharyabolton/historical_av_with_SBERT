Had Gen'l Imboden's dispatch come one day sooner I should have sent this answer to your dear letter of Tuesday by papa to day. but we were so hurried getting him ready that I did not have time to write you Even a line. I did wish that I could have gone with him I am so glad you are coming Saturday it seems like months since you were here last & I do want to see you so much. Brother David Sibert was up yesterday Eat dinner with us, asked about you. said Rennie was well, & happy, & that they missed us very much & we should come to see them soon Ada is going down to stay a few weeks in my place. if she lives she will go the last of this, or the first of next week. Pa & I spent the day Monday at Mr. Ferror's. it was very difficult for me to get away from them all they insisted upon my staying a few weeks Mrs. Cosby was there from Richmond. M Dunlap also. They left the next day for their homes. Regina & Billie were left lonely in I promised to go down next week if I live & sa week with them. but as Ada is going to Bridgewater I may not get to go. Samie said "it was very strange that I could stay in Staunton 6, & 7 months, & could not stay a few weeks with them." Pa & I had a very nice visit they are so kind, & attentive. Mrs. Dunlap told pa whilst Samie was filling pa's pockets full of apples that Samie had an interest in his Steel pa laughed. they seem so glad to hear of pa's success. We are lonely now since papa is gone. I wish you were here then I should be happy & satisfied. I do miss you coming of Evenings it seems that I cannot let the day go by without seeing your dear, & welcome face. I miss you more then you could possibly miss me. I do not think that you don't miss me any I know you do or you would not say you did but I just feel like I miss, & need your society more then you do mine it is woman's nature the world over to want to be with those they love all the time. we are selfish in that respect I know I am. It pleases me to have you say you love home pleasures for they are indeed The sweetest of all Earthly joys not many are thankful enough for such happiness & would rather be any where elsethen at home. I know you would be both thankful & happy & prefer your fireside & the society of an intelligent, & loving wife wife to all other enjoyments. you would not spend your Evenings any where but at home, reading while your wife sewed & if tired listening while she read to you, with your eyes shut you would forget all the busy outside world, thanking God for the great blessing he had given you. Hamie came in asked me if I was writing to you I told him yes, sends his love to you & wants to know "if you ever miss him." I can scarcely  to come I want to see you Oh so much, for I love to be with you more then all others in the world I love you only, truly, & devotedly as I never loved mortal being in my life, & my greatest, & sweetest pleasure is to be with you. Come then Saturday my pen & heart say come. I hope God will let you come, & give you a warm & pleasant Evening for I do want to see your dear face more then I can write in words. I think of you all the day long & wish I could see you. Come Saturday if you live & you will meet a glad heart & happy face a bright fire &warm supper all for you. tell Magnus to come with you. I wish the day was here I am impatient for you to come I have many things to tell you as usual. I will not talk all but will let you say something now & then if you promise not to talk too much like you always do when we are together. Ma & all send love. I send love & a warm loving kiss to you I love you with all my heart, nature, & thoughts. God bless you & send you Saturday to gladden the heart of one who thinks only of you. Goodnight Love me.
