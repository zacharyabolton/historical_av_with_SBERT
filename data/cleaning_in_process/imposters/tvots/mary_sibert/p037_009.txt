Your dear letter of the 28 has been rc'd, & read with thankful heart many times. You can, & do make me very happy when you look bright & happy your self, when you stay with me, & love me, when you write me long & affectionate letters, & when I think you will ask God to bless you with a new heart. Do you think I demand a great deal to make me very happy? & that it is too much to give? I feel sure the answer of both your heart, & lips will be no! How delighted I am to know that you do not, & have not regretted giving me your love. & may it be my only & greatest desire while we both live never to give you a cause to regret having given to me the first devotion of your early manhood. May I ever love, & dearly prize the sweet gift of your heart its truth & love. You are & always will be worthy of my love, & deepest devotion. You are all I could wish you to be but a christian & in that particular I have placed you my love in the hands of a merciful God who will in due time answer my daily & earnest prayers for you who I love so well. My dear papa is very joyful to day over his steel success. he rec'd a letter from Gen'l Imboden, saying the analysis of the metal made by the great chemist of Baltimore had been sent to him & that it was not an alloy but pure steel of the best quality ever made. The chemist has been almost 2 months giving the metal a fair & perfect test by the best chemicals which he sent to the City of New York for just to try papa's own metal with. Gen'l Imboden also wrote that the tires sent to Mr. Whitcomb at Richmond would be tried the first of May. I never saw pa in such a glee as he is to day, did not know what to do with himself. I told him to thank God for his success. Maj. M'Cue invited him over to his home this evening where he is now. I was interrupted while ago by some ladies calling to see the stereoscope. it took them some time to view Washington City Rennie is coming up tomorrow if she lives to remain with us until Sunday. So brother David wrote to pa. We will not get down to see them if she comes Got a letter from Ada she is anxious to come home now. I wish you were here this lovely Spring evening we would enjoy a long walk & gather flowers without thorns for each other. I long to see your dear face can't hardly wait until Saturday comes & brings you with it. Come if you live, my heart is anxius & impatient to have you here again. be happy & I shall be so. let nothing cloud the joy of our meeting but let us be very glad & truly thankful that God has so kindly granted us the blessing of being with each other again. I love you Oh! so devotedly & entirely that to be with you is happiness indeed. & I ask no other joy only to have you ever with me. May God let you come to one who loves you with all her heart & soul. All send love, I send love & a loving kiss to you. God bless you my love. Come Saturday I long to see you.
