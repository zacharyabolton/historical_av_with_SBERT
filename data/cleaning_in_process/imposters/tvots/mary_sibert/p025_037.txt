Some unknown, but very kind friend has been thoughtfully sending me the "Ledger" since my return from Staunton. I once thought it was Mr. [unclear: Jn] Ryan but remembered he only sent me papers containing some communication written by himself. I've at last concluded it must be you. If so, I sincerely thank you. Truly do I appreciate such evidence of your esteemed remembrance. And most earnestly do Iwish that the power were mine to repay your kindness. perhaps that pleasure will yet be mine. I hope so from my heart. I may some day meet with the one you love best. Then will be one of my opportunities to compensate. With deep & sincere respect & wishing that your future may be ever prosperous, & happy I am
