This will be my farewell letter from the Village of hills. If I should live to write again it will not be from the hills but mountains. The grand & glorious mountains where I can breathe the pure fresh air of [unclear: Virginia]. I have your dear & welcome letter of the 5th I was so sorry to read that you were not well my love & I am truly glad that you are not going to ride again in the night air. I hope you never may have to do so. it is not good for your health & then it is not safe for you to ride after night. I always feel so anxious a bout you. Do you not think you would improve very much if you were to be more moderate in smoking I do certainly believe you would feel better my love I have never said a great deal to you against the habit as you seem to enjoy smoking so much & I do love to see you enjoy any thing. but it would be best for you if you could only smoke occasionally or not at all. I was so sorry that you left last Monday without your breakfast & I did not get to give you Goodby. I did wish you could have staid until sunrise. I felt lonely all day Monday after you were gone I missed you sadly my love & always do when you leave. my home has lost its dearest happiness when you leave it. I wish from my heart that you were here to night. Oh how glad & happy I shall be when you come & spend a week with me in our new home. it will be so sweet to have you there to stay more than one day & night & I shall try & do all I can to make you happy & feel at home. I hope we shall spend many very delightful & happy hours with each other at Buffalo but you must promise me that you will not ride after night. your health & life are too dear to me not to be anxious & unhappy when I feel that you are exposed to danger in the lone hours of night. I shall be ready to go up with you next Sabbath if we live & will remain in Staunton a few days then I can have the dear privilege of seeing you often while I am there. how I do love to be where I can see you. I can scarcely wait for the time to come I am so anxious. Hamie has just arrived & tells me you are well again I am so glad to hear it, & that you are coming for me if you live early Saturday evening. May God guide you safely here. I love you with all the deep unchanging devotion of my heart & Soul & ever shall while I have life. No one on all the wide Earth is so dear to my heart as you are my only love. I can never tell fully how much & how devotedly I do love & cherish every thought of you. I love you only of all in the world. All send love. I send a loving kiss to you & a hope soon to be with you. May God bless you my love. This last letter to you from Mt. Solon says Goodby. Come my love I want to see you Oh so much. I love you only
