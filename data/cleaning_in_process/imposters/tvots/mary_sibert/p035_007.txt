Your welcome, & very dear letter of the 14th came duly to its rightful owner. How to me its truthful lines gave the glad assurance of your continued love you could have seen had you been near when I read it over & over again. It is so sweet to have you call me dear. I repeat the treasured words so often in my mind since your dear hand traced them to me. I had looked & waited so long for you to call me Dear Mollie & at last my wishes have been fulfilled I feel more sure that I am indeed as dear to you as you are to me & My heartfelt prayer is that you may never regret giving me the sweet & affectionate little Dear. I love to read the short words so expressive, written by you & coined from your true, & noble heart I know how dear, how inexpressably dear you are to me always & to feel that I am as much loved by you makes meso happy. I wish Oh so anxiously that you were here this Evening I want to see your dear face more then I can tell I miss the happy & loved Evenings of the past three weeks when I could have you near me, & now I think you must come in at twilight & sit with me & as I can't see you I feel so lonely & that I can't live without seeing you Every day. I know you miss me when the lamps are lit, "& evenings home pleasures are nigh." You have a heart made to love, enjoy, & appreciate fire side, & home pleasures this I have known for some time & when I am in Staunton I am happiest & so are you when we are with each other round dear Ella's fireside. Yes I am so happy then & happy when you are here with me any where with you I am contented & happy so happy that I love to sit silent & think of my blessing without talking much I love to muse when with you & you think if I don't talk that I am sad & gloomy but I am not. with me much talking does not prove the heart to be in its happiest mood. I am often silentwhen with you & I know that I am very happy. I am fearful you think I would not make a "cheerful, & happy fireside" You must not think this of me. I am sure with help from Above of making home happy for I do love to see others happy & unless those I best cherish are so I cannot be so myself. Please don't think I would make a gloomy & cheerless fireside. to me the shake of your dear curly head & the rapid motion of your foot are very Expressive I saw these when you spoke of Sue Forney & I wondered then if you thought I would be such a gloomy wife, a dark cloud to hide the light, the beauty, & happiness of home & not a "fireside angel" making home a sweet & much loved shelter for the dayworn husband. what were your thoughts then? did you think I was like Sue? perhaps I have been unjust to you & this I do not want to be for I love you too dearly to be unjust forgive me then. one of my greatest wishes is to please you & to render myself a worthy object for you to love & trust. I rec'd a long letter from dear Ella Tuesday night she wrote that she never was so lonely in her life. I am sorry I did not stay. wish I was there to night I loveto stay with her. I would rather be with Ella in one little room then live in a palace in Bridgewater. I do in truth always enjoy my visits in Ella's dear upstairs home more then anywhere else in all the wide Earth. Ma rec'd a letter from Rennie to day she says she hopes you & I were as glad to visit them as they were to have us there. she says she was so lonely after we left. wants me to go down & stay awhile with her. dear Rennie I love her too but don't think I can go only when you take me. You & I will go again before long. she is very happy & I thank God for it, but I would rather be with Ella then in Bridgewater. dear Rennie has a warm place in my heart & I hope God will always bless her with happiness here & in Heaven. You & I will go to see her when ever we can. Do you remember the letter you brought for pa? it was from Mr. Estell I will let you read it when you come. I was so glad to hear you are coming Saturday a week if you live. I want to see you more & more every day of my life. I will have a bright warm fire & a warm supper for you, a sincere loving heart & glad face to meet you. Oh! I am so happy when you are with me best & dearest of all the whole world. Hamie sends his love & says "do you miss him" & that "he is chewing Mr. Cupp's three  tobacco." Pa is getting ready for his trip to [unclear: Paye] I have not yet consented to go with him. I may just to please him. There is not much enjoyment in travelling in the winter I am sure of that Pa just came in where I am writing. he looked round said "I was very comfortable," & then went up to Ma's room. Ma & Lola went to see Mrs. Cupp. Ada Hattie & Lula are at Cap't. C's. Hamie gone to see Maggie I guess. I have been alone writing to one I love more then all others.
