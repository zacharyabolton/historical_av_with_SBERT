I will now answer your dear & welcome letter of Tuesday & have it mailed if the rain is falling but I hope not enough to raise the rivers. I wish as usual for the first & last wish of every day that I could see you. Ella & her dear children arrived safely Monday Evening & found us all gald to see them again. Ella says she knows you will take care of her dear Magnus & stay with him at night & keep the robbers from killing him, but don't you let them kill you. Ella talks so often & so much about you all that is good. I love to hear her speak of you. she knows it. dear Ella is a true, & faithful firend of yours from the very sincerity of her heart. so is Magnus. I will tell you something Ella told me he said to his sister Bettsey about you when you come then you will know that he does certainly esteem you very highly. it makes me love Magnus more then I ever did. I wish you were only here this gloomy evening I would then forget the sun was not shining & the rain was falling it would be so bright within the house that I would not feel the want of sunshine out doors. but you are not & cannot be here now. I can love you, think of you, & write to you, pleasures I thank God for giving me when you are absent. I have been thinking so much about you that I love to think of nothing else all the day long. Ella is anxious for me to spend some time with her this Summer if we should live I told her the same I wrote to you last week, but if Ada returns I can go & stay a long time & be near you who I love to be with always & never get tired of seeing your dear face. I do get very tired now of waiting until I can see you two long dreary weeks Oh how long & slow the days are to me before you come I often think I can't wait there is nothing in this life harder to bear then to wait patiently for what our hearts wants to be now, to have now, but can't & must wait longer then now for what we so fondly desire to make the heart happy & satisfied I try to wait, & not complain for I know it cannot be helped. It seems that I would give any thing in this world if I could only see you every day. I am sorry you can't get here earlier, so we could be with eachother as long as possible your short visits seem like dreams to me  they are dear & sweet to me if short just so I can be with you I am happy & contented & now to think you will soon be here makes my heart very light & glad. I can scarcely wait for the two days to pass so anxious am I to see you again. come if you live my love I hope God will safely guide you to me as in days past. I love to have you with me always I love you with the same unchanging devotion of heart & soul. nothing can ever take my love from you & to love you is a very dear pleasure to my heart. I ask only for you to love me, & only for me to love you of all the living on Earth. Yes I love you & God knows how deeply, & how devotedly. All send love. I send love & a loving kiss to you. Come Saturday my heart says come. God bless you
