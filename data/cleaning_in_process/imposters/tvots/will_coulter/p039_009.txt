The Asst. Comr. desires to be informed, with the least possible delay, if J.W. Jordan A.S.A.C. has taken charge of his Div. and established his Head Quarters at Lexington. If he has not, it is directed that you order him to proceed to that place at once, or show by "Surgeons Certificate" that he is unable to travel, and for how long a period, he is likely to remain so.
