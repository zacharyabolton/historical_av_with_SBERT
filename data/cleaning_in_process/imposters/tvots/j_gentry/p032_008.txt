Allen Rodes wishes me to write to you and state the circumstance concerning a matter that he will apply to you on and it is as follows as you will see by his papers in June 1866 he was Registered by Lt Hooks as married to Ann Davis and has been living with her ever since and before as for some time as man and wife and on Sunday last a black man by the name of John Cooper came to my house (I having Allen's wife employed), and took his wife off claming her as his wife and he having had her before as his wife but left her some six or seven years ago as I am informed and is now I understand claiming the property that Allen has gathered up since his marriage and will apply to you for an order for it and I think it nothing but fair that you should be informed on boath sides of the case before you act in the matter. I can say for Allen, as fair as I have sean of him he is a truthfull honest man and will not state any thing to you but what is true.
