Your very kind & excellent letter of 22 inst. was recd yesterday. Allow me to return you my sincerest thanks for your tender consideration of me. Tho' afar off from home & friends--among a cold-hearted, bloodless set of strangers; your letter was the first line recd since I left you. Nothwithstanding I have been so prompt in writing my Bros, Sisters, Nieces & nephews & friends, & gave all my P.O. address before leaving [unclear: Easton.] & insisted upon their writing me, & in addition to this, have myself written nearly all my Bros. & Sisters & Nieces, [unclear: East.] yet not a line from one have I recd since I left them. Then dear cousin let me again thank you for your mindfulness of me. Since I left you, I have been the "grand rounds"-- to Lewisburg, Union, Giles Ct. House, Dublin, Newberne, Wytheville, Abingdon, Saltville, Marion, [unclear: Glade] Springs & then again back here. At Each of the several places I was busily engaged @ several days, in the execution of orders. I have done much labor & feel quite broken down. For last several days been here, examining [unclear: Reviews] for Exemption from service-- 'Tis no pleasant work-- to see them coming with their walking sticks & then to have to set (if one would) & listento their ten thousand "Ailments" would worry one even of more patience than your "cousin Andrew" But the work is well nigh over, & soon again "I'll be marching" to other & as yet unknow fields of labor. I yesterday recd an order to hold myself in readiness to take command of Rendezvous at Abingdon & the Reserves of West Va. When the order comes I am going to decline it-- I am but one man, & tho' having been disabled from active service in the field by Secty. of War, inconsequence of wounds recd. in line of duty, yet feel able & willing to discharge the duties of one soldier in C.S.A., but I am tired of double duty, & mixed duty in Medical & Military Dpt. of our Army. I want to perform duty in the Medical Dpt., or am willing to return to the field & take my command ss once I had it, but I will not much longer, be a subject to obey orders in both branches of the service. I have made but very few acquaintances outside business transaction. I have met with one or two pleasant Ladies-- spent one eveg. in Ladie's society since I left Lewisburg. Have heard some fine music. At Wm Y.C. White's Abingdon. I care but little for making acquaintances now. My heart once so full of tender affection seems now to be drying up, or if refreshed at all, 'tis only by the memory of, & sweet dreams of happy byegones. I regret dear cousin that you seemed to labor before getting a "theme" upon which to write me. Glad however, that when you selected it, that you gave me such a fine essay on the subject that rules & governs Excuse this letter-- I have written in great haste & have frequently been interrupted-- will do better next time. Here's a kiss, & a loving goodBye
