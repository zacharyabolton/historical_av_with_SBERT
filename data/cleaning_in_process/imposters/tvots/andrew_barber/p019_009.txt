I have only time this cold Sunday morning to write you a line. Indeed I have nothing of interest here to write you. I come out safely after taking a very active part in late fight at Saltville. Gen Burbridge U.S.A. was punished very severely for bringing his mixed white & Blacks in the vicinity of Saltville where we Reserves could strike them a blow. Let it be said "never more" that the silvery haired men & the beardless & downy cheeked youths of old Va. will not fight. They have of late made their own record & the faithful Historian, & future generations will give them a high place in the annals of their country. The fighting for the Season in this country is over, & I have accepted the appointment of"Medical Director & Chief Surgeon of the Reserve & Local Forces of West & SW.Va." & have established my Head Quarters at this place & am on duty. "I am in fine health, hoping when these few lines come to hand they'll find you enjoying the same God's Blessing." I have just read a letter from Bro. Gabl. & Daughter Mollie giving account of depredations &c of the Yankees. They now know & feel what I knew & was made feel near four years ago-- only they have never been made suffer from the vandals as I have suffered. They have not felt & known what it was to mourn over the loss of a darling child-- the victim of a wicked relentless foe. But enough. God is just & merciful-- & the day of Retribution for the wicked ones who have stricken so many hearts & laid waste our beautiful & once happy country is nota far distant. Let it come-- I repeat it let it come-- God speed it. Amen. Remember me kindly to your parents & Sister-- would like to see you all. With fraternal affection be kind enough please to remember me to Sammie & Mat. I wrote Mat a letter & enclosed it to you-- She never answered it, or if she did, I never recd. I love her very dearly, but & it distresses me because she neglects me. Suppose she got mad at me because Sammy foolishly [unclear: did]. I never wantonly abused or wronged or injured any one. I remember very pleasantly our delightful Boat ride-- I remember your kindness & affection towards me. I will not forget it or cease to remember you kindly & affly.
