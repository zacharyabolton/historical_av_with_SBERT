Many things May be considered more useful than a Shovel & pair of Tongs-but to me they are invaluable-Please accept my thanks for the Same. I Send with this my measure for the boots-I want Cavalry boots-but I don't wish them to be heavy-have them made medium about half way between heavy & light- I don't wish the tops to come above the knee-Please have them made at once for I need them badly- don't want Scotch Soles- Wm Smith will explain everything to your workman-
