Your application for aid for the Freedmen of Augusta Co. in the way of Books has been handed us by Rev. Mr. Manly with request that we do what we can for you. Our plan is to place the Books in the hands of some one who will use proper discrimination selling the Books to all that will or can buy them, (and experience tells us that those who purchase appreciate the books most) but at the same time we desire to help all those who are too poor to buy, let none go unlearned because they are too poor to buy a book. Rev. C. F. Fry is our  in your county, lives in Staunton and would no doubt be glad to cooperate with you in doing anything he can to better the condition of the freedmen, we will write him and request him to see you, in the meantime, we shall be glad to receive letters from you in regard to any special [unclear: cases] of Sabbath schools needing books, shall be glad to hear from you again.
