McDowell, at Winchester, was referred through the Bureau to this Agency of the American Tract Society with the request that we would supply the books named therin on the terms proposed. We take pleasure in so doing & whenever we shall have received 1/2 the amount of above bill, we will cancel the remainder by charging to our charity fund or rather to Grants as we have no funds.

Please write us on receipt of them & whenever you can make it convenient let us hear from the Schools.
