I enclose you a deposition taken by a witness to a claim of Mr. Thomas Wholey who owns the ground on which the barracks of this post are built. He claims 2200 feet of lumber & wants to know [unclear: when] [unclear: disposition] is to be made of their barracks. The Q.M. Dept has I imagine the control of these quarters.
