I find that we are obliged to pay seventeen dollars ($17.00) per month rent for the school building at Staunton, Va. In opening the school at Staunton we made no provision for this expense. Can you not relieve from it, to date from April 1st. John Scott, our teacher and agent there, will secure the signing of the proper vouchers. Hoping that you will be able to favor us with this relief.
