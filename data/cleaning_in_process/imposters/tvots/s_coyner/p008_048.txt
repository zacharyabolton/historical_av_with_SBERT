My very dear friend.-- I know you think my friendship is false, when I neglect you so long; but indeed I had good reasons for my conduct. We soldiers have hard times. To us the luxuries of life are so often denied. To us places as well as life are very uncertain. [unclear: At] one time there is a feast & at another there is a famine. Never before have I been in such straits. Sometimes without paper and writing material and then without money to pay the postage on my letters you may know that the soldier who has thrown away his all, and staked his all, even to his life, for his country, has nothing now but his sword and his reputation, and that sometimes he must forgo the pleasure of writing to his dearest friends.-- But my ink is out; and there is none on the premises. I must wait till morning &you must excuse my short imperfect letter this time, and I will try and do better next time I have no news from this desolate region. [unclear: Make.] & Hubert [unclear: Jordan] & [unclear: O.G. Lianberger] are all absent I suppose you have heard of the death of [unclear: Lianbr.ger's] youngest sister of Diphtheria. Give my love to all the family & believe me your everlasting friend & lover,--
