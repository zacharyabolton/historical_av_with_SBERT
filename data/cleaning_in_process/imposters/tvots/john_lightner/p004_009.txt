I suppose you think I have forgotten you but far from it. I received your kind & affectionate letter, and was truely glad to hear from you & my old school-mates on the Creek. I am not very well at present, as I have a very bad cold, which is quite common in this vicinity. Well, news is so very scarce I hardly no where to get intelligence to write to you. I was in company with some ladies last night, and my ideas are a little tangled, and it requires some exertion to extricate them. But I managed to keep my heart, and am no suscipient (as you already know) of other people's hearts. I hope you had a joyous time, during your meeting at Calvary, & also hope you had a revival of religion in your midst. You said that there was need of one in your neighborhood; you need not limit it to your own neighborhood for all neighborhoods need it. You made mention of some in Greenville, who had made a profession, I was glad to hear of it, and hope they will remain "steadfast in faith." You hoped, (you said) that I might succeed in getting one of Mrs. P. daughters, I have not courted them yet & have not gotton sense enough to do that; I think I will have to take a few lessons under you, for fear I begin wrong and fail in my attempt. You said that you would like for me to send you my likeness, I'm afraid I would break all the glass that can be started. I am very thankful that I am going to school where I am; I know Midway of old, and the "Burg" is not far behind. Well, I want to go to prayer meeting to night, so I must conclude. Give my love to all inquiring friends & accept a portion for yourself. Write soon.
