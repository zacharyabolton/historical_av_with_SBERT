I have diligently searched the records of my Office to find the order of Court, directing the "Overseers of the Poor" to bind Mary Gordon to Stewart C Slaven. and can find no such order, I searched the records for the past twenty years Neither do I find any "articles of Indenture" between such parties, filed in my Office. I think there must be some mistake in regard to her being bound by the Overseers of the Poor of this County.
