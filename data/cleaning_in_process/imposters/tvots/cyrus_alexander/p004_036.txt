Yours of --- is to hand, and I am sorry to say that your friend Miss Lucy is no longer an inhabitant of this Commonwealth, for some unknown cause -- probably because the "Species were not propagated fast enough in this region. She emigrated to Ohio last Spring, with no intention of ever returning. Does it not make you weep to think that you have forever lost the services of Lucy & her "Catnip". As she has always been a necessary institution in your Domestic affairs, I see no other channel for you in the future, than to "shut up shop" and discontinue the Business. Tell Liz. that I have some idea of paying her a Visit about the first of the new year, & that if she will make her arrangements to that time, that I will carry with me some Catnip, & that you & I will put her thro all the phases of Lucy & the Catnip. I know of no one whose services as nurse could be had, except your Aunt Ginnie Martin -- she is a fine woman & an excellent nurse, but I do not know whether she could be induced to go so far from home. Sarah is quite smart, but is slightly afflicted with the same epidemic under which [unclear: Liz.] is labouring. No news of interest. Times are Dul & weather cold. There is considerable War Spirit in this country. We are seeing in the Harpers Ferry affair, the legitimate consequences of the Jno Letchers election -- that result justified Old Brown & friends in believing that a Majority of Virginians were ready to join them. The Democracy are responsible for it, & should be held so, for all this slavery agitation they have kept it alive for years. Elect Millard Fillmore President, & I would guarantee that before the expiration of his term all would be quiet. I would like to see Wise, Seward, Douglass and a few others Hanged as high as was Jno Brown. Why Dont you come over. all Well. Love to Liz & children
