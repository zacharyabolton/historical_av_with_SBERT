I come to the conclusion last Sabeth neve to send that I had writen or write to you a gain but not untell I heard from you a gain as you thought perhaps but to quit corisponding; but your dear brother was here last night & we talked about you; he asked when I had heard from you I told him & also said I did not expect to reply & he gave me one condiming look & I have thought ever since that I heard a soft low voice saying Kate dont give him up. Oh my poor wayward boy whose voice is it Ah me thinks it must be he that of thy dear mothers & feel very thankful this evening that I have heard it yes I can thank my heavenly Father this evening that I am very happy yes happy in the Lord & I ask my self why can't Willie be happy why is he grieving over this worlds happiness & not looking forward as he once did to a world beon the [unclear: dark] why is it that there are no brightness no sunsine that this world is dark & dreary not a charm to bind you to earth I ask why: & I believe that I can give you the answer will you allow me yes I bileve you will I will tell you what I think it is your sins Oh dear one you are brooding over my sorrows trouble & thinking how you will make me happy now let me beg of you dear one to forget me for a while & think of yourself yes if I could come to you to night & fold my arms around your neck & pray for you I believe my earthly happiness would be compleat (not that I want to winn back your affections to me for I leave that with God) but Oh that I could win you back to the foot of the cross & get you to cast your care on Jesus he is ablee & willing to turn your darkness in to day you know the head of him yes dear one I believe he is kocking at the door of your heart & ere this yes when you wrote before I think he had been there Oh Willie I have fasted & prayed every Wednesday since I got your discard & I have been very very happy I believe that the good Lord has melted & moved your dear heart ere this yes in sever instances my prayers have been answered in less than a week is not this joy enough yes I have spent one Sabbeth in fasted & prayer besides Wednesdays & I can say with joy it was the a very happiest day I believe I ever spent. no one knows that I done this but Lord & thee I (fas) done it for you & I think you ought to know it or for the salvation of your Lord yes I am willing to sacrifice my life for it (that) but that is not nesessary for Jesus Christ was sacrificed for our sins. Oh dear one how oft. times I think of that happy prayr meeting we had in G just before the war broke out that good prayr that you offered up that night this was some of the words Oh that we might [unclear: strike] for the [unclear: press] of the high calling in Christ Jesus; was that not a happy night have you forgotten it; you felt that God was with you & he is with you now dont refuse his pleadings he loves you dearer than he did then dont think that your sins are too great he bigs you to cast your burden uppon him he is ablee to engulft you in Christ again but deare dear Willie let me beg of you to quit the distilay & go & pay the tax that you have not payed on it & pray to God to give you grace to over come the other sins that has beset you & resolve in your own heart to be come a christian a gain; as you dear brother said to day Kate you know he was once a good boy but that is such a wild nieghbourhood Oh I wish he had never gon there & we both came to the same conclusion that that distilry was the cause of all your trouble going a gainst your Pas will & John sais it is greaving your dear Pa so much Oh Willie what must I do for to get you to change if I thought if cralling on my hands & knees would to you & pleading & praying & beging would make this change I would do it yes you wish to know what you must do for my happiness do this Willie be come a good man if you cant do it up there come to your Pa he can adivse you & pray for your help in evry way. Oh Willie the harvest is great & you once was a labourer wont you come out a gain & help me to labour I feel that I am almost alone yes I believe you will for I drempt the other night that I met you in the harvest field I was there & had my rake but there was no one to cut the grain for me but preasantly you came & set down the cradle & was whetting before you saw me but as soon as you seen me we both wept & you took my hand as you use to but enough Now Willie you may be the means of saving the souls of those that led you astray return O wanderer return Jesus bids you come I long to see you in prayr meting & class meeting in our good old Methodist Church the bright star that you once was may I not hope for it yes & believe that you will come; tomorrow is my fast day Oh how I wish you could get this & keep it with me but you can have a day of your own & fast & pray it has made me strong in spiritual strenth & in bodily strength Willie you can keep that ring I did not mean the hole love I gave that to you but I dont care for any do you wish your you can get it any time you call for it try & forget the past & become a good christian I hope that that the time will soon come that we will soon rejoice in Christ Jesus that this all happened if you should get sick or anything happen you & you want to see me or want a friend to wait on you send or let me know & I will do for you yes it would make me very happy to do so but I find that Jesus is our best freind if all others forsake he will not then let us tell all our greafs to him he bids as pray & pray a gain but I must close you can use your own pleasur
