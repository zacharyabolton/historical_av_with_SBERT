I have been waiting for a letter from you but have waited in vain have come to the conclusion that you have forgoten me or must perhaps changed again ha ha if so Willie let me know, you know I cant think you that ficle. Your brother C said he would carry this note or I reckon I would still wait for to hear from you why have you not ritten or been down do come down Saturday & & bring me some good news for I havent got any good news but I have bad news somthing that gave me the blues for three or 4 days but I am quite cheerful now was a little sick this eve was gathering cherries & almost fell off of the tree the jar maid me sick. I cannot tell you what gave me the blues but I am all right if you are one smile from thee will drive that gloom away Willie I have not got anything yet for my  will untill I hear from you or see you & much rather see you the girls think best for us to have waters & then for you & I to take a trip to Rockingham Ronoak or Buckingham I think myself it would be very wise but of corse if it does not suit you I will not insist Charles has put me in the notion of visiting Buckingham but enough of this. Dear Willie I am very anxious to see you I hope you will not loos what Mr C owes you but if you do dont let it greave you we can make a liven of corse we will have to commence unable in life but we must trust in God he will help us if (I) we be energetick & have faith Willie dont promis yourself any thing but me I have got nothing but I mean to strive to have you value me more than you wou value any other earthly thing I know dear one you are not going to marry me for wealth for I cannot promis myself anything from any the things that are mine now but I dont think that will make any diference with you but I must close we are all well & I hope this will find you well & happy yes happy in Christ yes Oh dear one strive to be a good boy & let us be happy together there is hardly any hour of the day but what I think of those recent promises may God in his mercy help you to keep them this is my only prayer Oh is good let us trust in him & pray to him for more faith Willie do come down with C Saturday  pleas excuse all imperfections.
