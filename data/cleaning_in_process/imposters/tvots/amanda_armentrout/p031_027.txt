I have just returned from my friend Rachel's & thought I would write you a short note my health is very good better than usual I think & I am trying to be very cheerful though I get the blues very bad some times. Pa has at last consented for to have some waters & get married at home so I have chosen six girls though I expected to have 7 but I want the privlege of inviting one gent as water & will give you the same privlege you can invite a lady to wait as I have but (on) six chosen but wish to know immediately what lady you wish. I have my two sises R.C.E. Shuey, Kate Shields & cousin Josie of course I will expect you to have Mr. Linzy as a water to make the 6th I do not know how to spell the name; Oh how I wish you were here that we could make the arangement you are so slow a bout writing I think you are so careless a bout writing Willie dear will you always be so it has a bad tendency now you can not imagin my feelings when I think a bout it but then I think it will not be long that I will be from you & that you will strive to make me happy. Alas how long long did I await to hear these words the other night Kate I am striving to live a better life to become a good Christian my dear one are you trying to do this Oh I do hope you are you cannot imagine the joy those few words would create within in my bosom I think the tryals that I have dayly would be nothing if I but knew that all that you can do is being done; if I allow myself to think for one moment that you are not doing that I almost shrink from the situation or position I have taken but I feel that you are trying for I know you will not have me brake that  no I know you want to make me happy & that will make us both happy dearest remember me in your dayly prayrs but enough. Willie the company all that I have talked to wish to go to the Natural bridges what do you say about it I for my part would rather take the trip over the mountain though I am in for what ever suits you the best if it suits you the best to go to the bridges I want to go there I would like to have the crowd together longer as they are so anxious but we cant take both trips though it may suit you better to take the trip to the bridge as you would not loose so much time but I suppose your friends will look for you & I should not like to disappoint but I will leave it intirely to you your will is my pleasure you know what I would rather do but I want you deside if you prefer going to the bridge let us know immediately so we can make arrangements to that affet I leave it all for you to deside I do not know your friends but have a desire to see them I know I will love them do not forget the lady of your choice I wish you were here for I am not half through but must close as it is getting late write as soon as you get this you will come Friday or Saturday a week excuse all imperfections as this is my birth day
