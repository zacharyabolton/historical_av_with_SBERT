I received your very kind & much welcome letter of the 28th May, for which please accept my thanks. It found me rather sick, but I have ralied rapidly the warm weather Seams to agree with me and now it is melting hot, for in these Northern climes when it becomes warm the sun melts human objects and you can realy See vegetation growing. I was very happy to know that you are all well and still at Mount Solon. I heard from Cedar Creek and learned that Mr Adam Rudolph is dead. As soon as your father returns please have him ascertain the amount of taxes due on the lands & I will try and raise the funds to pay them. I am Sorry that Major McCue remains single Can't the young ladies of Mount Solon display a little christian Self Sacrifice and take him for better or worse I am Sure the Major is a fine man & will make a good husband if the young ladies would but try him. Please give my kindest regards to your mother & father & should you see the Furrors remember me kindly to them & if my health will permit I shall see you all before many months.
