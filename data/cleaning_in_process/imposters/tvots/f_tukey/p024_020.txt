I enclose to Mr Whiting herewith a Bill of expenses for the Mission at this point in which you will observe that I have reduced the price of Board to $4 per week, and also in addition to having rented one room of the House at $5 per Month I have taken it upon myself to pay $25 per year of it from my own pocket.  I wish to be understood however as not doing this from any conscious intention of having charged too much in my other Bill for I believed then as I believe now that the charges were as low as could be afforded when it is taken into consideration that no charges whatever were made to you for furnishing the House and I had to pay out upwards of three hundred dollars out of my own pocket for this purpose. but now in view of the fact that provisions are somewhat cheaper I will engage to Board them the balance of the year at the above rates.  over-- And now in conclusion I beg leave to say that I hope both this and my former Bill will be preserved untill such times as I can visit your rooms, and then if it is made to appear that any injustice has been done you, you will find me ready and willing to make amends.
