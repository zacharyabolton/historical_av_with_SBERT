Yours of the 12th came to Hand on Saturday evening last in which you say the A.M. Association have decided to send Teachers to Staunton this Fall or that you will forward Mrs Dunn + Miss [unclear: McLeune] as soon as they shall report themselves to your Rooms, In reply to this I have to inform you that sometime the last of Sept, I received a Letter from Miss [unclear: McLeune] Stating that herself + Mrs Dunn had both recd appointments from your Rooms with the information that Commissions would be sent them as soon as you decided where to locate them. they also informed me that they wished to visit some relatives in Washington on their way South if they could have time to do so before their schools would commence and also asked me if I thought it would make any difference to you if they left orders at home to have their commissions forwarded to them and they leave in advance of them, my reply was no that I thought as they had been Commissioned by you once before and you had seen them that you would not be particular to have them report in person again to you therefore I thought if they could visit their friends in Washington without any additional expense to you then would not be the Slightest objection on your part + acting under my advice they did so. Imediately on receiving your Note saying that you had or would assign them to duty here I wrote to them informing them of the fact + advising them to report here at once and I would write to you + learn your pleasure with regard to them. I took this course because we were all ready to start our Schools heree and I thought it would save time. now if this meets your approbation will you please forward them Commissions with any instructions you may wish to give them to this place. I have a House all ready to receive your Teachers + should be glad if you could forward two besides Mrs Dunn or Miss [unclear: McLeune] as there is plenty of work for them to do and I will strive hard to see that neither the Educational or Missionary interest of your Teachers suffer in Staunton. Yours with much respect + a desire for an Interest in your prayers that God may make me Equal to the work in which I am engaged
