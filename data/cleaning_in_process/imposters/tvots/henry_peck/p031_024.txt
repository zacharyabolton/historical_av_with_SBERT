The within papers having been refered to me as President of the Board Overseers of the Poor of Augusta County, by the County Court of Augusta at the August Term, would report that the Overseer of the Poor of Augusta County have put up additional buildings at the poor House of the County with a view of receiving colored Paupers of the County and we are prepared to support all colored Paupers belonging to the County, but would beg leave to call the attention of the Bureau to the fact that there is a large number of Freedmen in our county who have come in amongst us since the surrender who do not belong to the County and who we could not be expected to support.
