I received your letter a day or two ago and have commenced to answer it once or twice but was interrupted. I had my mare valued at 650$. My arms have not cost me a cent. One of the men gave me a rifle captured at Chancellorsville and I drew a pair of pistols from ordnance wagon which I will return as soon as I can capture one. I bought a sabre for 3$, the best one I have seen. Capt Steptoe sends his regards to you. He has just ordered us to strike tents and I have to close. Let me know when Jimmy Langhorne is coming. Love to all,
