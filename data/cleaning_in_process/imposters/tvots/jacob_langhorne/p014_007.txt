I saw Tip Griffin yesterday who told me that you were very uneasy about me. I got to the Regt Saturday the 9 and would have writen yesterday but the mail was carried off before I new it. I wrote to you once from Columbia and again at Ashland. Tell Ma I am a better hand to take care of my self than she thought. I flanked the Yankees until I got across the James R. and please don't be so uneasy about me in the future.  [unclear: Col] M & Judge say that they think it best for me to join the Wise Troop for three very good reasons. 1 that Capt. Steptoe is willing to take me in his mess. 2 you can get nearly twice as much for your hors to eat as a general thing in a small Company than you can in a large & when they issue corn you get a bag for each company and if the company is small you get as much more. 3 and best reason you will fare better in that line your self. You can buy any thing you want from the government at their price with his consent. The mail is about to leave and I must close. Love to all the family & Cousin Kate. Direct your letter to Orang CH.
