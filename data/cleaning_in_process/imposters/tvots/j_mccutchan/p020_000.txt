 Your letter to me was detained several weeks and I defered an answer hoping to hear from your friends in Augusta but there has been no flag of truce since I am not permitted to receive such things as you [unclear: propose] to send except from a near relative I am only allowed to receive money from friends and can purchase the small articles if you will be good enough to send me a few dollars of greenback Enclosed one Confederate postage stamp for you to write to your friend in Virignia.
