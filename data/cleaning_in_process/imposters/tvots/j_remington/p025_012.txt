I have the honor to report that on the 1st of September 1865, there were no buildings occupied by the Bureau in this District, for which rent has been claimed or paid. The offices at Lexington & Staunton were located in the Court Houses in these places, and the offices at Winchester & Harpers Ferry were held in buildings [unclear: hired] or taken by Commanding Officers for Head Quarters. 2d The amount of rent claimed and paid previously to and from that time to April 1st 1866, is $10. 3d There has been no personal property seized and applied to the use of the Bureau in this District.
