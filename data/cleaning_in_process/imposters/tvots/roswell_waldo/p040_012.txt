In compliance with Par VI Circular No X - dated Head Quarters Assistant Commmissioner Richmond Va March 12, 1866 - in relation to the operation of the order restoring to the Civil Authorities jurisdiction in Criminal Cases over Colored persons &c I have the honor to make the following report so far as said order pertains to this Division (Highland and Augusta Counties). My report under this head is necessarily brief this month from the fact that no Criminal case has been tried by any tribunal during the month in which I had any reason to believe injustice or partiality was shown to the colored party concerned. One case was referred from this office to a Magistrate for investigation which resulted in binding over the accused (white) to answer indictment before the Grand Jury at March term of Court. On account of the limited number of cases tried before Justices during the month, no opportunity has been offered for observing any spirit of prejudice exhibited on the part of these officers, therefore any opinion expressed in previous reports under this head cannot be materially modified at this time. No complaints have been made at this office by any party, arising from the disobedience of the "Game Saw" referred to in Circular NO 24 CS. from your office, nor have any instances in relation thereto come to my notice.
