I have the honor to report that the number of freedmen who are out of employment is increasing. While many have good [unclear: wages] for the worker, there are many others who find it very difficult to procure Employment sufficient to purchase the necessaries of life. Among this class are numbered the aged of both sexes and many children who are not old enough to care for themsleves.
