In consequence of my detention at Staunton Va until the 8th inst., awaiting my pay and transportation from Richmond, Va., I would respectfully ask if the revocation of my appointment could not be so amended as to take effect on that day, since the Expenses necessarily incurred while detained there are nearly equivalent to the pay due up to that time.
