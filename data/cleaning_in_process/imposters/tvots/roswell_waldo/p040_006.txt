I have the honor to request to be informed if the school report to be submitted by Circular 26. from Richmond Oct 21/68 - is to include those schools taught under the auspices of local church societies as well as by A Miss Assn. Also if the form on back of said Circular is to be considered merely as a guide by which a form of proper dimensions is to be made up - or is said report to be submitted on back of the Circular?
