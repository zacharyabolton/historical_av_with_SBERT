In reply to your request for a teacher at Waynesboro I have the honor to inform you that Mr. Brackett Supt of schools for the Valley will furnish teacher on the following condition: that the freedpeople will board & furnish fuel & pay him (teacher) $10 00  per month. Mr. Waring (colored) [unclear: representing] another association in the Vally will furnish teacher on same terms by paying $5 00  per month - Please inform me immediately which proposition you accept if either. - I, of course, recommend the latter.
