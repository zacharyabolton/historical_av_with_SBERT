In compliance with Par VI Circular No X- dated Headquarters Asst Commissioner Richmond Va March 12 1866 - in relation to the result of the operation of the order restoring to the Civil Authorities jurisdiction in Criminal Cases over colored persons &c I have the honor to make the following Report so far as said orders pertains to this Division, Highland and Augusta Counties. But two or three cases of a Criminal character have been referred to the Civil Authorities during the month, and those were withdrawn before coming to trial, the parties concerned preferring to settle them amicably rather than subject themselves to the costs that would accrue from a legal investigation. All these being of a petit nature, I could not but approve of the action of the complainant in withdrawing them. The political animosity of the Magistrates toward a Union man, of either color is so great that I have reason to believe, he would do more injury to the complaining party, if a loyal man, than justice to the party complained of, if of the opposite sentiment. When a Justice of the Peace will degrade himself, and his office by committing assualt and battery on a white man, without other cause for aggravation and offence, than his loyalty tested, as was done in this place but a few days since, I do not think such a man is too moral to manifest his resentment against a colored applicant for redress in case the accused be of the more popular stripe - a rebel - While I do not think all the Magistrates would [unclear: demean] themselves to the extent here represented, it is but a fair representation of the spirit engendered and personal feelings of many. Although I am unable to recite any instances where actual injustice has been done a Colored person by any Magistrate, yet this spirit of animosity courted by them against a man white or colored with loyal proclivities, is so prominently manifest that it is with a spirit of misgiving as to the [unclear: result] that I [unclear: refer] the complaints made to this office to the Civil Authorities for adjustment. Many complaints have been made of the non-payment or partial payment of employees for labor performed during the past season & for other causes, in many of which I have been successful in adjusting to the satisfaction of complainants, but it serves to show the spirit manifested toward the colored man, and the honesty and integrity of many whites by whom they have been employed. No complaints have been made at this office arising from the disobedience of the "Game Saw" referred to in Circular No 24 CS from your office, nor have any instances relative thereto come to my notice.
