By direction of the Asst Comr Richmond Va I most respectfully  in the matter of the difficulties existing [unclear: between] the Methodists and Baptists in regard to the use of the Church building at Waynesboro [unclear: &c] [unclear: that the] grant of $150 was made by the Bureau toward its Erection with the express understanding that the building was to be used as a house of worship by the Methodist denomination and as a schoolhouse for all children without distinction of sect. It is expected [unclear: therefore] that the Methodists will do themselves no discredit and their people no harm by trying to make the school in any way denominational. It is further hoped and expected that both denominations will unite in harmony in the use of said building for school purposes and that no further difficulty may arise regarding it.
