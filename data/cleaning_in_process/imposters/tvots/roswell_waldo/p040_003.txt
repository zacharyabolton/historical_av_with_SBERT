The colored people of Laurel Hill Augusta Co. are in need of a teacher for a school which they are ready to open. They have a comfortable log school house, for the Erection of which this Bureau appropriated $40.00. On account of the poverty of the colored people in that vicinity they could pay the board only of a teacher. On account of hostility of the white population toward colored schools, the people would prefer a colored teacher, as he or she could then board in a colored family. Can the Bureau or Am. Missionary Association send a teacher to this school? There will be about 25 or 30 scholars. Schools in other localities could be opened this winter if teachers of any sort could be procured & their wages paid from any other source than by the freedpeople.
