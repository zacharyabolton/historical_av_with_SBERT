In accordance with instructions contained in Par 6 Circular No 10 - dated Head Quarters, Asst Commissioner, Richmond Va March 12th 1866 - in relation to the result of the operation of the Order restoring to the Civil Authorities jurisdiction in Criminal Cases over colored persons &c - I have the honor to submit the following report as far as said order relates to this Division (Highland and Augusta Counties) viz: On account of the peaceable disposition of the colored population and their desire to confine their actions within the limits of the law, there has been but few Criminal cases tried by Magistrates during the present month. In these, the accused have been required to answer indictment for larceny & assault & battery before the next Grand Jury. I have no hesitation in saying that impartiality and fairness were observed on the part of the Magistrate in the disposition of these cases. In settling difficulties of a Civil nature where a colored man appeared as a party, I have adopted the course of my predecessor - by adjudicating them at this office as far as possible. I am convinced that this course results to the welfare & interest of the freedmen, they being relieved of the expense of a trial by the Civil tribunals, which expense, in their poverty stricken condition, they are unable to bear.
