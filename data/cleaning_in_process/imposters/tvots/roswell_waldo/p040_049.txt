In compliance with Par 6 Circular No 10 - dated Head Quarters Asst Commmissioner Richmond Va March 12, 1866 - in relation to the operation of the order restoring to the Civil Authorities jurisdiction in Criminal Cases over Colored persons &c I have the honor to make the following report so far as said order pertains to this Division (Highland and Augusta Counties). No case of a Criminal nature has been referred to the Civil Authorities from this office during the past month, nor has any been tried by the Courts in which there was any reason to believe that injustice was manifested toward any colored party. As the Bureau closes its operations on this date, there seems to be no necessity for extending this report, other than to refer to previous ones under this head.
