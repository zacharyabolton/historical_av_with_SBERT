In reply to your Communication of the 10th inst. requesting to be informed as to what [unclear: place] I am Entitled to transportation & I have the honor to state that my appointment in this Bureau was recieved at my home in Ravenna Portage Co Ohio (near Cleveland) When I was transferred from Washington to Va I received a new appt for this state, but I think I am entitled to transportation to the place where I received my original appt (Ravenna). If it be so decided, I most respectfully request that it be issued via Washington, Harrisonburg & Pittsburg - Having my family with me (wife & infant) it [unclear: would be] utterly impossible to go by Stage to Winchester, & I have business in Washington to settle before going to Ohio that requires my personal attention.
