I recd a letter from you a few days ago wishing to know if I knew Lewis Lurner and if he had any Property. I know him he is living with me and Draws his pay as fast as he earns it to pay up last years recpts he has nothing that I know of. I told him you had a Claim in your hand against him he said there was some owing of him and he would have to push them to pay you.
