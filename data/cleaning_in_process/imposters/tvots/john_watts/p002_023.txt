I have just learned from Roswell Waldo, [unclear: Esq], A.S.A.Comr., here, that he has been ordered to report at Wytheville for duty. And having been a close observer of him, & his promptitude in the dispatch of business involved by his position, permit me to express my deep regret at his ordered removal from the office here, and further, to express a hope that the order will be recalled, & he continued in his place: I have reason to believe he has given entire, general satisfaction, to all interests concerned. I have been here for over thirty years, & most of that time a member of the Bar: And I do think I have a right to think I can with propriety make the appeal herein, to you.
