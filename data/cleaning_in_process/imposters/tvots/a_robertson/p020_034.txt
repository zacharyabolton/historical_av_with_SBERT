Your moddle of gun is so incomplete that it will be useless to take it Richmond in it present condition & I haven't time to have one made. I have left it in Farmers Bank with Mr. Lo. Norvell. I think you had better come here & complete the Moddle & take it Rich'd But I have assertained that you can do nothing with the government or any one else unless we can furnish the metal for its manufacture. I can get up a large company here if we can furnish the mettal. So I think you had better go to Oronoco at once & put things through there & then start the gun nearly at the Armory works in Rich'd are stopped for want of mettal. Some very wealthy men are anxious to go into the iron business at Orono we get the iron & then we can go ahead with the gun I would have written to you sooner, but have been worked half to death by gen'ls in & around Lynchburg ever since I parted with you. Keep me acquainted with your movements In haste
