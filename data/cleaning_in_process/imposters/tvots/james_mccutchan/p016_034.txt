I am determined that you shall not quarrel with me the next time I see you for not writing to you; though I am sure I have written several letters that you do not get, but I am determinded to comply with your wishes, while there is paper ink or pencils in the Confederacy - It is almost night; I have been busy to day - on review drilling +c. I just finished my dinner of bean-soup + biscuit.  Gen Breckenridge is here + I think if our rations get much less, Gen Starvation will be here also or Gen. "Skidaddle" to a quarter where there is more to eat. - Gran. + myself got here safely, but had a tiresome ride over bad roads. I got a letter from you when I returned, + also one from Lydia + one from Cousin Mollie.  I'm getting awfully tired of this camp, I despise this inactivity. I am tired of the war - I wantto fight it out, + the sooner we begin this spring the better.  We had a grand sight here last night. The mountains around us were litteraly mountains of fire. It burned all round our cabins + what do you think we did - we just let it burn - I have to reduce myself to half a sheet as paper is scarse just at this time. We can buy nothing here now - nor can we, I suppose until the new money is issued - give my best love to all + write soon, assured that I will do the same.
