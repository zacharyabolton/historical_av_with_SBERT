I will surprise you with a few words + jokes. I am again in camp enjoying the pleasures & braving the hardship & dangers incident to such a life. As to any enjoyments they are many & various consequently I will not endeavor to enumerate them. I have had some pretty hard times since I came down. I have marched over 100 miles since leaving Winchester Thursday morning Jan 29 30. We had to march yesterday morning and I didn't get time to finish your letter. We marched 8 mls. yesterday & are now 5 mls. from Winchester on the [unclear: Pughtown] road. We are in winter quarters, are yet in our tents, but will continue building our cabins tomorrow. I think it probable that we may have some rest now for awhile We left Romney on the 23rd. It rained all the time we were there & was very muddy & disagreeable. Romney is a very nice town I suppose in time of peace, but it is overrun with soldiers + abused now. There are a few pretty girls there; some of were very kind to me & others were more "union than secesh" I think. There are several pretty churches there & a good many nice private residences & also a very commodious Court House, though the Yankees have torn the floors & every thing from the inside of the Court House.  The Federals left a great many things when they "vamoused" from there. I could have gotten a number of trophies but had no way of taking care of them. Its the most mountainous regions between here and Romney I ever saw. There are 8 mountains between here & there & The Pastures about Burnissis Springs is a paradise to the be best part of Hampshire County. The people of some places can look up the chimney & see the sheep & goats on the hill side above. There are some children out there that never saw the sun.  The Yankees have burned all the houses for 20 miles in this side of Romney. But I guess they won't burn any more soon Write to me soon. Direct to Winchester. In care of Cpt. H. J.
