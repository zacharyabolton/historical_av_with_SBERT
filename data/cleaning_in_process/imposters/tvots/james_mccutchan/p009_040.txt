I received your letter some time since + would have answered sooner, but times have been too stiring for a while to spend much time writing letters.  We left Winchester on the 11th, of this month + fell back to Strausburg; we stayed there a few days, + we are now about to middle way between Edinburg + Mt. Jackson. Our encampment is a very pretty one, in a beautiful pine grove, on the bank of the Shenandoah River. The surrounding country is exceedingly beautiful rivalling any in natural charm that I have ever seen. I felt sad when we left Winchester. although it is a very corrupt place in my estimation still there are a great many there who ar true and loyal to the South + it was hard to leave them to the mercies of those who have no hearts to feel even for themselves or others. Some were laughing + some crying as we came through town + there were many sad partings too - Two companies in our reg'mt were principally made up in Winchester, + these were forced to part with those near and dear to them. They were compelled to have mothers + sisters + wives, + little ones, who were all they had on Earth to love, + leave them too, without a hope of seeing them again + no prospect of hearing from them. I had to cry myself when I came through Strausburg. The doors + pavements were filled with ladies old + young + even the little children were weeping forced to do so by the tears of their Mothers + Sisters. Such scenes are romantic, but I envy them not their feelings, when they feel themselves cut of from their friends + left to the tender mercies of those black hearted traitors, who are strangers to mercy. [unclear] there is a time of retribution coming a time when we can relieve the broken hearted + lift them from the dust into which they have been trampled by the unhallowed foot of the oppressor. Our last stopping place was between Woodstock + Edinburg; we stayed there one night. It was the most romantic place I ever saw. Right on the edge of a high cliff on the side of the Shenandoah River. The cliff is on one side of the turnpike + the railroad on the other side crosses a deep chasm on trussel work 130 feet high. I will send you some Spruce Pine that I got there. I must write some to your Ma.
