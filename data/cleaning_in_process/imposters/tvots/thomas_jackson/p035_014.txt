I respectfully ask information as to cost of transportation by cheapest route from Jacksonville, Florida to Staunton, Virginia. Charlotte Slate and daughter, sold hence some time back, are anxious to return here, and their friends are willing to contribute as their means admit, toward paying their passage as above.
