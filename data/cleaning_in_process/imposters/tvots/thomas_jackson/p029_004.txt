In compliance with requirements of Cir. 10 S. 1866 (B. R. F. & A. L.) I respectfully report that I have been present at several examinations of Freedmen before Mayor N. K. Trout and other magistrates and in every case the action of the presiding justice has been impartial. Before the County court the only case tried of the same character was Comm v. [unclear: Hill] for the theft of Corn which resulted in conviction of Bell> to be imprisoned for 60 days in the County jail. Of this case the Defendant's counsel informs me that although the circumstances hardly warranted the severity of the sentence still the court acted with the utmost impartiality.
