Your kind and christian letter of the 16th inst. with the accompanying resolutions have been received. I write this note to thank you for having so effectually complied with my request, and to ask that your prayers and christian efforts be continued as before requested. My trust is in God, and it is a great comfort to me to know that He answers prayer. I am very thankful to our kind Heavenly Father for restoring you to health. I hope that both your sons, if not entirely well at present soon will be.
