I have the honor to request that enquiry be made at Richmond for Estaline Doke (col'd) aged about 14 years daughter of Abraham Doke who lives at Naked Creek, Augusta Co. Estaline was sold to Richmond in 1862 by James E. Carson, a slave trader. Her father (Abraham) has heard indirectly she is still in Richmond and he is anxious to find her and have her come to his home where he can take good care of her. Perhaps enquiry through the schools may lead to her discovery.
