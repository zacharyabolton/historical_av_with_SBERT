Under date July 3/67 I forwarded to your Head Quarters request of Benjamin Frazer (col'd) for help from his family living near Fredericksburg, which was returned to me through your HdQrs Aug. 14/67 attention invited to endorsement of Lt. Hector Sears A.S.A.C. 1st Div. 6 S.D. Va. Aug. 8/67 who said that "Nathan his son would send him some money soon." Benjamin calls again at this office, is in a distressed condition and asks that Nathan send what he can of money as soon as possible or have some arrangements made for reunion of the family.
