In compliance with the requirements of Cir Ord No. 6 Series 1866 (B.R.F.&A.L.) I have the honor to submit the following report of condition of Bureau affairs in this 4th Div of 9th Sub.Dist. Va. The election held on the 22nd of October passed quietly at all the Districts in this county (Augusta) and the excitement consequent on this [unclear: canvass] has postponed much of the ordinary business of this office. There was excellent order at all the places of voting, but since the election there has been a most outrageous attempt to deter freedmen from voting again except they vote as ordered by their masters. Owing in a great measure to this, contracts have not been so frequent the last half of this month. The circumstances of Freedmen, as a rule, are comfortable but those with families realize but little over a base subsistence. There are many applications for relief by aged and helpless freedpeople and when the time comes, I shall endeavor to have the county authorities provide proper maintenance for deserved poor. The Social relations between white and colored have not become more amicable by the recent election, but I advise patience and forbearance on the part of Freedmen and they refrain almost entirely from discussion. Politically the whites have compelled the freedmen to take sides against them. The Conservative candidates openly proclaimed their opposition to education, franchise or elevation for the Colored men and of course they naturally voted for the Republicans who were willing they should enjoy these privileges. The Moral condition of the Freedmen is not as it should be but education for the young will in time bear good fruit. I am unable to report any temperance organization as yet among the Freedmen but there is much less drunkeness than a few months back and when the political excitement has subsided I may succeed in forming a branch society of the Lincoln Temperance Association.
