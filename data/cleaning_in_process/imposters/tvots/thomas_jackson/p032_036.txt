Miss Rowell arrived safely at Staunton but I have had great difficulty in finding a boarding place and at last had to rent part of a house occupied by a colored man & wife. I am somewhat embarrassed in this matter and this lady question was the reason I asked so earnestly for a gentleman.

Excuse my hurried letter but I have been working day or night to 9 or 10 at night on Registration & election and would not have written at all had I not felt compelled to notice the  [unclear: letter].
