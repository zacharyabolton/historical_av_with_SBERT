I have the honor to transmit letter of Wm W. Montgomery, J.P. Deerfield asking for aid for a Freedman's School at Deerfield taught by  Willgoss. Deerfield is an isolated place between the North and Shenandoah mountains and if aid can be given in such cases I respectfully recommend it be granted in this. I have furnished the school with some books received from Am. Tract Society Dept at Richmond.
