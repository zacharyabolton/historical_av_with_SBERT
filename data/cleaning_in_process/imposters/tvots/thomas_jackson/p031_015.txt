In compliance with Cir. Ord. 6 S. 1866 I have the honor to report that during the month of August the examination of trials of Freedmen have been conducted with entire fairness and counsel appear always ready to defend. I regret that so many Freedmen should be imprisoned in the jail at Staunton but though I have made repeated visits nine complain they are unjustly imprisoned.
