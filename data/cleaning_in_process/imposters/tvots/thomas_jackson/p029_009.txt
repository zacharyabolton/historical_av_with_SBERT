Peyton Harris (c) complains of bad treatment of his child by your wife and that you attempt to break an agreement made with him for present year. I need not tell you that the law gives you no right to beat or threaten anyone and before you can put Harris out of his house & garden you must assign sufficient reason, such as breach of agreement on his part.
