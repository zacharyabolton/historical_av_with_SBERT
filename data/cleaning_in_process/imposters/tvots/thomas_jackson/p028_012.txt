I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of communication from your Hd Qr May 7/67 authorizing me to forward Ration estimates for May and referring me to "Circular 33 Hd Qrs Asst Comr S. 1866" The office file of orders at this post is so imperfect as to be almost useless and [unclear: much] was [unclear: missing]. I respectfully transmit Ration returns for 21 days calling for 630 rations. These lack my signature as I was instructed to forward them some time back. If incorrect in this report or if you require the names please inform me.
