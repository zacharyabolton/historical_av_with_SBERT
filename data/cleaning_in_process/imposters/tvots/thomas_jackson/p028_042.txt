Complaint is made by Violet Baker that Michael son of Mr John Harman did yesterday May 28 assault and strike her child Ellen Baker or [unclear: Eats] while at the spring on her farm and made threats of further maltreatment. I understand Mr John Harman lives within the corporation limits and I respectfully refer the matter to you for such action as you deem just.
