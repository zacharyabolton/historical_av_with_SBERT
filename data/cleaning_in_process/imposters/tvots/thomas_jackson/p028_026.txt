Fenton Wells (freedwoman) living at Staunton complains that her husband John Arnall neglects to support herself or family and asks that he join her here or send for her to live with him at Richmond. About Christmas 1866 John Arnall was employed as a blacksmith by Mr. John Tanner, Gamble's Hill, Richmond. Fenton appears to be a striving respectable woman and I respectfully ask he (Arnall) may be found and required to assist her.
