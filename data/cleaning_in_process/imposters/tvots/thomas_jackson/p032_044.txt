I respectfully ask if Transportation can be furnished from Staunton, Augusta Co. Va to Nashville Tennessee for York Kidd freedman. York is now about 60 years old and in failing health. his family sold from him to Tennessee, write they will take good care of him if he can reach there. There is about his case a circumstance it is proper to mention, that York has a claim against a Mr. R.W. Smith of Staunton which could he collect, would more than pay his expenses, but I cannot compel Smith to settle even partially & York has not means to sue.
