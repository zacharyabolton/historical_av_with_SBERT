I respectfully return papers of James Woods June 17/67. I have written twice to Mr. James Dorman Esq Wood's counsel, who resides at Lexington, Rockbridge Co. but have received no reply whatever. I have not seen Woods for some time and when I last saw him he stated that a new trial would have been granted him if he could have given $50 security for costs. The property in question lies in Rockbridge Co.
