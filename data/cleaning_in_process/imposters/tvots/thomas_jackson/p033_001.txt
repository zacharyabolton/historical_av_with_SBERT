I ask your direction how I can be reimbursed for purchase of barely necessary furniture for Teachers. I could not find a boarding place public or private, no one would have a teacher, and I had to rent two rooms which were entirely unfurnished & buy some few things. I have paid about $33 and $15 or $20 more will be needed to give them chairs to sit on. The school is progressing well, but Miss Rowell's assistant has not yet arrived and her services are much needed.
