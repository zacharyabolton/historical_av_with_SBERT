In compliance with Cir. Ord. No. 10 6 B.R.F. & A.L. S. 1866 I have the honor to report that during the current month no trials of cases involving the rights of Freedmen have been had in either county or circuit courts in this Division. Several freedmen have been committed to jail by magistrates on charges of larceny and remain in confinement from inability to give bail.
