In compliance with Cir. Ord. No. 6, Series 1866 I have the honor to report that during the month of September several trials of Freedmen have been had before the county court. In all of these full justice was accorded by court and jury. In minor cases before Magistrates in their districts, Freedmen, being without counsel, cannot fully obtain impartial justice, but this is more the result of their own ignorance, than wrong action on the part of the justice, basing his decision upon the facts, as presented. To remedy this as much as lies in my power, I shall continue to notify magistrates that if Freedmen request, the examination be postponed until I can be sent for to appear for them.
