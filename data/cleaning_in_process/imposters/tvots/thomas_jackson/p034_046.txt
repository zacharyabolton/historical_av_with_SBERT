I have the honor to transmit enclosed here with account of John Brent (col) against Henry Miller & Son of Brownsburg, Rockbridge Co. and letter of Daniel Brown J. R. in answer to an enquiry made by me. Brent comes to this office and insists that Miller is indebted to him as per act and that at the examination before the Justice Brown his witnesses were not heard nor any credit given to his own statement. As to the watch for which a credit of $25 is given Brent says that it was extended to Miller to have a new hand to put on but he (Miller) retained it as appears by account. Brent appears a quiet, steady man and I respectfully ask the matter be investigated by the proper officer in Rockbridge Co.
