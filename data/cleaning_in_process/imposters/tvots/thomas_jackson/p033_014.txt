Your endorsement on Mr. Kennedy's letter of Nov. 8 is a relief as it settles definitively the  current time as to the schools and Mr. Scott. My only object (having no preference) is that the school shall succeed & it will but there has been an [unclear: unwilling] movement caused by hope Mr. Scott and others would be engaged which has embarrassed myself and Miss Rowell. The board money I have arranged & have advanced for Wood &c myself.
