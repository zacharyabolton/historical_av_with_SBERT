I have the honor to report that Mr Alexander Curry now of Bath Co. late of Highland has been indicted in Highland Co for theft of a horse from Mrs Sarah Bird of Highland Co. during the war. There is another of the suit instituted in Highland Co. against all in any way connected with the Federal troops during the War and the scouting parties so frequently sent out by them and as enquiry is now being made into some of these cases at Winchester. I notified Mr. Somers the Sheriff not to arrest Curry until some decision had been given on such case. Without defending the conduct of such men in all cases, I am satisfied all such suits should be dismissed for as the courts are constituted in Highland the same law will not be administered if the [unclear: Union] man is plaintiff as if he is defendant. The case of Curry's may likely come up at court held at Monterey Dec 12/67. I respectfully ask instructions,
