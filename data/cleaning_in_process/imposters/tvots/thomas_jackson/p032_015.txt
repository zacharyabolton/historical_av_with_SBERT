I have the honor to enclose a claim of Joshua Harris (col'd) against Mr. Jacchesi of Charlottesville (who kept a restaurant at White Sulphur Springs) amount $18 75  Jacchesi has paid Harris nothing and makes as I understand no excuse except that six (6) Knives & forks were lost. Harris claims that even if the knives were lost the room was open day & night by way of Mr. Jacchesi and their value is very far below $18 75/100. Harris is a faithful, respectable man and bears a first class character for honesty.
