Your communication of Sep 19, has had attention but I could not give a satisfactory reply as there was some difficulty in the way of procuring a School Room in proper terms. The Trustees of the M.E. Church have now given consent to use of basement for school purposes if BRF&AL will expend $100 in school fixtures in lieu of rent for the season and in my Sept. report I respectfully urge such appropriation be made and now I ask your assistance in securing this and teachers. If but one can be sent by all means send a gentleman. We want a teacher who can go out among the poor and "make them come in". Mr. Brackett when here was much in doubt whether his principals could spare teachers here, but the field is too large the in- terest of too many at stake to let the door of the school house be closed at Staunton. The room will answer at once for school purposes if you can send a teacher now and his suggestions would be useful in making the $100 provide the most needed articles.
