Martha Marston (c) mother of Mimi 10 years and Alfred 7 years, are living with a widow lady in Staunton who cannot keep them longer and they must be homeless. Martha says her husband Anthony Marston (c) lived with Mr. Philip Louis Burrel at Winchester, that she was "refugeed" here and if she could reach Winchester where all her friends live she could do well enough. I respectfully ask enquiry be made for her husband, or friends, and if it appears she can be bettered by removal before bad weather that transportation or aid toward it, be furnished for Martha and her two children, hence to Winchester.
