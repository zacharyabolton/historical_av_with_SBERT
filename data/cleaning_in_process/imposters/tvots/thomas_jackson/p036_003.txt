Hiram Thompson (cold) who lives near Fishersville in Augusta Co. states that a General Long an officer in the rebel army has in his possesion at or near Leesburg, Loudon Co. Va. a Bay horse, (black leg, mane & tail, nearing 8 years old) which is the property of said Hiram Thompson and was stolen from his stable during the war, by a Lieut. Hunter of Rockbridge Co. and by him transfered to Genl. Long in exchange for another horse. Thompson claims to have information that his horse is not branded and was claimed by Genl. Long as his private property when Gen. Lee's army surrendered. Thompson attempted to reclaim the horse immediately after it was taken from his stable, but while he was seeking evidence required, the command to which Lieut. Hunter was attached left Staunton, taking off the horse. Thompson bean an excellent character and reliable neighbors say there will be no difficulty in identifying the horse which was well known as a valuable animal of Morgan stock. I am further informed that the horse was taken by Lt. Hunter without any authority whatever and has never been known as a public animal. I have the honor to request such enquiry be made as will restore the horse to Hiram Thompson if above fact can be proved.
