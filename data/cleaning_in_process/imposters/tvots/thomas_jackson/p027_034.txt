I respectfully forward claim of Reily McDonald, Staunton against C.W. Oltmann, late of Staunton but now said to be at Lexington (at Washington College in employ of one Col. Allen. Oltmann gave McDonald an order on Mr. Jed. Hotchkiss of Staunton but he refuses to pay for the reason he has no funds of Oltmann in hand and so states in writing.
