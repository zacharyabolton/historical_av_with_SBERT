In compliance with Cir. Order No 10 6 BRF & AL S. 1866 I have the honor to report that except examination before magistrates no trials involving the rights of Freedmen have taken place in either county or circuit courts in the 4th Division but several freedmen are in custody awaiting trial at March term. Examinations before Magistrates have been repeatedly attended by me and found conducted fairly except occasionally excessive bail demanded, which in deserving cases, I have procured an abatement of.
