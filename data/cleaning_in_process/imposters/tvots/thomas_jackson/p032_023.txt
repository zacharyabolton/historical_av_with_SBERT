Your favor of 4th inst. I received 5th inst. and reply at once that Mr. Brackett informed me he could not supply this station and the anxiety of the colored parents for a school is so great that I shall gladly for them accept your offer of one lady teacher, and the room can be at once used by borrowing some chairs &c so I hope she will come on at once. I have not yet found a place where she can board, in fact except a mention at Sabbath School  I have had no opportunity, but if you [unclear: give] me two or three days notice of her coming I will have all prepared.
