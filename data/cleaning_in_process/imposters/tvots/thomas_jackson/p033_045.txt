I respectfully ask enquiry be made at Richmond for a colored man known only here as "Uncle Fleming" said to live at "Lee's" jail, an old slave pen. If found, that he be asked to give the name and residence of the man named Quarles, who bought three of the children of Nancy Thornton, Reuben about 13 years old Amy 12 and Ransome 11. Nancy is very anxious to find her children and if Fleming can not be found at Lee's Jail I ask such enquiry be made for him as will discover him if in Richmond.
