In compliance with requirements of Cir. 10 S. 1866 BRF & A.L. I respectfully report that during the month of June 1867 the Circuit Court of Augusta Co. has been in session; that several cases were tried in which Freedmen were interested parties, that I was present during several of the trials and that in [unclear: impanelling] juries receiving testimony and rendering verdicts, the action of Court, Prosecuting Attorney and Juries, the requirements of the Civil Rights Bill were fully carried out. In minor cases brought before Magistrates, I had not seen, nor has there been reported to me, any partial proceedings against Freedmen.
