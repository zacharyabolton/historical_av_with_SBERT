Betsey Brown (col'd) sold from this county some 20 years ago has reached Staunton from Mississippi with three children and her means are exhausted. She is a daughter of Garbriel Brown (col) who is living about four miles from Winchester on the Charlestown road. Please have enquiry made for Gabriel or he can send money to pay her passage to Winchester or if he is not able I respectfully ask transportation for her and her children as she is penniless
