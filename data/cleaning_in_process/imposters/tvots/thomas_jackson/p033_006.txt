Enclosed I forward a letter from Mr. John Scott with the explanation it appears he has permission from Am. Miss. Ass. to take charge of schools at Staunton and I think he is desired by the colored people here and will relieve me of a very troublesome business so I hope he will come. Miss Rowell however intimates to me that she will not be allowed to act as his assistant nor is she willing to do so. This will necessitate a change for her and the assistant promised by F.A.C. of New York, now daily expected. Please have matter arranged definitely (for this double correspondence and expectation of change is prejudicial to the school and unpleasant to Miss Rowell) and inform me of decision as soon as possible.
