In this matter of the two months between yourself and Mr Grant & Daniel Lee I see no reason to change the view I took at first. The 5 Bus Wheat was evidently sold by Grant to Lee & charged as cash in the settlement between them. Lee was working continuously under your orders. If you are responsible for the 2 months at all you and for the whole and cannot seek to make the $10 for Wheat a payment on your account. I think on full review you will arrive at the same conclusion.
