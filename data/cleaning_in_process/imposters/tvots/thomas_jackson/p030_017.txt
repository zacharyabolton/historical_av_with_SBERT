The occupation of the house on Mr. Shaw's land where you now live is dependent entirely upon your working for him in a proper and regular manner. As you have ceased so to work Mr. Shaw has the right to eject you giving you a few days as reasonable notice to provide yourself another home. You will give Mr. Shaw peaceable possession within ten (10) days from receipt of this notice.
