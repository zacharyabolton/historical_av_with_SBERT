I respectfully forward copy (evidently imperfect) of indenture Punch Fox to John H. Rippitoe. Both parties reside near Staunton. Fox claims that Rippitoe so far from teaching him the trade of "brick mason" hired him out year after year as farm hand and received and kept the whole amount of such hire. Both in default to teach him the trade of "brick mason" & settlement subsequent to the expiration of apprenticeship Fox claims that Rippetoe has defrauded him. Can you have the copy enclosed compared with the original on record in Nelson County and the omission between the words "Punch Fox" and "in the craft" &c supplied or correct copy made.
