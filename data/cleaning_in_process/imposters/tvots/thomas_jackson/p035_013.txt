I respectfully ask enquiry be made at Parkersburg, W.Va for Cynis Bannister (col'd) who left his wife (Angeline Bannister) and family at Staunton in 1864. Went first to Swan Tavern at Parkersburg and is said to be keeping a confectionary store there at this time. His wife and family stand in great need of his assistance and from all I learn well deserve it.
