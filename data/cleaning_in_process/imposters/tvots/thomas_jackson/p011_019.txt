I am very grateful to you for your prayers to God for the success of the operations which God has entrusted to me. Please continue to pray for me and for the success of the troops entrusted to me. It cheers my heart to think that many of God's people are praying to our ever kind Heavenly Father for the success of the Army to which I belong. Without God's blessing I look for no success, and for every success my prayer is, that all the glory may be given unto Him to whom it is properly due. If people would but give all the glory to God, and regard his creatures as but unworthy instruments, my heart would rejoice. Alas too frequently the praise is bestowed upon the creature. Whilst we must not forget the superior importance of spiritual victories, yet I trust that you under God's direction do what you can in securing the prayers of His people for the success of our arms, especially for the success of those which are entrusted to me, an unworthy servant, but who desires to glorify his name even in my present military calling. My trust is in God for success. Praying for a continuation of your usefulness,
