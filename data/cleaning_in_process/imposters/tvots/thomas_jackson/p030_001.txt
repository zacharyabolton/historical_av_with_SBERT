 On the 27 of May Marian Hall (c) made com- plaint at this office that S.C. Slaven of Highland Co witheld from him his daughter Mary Elizabeth on the ground said child had been bound to him by the County Court of Bath Co. Va. I wrote to Slaven on the 30 of May but received no reply. Since, looking over some papers, I find letter from S.C. Slaven received some time before I took charge, which I respectfully transmit asking that the records of the court of Bath Co. be ex- amined to see if the indenture will be recognized as fair and valid by the Bureau. The father claim he is fully able to support the child and was when taken from him but being himself a slave the authorities would not allow him to retain or provide for it.
