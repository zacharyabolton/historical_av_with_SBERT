In compliance with C.O. No 10 6 (BRF & AL) S. 1866 I have the honor to report that during the month of November no cases involving the rights of Freedmen have been tried at County or Circuit Court. Numerous complaints have been referred to District Magistrates but with indifferent result, owing in part to inability on my part to be present at examination and also the poverty of the Freedmen who are unable to sue in County courts.
