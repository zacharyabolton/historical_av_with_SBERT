Your communication of date May 8/67 asking if BRF & AL would aid support of teachers in Valley during the present summer &c is returned with endorsement "such aid cannot be furnished by the Bureau" I trust notwithstanding present discouragement your society will retain several if not all the teachers during this summer, taking advantage of the increasing interest manifested by the Freedpeople in Education and the disposition to tolerate schools on the part of the Whites.
