Peyton Harris (C) complains of bad treatment of his child by your wife and that you attempt to break an agreement made with him for present year. I need not tell you that the law gives you no right to beat or threaten to beat anyone and before you can put Harris out of his house and garden you must assign sufficent reason, such a breach of agreement on his part.
