I have the honor to enclose a note written by Mr David Fultz to Mr. Peyton and inviting attention to Mr. Peyton's endorsement thereon, ask that enquiry be made of Richard Munroe (col'd) who lives on land of Taylor Rice, Meechum's River, Albemarle County, who claims the boy, is a proper person to have charge of him and if his statement that he married a sister of the boy (James [unclear: Cozzens]) is correct. As Richard Munroe has not called on me himself, I did not think it proper to direct the boy be given up until enquiry had been made as to his rights and means of support.
