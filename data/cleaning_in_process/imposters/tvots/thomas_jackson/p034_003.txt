In compliance with your order Dec. 4th 1867 to report what action was taken in the "four cases of attack with pistols" alluded to in November report under Cir. 6, I have the honor to transmit copies of letter addressed by me to James Bumgardner Comm Atty. in reference to cases of Baker Jackson and Wallace, to William Chapman J.P. in reference to case of Levi Middlebrook and to John M. Huff in reference to case of Mary Minor. On receipt of instructions from Capt. John A. McDonnell Sub. Asst. Comr. to refer cases of Wallace &c to county magistrates, I proceeded to Mt. Torrey Furnace some 25 miles from this place, but found Wallace from home. I have however directed his wife to apply to Justice Chapman for a warrant against Ford and Sarah A. Epps, to Justice [unclear: Koiner] for a warrant against Robert [unclear: Loving] Hugh Jackson I could not find. To this time I have received in instruction that warrants have been issued in any of these cases or seen the com- plaints, who live at a distance from Staunton, except when they first called at this office to make complaint, and owing to the absence of county official, at Richmond I cannot learn if any action has been taken by the civil Authorities.
