In compliance with C.O. No. 10 BRF & AL S. 1866 I have the honor to report that during this month session of Hustings Court, Staunton has been held and County Court has just opened its sittings. As to the decisions of Hustings Court I respectfully refer to my special report of March 10/68 in cases of Comm v. James Brigham & Comm v. John McNinch whether the defect [unclear: inheres] in the law or in the officers I cannot decide, but although impartial justice may not be denied in [unclear: terms] to freedmen it is very evident it is difficult for them to obtain it either before courts or magistrates. From this remark I would except controversies as to property but these as compared with breaches of the peace are very rare with freedmen.
