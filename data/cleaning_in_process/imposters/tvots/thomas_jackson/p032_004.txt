I have the honor to enclose receipt of George Harlan, Jailor custodian of Alexander Jones, lunatic freedman, for one shirt and one pair pants, issued from Bureau stores under my charge for the purpose of clothing said Alexander Jones for his journey from Staunton to Howard's Grove Hospital, Richmond, he having entirely destroyed all his own clothing. I respectfully ask if enclosed receipt will be vouched sufficient for me, with your approval of the issue.
