In compliance with Cir. Ord. No. 10 Bureau RF & AL S. 1866 I have the honor to report that during the month at both County and Hustings Courts several cases involving the rights of Freedmen have been tried only one case of importance on the list, a charge of attempted rape on the person of a colored girl by Thomas Harris colored and this was removed to the Circuit Court. On the other cases the bench acted with strict impartiality but it was painfully apparent that many freedmen had been held in confinement for want of bail, on charges which were totally unsupported by evidence, and in one case, Comm. v. John Hughes for grant larceny, the jury actually brought in a verdict of guilty, when the Corp. Attorney had charged them there was no testimony against him. Hughes' counsel promptly moved for a new trial, which the court granted, and the Corp. Atty at once entered a nolle prosequi and Hughes was discharged while the jury who had brought in a verdict of guilty were yet in their seats. I have appealed both to magistrates and the mayor against demanding excessive bail from freedmen charged with trivial offences but they inform me the statute gives them no discretion below amounts it is impossible for most of them (the Freedmen) to give. The consequence is the jail is often crowded to the great cost of the county and demoralization of those who have committed perhaps their first offence.
