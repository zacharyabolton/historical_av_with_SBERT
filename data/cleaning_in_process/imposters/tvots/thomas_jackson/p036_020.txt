I have the honor to transmit herewith enclosed paper in reference to claim of Henry Alexander's heirs col'd against estate of J. McPhetus McCutchen, deceased, asking the matter be referred to Military Comr 14th Divn. for investigation. Benj. Moten came here from Fredericksburg but found legal expences too much for him to prosecute the claim and further he could not absent himself from his business at Fredericksburg. The other claimants who live here are too poor to sue in court. The estate is solvent, and the adminstrators a loyal honorable man who will admit the claim if proper proof is furnished, and a receipt given which will be admitted as a valid voucher in his settlement of accounts with the estate.
