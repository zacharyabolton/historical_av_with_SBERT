James Harris (col'd) left his wife Elizabeth and child at this place and went to Danville. He writes to her from that place, Sept 23/67, stating he had found a home and would send for her to join him. Since, Elizabeth has not heard from him and asks enquiry be made for him and he either send for send for her or return her to take care of her. He speaks in his letter of his "uncle John's people" at Danville, which may be a clue to his whereabouts.
