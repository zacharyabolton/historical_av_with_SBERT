I have the honor to transmit my [unclear: injual] application for Transportation of Orphans from Staunton to Richmond with endorsements and also this explanation. For some reason or other there seems an excess of [unclear: g---g] orphan children at Staunton and if homes are found but food and clothing can be had & no education. Sally M. Lane and [unclear: James] Cozzen ran away from Peyton who formerly owned the parents & I had difficulty in inducing them to return. They did so, hoping I shall send for them. James W. & George Washington Stuart and children of a  widow who cannot support them she begs they may be allowed to go North and I respectfully second her request as they must otherwise be bound out. The rest have homes but poor prospects.
