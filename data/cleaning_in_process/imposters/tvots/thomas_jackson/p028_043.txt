 Alice Moore aged 16 asks information of her parents Roderick Moore, who lived with Wm Hayward Ham 10 miles from Goldsboro N.C. on Kinston road, and Sally Moore who lived with Nicholas Bess 6 miles from Goldsboro. Ham sent the child to be sold in 1864c5 and she was bought by Wm McFall of Augusta County who lives with WM Shumate of Stuanton. I respectfully ask enquiry be made through proper channel.
