At the request of Mr. Alexander Anderson of Augusta Co. I have the honor to transmit a claim made by him against the United States for property seized by and furnished to U.S. troops from June 7 to 9th 1864, amounting to $476 0/100. Many similar claims have already been presented and will be almost numberless if the U.S. govt. commences paying them. For Mr. Alex. Anderson I can only say that his account is a just statement of his losses and that his loyalty throughout has been decided and unconditional.
