I have the honor to report three cases of assault upon colored persons, and to ask instructions, as from what transpired this morning, I cannot but infer that the prosecuting officer will not willingly perform his duty as a public officer. On the 1st Inst Hartwell Baker (col'd) was assaulted by Patrick O'Nole who snapped a pistol at him several times, but as it did not explode he beat him with the butt of the pistol. Taken before a magistrate O'Nole was fined $17"" [unclear: Son] Hartwell coming to me I sent him and his witnesses to Mr Bumgarner the Com Atty no action yet taken. On the 1st Inst Hugh Jackson (col'd) complained that on Oct 31st James L spencer assulted him with a knife. I referred him also to Mr. Bumgarner- and no action yet taken. Nov 8. Abraham Wallace (col'd) complained that on October 31st James L Spencer assaulted him with a knife. I referred him also to Mr. Bumgarner and no action yet taken Nov 8. Abraham Wallace (cold) complained on that day Henry Ford discharged a loaded pistol three times and snapped a cap the fourth time at his wife Eveline Wallace. This morning I addressed enclosed letter to Mr Bumgarner making a mistake in his intials which are James [unclear: L]. He opened the letter, said to Wallace I had no right to write anything to him and without giving Wallace any advice or satisfaction returned my letter by him. Sentiment is so strong against Freedpeople here (not withstanding their quiet deportment) since the election, that I fear unless such outrages are promptly checked there will be trouble between the two classes. I respectfully ask instructions as to what steps I am authorized to take in such cases.
