I respectfully renew my application to you under date April 20 by "that I may be furnished at as early a day as possible with a suitable horse." In addition to the general business of this office the Circuit Court for Highland Co. is now sitting, and as much complaint has been made of injustice to Refugees & Freedmen, whose cases have been tried there and I was desirous to attend, but am unable to do so as the horse at this post is blind and unsafe even for good roads.
