In compliance with Circular No 16 C.S. HdQrs Asst. Comr. State of Va. I have the honor to report that no Rations have been issued to Colored paupers in this Division since June 1867. During that month I issued (as per report) as follows to -- Adults 5 Males, 12 Females Total 17 - Children 5 Males 9 Females, Total 14. Aggregate 31, Aggregate May Report 40. Total Rations issd 616. The [unclear: favorable] result of crops here and the evident ability of the County to support the poor within its limits led me to suspend further issues. I addressed a communication to the County Court now in session in Augusta County and transmit herewith copy of reply. In Highland Co. there are few Freedmen, these nearly all belong to that county and the authorities are fully able to provide for them.
