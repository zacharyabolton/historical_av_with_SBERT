I have the honor to transmit copy of a letter addressed by me to Capt. John A. McDonnell [?] and letter from Asst. Com. dated Aug 15th/67 with request the case may have prompt consideration and as John Gum's property is advertised to be sold under execution referred to on the 12th of September, [?] A. Burket & John Gum are in the same position. All the documents pertaining to the case have been forwarded to [?] from time to time as shown by letter from Asst. Com. & copy of mine of June 15. Gum asks from the Military an order suspending fals under execution & stay of proceedings in three other similar suits to be tried 12th [?] until he can have a [?] and I know of no case in which such interference is more appropriate & necessary.
