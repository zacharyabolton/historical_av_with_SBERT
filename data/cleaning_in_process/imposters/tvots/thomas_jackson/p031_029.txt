Col. Franklin on behalf of James D. Hick, also of Highland Co for whose arrest on a similar charge the Sheriff (Somers) hold a warrant but which he has not executed and notified him Somers (July 17/67) Hick had appealed to the Military authorities & his arrest would be at Somers' peril. Please let me have some information of probable action in both cases before 10th [?] as I propose to attend Court at [?] on the 12th September.
