I respectfully ask that enquiry be made at Tuscaloosa, Alabama for Daniel Brown (c) son of Sally Brown of Staunton, Va. now about 25 or 27 years old Daniel belonged to William Donaghee of Staunton whose daughter married the Rev. Roberth White, pastor of the Presbyterian church at Tuscaloosa and took Daniel with her to that place some time about 1851. His mother, Sally Brown, is desirous to know where and how he is, and that he communicate with her through this office.
