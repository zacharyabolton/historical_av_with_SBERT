I respectfully ask that Transportation be granted for York Kidd and his wife Martha destitute freedpeople, from Staunton, Va. to Nashville, Tenn. York is old and in failing health. His family, sold from him, live at Nashville and are able and desirous to help their parents. The family with whom York is living at present are in straitened circumstances and cannot give him a home any longer. I cannot specify the proper R.R. route beyond "from Staunton to Richmond via Va. C.R.R."
