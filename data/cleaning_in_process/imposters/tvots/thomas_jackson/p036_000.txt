I respectfully ask that Fifty ($50) dollars be appropriated by Bureau R. F. & A. L. to aid in building a School House at Churchville, 9th District of Augusta Co. under following circumstances. John Reed a colored man has had a school taught in his house by his daughter Sophia J. Reed The house is small and owing to family matters the school had to be discontinued. Reed has now given a piece of ground for a site for a new school house, and some Lumber has been purchased and part delivered for the building, but for want of means, the work is stopped. Reed is an earnest industrious man and his daughter competent to teach such scholars as live near the school house and the appropriation of $50 will insure completion of the house by Spring.
