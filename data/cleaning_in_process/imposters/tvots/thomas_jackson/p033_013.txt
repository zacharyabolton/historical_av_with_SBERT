Abraham Wallace (col'd) lives near Mt. [unclear: Torrey] Furnace complains that a man named William Ford, on yesterday Nov. 8 discharged a loaded pistol three times & exploded a cap the fourth time at his wife Evelyn Wallace. This deadly & unprovoked assault calls for prompt action and that such may be had in form of law. I respectfully refer the case to you.
