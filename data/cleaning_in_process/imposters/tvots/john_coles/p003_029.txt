I write you a few lines to ask a particular favor of you to get me about 5 lbs of Maple Sugar when in Staunton the best I saw was at Staples & Martins the harder & clearer it is the better it is you will find the price about 20c per lb for so small a quantity you may meet with a safe opportunity some one comeing over to our Superior Court, if you will send it to Mr [unclear: Wittmore] or Mr [unclear: Arnole] at Waynesborough either of them would take care of it & send it over either to Mr Dickinson's or [unclear: Fergreson's] our Post office Mr Albertson's frequently sending over to his plantation. But if you will do me the favor to write me a few lines to Greenfield if I learn the sugar has been sent to Waynesborough will send over after it. I suppose almost every day you could meet with a safe opportunity to Waynesborough. You will confer a very great favor by attending to it as soon as you receive this & write me without delay & will send you or hand you the money at sight & will probably be at Staunton in a week or two
