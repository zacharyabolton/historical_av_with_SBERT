We have determined to have our summer communion on next Sab. week (3 d  Sab. of June). I expect to have Bro. Walker with me during the meeting, which will commence on Friday; but the Session expressed a desire that I should write & ask you also to be with us. Some of your old friends wish very much to see & hear you again. Mr Morrison I know would be greatly gratified to meet you. He was out yesterday, but I did not get to speak to him. I believe he is in his usual health. Bro. Harris would supply your pulpit for you I have no doubt. Remember me kindly to Mrs. McFarland & your family. If you come bring her with you & make us a little visit. Hoping that you will be able to comply with our request.
