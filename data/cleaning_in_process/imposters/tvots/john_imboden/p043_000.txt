I can only write you a very short letter this morning to go off in today's mail, for if I put it off till tonight it will go by Friday's Post and not reach you for a week. The very day I wrote you last I received the longest and sweetest letter you have written to me, and I want to thank you ever so much for it, but to say you must not adhere to your idea that I must write you several letters to your one. If we had a daily mail we should exchange letters daily. I enclose you a letter I answered last night. Isn't it charming, and so sensible? It looks more to me like the realization of my hopes than any letter I have had. There are certain practical matters referred to that indicate the certain near approach of the happy day. I am sorry we ever opened the question of time again after we had once agreed upon March. And whilst I would be delighted to reconsider and fall back upon March again, I will not insist now upon a change of your assesment to settle the matter when I go to see you. Now when will that be? I answer "in January," perhaps about the middle of the month. I am more resolved to so far arrange my business here as not to be obliged to come back till you come along. And also to have it so arranged as to remain sometime with you on my next visit. Just as soon as I can fix the day of my departure from N.Y. I will write you when to expect me. I know it is important for you to know exactly when I am coming, but as I can't now fix the day of my departure hence, I can only say it is hardly probable that I can get away before the middle of Jany. I would give anything to see you for only two hours, and arrange our affairs with a definiteness that would enable us both to make our plans with reference to it. You could now fix the day if you would, and the earlier the better. I will be more than ready at the earliest moment.
