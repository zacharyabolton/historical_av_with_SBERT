Your sweet letter of the 5th has just been recd. and although I wrote you last night, I do so again, here in my office, send on this formidable looking business sheet of paper. You say you are going to Brunswick next week, and this may reach you before you start. I am so sorry your sister Ella's letter has unsettled your mind again as to the time. You now say May instead of March. Well let it stand till I see you, and I am sure we can agree. And if you are not a very firm and obstinate little woman I will argue you into my views or be greatly mistaken. You have heard "jokes" on me? And want to know when I saw Miss Parke Perkins of Pr. Edward. I saw the lady you mention in Pr. Edward during the fall, though she does not live there. She & I were reported months ago to be engaged & have had a good deal of fun over it. We are the very best of friends - nothing more, & I hope we shall never be less. She is not a marrying woman - declares she never will marry any man upon earth, & I believe she will not. She certainly will never marry me. She is a Poet of a good deal of genius & I have several of her poems now in my hands to have published - besides she is very beautiful. Now ain't you jealous? She sometimes comes to Richmond & when you are mistress of my household I shall want you to invite her to visit us. If there had been any truth in our reported engagement, I shouldn't have so hopelessly fallen a victim in Mecklenburg last August. I dont deny that I felt once mighty tender towards Miss Parke, but it has all ended in nothing but an abiding friendship - and when I see her in Richmond this winter I'll tell her I belong to you, and ask her if she isn't sorry? Now what are the other "jokes" - I am honest & own up to the truth like a man. I send you a slip from a Richmond paper of this week shewing how near you will have a church to go to.
