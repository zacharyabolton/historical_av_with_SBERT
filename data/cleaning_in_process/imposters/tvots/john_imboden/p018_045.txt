I was taken down with fever at New Market about the middle of August and sent to Staunton for treatment. Two weeks ago I was sufficiently recovered to come to this place. I am now well and will return to duty in a few days. Mary is with me. Her health is still very delicate. She recd. your letter of July 28th & answered it at once. This week I recd. your letter of July 14th. I am endeavoring to carry out your request but doubt my ability to accomplish anything. I have written to Gov. Wise invoking his aid & hope it will be more potent than my efforts. Some of your friends have been killed since your capture, though I believe none with whom you were very intimate. Col. Lang & Thornhill were killed below Winchester week before last. Poor Lang we shall miss him greatly. George & Jimmy & Geo. McPhail were well at last accounts. The 18th won the distinction of a special report from the Division Commander a few days ago for gallantry. I would say more if it were not contraband. Ma was to see me in Staunton. All were well at home. I expect to see them next week. I have laid aside a Salem letter for you which I suppose will "keep" till you get back. Col Massie of the Institute is here & sends his regards to you. His brother Rodes is a prisoner. If at Johnson's Island make his acquaintance. I shall endeavor to get Mary to winter in S.C. or Ga. for her health. Give my kindest regards to Ginnevan, Ervin, Warden, [unclear: Mattely], [unclear: Remen], Capt. Imboden & all other friends with you. I spend many an hour thinking of you all and hope ere long a general exchange may restore you to your friends esp.
