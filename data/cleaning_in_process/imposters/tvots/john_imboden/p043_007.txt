Your letter of the 20th from N. York is to hand, and I reply from here. We are getting some very important legislation here to reach the sea with our coals. Hope to have it all right in a few days. Touching your request to join the searching party after supposed Confederate metaphorically "buried" treasure in Europe, I have simply this to say why I can't possibly even think of it. 1 st  My entire time, and all my energies and capacity for labor are the property of my Company, by Contract. I have agreed to engage in nothing else of a business nature whatever. This one reason is enough so far as I am concerned. But as you desire me to enlist friends in the scheme to the extent of putting up $10,000, I ought to state further why I cant undertake to do so. My reasons are, First: That I have no faith in the alleged fact that the Confed. govt. had $50,000,000 - or even $5,000,000 or one million in Europe in money or property when it collapsed. I know of my personal knowledge that Mr. Seddon Sec. of War late in 1864 had neither credit nor money to buy two ship loads of supplies at Liverpool when we were starving & freezing, & in the dead of winter he shipped 2 cargoes of cotton from Wilmington to buy supplies, & Ben Ficklin got the proceeds, & the Gov't got nothing. It is all moonshine about this $50,000,000. But suppose it possible, do you think that a man who had spent $150,000 of his private fortune to unearth it, has not the credit amongst his own friends to raise a paltry $10,000 more to insure his success? Why John Sherman would put it up. Any gambler in N.Y. would put it up on half a show of winning. But suppose good reasons to exist for applying to you to help in the last moment, do they offer you enough interest in it? I understand Nicholas is to have $500,000. This is only 1 per cent on the $50,000,000. And if you can raise $10,000 you are to have $250,000, which is only 1/2 a per cent, or 50 cents on the $100 dollars. To get the $10,000 you would have to give away the larger part of the $250,000. Major! Mr Nicholas may be honestly duped in this matter, but the whole thing is so preposterously rediculous as I view it, that if I had $100,000 idle cash lying in bank to day, I would not give $100 for a half interest in all that will ever be recovered. The war has been over 16 years. The U.S. Gov t  has pursued the defunct Confederacy like a beadle for the last dime to be found anywhere, at home or abroad, & has taken even private property in some cases, and is grudgingly making restitution. If a stray fund should now be found, it would take years of litigation to establish the Govt's claim to it, and then years of diplomacy to get it into the U.S. treasury, and then more years to get Congress to pass an act to divide the "swag" with the detective who now only wants $10,000. See the course of Congress on the Geneva Award and the Alabama Claims. The Gov t  recovered $15,000,000 from England ostensibly as a guardian & trustee of her loyal Citizens whom Semme's, the hero of the seas despoiled. England paid it over 8 years ago. And the larger part of it remains in the Treasury to day, undisposed of. If there was the possibility of any truth in the story of the $50,000,000 life is too short for you & me to take a hand in its recovery. We might begin it, but the next Centennial will be celebrated before we or our heirs would realize from the venture. With these views, it is unnecessary for me to write to Mr. Nicholas, for under no circumstances could I go into it, nor would I be willing to commend the scheme to any of my matter of fact business men in Pittsburgh, who see money in Coal & Iron in the late Confederate States, but none in the mysty vaults of a defunct, starved out, naked & ragged psuedo nationality.
