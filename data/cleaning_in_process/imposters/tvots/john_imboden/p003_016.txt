I leave this morning for Panther Gap. You need not tell any one where I have gone to. I will try and get back tomorrow night, if it be midnight when I get here. I know of no care in Court in which I am interested which will come up before my return. Didn't you tell me that our $300 note in Bank wd. be due to day? If so you must attend to its renewal or we will be protested. I forgot the thing on yesterday, or I should have attended to it. Mike Harman is our endorser. Renew for 116 days. You will find some blanks lying on your Table. The note is drawn "Imboden & McCue." Bob Bickle has 294$ of mine which he told me last evening he would deposit to my credit in the Central Bank this morning. I wish you would see him before court meets & have the money put there. I gave Ficklin a check for $300, & two others checks for $50 each last evening & my account at bank may be short to day unless this deposit is made this morning -- Don't forget it. Tell any body who wants to see me that I will be at home again on Friday--
