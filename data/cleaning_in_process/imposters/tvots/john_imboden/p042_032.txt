I can not leave without a note to tell you how grieved I was not to have been able to say a few words I wished to speak at parting. I left you at Miss Goode's because I thought I discovered I was in the way, and that your friend was present on our walk to deprive me of the coveted opportunity I sought, but could not have; all the evening, for only a very few words of good bye. If I had known before we started that he was going I would have sent Miss Goode my apology by you & not have made myself a third party to the walk. Where one is so deeply attached as I am to you, without any ground of hope to stand upon, even trifles are watched. And the Constant presence of this gentleman with you all the evening till I left, when he also left and came to town in the same vehicle ambulance with me, has alarmed me more than I can express. If he alone is responsible for this Constant watchful presence, I would not attach so much im-portance to it, for it is natural he should wish to be with you, but if it was your request that he should be a third party during the last few hours I could possibly be with you, then indeed I am about to awake to a reality I have all the time dreaded - that I am too late - hopelessly too late. I do earnestly - Oh! so earnestly hope all this, as far as you are concerned was accidental. Forgive me for writing you this hasty note, and for God's sake answer it to 257 Broadway New York, by the first mail and relieve my anxieties if I am laboring under a painful, but I think natural misapprehension. God bless you and make you always happy.
