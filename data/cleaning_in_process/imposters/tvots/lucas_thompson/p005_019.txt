I enclose you an  of appeal in the case of [unclear: Dickinson vs. Page]: As to the election our prospects are gloomy enough; almost every person I see has despaired of defeating the Black Republican Lincoln. My Motto is [unclear: Nil desper audiem]. I am Still hopeful of the election of Bell & Everitt or some one of the antirepublican tickets, and if the worst comes to the worst and Lincoln is elected their will be neither Secession or disunion. Such a consequence would be of a piece with the Madness & folly of committing suicide for fear of dying. Let us wait for an [unclear: overt] act (which I verily believe will not be committed by Lincoln or his [unclear: allies]) and cling to our glorious union as long aspossible consistently with honor safety & liberty, for in disunion I can foresee woes innumerable, no remedy for our grievances but rather as aggravation of them all, in short the greatest calamity that could befall not only the U S but the cause of free government throughout the world. We shall have a grand whig rally here tomorrow. Baldwin & Stuart will address the mass meeting.
