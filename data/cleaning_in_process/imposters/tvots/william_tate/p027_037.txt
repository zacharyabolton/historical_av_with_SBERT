Your note of the 22nd in reference to the claim of [unclear: Theophilus] Randall against me was recd yesterday evening and it is out of my power to go to Staunton to day as you request, I will however  in early next week and call at your office. In the mean time allow me to say that while the amount of $13.90 of Randall is correct, I have an account for rent of house against him of $13.50. I house he occupied against my wishes and to my great inconvenience and annoyance for four months and a half, during which time neither he nor his family rendered me any services whatever.
