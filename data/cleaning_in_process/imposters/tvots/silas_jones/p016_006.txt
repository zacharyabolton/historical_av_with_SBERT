I gave Adam the  and butter the first day after I got to camp while on picket I had to go on picket the next morning I got here  on the river toward Fredericksburg They awaited the enemy in rifle pits but instead of advancing they retired - as usual I saw Add the other day & he is well and hardy. he looks fine much better than he did when I left the night before he had a good reason George I am proud of my shirt that Josie made I appreciate your gift very much and in return I shall give you a barrel fife made by my own hand if all goes right when we get into our cabins I have & get out of the cold George these are fifing times with us all the boys have their fifes but myself I have not seen it smoking All are cheerful & gay with their fifes I am on guard today & what a time I will have musing about the just & penetrating the future You will not understand this phrase unless I explain it When I am on post my mind is - out from every thing else & I can study all & my mind - - - I build great air castles I soar aloft in ecstasy of sublime Tell Jane the butter she gave me done a great deal of good after I got to camp Give Josie and Louise my regards & tell them to write to me George send them to school if you can consistently for an education is - - - to all a Happy Christmas to you all I am well
