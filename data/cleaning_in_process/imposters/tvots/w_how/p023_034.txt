The accompanying claim has been handed me by Robert Brick a Freedman, to be forwarded as it now is, but I have as yet been unable to learn anything concerning claims of Freedpeople previously forwarded. I should be glad to learn receive any information that would tend to assist the Freedmen in obtaining compensation for losses sustained by them.
