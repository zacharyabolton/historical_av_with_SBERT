You are quite at liberty to hire any colored man without the consent of his former master, as he is also at liberty to engage his services without such consent. The "citizens" who "resolved that no one should [unclear: hire] &c" would seem to have been quite willing that white men should lose freedom of action, if only black men could be hindered in the exercise of the freedom they have acquired and cannot lost. Your government however will see that the rights of all are respected and maintained.
