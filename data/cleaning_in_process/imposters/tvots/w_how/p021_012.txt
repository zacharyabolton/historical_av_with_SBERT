I have the honor to state that there is at this place a portable steam engine of about (10) ten horse power that belonged to the so called Confederate Govt. I am of opinion that it can be put in working order for less than ($100.00) one hundred dollars, and learning that there is at Fort Monroe and Portsmouth a Saw Mill not in use, together with parts of Machinery that would reduce the cost to almost fifty dollars. I propose to set a Saw Mill in operation as by so doing, Lumber that will certainly be needed can be furnished, and employment given to freedmen who will require it. Will you please give the order necessary for the transfer of the Saw Mill &c to me
