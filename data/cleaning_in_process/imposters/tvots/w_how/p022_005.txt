Enclosed you will please find an order to Mr. Wm. J. Shumate in the case of James Hamilton, negro, with endorsement directing you to see that it is complied with; in the event of Shumate's refusal or neglect to pay Hamilton after the order has been given to him, you will bring the matter to the notice of the Provost Marshall, and request that Shumate may be compelled to settle the claims of Hamilton in accordance with that order. I also enclose a letter from Mr. Baldwin attorney for Mr. Shumate, which I referred to Col. Brown, Asst. Comr. with a statement of the case, and you can show to Mr. Shumate the endorsement thereon, and return the paper to me.
