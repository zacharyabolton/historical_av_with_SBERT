I have the honor to forward herewith monthly reports of Bureau affairs as made by the several Asst. Supts. and I would respectfully ask your attention to the sufficiently explicit suggestions of Mr. F. S. Tukey Asst. Supt. Sub. dist. "B" in the case of E. P. Walton and I endorse the proposed action since there is no force locally available for his arrest, and no military prison in that sub. dist. in which he could be confined for his contempt of authority, and until he should comply with the decision of the Board of Agents. It will be seen that no serious disturbances have taken place during the absence of military force and it must also be evident that no apparent jurisdiction can be exercised by the officers and agents of this Bureau when unsupported by the presence and use of U.S. Forces. I have therefore again to request that a detachment of troops numbering (30) thirty or more may be sent to Staunton with a commissioned officer who may be empowered to station ten (10) of them at Lexington, and to send small squads when requested through Augusta, Highland, Bath, Alleghany and Rockbridge Counties. The other portions of the district will soon contain a force including Cavalry which will suffice for the maintenance of Bureau Power at the most important points and with the officers on duty and the Agents at their posts, will enable me to carry out instructions and protect the Freedmen in all their conceded rights.
