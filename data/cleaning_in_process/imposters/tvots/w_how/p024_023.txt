I have the honor to forward the enclosed Special Requisition with the request that the Flags may be immediately furnished in order to prevent the impatience of the people to witness these emblems of restored authority from breaking out in demonstration against the Bureau Officers  of their freedom to exhibit the Good and glorious insignia of our National Freedom and Power. The quotation in the Special Requisition setting forth the necessity is from the President's Proclamation dated Washington DC April 2d 1866.
