I shall perhaps astonish you, but am sorry if it should in any way disturb you to say that I wish to leave your district and subsequently the service. I gave you a hint of this when last I saw you. No, not the last, but, the time before that. When I told you that I had [unclear: met] the one for whom I had long [unclear: been] seeking, and who was to go with me through life. It happens that we want to leave this part of the world about the first of June to the ----- to selt--i-- happiness in the Fall. guess at this So I wish you would provide a succession for this District and have me ordered to report from my place of residence, and should like this to occur between the 13th and 25th of May next. Can you manage it for me? Lt. Col. Neide was here on Friday and I having just then decided the matter spoke of it to him and recommended Maj Carse as I now do to you for the position. After consultation with Maj Carse I found that he would quite as [unclear: like] remain where he is, and be perhaps more useful there. I could command no one else. I have [unclear: real] regret in leaving you to whom I am so much indebted for kindess and consideration and with whom I have served so pleasantly, and shall hold myself always ready to give "three times three" at the mention of a name I know so well, and send you good wishes [unclear: with] bright hopes for present and future happiness. Please tell me now what you think and can do
