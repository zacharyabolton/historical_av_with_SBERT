I have the honor to report that a young freedman named Robert Carter was tried for an attempt at Larceny by the Hustings Court at Staunton, Va on the 8th of this month. He was just taken before the Provost Marshall, Capt. J.M. Collins 58th Pa. Vols., to whom he confessed his guilt. He was then turned over to the Civil Authorities for trial. A Counsel was assigned by the Court, Mr. Cochrane, who managed the case with commendable zeal and ability. He contended and I think proved that the confession was not voluntarily made. The other evidence would not convict. The Court thought otherwise, received the confession, convicted and sentenced him to (1) one year in the penitentiary. The case will be sent to Gov. Pierpont for [unclear: revision].
