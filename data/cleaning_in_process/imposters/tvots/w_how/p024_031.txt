I have the honor to request that you will forward me transportation from this point to Afton, Albemarle Co. for Louisa Frintz, a freedwoman who is at Staunton, sick and destitute, and dependent upon the Bureau for support; she has no home here, and will be cared for at Afton by her parents who reside there.
