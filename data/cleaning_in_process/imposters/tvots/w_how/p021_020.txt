I have the honor to state that there is a house on New Street, near the building used as Commissary Storehouse, which I am informed was owned by James Campbell, colored, who went North and returned to find his house confiscated by the so-called Confederate Government, by whom it was sold to Mr. William Stevenson of this place. I respectfully ask an investigation to establish the facts in the case, and if they prove to be as stated, I request that the property may be seized and turned over to me for restoration to the owner, who is not now here. Mr. Tuckey Assist. Supt. for this County will aid you in obtaining evidence in relation to this matter.
