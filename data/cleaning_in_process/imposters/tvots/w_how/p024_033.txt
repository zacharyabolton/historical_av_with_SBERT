I have the honor to request that transportation may be furnished to Mrs. Eveline Stuart, freedwoman from Staunton, Va. to Ironton, Lawrence Co. Ohio, as she wishes to go there and the facts concerning her husband are as stated in the accompanying letter from Mrs. A. Jordan, dated Washington, D.C. April 14, 1866.
