I have the honor to request that a detachment of troops may be sent into this portion of the Sixth District for the purpose of supporting Bureau officers and agents in the exercise of their several functions, and it is respectfully suggested that a commissioned officer stationed at Staunton in command of thirty (30) men would be about the force required, and which might be distributed as follows: ten (10) men to Lexington, Va and twenty (20) men at Staunton, Va. with the officers in charge, who should be instructed to respond to the requests of any duly authorized agents of this Bureau who might require military assistance or protection in the discharge of his duties, and who without such support might best be absent from his post.
