I met Genl Ayers here last evening. He is making a tour of his District and will go over into Page, Warren & Clark co's. As I determined to accompany him instead of going straight to Winchester, where I shall now arrive in Tuesday. The opportunity is a good one for observing the condition of the Freedmen in these [unclear: rebellious] counties, and I hope to persuade the Genl to send troops there, though he has but four (4) companies of Inf and 2 of Cav in his Command. [unclear: Tell] Mr Tukey to look up that woman who stole the "body". "Marian" something. Mr [unclear: Sipee] will perhaps know where she lives. She [unclear: wist] him to come to me yesterday morning to be sent to jail, but evidently doesn't want to go. Had she come I should have scolded her and let her off, but as it is, I [unclear: wist] the Provost Marshall to put her in for three (3) days. Tell Mr. Tukey also to take possession of Mr Campbells [unclear: house] as abandoned property and make such disposition of it as he should judge best [unclear: collecting] rents due, giving notices to quit, &c. Also to see that the man who maltreated the Freedmen at the -- Furnace got their deserts at the hands of the Provost Marshall. Take the [unclear: census] in hand and copy the census of Staunton first, in the [unclear: proper blanks].
