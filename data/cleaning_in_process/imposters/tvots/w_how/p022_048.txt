I have the honor to inform you that I find it necessary to [unclear: proceed] through my District to Staunton, and leaving here today I shall probably be absent until Saturday 30th Dec. As I expect to reach Staunton on the 23d and to leave that place about the 27th, I desire that any communication requiring my immediate attention may, if sent from Richmond between the 23d and 26th of this month, be forwarded to me at Staunton, Va. Cap Wells, [unclear: agent] accompanies me to Harrisonburg where he will be temporarily stationed for the organization of Sub-District "C".
