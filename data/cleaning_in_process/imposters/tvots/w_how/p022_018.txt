In relation to medicines and medical treatment for the destitute freedmen in the district I have the honor to report that there are yet comparatively few cases requiring such support assistance, but where they do occur it is difficult to meet them, as I am without definite instructions upon the subject and do not feel authorized to pay for single visits or make contracts by the month. I understand from Dr. ----- who visited Staunton in September by order of Dr. [unclear: Lamenter] that contracts would probably be made with local physicians and so I have remained in expectancy. In Staunton and in Lexington the services of physicians have been needed and given, and I have directed that moderate bills may be made out and sent to me to be forwarded for approval. No other instances have been reported to me, and I respectfully suggest that the method might be adopted with advantage until it shall be found too expensive or liable to abuse.
