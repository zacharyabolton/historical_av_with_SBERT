I have received your order to turn in the transportation in my possession, and in reference to it desire to state that I have but one (1) officer acting as Provost Marshall, under the order of Maj. Gen. Terry, and he is at Lexington, Va and he is at Lexington in charge of Sub. Dist. "A", three (3) counties. At Staunton there is a Civilian Asst. Supt. in charge of Sub. Dis. "B", two (2) Counties, and in these five (5) Counties there are no U.S. Forces, and no other effective means of interim communication, than by the mentioned officer and civilians. The boundary line between Augusta and Rockingham Counties separates the Dept. of Va. from the Middle Military Dept., and compliance with this order will leave the remaining (8) eight Counties, much the larger portion of the Sixth District, without any means of transportation since the orders of Maj. Gen. Terry are not effective here. I have in use a spring wagon with two (2) horses, and I can more economically traverse my District in it than by any other means of transportation. I have also in use two (2) horses at Staunton by the Civilian Asst. Supt. and me at Lexington by the Mil. Asst. Supt. actg Pro. Mar. and in my judgement each officer should have at least two (2) public horses. One reason being that it is unsafe for an officer of this Bureau to travel in these Counties unattended and in the entire absence of Military support. In this Middle Mil. Dept. with the voluntary assistance of [unclear: offrs ] I have managed as well as I might in the hopes that at some time QM supplies might be obtainable, but am unable now to make requisition  officers on duty in this portion of my Dist. because they are not acting Provost Marshalls awaiting instructions. I shall proceed to Staunton, and retaining one (1) horse for the officer at Lexington, turn in the other four (4) and the wagon, equipments &c with the least possible delay, as ordered.
