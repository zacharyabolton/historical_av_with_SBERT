In relation to the accompanying papers of Mr Thomas Wholey I have the honor to report that the barracks referred to by him were turned over to the agent of the Bureau at this Post by an order of Lt. Col. Cecil Clay, 58th Pa Vols [unclear: comding ] (copy endorsed) dated Jany 10th 1866, and that immediately upon the withdrawal of the troops from this Post, and the consequent removal of all guards from the premises, the barrack was stripped of anything moveable by persons unknown, and there now remains nothing but the bare walls and roof of a building without windows or doors. Taking into consideration therefore the [unclear: correctness] of Mr. Wholey's claim for lumber taken, the presence of the lumber on his grounds, his loyalty and the fact that this building is not now needed for any use which would justify its repair and the payment of ground rent and the fact also that balance of the lumber would not meet any considerable sum over the expense of its disposal, I respectfully recommend that Mr Thos Wholey be permitted to retain an amoung of the lumber comprising the barrack equal to twenty two hundred (2200) feet, and that the Freedmen be allowed to remove the remainder for use in the construction of the church now being built by them in this place.
