Respecting medical affairs in this District there is no material change since my last report. I do not learn that there has been any marked increase in sickness or mortality. There still exists the want of a medical officer to look on the field and see that proper care and attention are given by those selected to attend the poor freedmen. I forward herewith two bills for services which I think to be fair and just, and respectfully ask that they may be approved, and ordered to be paid by me.
