In relation to the medical necessities of the Freedmen in this District, I have the honor to report that there is an increasing demand for Medical treatment and medicines, and I am at a loss how to meet it. I have casually learned that Dr. DeLamater has telegraphed to Asst. Supts. to ascertain the terms upon which local physicians would treat the sick freedmen, but am not aware that any of them have been directed to be employed. I am of opinion that such is the best method to be adopted in the smaller places, but think that at this place Winchester, one physician would be fully employed, and I therefore request that a Surgeon or Asst. Surgeon may be sent here with a months supply for a hundred (100) patients -- and with his assistance I may be able to meet what will soon become pressing necessities among the Freedmen, for it appears to be evident that there will be a considerable amount of sickness, among those who are supporting themselves but with difficulty, and who are living in crowded or unhealthy places. And in such places they must live for [unclear: none] others can be had, and all their efforts are expended in procuring present supplies of fuel and food, and with no capital nor credit they cannot employ a Doctor, but are dependant on his charity, which if he has any is sure to be [unclear: overtaken]. I have therefore to respectfully ask attention to this statement, and suggest the propriety of immediate action and instruction.
