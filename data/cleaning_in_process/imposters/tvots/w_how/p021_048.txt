By permission from Lt. Col. C. Clay 58th Pa Vols comd'g sub. dist. of Staunton you are at liberty to use the upper story of the Court House recently occupied by me as an office, for a school room, for the children of freedmen in your sub-District 'B'. Proper care will be taken of the Rooms in order that they may be given up when legitimately claimed, in as good condition as they now are.
