In reply to your interrogatories under date of Sept 10th 1865 I have the honor to report that I have no evidence or suspicion that any insurrectionary movement has been thought of or contemplated by the freedmen within this District, on the contrary I have every reason to believe that these freedmen are inflexibly loyal to the United States Government and disposed to yield unquestioned obedience in all just laws brought to his knowledge and comprehension.
