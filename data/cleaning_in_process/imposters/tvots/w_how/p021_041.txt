I wish to visit Richmond for the purpose of consultation with you upon many and varied subjects [unclear: ----ted] with the Freedmen in this District: the lack of Stationery alone would prevent the exposition of these subjects in writing, and many of them may [unclear: best] be treated verbally. I have therefore, respectfully to request the necessary order for transportation from Staunton to Richmond and return.
