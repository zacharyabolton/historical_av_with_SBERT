I respectfully request permission to remove my Head Quarters from Staunton to Winchester for the reason that the most important portions of my District are more accessible from here, than from there, and, in my opinion, my duties may be better discharged at this, than at that place. Please address your reply to Winchester Va. so that it may be seen whether the mail communications are frequent and regular, and send via Washington.
