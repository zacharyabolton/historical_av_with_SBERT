I have the honor to request that a commissioned Officer may be ordered to report to me by letter for assignment to duty in this Bureau, in each County within your sub-district. I do not know what Counties are included in your command, and shall feel obliged if you can furnish me with information respecting the disposition of troops in the several Counties, through the Shenandoah Valley, the limits of the sub-district, & the commanding officers. If you have jurisdiction in Page & Warren Counties one officer will be sufficient for them. It is particularly desirable that competent faithful officers may be selected for this duty.
