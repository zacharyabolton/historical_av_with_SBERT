I of course do not [unclear: like] to state in an official communication that I have to dispose of U.S. Drafts at a discount, but such is the fact since checks on Richmond are not current funds, and the first one received cash payment in Baltimore while I now pay 1/4 for each in Martinsburg, having no National bank at Winchester. Hence I was obliged to carry as on hand the check for 300 received in January until I could get the Martinsburg Bank to cash it. If there is any way to avoid this course I shall be glad to know it for it is manifestly unjust that the employees should have to pay this additional tax. I received on Saturday from [unclear: Hank] B. Hayes M.C. from Cincinnati - my District - a communication to him from the War Dept notifying him of my nomination by the Secy of War for brevet promotion to Major of Vols under date Feby 13th 1866, and presume that I shall receive a letter notice through you, and you don't know anybody who wants it less than do I. If you wish it, just say " an official statement on either or both of these subjects" and I will.
