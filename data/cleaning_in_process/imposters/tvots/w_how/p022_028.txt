I am this day in receipt of your letter in relation to Gen orders No. 51 Current Series which order I have not as yet received or read. On the 30th day of September 1865 I had no Employees serving under me in the QM Dept because I was then, as now on duty in the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, as Superintendent of the Sixth District Va and since the 1st of October 1863, I have neither employed Printers for a compensation nor paid any person for such services. My Post Office address as previously reported by me to the Quarter Master General is Winchester Va., and the direction of your communication to Staunton is the reason of this delay in replying to it.
