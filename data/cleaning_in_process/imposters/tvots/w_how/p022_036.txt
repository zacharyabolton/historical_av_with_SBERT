Please make an Estimate of the quantity of wood that will be needed for gratuitous issue to the very poor freedmen of your sub-dist during the next three (3) months. I have none on hand and cannot speak encouragingly of the prospect of obtaining any but desire you to make a careful estimate in view of the possibility that an immediate supply may be obtained. State any facts within your knowledge relating to present or prospective suffering for want of fuel. Any of the articles likely to be wanted in the next quarter, Stationery &c must now be Estimated for, as my estimates must be forwarded on the 15th of this month for Quarter ending March 31st 1866.
