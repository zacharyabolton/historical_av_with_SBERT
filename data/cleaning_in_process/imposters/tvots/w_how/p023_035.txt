I have the honor to forward herewith for approval corrected accounts for medical services rendered the Freedmen by Doctors [unclear: Fauntlerry] and Freeman at Staunton & Lexington respectively They were employed under my direction at a time when there was pressing need for their services, and while I was awaiting definite instructions in the subject. The services were necessary, were [unclear: rendered], and I believe the accounts to be moderate & just.
