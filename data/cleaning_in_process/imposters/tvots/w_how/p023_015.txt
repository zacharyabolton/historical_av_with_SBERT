I have just learned that the troops are ordered away from Lexington and Staunton and that in consequence I am needed there. I shall leave Capt. Wells A.Q.M. in charge here during my absence, and I respectfully request that either transportation or an order for it may be sent to me at Staunton to enable me to visit & consult with you. The detachments stationed at Woodstock and Harrisonburg came in yesterday under orders to be mustered out, and it is the unanimous belief of the officers that an agent of this Bureau cannot remain unmolested in these places if unsupported by the presence of troops. Gen. Ayres has found it necessary to send a guard with the supply wagons, because the drivers were stoned by mobs. I attempted the establishment of a civilian Asst. Supt. at Harrisonburg but he felt obliged to return with the troops. An order has been received here this morning for the muster out of the 193 N.Y.V. now on duty in this Military District, and at H. Ferry, and those places in Gen Ayers Dists. are to by supported by one company of Veteran Reserves, which will confine my effective jurisdiction in this part of the Valley to sub-distrcts "D" and "E", and I desire again to express my conviction that it is worse than useless to attempt a continuance of the Bureau in this district, without the presence and support of a military force. The Schools might live but I think it very doubtful.
