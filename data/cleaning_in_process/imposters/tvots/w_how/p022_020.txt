A man named MacRichardson is charged with having forcibly taken a freedwoman & (3) three children from near Greencastle Pa. in July 1864, and with delivering them to one Madison Leary, living near this place, who is said to have sold them as his Learys slave, and I am directed by Col Brown to act & respond. Having just learned that MacRichardson is living in Bedford County I have respectfully to request that you will ascertain and inform me if he did thus take Eliza [unclear: Alesouth] and her three children and what was done with them.
