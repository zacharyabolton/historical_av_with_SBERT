I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th in Reference to Requisitions, and in reply I have respectfully to state that I have not construed the order referred to in the manner which I now see is implied. Respecting the requisitions already approved I have to communicate the information that stores can probably be most readily obtained from the Depot at Harpers Ferry, as I understand there is an accumulation of QM Property there under the care of Bt. Maj. Geo A. Flagg A.Q.M. (from whom the transportation can certainly be best procurred) and I think he can better furnish the wood which I thought to get delivered at the offices of the several Asst. Supts. and have it paid for in [unclear: Form 12] by Maj. Flagg, who would then issue it to me. I have therefore respectfully to request that the approved requisitions may be forwarded to me in order that I may attempt in this way to obtain the much needed stores.
