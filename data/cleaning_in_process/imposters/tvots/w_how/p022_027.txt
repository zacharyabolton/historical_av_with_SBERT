I have respectfully to inform you that I find it necessary to [unclear: proceed] on a tour of duty through the upper portion of this District, and shall leave here tomorrow for Staunton, at which place I expect to arrive on the evening of Thursday, 23d, and it is my present intention to return from thence on the following Wednesday 29th. Should anything require my immediate attention in the interim, be pleased to notify me by letter or telegraph at Staunton, sending nothing by mail to Staunton after the 27th of this month.
