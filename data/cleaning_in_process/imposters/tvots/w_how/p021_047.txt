You will please appear at this office on or before the 5th day of this month prepared to settle the claim of James Hamilton freedman a negro man for one (1) years services rendered you by him from June 1st 1864, to May 31st 1865. After hearing the statements made by him and by yourself I have fixed the rate of compensation at $30.00 Thirty dollars per month for the twelve months during which he was held and detained by you in your service, knowing as you did that he was entitled to his freedom, and also aware that but for your attempt to speculate in him "as property" -- a piece of property that at the time you purchased no one else would buy -- he would have been released from Jail by the forces of the United States and at liberty again to obtain employment as a teamster in the service of the Government.
