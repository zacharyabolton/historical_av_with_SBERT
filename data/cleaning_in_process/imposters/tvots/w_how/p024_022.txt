I have respectfully to state that Bureau Affairs in the upper portion of this District need my personal attention, and that in consequence I start today on a tour through the several Sub Districts, desiring that any communications by mail or telegraph requiring my immediate attention may be addressed to me at Staunton, Va until my return to this pace which will probably be about the 25th day of April. Hoping this action may meet your approval
