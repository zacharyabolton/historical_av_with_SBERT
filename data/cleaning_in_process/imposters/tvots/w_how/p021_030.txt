The question has been raised by a legal gentleman as to whether or not this Bureau has jurisdiction over cases in which free born negroes are concerned; he claiming that they were already free, and not included among those classed as freedmen. Conceiving it possible that those manumitted and free born, and those who purchased their freedom may not have been embraced in the term "freedmen" I respectfully ask instructions.
