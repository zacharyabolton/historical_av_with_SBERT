I have the honor to inform you that I shall start today on a tour through the upper portion of my District reaching Staunton, probably, on the 17th of the month, and respectfully request that any business requiring immediate attention may be directed to me at that place until about the 24th of this month. Capt. G. W. Wells, AQM &  A Supt. will transact the [unclear: ordinary] office business during my absence.
