The beautiful Bouquet Sent by you Several days ago, I received, and with great delight, did I gaze at this [unclear: one], reminding me still of your devoted friendship, which I hope time will never eraize. Accept my Sincere thanks for this mark of Your Kindness towards me, and accept in return this Token of my undiminished Friendship.
