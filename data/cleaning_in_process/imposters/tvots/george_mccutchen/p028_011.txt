In answer to your note of the 8th in regard to Henry Alexander claim against Estate of John P. M. McCutchen Dcd. Said Alexander did apply to Capt. Tukey, Agent Bureau at Staunton for the recovery of money from said McCutchen, and the facts being stated to Capt Tukey by said McC in his lifetime the case was dismissed. Should the claim you refer to be for service rendered by said Alexanders children it can be proven that McCutchen agreed with the wife of said Alexander that her and her children might go, or remain with him, till they could do better and he would furnish them supplies as he had done before and house &c till they could find a place to move to, and after remaining some time in that way they concluded to leave. McCutchen's books show no indebtedness to Alexander. I have learned the above facts from Mr. Judson O. McCutchen, who I believe was living at his uncle's at the time on the place. Should you wish to make any further inquiry about the matter write me on the subject and I will be glad to give you all the information I can.
