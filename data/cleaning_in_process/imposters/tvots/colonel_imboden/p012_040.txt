 Your welcome contribution to the destitute men in my command was safely delivered here, and the several articles sent, distributed at once to the more needy amongst the N.W. refugees - The promptness with which the ladies of Augusta have responded to my appeal in their behalf has won my lasting gratitude. Through their generous kindness my poor fellows who were ragged and shivering 3 weeks ago, are now Comfortable & warm - God bless my Countywomen!  You ask if I need hospital supplies - I am so fortunate as to have but little sickness amongst my men, and at this time none of a serious nature - Should I find that we need such supplies I will inform you of it and most thankfully receive anything you may be able to send us -
