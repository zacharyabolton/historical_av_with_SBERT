The report has reached me that you had [unclear] that Paxton's Brigade had disgraced its-self upon the field on the morning the 3rd refused to go forward when ordered and permitted other troops to run over them. I'd hoped the brigade had sustained its reputation on that occasion. Genl Rhodes [unclear: section] was under the same impression. But when informed of the facts has admitted he was mistaken on the brigade - I also hope you are mistaken. I will briefly state the facts. At the commencement of the engagement we were in the 2nd line on the left on our right resting  the [unclear: felands] road. After sunrise we were ordered on the road and placed upon the extreme right advancing over some  works behind which lay a brigade - we confirmed our advance over the line of battle where we were [unclear: warmly] engaged some twenty minutes our right being enfiltrated, and forced to fall back some hundred yards when Gen'l Paxton fell - here we reformed. When Genl Stewart ordered me to take command and put the brigade in motion to relieve (as I understood) our brigade who were out of ammunition. I immediately advanced to the relief of the line in front who were gallantly holding their ground with  ranks and empty boxes. we continued the charge up the [unclear: hill] driving the enemy from his fortification in rear of the log house a half a mile of Chancelorsville. I do not remember of any troops passing over us or they refusing to move  when requested or commanded our casualties speak for us, losing  there one third of what we took in the engagement. Aside from the above statement of facts, you will find you are mistaken in the brigade. Please favor me with an immediate answer
