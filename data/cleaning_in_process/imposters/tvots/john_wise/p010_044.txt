I promised to write to you evry chance that I had. We landed here yesterday about sundown. The roads is very dusty down here Jackson and his army is still on the march no one knows exactly where he is. We had a good mess of cherries to day, we never have them this early in Highland; but we have something that I like better, and that is the water. We may have worse water than this is to drink, but I do not like it. I expect that we will leave here in the morning for Gordonsville. Our company is in good spirits and just as many as they were at the warmsprings. You must write to father the first chance and inform him where I am I expect that we will stay down here for some time, may be untill the war is over. You must give my best love to Aunt Liza, and and all the family. and all of cousin Give my best respects to cousin Martha and all her sisters. I will write in a few days and let you know where I am. Excuse bad writing and mistakes for they are ver comin in camp.
