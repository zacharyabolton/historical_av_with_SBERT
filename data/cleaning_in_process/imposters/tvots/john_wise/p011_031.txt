As Wm. Bratton has got a furlow for a few days, I will write you a few lines. We got to stay in camp to day for the first time for several weeks. I had the plaisure of looking at the yankey camp on yesterday.  We were sent out on a forraging expidition and I was sent up on a little mountain to stand picket while the wagon were [unclear: loadening]. We could see the yankeys riding about the camp very plainly with a glass. They have a large force down in Culpepper. Six yankeys came over on yesterday and gave themselves up to our men. Jacksons whole army moved forward on yesterday. There will be a large battle down here on a few days if Jackson whips the yankeys out here it wont be a great while untill there will be peace made. It is reported that the yankeys are all leaving be low . They are all dying down their. Jackson has a large force here. He has Genls Hills and Longstreets divisions. I think Jackson will give Pope a good grubbing. Wm A. Bratton is very glad to go home. He has been trying to go to go home for some time. Tell Miss Harriet Cleek that William has been dreaming about her for some months. I hope he will be satisfied when he gets home for he has been uneasy about his cattle. Geroge Cleek sends his best respects to you and says when ever he gets a furlow you may hear of him on the Cow Pasture below Williamsville. Give my best respects to Harriet Cleek and all the Young Ladies on Jacksons river. I won't have time to write a long letter to you this time for I have to go on camp duty tonight, and the time for the bugle to sound is near at hand. I expect that we will move in a few days some whear else. Excuse bad writing and mistakes.
