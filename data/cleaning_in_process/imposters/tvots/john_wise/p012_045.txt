I have seated myself to let you know that I have got to the company safe after I left home I concluded that I would go by Staunton. I got to Staunton on Wednesday and remained there until the next eavning. I was two day and a half comeing from Staunton to camp.  Everything is quiet here, no yankeys no nearer than than Winchester fifty miles from here. It has been quite worm for the last few days.  They are all well in Staunton except Uncle Archy; he is mending. No sicness in camp of any consequence. We get [unclear: pretty]  plenty of hay and wheat now. If we could get corn we would get along very well. There is a good deal of cavalry down here. One battalion of Infantry and a battery of artillery. You must write soon to me. I must close writing this time.
