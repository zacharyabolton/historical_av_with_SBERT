Your communication of the 22nd inst only reached me today. The O'Toole case occured in the Corporation of Staunton and has I believe been taken up by the town authorities with whom I have no official connection. In the spencer case I had the witnesses summoned and they appeared before the Grand Jury who after hearing the case declined to make a presentment. In the Ford case I saw the complainant and after examining him closely was satisfied that an indictment could not be sustained in the case. I however informed him of the time of the sittings of the Grand Jury and directed him to appear and make his complaint. This he did not do. It is always my course when informed from any respectable source of a violation of law to send the parties and witnesses to the first Grand Jury. If an indictment does not result of course I have no further power in the matter.
