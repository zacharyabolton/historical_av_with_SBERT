I will attempt to write you a few lines in addition to what is enclosed to let you know that I am well and in good spirits except now and then, when we run short of rations which is very often As we are now across the mountain we have some prospect of rest soon. It is reported that the yankees are occupying their old ground on Stafford heights if so I suppose we will move towards Fredericksburg before long. We were all glad to get east of the Blue ridge this time for we think times will be easier than in the Valley. The sound of the railroadcar whistle is a great relief to men whose appetites are sharpened by hunger it betokens more to eat and of a better quality. I received a letter to day by A Smiley in which you said for me to write if I needed pants but I expect to draw a pair soon and thus save the risk of having them sent to me while we are not settled I was not surprized to hear of Miss Jennies marriage as Lieut Carson had told me of it before I received your letter But I will now close for the present by asking you to write soon and let me hear all the particulars.
