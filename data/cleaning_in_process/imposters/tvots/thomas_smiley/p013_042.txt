I will endeavor this evening to write you a few lines to let you know that I expect to start to camp in the morning. I do not feel any better than I did when I left home but the doctor said he thought it might be an advantage to me to go to camp I will not take but one blanket with me as there is no one allowed to have more than one in camp now I will take the white one as it is larger the other I will leave with Amos Troxel and get him to send it up the first chance I will close as I have no news of importance to write excuse this piece of dirty paper & when you write direct to the company
