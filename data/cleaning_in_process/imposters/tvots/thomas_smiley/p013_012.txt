I take my pen in hand to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well & hope that when these lines come to hand they may find you enjoying the same blessing I received your letter and the Cheese, Apples, & Caps, you sent by Mr Jarvis. I am very much obliged to you for sending them The caps I gave to those who were worst off. there is no bareheaded men in our part of the army The most of the men have good hats or caps. This week has been very disagreeable raining almost every day. I suppose it is snow with you as it is much warmer here than in the Vally. We are very comfortably situated now the men all have cabins or tents with chimneys on which we do our cooking. I think that as long as the weather keeps bad we will have the privilige of remaining in our quarters as the roads are too bad for the moving of an army There is a good many troops going from here to North Carolina but they are altogether North Carolina troops We have a Court house & Church built and some of the men are now building a Theatre It will be finished in a few days I suppose As I have nothing of any interest to write you I will close by asking you to excuse all mistakes and write soon
