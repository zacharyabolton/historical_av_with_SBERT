Your note to Kayser Stribling & Co for $211.86 dated Nov. 1/57 has fallen into my hands as Trustee by the assignment of John W. Stribling. I of course do not wish & will not do anything to annoy you in reference to this note, but will hold it very much to suit your convenience, and hope you will be able to relieve me by from time to time paying in such amounts as you can conveniently do. I am one of the sufferers myself by Striblings failure & wish to realize as much as possible out of the assets, and know that you will do all you can in the [unclear: premises]. Please advise. Remember me to Cousin Liz:
