We went to Staunton a week or two ago and had our pictures taken for you which we send in this letter. We have been gathering walnuts and have got our hands stained - we did not get many hickory nuts this year. I went with Uncle David last saturday after his cattle They have been doing very badly - he has lost two or three. The Thresher has just now come and will finish the wheat this time. We had a big snow last night but it has nearly all melted already The limbs of some of the trees were bent to the ground It was a fine sight this morning. Uncle David has gathered all his winter apples - has about 30 bushels of bellflowers. I expect he will have more than 200 bushels in all. I believe I like Geography the best of my studies Sister likes Arithmetic best. I think Lillie can memorize the quickest but I dont know which can recollect the longest Uncle D has gone to attend Mrs Tate's sale today I am at the 27 th  question in the Shorter catechism. There are 50 cords of wood hauled for winter. Give my love to all of them at home. Write soon to
