I would have written you sooner but have not had an opportunity of doing so from the fact that we have been fighting constantly ever day for the last ten days and I am very sorry to say that Co. D., has suffered very much. We have [unclear: seen] fourteen of our company since the fight commenced killed wounded & missing Lieut. Edmondson, Baker, Williams, Fields (Charles), and Miles are the killed; Jones, Dulaney, Andy & Frank [unclear: Cabrier], Schwartz & John Sanders wounded, Sanders very slight & Jones I don't suppose will get well. Keale, Henry and Pendleton missing. I feel very thankful that I have come off safe so far. Dear sis I would write more but have not time to do so & this is all the paper I have. My love to you all-
