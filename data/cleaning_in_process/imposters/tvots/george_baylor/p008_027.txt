I take my pen in hand to let you no that I am well at this time. I received your note the other day and was very glad to get it. We just got back to camp yester day evening we went down on picket today weak ago, we could see Arlington hights from Masons hill; we could see the Capitol at Washington and the steple at Alexander and all their breast works, they shorly have it fortified. We could see the steam boats going on the river be low Washington. The river is a mile wide it was four miles from us to the river. We would go on picket in the morning and stand until the next morning and had about ten on one post, we ware in sight off their picket often but we dident shoot not they dident - friday night about ten oclock we got orders to to bring in the pickets and fall back about a mile to a little town named Anna dale and we stayed there till in day light very near in the morning and then we came about three miles farther back to [unclear: Secutank] crick at the border and there was a brigade of Miscippians throwing our breast works and the next morning we came back to Camp. we could see their old Baloon go out every morning and eaving it looked as large as a tent and as white. I don't no what we fell back for without it is to get them away from their breast works out toward ours; President Davis came here to [unclear: Farfax ] yesterday eaving but I have not saw him yet. I would like to have a pair of socks or to be fore long if you could send them, and a pair of drawers. I dot no wather to have a new pair or not the boots that are at home have some holes in the leg and they would not do me much good, for I would like to have a good pair. I think that I will send my masure the next time I write. I must stop writing for this time, for it is time to put on a [unclear: doger] for diner. Mat and Cal has not bin well for a few days. Tell Dave that I want some of his water millions. I want you to write soon as you can.
