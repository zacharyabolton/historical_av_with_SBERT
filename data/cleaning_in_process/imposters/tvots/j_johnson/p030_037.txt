I do not know whether you still belong to the Bureau of R.F. and A.L. or not but if you are not I feel sure you are acquainted with the incumbent in Staunton and so will be able possibly to do through him what I wish if it will not trouble you too much.   I want then a girl as Childs' nurse and I find it utterly impossible to get one here more than temporarily. So I thought I would write down to you to see if you know such a one as I want or could find me one without giving yourself very much extra care. Any girl of ordinary intelligence of good habits and not less than seventeen will do although if I could get one who has been brought up as nurse I should like it. She should be a good strong girl and knowledge of washing and ironing will not injure her in my eyes or those of my wife. Please answer me as soon as you can.
