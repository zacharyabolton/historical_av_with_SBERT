I had determined to write to you to night, & now that I have blindly, as, if I put off writing now, I dont know when I shall have another chance - being separated from all my children they all expect me to send them a letter every week, which keeps me pretty busy in my liesure hours. No doubt you have heard through Hol all about me. I am very nicely fixed in this large Seminary, it suits me exactly. I have plenty to do with all the girls to give me an influen ce over them, & 10 little girls under my care - after they come out of school at 4 o'clock I take them a walk in the Country, & let them play & amuse themselves, & when we return make them study their lessons for the next day - in the morn ing I go round & see who are sick, take the Dr to see them, etc. Archie Fauntleroy & his parter visit here  about, every morning, so I see a great deal of them & I think Archie enjoys going round with me as much as I do with him. I have no responsibility, & just the employment I like - this is a splendid School, 130 pupils gathered from every state in the Union. I always thought when there were so many girls they would lose their identity, but it is not so; Miss Ba ldwin has 12 lady assistants, & each one of them thoroughly understands each girl, temper, disposition, ability, constitution, & every thing connected with them, they make them a regular study, & everything is arranged with perfect regularity. I wish you could go with me into the dining room - 12 tables set with perfect neatness, each one having a teacher & 12 or more girls - the greatest quantity, enough & to spare of delightful hot rolls for breakfast & supper, butter, molasses, & either Beefsteak, eggs, or some other relish, perfection has certainly been attained in management of every kind - the best servants I have seen since the War & plenty of them - Dear Hol I wrote this far last night & hope your knowledge of my hand will enable you to read - I have found my specks & hope the rest will be more legible. Miss Baldwin wants me next year but my children are so opposed to my "cutting myself o ff from them" that I haven't made up my mind what to do. I do want to see you during the vacation & if you will be at Mittie's, will try & spend a few days there with you, & can see dear Mit & her chicks too, as I couldn't be with her las t winter. Blandy writes they are all well, but Jamie broke his arm, bore it like a little man & is doing well - Alf & Will are great at "Declaiming" & my hopes are high that they may be Preachers. Tacher was tempted to break his arm also, because Jamie was made such a hero of & had so many good things sent him. A portion of this letter is missing, but it concludes with love to various members of the family and "May God ever bless you my own dear Sister, the Friend of my youth, & of my riper years also.
