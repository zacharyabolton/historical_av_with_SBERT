I wrote you some two or three months ago and as there were two or three letters sent off at the same time, to neither of which any answer has been recived I think it more than probable that none of them reached their destination. They were sent to our office during our rainy spell & as our mails frequently came up more or less [unclear: and] by the sudden showers, it is likely the letters shared at that time the same fate but [unclear: werte] & they were [unclear: srcully] thrown away by our Mail boy--who sometimes played us other tricks by his negligence. In my letter I conveyed a wish from all the family & particularly from Henry that you would permit Sandy to pay us a visit and [unclear: uitie] our family school for the winter & spring, as your schools must be in a state of disorganization & and must remain so during the war--a [unclear: rendence nither] us too at this [unclear: parune] would impress his[unclear: health quietly besides] the advantage of [unclear: trar] it to our that has led to [unclear: domertre] a life as [unclear: he]. We have an excellent Teacher--a Virginian but a little too much of the Puritan order in the [unclear: thinking] of his rules &c such as rising at day break and an occasional confiniment in [unclear: May house] for [unclear: very] minor dificiences, but I will  to him [unclear: dffny] any saturday that they may enjoy thier [unclear: Horses] &  to their hearts desire. We have [unclear: piest] had the [unclear: tiding], of Englands demand for the restoration of our Captured ministers, which has  more  to others than to me--I would rather she would have told us a [unclear: fire] iron clad [unclear: war streamer] with [unclear: Armstrong] guns &  as have whipped the Scoundrels ourselves. Our People here are very much at a loss to account for  madness & folly on their part as to  a quarrel with England at this time, for judging from their acts there never was a people so  & crazy since the world was made. But there may be method in their madness--Like Macbeth they may --I am in [unclear: blood] slipped in so far, returning, [unclear: now] as [unclear: hard] as togo [unclear: over]They may  themselves on the brink of  whipped they certainly are, and unable to stand the [unclear: outside] [unclear: nature]& fear of discovery of the lies and  they have so long practiced on their  of victors &  won of [unclear: sin parts] [unclear: opened] that the  now [unclear: haunts] their imagination & to [unclear: dark] them from the Truth,  get up a war with England--dont you believe [unclear: Cameron] was telling an enormous lie when he made out his report of 6 or 700,000 men in  arms. I doubt whether they have or had over 350000 in the fold of [unclear: arms]--I doubt too whether they ever got 150000000 loan from the Banks. They are to me with  Gulf Stream that takes its  at the Cape of St. Rogue  the North American coast  the climate of western Europe & scarcely [unclear: mingles] with any other [unclear: water]--They have    the  man Conquest a separate & distant  we with such  of  that they never [unclear: cropped] out  before in the [unclear: lives] of [unclear: Cromwell]-as [unclear: haters] of other people but masked their [unclear: motive] as [unclear: lay] as they could fatten on our tobacco sugar & cotton crops by high Tariffs & [unclear: fishing] counties--but when like  the copper smith they find their [unclear: craft] in danger they show themselves in their theircaracter--the [unclear: Hirarado] of the [unclear: Chinese], the  ferocity of the , with his cowardice & lying   of the Gipsy  my Eyes [unclear: devl] , I hope to read of their buring town, smoking ruins & devastated fields. I fow now the [unclear: mor] will be too [unclear: short]--I want the whole South to imitate Carthagenian who swore his children on his coutries altar eternal hate to the vile wretches. They have learned one lesson and Europe too, that our peculiar institution that they hoped was our weakness, is a lever of strength, [unclear: We] of the [unclear: better] [unclear: rejoiceful] that subject more than you of Virginia, Tennessee or Kentucky--that their wishes & expectations [unclear: been] realized, can the mind of man conceive the awful horror of a  , the midnight conflagration & the [unclear: stagnation] of innocence. Had they  succeded, if alive, no doubt I should with my [unclear: other], now have a coporal with a   on my family, like my bale of cotton nor , to pay for the  of our Subjugation-- I  of Everett in  in this & there on that, his Electioneering speech of 1860 & his 4th of July address that the [unclear: gallaries] is the fate of Lincoln Sewared [unclear: Cameron] [unclear: Bates]  & the Blairs It is very late & cold, & if you can read this it is more than I can do. Our kindest regards to Mrs. S & the children all.
