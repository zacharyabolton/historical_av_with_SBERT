At the recommendation of Mr. Shields, of the Whig, I send you two accounts against Mr. Chesley Kinney. We drew a draft on him same on the 25th Sept. and he allowed the same to be protested. You may use such means as may be necessary to collect same. I have a number of other accounts against persons in Staunton and in the neighborhood, which I will send you as soon as I can prepare them.
