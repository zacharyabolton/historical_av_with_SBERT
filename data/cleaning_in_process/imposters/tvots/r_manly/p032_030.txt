I am sorry the teachers delay their coming so long. It would be better not to wait for the transportation but to collect it afterward. I have directed Miss Rowell to go to Staunton. The Free Baptists who were there last year do not return, and there was no provision at all for that fine post. One of the best Bureau Officers in Va. is there Mr. Thos. P. Jackson, who will aid in every way possible. I have instructed him and Miss R. also that the people will be expected to raise the means to pay the board and have suggested that 10 cents per week be collected from the pupils. What about books for our schools, and what are the instructions in reference to sale and exchange, and in reference to collections of "Peter's pence" from the scholars?
