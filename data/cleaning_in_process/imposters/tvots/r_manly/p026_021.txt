Your communication of the 4th inst. addressed to Maj. Gen. Schofield, Asst. Comr. has been referred to me with the following endorsement. "Respectfully referred to Rev. R. M. Manly, Sup. Education, who will write Mr. N. C. Brackett that general accusations like the enclosed cannot received attention. If Mr. Tukey has been guilty of acting in a manner injurious to the interests of the freedman's schools, he will please make specific charges." Signed O. Brown A.A.A.G. by order of Maj. Gen. Schofield. I add: The exigencies of the Bureau may require changes in the field of labor of an officer, the reasons for which an outsider and a stranger cannot understand. Both Lieut. Cook and Mr. Tukey have been known to Gen. Brown much longer than you have known them. If there is anything wrong in reference to the schools, I shall be glad to learn precise what it is.
