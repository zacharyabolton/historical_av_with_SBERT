I have the honor to inquire in regard to Freedmen's schools in Staunton. How may teachers, how many scholars, how are they accomodated in respect to school rooms? If repairs are necessary, what is the smallest sum that will meet the demand. If additional room is required, cannot a room be rented rather than to build? An immediate reply is very desirable. Write directly to me.
