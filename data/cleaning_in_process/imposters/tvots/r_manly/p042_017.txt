Your requests will immediately be attended to. The room will be rented at $7 from Nov. 22 but cannot be paid in advance. The Govt. never does that. I shall pay the rent to you, and you can settle with the owner. The seventeen dollars will be paid as soon as the money can be obtained from Washing. That is the inevitable routine.
