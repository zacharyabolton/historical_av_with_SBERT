Yours of the 4th recd. This city is already fully supplied with schools and teach. Consulting with General Brown it is concluded that Staunton is the best place for you. It is a delightful place to live in, the colored people are comfortable and well to do, and yet there is no provision whatever for any schools for them unless you go there. The N.Y. Branch F.U. Com. had schools there last year, but are not able to continue them. The col'd people themselves will contribute about half a support. That being the case, you had better commence school Monday the 5th of Oct. if possible.
