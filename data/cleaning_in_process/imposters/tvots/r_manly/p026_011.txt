Not having the pleasure of your personal acquaintance, I address all. Your Nov. school report through the office of Capt. Lacey Sup. 7th Dist. has reached me, and has some things in it "hard to be understood." Your day school is reported as having 233 male pupils 183 female, 416 total during the month of Nov. yet the average attendance is given as "0". So the night school has an aggregate of 241 (which must be an overwhelming number for five teachers) and 0 is given as the average attendance. "No. of pupils enrolled" and "average attendance" are the two most important points of information required. Again your report shows 48 in Alphabet 142 in easy lessons and 45 in higher readers making 235 in all. Where are the balance of the 416? All the scholars are supposed to be reading somewhere. Sympathizing deeply with you in your trying but noble work.
