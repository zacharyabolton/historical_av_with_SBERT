You did not give the name of the person who proposes to teach, nor state whether she is colored or white, and I have no means of judging of her qualifications. If I am to pay a teacher, I ought to know about these matters. The price I could pay must depend also upon the size of the school. The teacher had better commence her school at once and then write a letter with her own hand, telling me how many pupils she has &c. I pay monthly. Please state in your reply the exact location of the school, and how it can be reached from the Chesapeake & Ohio RR.
