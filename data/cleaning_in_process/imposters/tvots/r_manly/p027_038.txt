Your communication of the 8th inst. should have had earlier attention; the hindrances have been various and I will not enumerate them. I should like more distinct understanding than I now have. 1st. of the No. of pupils to be provided with school room accomodations (I mean the whole No. in Staunton.) 2 What facilities are already available, by rent or otherwise, for the future. 3d The extent of the accomodations to be provided in the proposed church building. It must be borne in mind that the Bureau does not aid in Building churches, as such, but if aid is given for such a building, it must be with security that it may be continuously used for school purposes. Please inform me on the above particulars, and in the same paper, make application for a specific sum, making it as small as you can.
