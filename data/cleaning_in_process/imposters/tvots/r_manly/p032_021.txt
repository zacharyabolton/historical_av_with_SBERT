Yours of the 2d is rec d  I have been depending altogether upon Mr. Brackett to supply Staunton with teachers. Have not had communication with him, but took it for granted that he would supply. If he does not, the best I can do, so far as I can see, at present, is to send a young lady there. I could do that at once, if you thought best, then if none other could be provided you, would have her and she is an experienced teacher and a very good lady. This lady will be at my house probably tomorrow, and must be sent to some of the many applicants within a few days. The charitable societies are "hard up." I dont think you will get a man. If Mr. Brackett should supply at all, I suppose he would be glad to be relieved of the support of one teacher. Please reply at once, and I will be governed by your judgement.
