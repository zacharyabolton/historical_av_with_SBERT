A communication from Mrs. Cheney sec. Teachers Com. of the N.E. Branch F.U.Com. inquires after "some healthy location, high, where it would be safe to stay in summer . . where a lady who wishes to teach the Freedmen can start a new school. She prefers new scholars with whom she can carry out her own methods. She is an elderly lady who has had great experience in teaching and is highly recommended &c. She goes without salary and only expects school house fuel &c to be furnished - will probably be accompanied by an assistant." If you know of any place which will meet or nearly meet these requirements please give a full account of it as soon as possible as the parties wish to enter their work at once.
