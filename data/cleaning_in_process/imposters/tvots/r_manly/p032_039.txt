A letter from Tho's P. Jackson, Bureau Agt. at Staunton says "Do send an assistant and companion, as soon as possible for Miss Rowell -- we have now 112 scholars registered for her school, a number she cannot possibly control." This was written Thursday last. The school is to open today. Have faith and send Miss R. a helper. I hear nothing from Misses Howe and Hancock. It is bad very bad.
