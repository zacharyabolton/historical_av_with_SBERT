A severe sore-throat prevents my coming to town. Mr. [unclear: Brison] is very anxious to settle with me for the painting of my house. Can I have the measurement done so as to be useful to yourself and Mr. Imboden as arbitrators? I hold that I have a right to call on Mr. Armentrout to make out his bill and prove it, and, of course, to not herewith waive that right. Still, I would suggest that, if Mr. Armentrout is really anxious to have his work fairly measured, we ought to meet at my house (Capt. Smith, Mr. [unclear: Brison], Mr. Armentrout & myself) at some appointed day and hour, when the whole work may be measured and the part done by each workman ascertained. If you approve of this suggestion, please consult Capt. Smith & Mr. A. and let me know the day and hour appointed.
