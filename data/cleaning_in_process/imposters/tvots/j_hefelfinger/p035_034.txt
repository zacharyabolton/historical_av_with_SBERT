Your favor of Jan 29th is recd. The boy Jesse commenced work for me on the 8th of Oct last, having agreed to work by the month from that date @ $8.00 per mon; Sometime before his month was out he ran away without giving me any notice or leaving me with anyone to supply his place thus breaking his contract & depriving himself of all claim on me. I was away during the most of his stay here & my clerk informs me that he was utterly worthless & did not earn his board
