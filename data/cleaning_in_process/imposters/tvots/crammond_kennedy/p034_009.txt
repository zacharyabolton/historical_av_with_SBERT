Mr. Manly having forwarded your bill for household articles to this office, permit me to enquire whether you would take a dollar or two per month for their use till July 1st, and then bill them if you do not want them yourself and also whether this compensation could not be taken from the school-returns, which I notice in the last report, were $50 for the month. This may look  on [unclear: our] part, but the truth is that it is so hard to get money, and we have so many unsupported teachers in the field, that nothing but the hardest work and the strictest economy will prevent the suspension of our work before the close of the school year.
