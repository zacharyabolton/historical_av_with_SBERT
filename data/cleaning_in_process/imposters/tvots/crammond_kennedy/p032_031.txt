As I am informed by Rev. R. M. Manly that Miss M.S. Rowell, one of our teachers has been sent to your station, I take the liberty of writing to you on her behalf. We are very desirous that she shall be situated comfortably. Will you help her to find a good boarding place? She is instructed to collect enough to pay her board. Will you give her advice as to the most efficient mode of securing the money?
