The A.M.A. will not send Mr. Scott, or anybody else as a teacher, to Staunton, Va. As soon as the colored teacher who is under appointment for Newcastle Del. reports at that place, Miss Allison S. Jones will leave to join Miss Rowell. I inclose Mr. Jackson's papers. Ask him to see that the money which Miss Rowell collects is used for her board. The collection has been made, but the her bill has not been paid. If this is done, and he sends in his bill for furniture, I shall see that some allowance is voted in his favor.
