Again I attempt to write you a few lines with the earnest hope that I may soon hear something from you it has now been nearly four months since I have heard one word from you so long & anxiously have looked for a letter from you that I have all most dispaired of ever hearing from you again. I often fear that something serious has happend or that it is possible that I am now writing to the dead. I truly hope & pray that the sad thought is in correct you know not my dear friend what anxiety of mind I have experienced since you have been so long silent. I have had all sort of imaginations but can come to no conclusion. I earnestly hope now to hear from you & have all fully explained or if I have lost my dear friend Kate & this letter is read by her dear parrents any surviving friend that they will speedily favour me with a letter that would bear to me sad sad news for not withstanding we are comparitively strangers you have always since our earliest correspondence felt to me like a sister the Christian like character of your correspondences is so characteristic of one of who is a true child of God. That it has drawn out my fondest attachments for you are such. I will not write much more. if you are yet alive (& God grant you may be) please answer at the earliest opportunity with a continuation of my imperfect prayers for your preservation I will impatiently await tidings from you
