 I have been for some time intended to write you, but pressing times have prevented my doing so. For a wonder I am quiet this morning with nothing but the usual camp duties to perform.  Tom is well, tell his Mother that I have been very much & agreably disapointed with him. When he left Staunton with me I though he would be hard to manage & in truth I thought him little or no account. But I have found him not only usefull, generous and Brave to a fault, But I have found in him a pious regard for the truth, His word when given never braken, a disposition and temper rarely if ever muffled, and for one of his age a Boy that any one might be proud to call their son. In the Ardous & hotly contested fields we have operated on. He has allways been at his Post. And at Brandy Manasas & Poulsville my heart beat with pride, when I saw the flag of my Regiment ever in front & borne proudly in the hottest of the fight by him. Say to his Mother that I will care for him as I would & will for one of my Boys if they were old enough to fight for their Countrys freedom. I have made no request of Tom, but that is has been readily granted. He has thrown aside whiskey smoking & tobacco, and I think is trying very hard to be all that you & his Mother would desire him to be. I have not written this to flatter him, but as a just tribute to a good & gallant Boy. My kindest Love to Aunt Mary Jane Addy & the Children By the way the Boys tell me Addy & Gen. Thomson are about making a match, tell Addy she must wait unttil Tom & me can come Home, to enjoy the fun & good things. Cousin Jimmy shall give her a big fuss. Good bye.
