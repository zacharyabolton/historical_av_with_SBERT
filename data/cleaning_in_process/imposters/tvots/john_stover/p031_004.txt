I owe you an appology, when in Staunton to-day your boy (or clerk) told me that you wished me to call and see you before I would [unclear: leave] Staunton. I promised to day so, but being busily engaged I entirely forgot it until I reached home. If therefore you have any communications to make, you will please write to me at once, or if it is important that I should be in Staunton, or in your office, I will go any day, though it does not suit me as I expect to attend a mineral spring some six miles from here in the mountain You will please let me hear from you at once, and I will be at your service.
