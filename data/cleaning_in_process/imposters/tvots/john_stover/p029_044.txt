I have just met with a very disturbing case of destitution which I trust it will be in your power to alleviate. Viz. John Wesley Crisman, Churchville, P.O. He is about 60 years old in feeble health, has dependent upon his support an idiotic brother aged about 50 years, a son 25 years, idiotic, subject to fitts and as helpless as an infant, also a widowed daughter with a child 5 years old. Mr. Crisman is a very worthy, inoffensive man -- And certainly needs and deserves the charities of the Government.
