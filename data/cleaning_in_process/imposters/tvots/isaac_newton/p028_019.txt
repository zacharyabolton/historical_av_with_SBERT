I have the honor to inform you that I have this day sent to your address One Mail Bag containing vegetable seeds with the request that you will make a judicious distribution of the same among the people of your County, as contemplated by Resolution of Congress appropriating $50,000 for the purchase of seeds for the South, and trust the same will reach you in good order. When received please acknowledge.
