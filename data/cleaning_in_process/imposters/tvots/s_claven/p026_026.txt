Yours in reagard to the Col'd girl in my possession is just recieved I just say to you that the girl Mary Gordon as that was her Mother's name was Free born and on her way to the poor house when about 14 months old my wife took charge of her, and when about two years of age the County Court bound her to us. She is now eleven years old past, and just getting so she can pay for her raisen The Bureau has nothing more to do with her than they would have with a bound white girl her grandmother was a white woman.
