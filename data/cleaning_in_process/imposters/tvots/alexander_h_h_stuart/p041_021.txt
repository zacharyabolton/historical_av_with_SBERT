Your letter of 3rd inst was received last night & I hasten to answer it. After quoting some passages from a publication in the Valley Virginian, of what purports to be the substance of a speech made by me to the people of Augusta on the 28th ult. you ask whether the report is in substance correct or whether it is approved or sanctioned by me - The speech to which you refer was altogether extemporaneous, without the aid of any note or memorandum & therefore I cannot pretend to recall the language used by me on that occasion - I presume, however, that the general outline of the speech is correctly given, but the report is too meagre & imperfect to furnish an accurate presentation of what I said - Presuming that the purpose of your letter is to ascertain what I said in relation to your own comments in regard to the movement, which was the subject of discussion, I proceed to state it as nearly as I can, in the language which I used After adverting to the opposition which has made to the movement, & the criticism which has been indulged in, in regard to the course pursued by the gentlemen connected with it, I referred to the opposite quarters from which more criticism came - I stated that while we were in Washington we found ourselves between two fires, one in front & the other in the rear, & that these fires proceeded from parties holding the most antagonistic opinions, & having the most diverse objects in view - one party desiring the adoption of the Underwood Constitution, whilst the other was unalterably opposed to it - Thus while Gov Wells and his committee were assailing our proposition in Washington, Gov Wise & others, were attacking it at home - Thus extremes seemed to meet, & the singular spectacle was presented, of Gov Wells & Gov Wise, who probably held no other opinion in common, pulling together as it were in the same team, in opposition to our scheme I also referred to the fact that the Richmond Enquirer & radical Journal, which, on all other questions, were the antipodes of each other, were yet in accord, in opposing our measure; & that George Rye, Yankee Allen, & Dr Bayne, found coadjutors even in Augusta! - After commenting on this singular union of discordant elements, & the co-operation of persons who were looking to opposite ends, I said that such alliances of men of antagonistic opinions - of carpet-baggers, & fire eaters, would be productive of no good, unless they tended to satisfy the people that our scheme was the true one - I also referred to the fact, that Gov Wise had written five letters, in opposition to the movement, but I said that I had seen but one of them, & added that I thought the history of the last eight years would prove, that Gov Wise was not a safe councillor in public affairs - This I believe to be the substance, & as far as I can recall it, the language of that part of my speech which referred to you or your opposition to the plan of the committee, with which I was connected.
