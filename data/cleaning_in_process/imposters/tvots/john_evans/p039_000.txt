In reply to your note of the 23rd have to say, Alex Nelsons was arrested on my warrent and tried by the mayor N. K. Trout, to whom I gave your paper calling my attention to the case, and had supposed it had all been attended to. I understand from the "Mayor" this morning that he recognized the [unclear: parties] Alex Nelson to answer an indictment before the next Grand Jury. I would however refer you to the Mayor for full particulars as he tried the case.
