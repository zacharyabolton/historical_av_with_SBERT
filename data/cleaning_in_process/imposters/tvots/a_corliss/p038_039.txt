Yours of the 7th inst. is at hand. We are laying our plans to go to Staunton, and will start as soon as possible. It may take us till the 15th of Oct. to raise money enough for our support. We are having good success now. Please give me the names of some of the leading Colored men at Staunton, and the name of the Bureau officer there. Do you think we shall encounter much opposition there? Can we have a school house free of rent?
