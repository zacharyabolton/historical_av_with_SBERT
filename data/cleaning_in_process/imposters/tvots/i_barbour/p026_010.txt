Your favour of the 8th just has been received. At the late meeting of the Directors of the Co. I brought your matter to their attention, but in view of the financial condition of the road & its engagements for several temporary loans upon which the Directors were individually responsible, it was not their power to comply with your wishes, however personally admirable it would have been to them. My own opinion is that any suit of this class against the Co. would retard instead of advancing the collection of the bonds, though of course you must decide for yourself. The Co. can not pay now for the best of reasons--not having the means at command, and I regret that it operates so much inconvenience in your case--
