I am sorry you construe the resolutions as mutinous & tending to insubordination. I did not so construe them, and I am satisfied that such was not the intention of those, who passed them, with the exception of a copy, which I sent to Clol. George Bales, Staunton, I have not nor will not be responsible for their circulation. I have brought the matter to the attention of the officer, who signed them & will leave to them what shall be done. I deem it due to myself to say that the fact of my sending you the resolutions should have argued, that I did not consider them as containing anything derogatory to you.
