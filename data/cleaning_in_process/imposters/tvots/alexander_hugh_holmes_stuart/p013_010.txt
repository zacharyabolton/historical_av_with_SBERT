I spent the last week at the [unclear: farm], & did not return until Monday evening. This will explain why I did not write to you sooner.  I have always thought it was your pecuniary interest to have the whole land of Mr McCue sold, & I believe that it was the [unclear: course] but calculated to ensure harmony & kind feeling among all parties interested. Nothing but your strong desire to return the [unclear: manni-] [unclear: house] caused me to abandon my position. My opinions however remain unchanged, & were I in your position, I would prefer a sale of the whole. I fear, if you return the home place, you will be harrassed during life, & have a struggle to get on & educate your children. I never thought the home a durable one for you, & were I in your place I would still let it be sold. If it went for a moderate price, you might buy it. if not, let it go, & look elsewhere. Property must fall, & you can do better with this money six months hence. You will find it a troublesome. and in ordinary times, an unprofi table thing to carry on such a farm. It would be better to have a less costly home, & the surplus money in production stocks. You would then be certain of a revenue even in case of a failure of crops. A small farm sufficient to furnish your own supplies, with the balance of your money at interest, would be better in all respects. You had better come up on Monday, & qualify as guardian for your children. Come to my office & I will have every thing arranged so that you will be detained but a few minutes. you can then go to our home to dinner & return, if necessary, in the evening. When you come up, we can talk matters over, more in detail I think Col Bell had better file a bill & let Judge Thompson settle the matters of the estate both real & personal
