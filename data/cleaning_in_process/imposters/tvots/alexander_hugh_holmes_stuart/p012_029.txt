On monday last, I had a conversation with Col David S. Bell from which I learned that it was his wish, & also that of Dr Alexander, & I believe, of the other heirs of Mr McCue, as far as their sentiments were known, that the whole property, real & personal, should be sold, with a [unclear: mind] to the distribution of the proceeds. This has always been my opinion, & your uncle Isaac fully concurs in it. I know that your regard for the wishes of Mr McCue, induces you to entertain a different view, but I think you are sacrificing too much to this idea. If you desire to maintain perfect harmony with all the family, this is the true plan, & I am persuaded, that your pecuniary interests & comfort, will be greatly promoted by it. If you return your dower in the land, the buildings will necessarily be valued at a large sum, & you will thus be substantially paying a very heavy rent, for a house much too costly for your purposes. The remainder of the farm will necessarily have to be sold. probably in two trusts, & as there are no good buildings on them, the price may be affected thereby Moreover, if you retain the old homestead, (which in my opinion from its inaccessibility is a very undesireable home) you will entail on yourself an expense, which it is difficult to estimate, & you will necessarily become so much entangled with the affairs of other members of the family, as to render collisions of interest, & alienation of feeling almost inevitable. By selling the property, you would probably have $15.000 at least, in your own absolute right, & each of your children, eight$8000 or more, - probably $10.000 - With this large amount, you could buy a comfortable home, & give your children complete education. By holding on to the homestead, you cannot do this, & you would be harrassed by a thousand cares & anxieties, & have little left at the end of the year. On Monday, I had, (with the concurrance of Col Bell) John Brooks, Wm M. Tate & Wm A. Bell appointed Comrs, to lay off your dower in the land & slaves, if you should adhere to the opinion that that was the best course. If, on the other hand, you should think it best to pursue the other course, this appointment will be null. Col B. wishes some arrangement made by the close of the year, & it will be necessary for you to make up your mind, as to the course you will prefer. If a sale be deemed advisable, a bill can be filed, & the answers of the adult heirs put in, & submitted to the Judge. He will have no power to decree a Sale in vacation, but he will doubtless, advise such course as will ensure his ratification of the sale [unclear: ? ] when brought before him. The Sale can be made in January, subject to the approval of the court, & it can be affirmed in june
