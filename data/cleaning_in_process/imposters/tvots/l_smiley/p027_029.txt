 As I didnt have time to write last Friday I will try & do so this morning. I had the headache pretty bad this morning & was beginning to think I'd have to go to bed, but when I was in class, Nelie P. handed me a bottle & told me to smell it. I did so & it pretty near knocked me down but it nearly cured me of my headache. I have headache about half the time now. Carrie has headache this morning. The Episcopal Convention met here last week. Kip Baldwin took the gals Friday & Saturday night, some few went Sat. morning at 8 O'clock.

The people would be surprised when they saw 40 school-girls on the street before 6 o'clock. in It as you know from experience how hard it is to get them out of bed, Howe Peyton wasn't confirmed (according to expectation). We had Episcopal service in our church yesterday morning & evening. They got along very well in the morning as there was a good many Episcopal ministers scattered about over the church but last night there wasn't any one to respond at all. We had a very good sermons - the preachers were just carried away with the singing..thought they had never heard any voices like Miss [unclear: Arrow]'s & Miss Minnie Tupping's. Communion here next Sunday week. Josie English is living in town now. she is just about the prettiest young lady I have seen for a time.

Laura H. says aint you coming down to see her, before she goes away, never to come back again. Nelie P says she's going to send photograph this week.

Mary h my face is all swollen again. commenced last Wednesday. & I reckon will keep on if I dont have my teeth fixed. Please ask Pa if I cant have them fixed, unless it will cost too much. You needn't tell any one my face is sore again, as people will ask you more questions than a few. Mary ain't you coming down to see me before the session closes. I was asking Mary Turk when you were coming, but she said, that you said, I never said anything about your coming & from that you reckoned I didn't want you, Well now you know that isn't so, & that I would be glad to see you any time you would come Are you all done "planting corn, Lucy went down ordered a bonnet.
