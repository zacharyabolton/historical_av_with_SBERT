I learn since returning here that the colored people of Lexington have been paying Rent for a room in which to have a school. This realy seems hard. I did not know the fact however when I wrote you for a teacher for Lexington several weeks ago from Winchester. Please don't keep them thus waiting longer if possible to avoid it. I shall write you more fully about matters here soon. The day schools are not large yet but tho night schools are larger than the rooms or the teachers can accommodate. It is not unusual for the number of night pupils to be greater than the day but so it is here It is expected that the day schools will increase rapidly soon.
