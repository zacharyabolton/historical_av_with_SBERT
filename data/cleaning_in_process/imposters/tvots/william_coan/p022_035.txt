So great is the pressure upon upon us to open schools at Lexington that I start for there tomorrow morning in company with Mrs Dunn one of the Staunton teachers and Lieut Tubbs Supt of Bureau at Lexington. I propose to meet the colored people on Sunday and arrange to open school on Monday and hold my breath if possible until you can get teachers to us. We shall look anxiously for them until they come, expecting them next week. I hope for a gentlemen and two Ladies Lieut T. says he thinks there will be as many scholars in Lexington as Staunton. It will be hard for the teachers here to get on now for a few days without Mrs Dunn but all would accommodate. Please then send without delay Should you send them by R. Road let them leave New York on the evening Washington Train and they will be here (Staunton) the next afternoon at 4 1/2  stop at Mr Tukeys overnight and can to Lexington on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, by stage. Send Ladies of Nerve and experience if you have them. Lexington is a hard place for "Nigger teachers" Please be sure and send with them Say-- {200 Saunders Primers (Green backs) 15 [unclear: Sett.] Charts 1 Box Crayons} This will give them a start and I will make up a more general order or aid the Supt when he arrives.
