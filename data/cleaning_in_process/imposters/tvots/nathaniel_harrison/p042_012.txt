The letter was rcd yesterday, my court here will meet on the 15th inst - at which Wm. Spangler has promised me to make a payment on the Stuart land - Times here have been so hard that I told him, if he could pay make a good payment I would not require the whole at this time - I have none of the fund in my hands or I would lend you the cheque you desire - I have rcd nothing for several years before I and nothing since the termination of the war except Eleven dollars in some matter with Spangler, for which he is entitled to credit on his bonds. I will have the bonds & receipts exd as soon as possible and send you a statement [unclear: of] the balance due, and a cheque for [unclear: all] I can get from Spangler at at my next Ct. Mr Henry M. Matthews, told Mrs Harrison that Genl Echols said he would dismiss his suit in Charleston vs Erskines Estate, if his (Echols') debts are paid. Will you do me the favor to ascertain and let me know as soon as possible whether this information is correct and to what particular claims it was intended by General Echols to be applied. We are endeavouring to sell the property as fast as possible, with a view to paying off all the debts and, if a payment to General Echols embracing no claim which is objectionable, would result in a dismal of the suit I will use every effort to make it before the next term if Judge Jackson could on 22d Novr. next.
