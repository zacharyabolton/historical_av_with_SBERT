Yours of the 4th inst. was duly received, and should perhaps have been answered earlier. But the great uncertainties which have hitherto enveloped our work - rapidly however assuming the form of uncertainties most adverse to the successful prosecution of our work, at least under former auspices, have detained us from advancing, lest out progress should be suddenly arrested by some new "order" or more, of the Govt. In regard however to the call from Staunton, we have concluded to respond, and send the ladies requested by Mr Tukey. Accordingly I shall send for them at the same time I drop this note to you, and another to Mr Tukey. If then I do not receive any orders countermanding your request, I shall dispatch Mrs. Dunn and her sister to Richmond to your care, supposing that, that is the most direct route to Staunton. If there are any reasons why we should not forward them to you, please apprise us of the fact by return mail.
