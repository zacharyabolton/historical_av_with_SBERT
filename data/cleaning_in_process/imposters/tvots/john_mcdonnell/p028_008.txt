In your report of Bureau affairs for April you state "I regret to find myself without food or clothing to ration." &c. On the second of March last, Mr. Tukey, your predecessor, reported to this office, that he had received two (2) boxes of clothing for gratuitous distribution. Since that time, no application for clothing has been received from your sub-District at this office.  No Estimate of Rations required to prevent destitution has been received from your sub-district since the month of February, as required by circular 32. Hd Qrs Asst. Comr Va. series of 1866. You will at once send to this office the Estimate of Rations required by said circular for the present month, and a List of clothing necessary to prevent suffering.
