I return for correction your Postage account of July, it appearing to be made for August. Hereafter you will forward your postage account for the month in which the expense was incurred on or before the 25th of each month, in order that it can be [unclear: embraced] in my Postage account for that month. Heretofore your accounts have been received so late that my accounts for that month have been in, and generally paid, before yours were received. Hereafter you are desired to make all official communications on at least half a sheet of letter paper.
