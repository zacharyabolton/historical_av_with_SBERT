My Letter of Mch 19th calling for a Report of Civilians (agents) appears to have been misunderstood by you. It was not intended that that report should be included in your personal report to the Commissioner, but that an "additional" report was required. Your report as required by Cir. 12 should be made as heretofore. I also beg to invite your attention to Circular No. 12 by which you will perceive that it is required to be made on the 1st day of each month. If you are by that time at your new post of duty, it will not be necessary that it should be sent to this office.
