I enclose a copy of circular No. 3 altho' it has already been furnished your office. Your personal report for May must be forwarded at once, thro' this office. Circulars 8 and 9, have been sent you since you assumed charge at Staunton. No. 8 is the organization of the Bureau in this state into Sub Districts & Divisions, giving names of officers in charge of same. No. 9 directs that the Freedmen be made acquainted with their rights under the Reconstruction act, to be registered &c. You doubtless have them both. The other missing circulars of this year, do not relate to duties of agents of Divisions, or A.S.A.Comr's.
