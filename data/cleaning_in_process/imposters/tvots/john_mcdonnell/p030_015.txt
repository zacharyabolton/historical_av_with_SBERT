Your communication of 18th inst. inclosing accounts of Henry A. Harner and Lewis W. Pearce has been received. The account of Harner is per purchases, made on the 21st of June last, and you will please explain why said account was not forwarded in the month when purchased, as enjoined in instructions from this office. It is now too late to take up these articles on my Return for June, and the account will have to be altered to July. Hereafter you will take particular pains to see that such accounts are sent in before the 25th of the month in which the purchases are made or services rendered.
