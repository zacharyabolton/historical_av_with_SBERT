In reply to your communication of 23d inst. I have to state that schools sustained entirely by the people of the locality, receiving neither teachers or assistance from Northen Educational Societies nor benevolent associations nor from the Bureau need not be reported on Form "A" - The form in the back of Circular 26 is intended merely for the guidance of officers making the report.
