Herewith please find returned for signature, vouchers for your pay as A.S.A.C. in this Sub-District, for present month. Please return it receipted by return mail. I could not report you for pay, for a period extending beyond the date of the order assigning you to duty. Altho' it is but one day, it would be just as improper for me to report that day as if it were two. I enclose a set of vouchers for the one days pay, which you will please forward direct to Maj. White or Lieut. Hambrick for collection.
