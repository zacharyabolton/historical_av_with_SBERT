The expenditure of $300 is hereby authorized, for repairs of Schoolhouse at Staunton "provided the expenditure of that sum will supply the necessities of education in that locality." I enclose vouchers for purchase, and labor. If the work is not completed in any one month, send in vouchers receipted, for the month, a few days before its expiration, that the service may be repeated. The vouchers for purchases should be sent in as early in the month as possible, in order that services and Receipts may be exchanged with Maj. White, before the end of the month in which they are purchased. If the services of more than one man are had, vouchers should be made for each, so that the rate of pay may not appear exorbitant.
