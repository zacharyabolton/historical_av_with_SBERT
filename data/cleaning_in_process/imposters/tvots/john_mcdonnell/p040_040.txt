In reply to your letter 21st inst., I take the earliest moment to inform you I have no control whatever over the subject of your duties as Registering Officer. It will be necessary for you to apply to Gen'l Stoneman or the Superintendent of Registration and Election, for the Divison in which your Counties are situated, for instructions. If you desire to learn before such instructions arrive, it would be perfectly proper for you to transfer the articles to any of the County Regr officers, notifying the proper HdQrs of your action.
