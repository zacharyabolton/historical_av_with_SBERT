Enclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit one copy of Circular No. 4 C.S. from Bureau Head Quarters. Please acknowledge its receipt. Stationery will be drawn as heretofore by the Sub Asst. Comr. for himself and subordinates and he will continue to furnish them with the quantity necessary for the transaction of their official business. It is not supposed that any more stationery will be used than heretofore, but the allowance is increased to avoid the necessity of special Reqns to supply deficiency.
