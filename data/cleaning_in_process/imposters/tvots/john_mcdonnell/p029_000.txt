You are authorized to purchase the allowance of Corn & Bacon previously prescribed, for all destitute whites heretofore reported by you. You will please make the purchases as early in the month as possible, and transmit to this office, properly signed applications and receipts for all issues made, which must offset the quantity purchased. I enclose a supply of purchase vouchers, and blank applications and receipts, when more are needed make timely applications for them. Send in the purchase vouchers early in the month, and the receipts before the end.
