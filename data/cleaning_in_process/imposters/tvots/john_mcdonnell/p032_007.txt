Having received instructions to send in my Property Returns this month in time to reach Maj. White before the 25th your vouchers for purchase of Lumber arrived after my Returns were completed, and too late for me to receive Invoices for the articles from Richmond, and get in my Return in the specified time. I therefore inclose a new set dated Oct. 1st which if returned immediately, properly signed will be sent in time for payment with the Sept. accts.
