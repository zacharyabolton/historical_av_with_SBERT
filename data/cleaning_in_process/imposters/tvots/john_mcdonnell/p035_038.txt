I have the honor to report that there are in the 1st Division about fifty (50) freedpeople, able to work, who cannot obtain employment. In the other divisions of this Sub District, the demand for labor is equal and in some cases exceeds the supply. The rates of hire throughout the Valley is so low as to indicate that farmers and others find no difficulty in obtaining all the laborers they require.
