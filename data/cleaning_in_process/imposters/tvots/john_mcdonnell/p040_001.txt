In reply to your application for a teacher at Waynesboro, I have to state that Mr. Brackett will furnish a teacher on the following terms; the freedmen to board him, furnish fuel + pay him $10 per mo.   Mr. Waring a very intelligent colored man representing another society which is operating in the valley will furnish a teacher if they will pay him $5 per month and fuel etc. for the school.   Please ascertain at once which proposition (if either) they accept. I would of course recommend the latter.
