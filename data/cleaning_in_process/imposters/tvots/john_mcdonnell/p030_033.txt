Your School Report is herewith returned to be made on the forms furnished and prescribed for this Bureau. Whenever any reports are due for which you have not proper forms you should make immediately make application for a supply. It is worse than useless to send in some other forms, unless it is ruled to correspond exactly with the required one. It is impossible to consolidate reports made out on different forms. I enclose a supply for School reports.
