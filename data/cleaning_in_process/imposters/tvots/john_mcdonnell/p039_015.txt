Please inform me what arrangements have been made for Schools at Staunton for the coming winter. It is presumed that the AME Miss. Society will furnish teachers as heretofore, but if such is not their intention, Mr. Brackett Supt of Schools for the Valley who has the management of the Normal School at Harpers Ferry will perhaps be able to send teachers.
