I enclose a copy of a communication received by the Sub. Dist. Comr. from District Head Quarters in response to an application of Mr. Jackson, Agent at Staunton for the detail of one man to replace the messenger discharged. On consultation with the Commanding Officer here, as directed in your letter ordering the discharge of Messengers, he doubted the propriety of ordering a man to report to a civilian, and requested me to allow him to forward Mr. Jacksons application to Head Quarters for instructions, with the result enclosed. Mr Jackson states that the assistance of a man to replace the messenger is really indispensable to the proper performance of his duties.
