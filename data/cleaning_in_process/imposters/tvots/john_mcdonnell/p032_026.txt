The assistant commissioner has authorized the expenditure of $100 for furnishing the schoolhouse at Staunton with desks. You are therefore directed to have desks made for this school at an expense not to exceed $100-and to forward the accounts for services and material to this office for payment. The account should be forwarded in time to reach the office on or about the 25th of the month in which the services are rendered, or the materials purchased. The purchases should be reported sooner if possible.
