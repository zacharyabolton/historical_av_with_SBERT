The money to which you refer was received all right. I will forward an application for clerk with a favorable endorsement. If you have good men for "Registers at large" your Bureau affairs should not be much embarrassed by being chairman of the board. However, you know best what assistance they can render you. Make the application and see what Genl Brown will do.
