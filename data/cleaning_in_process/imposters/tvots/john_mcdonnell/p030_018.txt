I return herewith vouchers in favor of Lewis W. [unclear: Peace], they having been made out on wrong forms. I have also slightly changed the bill to make the articles purchased easier to describe on the Invoices. Please have the new form signed by Mr. Peace and inclose it in the envelope directed to Major White, and forward it to him, with as little delay as possible.
