My Quarterly report being called for earlier than I expected and fearful that I cannot go to Staunton so soon again, I will thank you for a full reply to each of the following enquiries as soon as practicable. Viz  1st What is the General Condition of the freedmen.   2nd What likelihood is there of full justice being given to freedpeople by the civil courts in cases in which they are interested against whites.   3rd What is the condition of the Register of Marriages as authorized by Circular 11-1866, and how far are each of the four Paragraphs of said Circular carried out.   4th How is the supply of labor adapted to the demand.   5th What is the condition of the Schools for freedmen and what the demand for them elsewhere.  A full report is required covering the condition of you Sub division, and such other information as may be important or interesting in referance to the general Condition of the freedpeople in Augusta and Highland Counties. My Report is called for on the 25th so please forward yours as soon as possible.
