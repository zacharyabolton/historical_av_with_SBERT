I return herewith Receipt Roll for clothing issued to destitute freedpeople. The Rolls are required in duplicate. The signature to certificate must be made by me, as the articles are [unclear: borne] on my Property Return and reported as issued by me. Please leave the heading blank, the body of Roll is correct, and is all that is required. As my Returns await your correction of this & its return with duplicate, please send it back with as little delay as possible.
