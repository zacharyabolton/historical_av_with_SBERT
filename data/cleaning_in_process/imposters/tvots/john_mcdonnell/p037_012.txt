Herewith I send you Blank School Reports, as requested. Forms No. 4 are required by Circular 5, Bureau Head Qrs. This Circular has not been furnished me. The forms were originally received from the Asst Comr with Circular Letter from Bu. Hd Qrs. dated Jany 14.68 which contained a memorandum at the foot stating that "Circular with blanks sent to each A.S.A.C." I presume it is in the file of Circulars from Hd. Qrs. Bureau in your office.
