I return his "Teagle" a Sorrel Horse, he is a good Saddle horse, but a little skitish at times, but not at all dangerous, he will endure more driving than any animal I have got. Hope you will like him as well as I have. Lt. Hall at Woodstock was very desirous to have him but I had promised the horse to you previously.
