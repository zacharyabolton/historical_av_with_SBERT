I respectfully return herewith vouchers of auctioneers in Staunton their charges being considered very exhorbitant. No authority to print advertisements was sent, the property not being considered sufficiently valuable to warrant any expense. It is unnecessary for you to employ any professional auctioneers. The United States can employ any person as an auctioneer, also he will not be required to pay any license. At Woodstock, where precisely the same things are to be sold, one dollar is the auctioneer's fee. About three dollars ought to be ample for ten minutes work.
