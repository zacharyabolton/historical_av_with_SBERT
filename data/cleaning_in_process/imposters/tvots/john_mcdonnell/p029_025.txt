The Commissary at Richmond telegraphs me for the receipts for provisions issued to destitute whites. You were to send them on the 15th They have not yet arrived. Vouchers for the purchase of supplies for present month should have been [unclear: sent in] in the early part of the month. They must be sent in at once, if payment is expected. Your estimate of Rations for July, has been due some days, and unless received immediately, my consolidated estimate must be made up without it. Send it on at once, with Provision Returns. Your want of promptitude in forwarding estimates, vouchers, receipts &c causes great embarrassment and delay in this office.
