Your attention is invited to my letter of May 22d last inclosing copy of Circular 32, requiring an Estimate of Rations to be forwarded to this office for consideration, to reach here before the 20th of each month, for the month following. No such Estimate was received in June for this month, and the one for August has now been due several days. Your immediate attention to this is desired.
