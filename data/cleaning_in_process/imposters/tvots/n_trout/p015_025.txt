We have much stealing of bacon &c in town - this morning a negro woman has been arrested with a peice of bacon in her possession which appears to have been in oats - which she says she got from your negro woman Roby - through the hands of another slave; the woman is in possession of the military in the guard house, and I address you this note as your woman is implicated, that you may investigate the matter - and if she is guilty that she may be properly punished. Robberies of meat houses occur here nearly every night & we must do something to arrest the perpetrators. If your woman is innocent we must have her as a witness.
