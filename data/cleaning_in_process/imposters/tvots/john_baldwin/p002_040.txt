I have recd the claim of Cousins for a horse killed in Battle. It requires to pass through the Auditor's office which causes a good deal of delay. & then I learn that the appropriation is exhausted, but that will be remedied very soon. I will put it in regular [unclear: course for so intend]. We have no news here of any kind except that which comes from the Valley, indicating the coming of Early's army this way. I was all along our lines on the North side of the River yesterday & saw [unclear: unescaped] war looking down from Fort Harrison to the point of Yankee lines. I was nearly all day within range of cannon & at times in musket range of the enemy, but there was not a shot. The enemy are building within quarters. I fear the Habeas Corpus will again be suspended, but I hope in some modified form. Mr. [unclear: Trenholm] has made a capital impression here socially, & officially & his report rates very well. I think it will in the main be adopted, but as yet matters are not sufficiently developed to enable me to form an opinion. The President's negro mishap has cause much feeling against him in quarters very near him as Harris, Ruffin &c & I learn it is doing much mischief in stampeding the slaves. The city is just now unusually free of gossip. I have not heard anything worth writing about. I saw Sandy & so his the other day & all well, but hungry. Love to all your folks.
