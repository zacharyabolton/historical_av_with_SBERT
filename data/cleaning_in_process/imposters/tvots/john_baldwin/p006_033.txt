I regret that I have in my gift or under my control no position in which I could employ your capacities as a military man. I am satisfied you have the natural gifts of a soldier & that you will in any field win for yourself reputation & promotion if you get a fair chance. As far as my opinion can avail as the result of a life long acquaintance I am bound to testify in your behalf.
