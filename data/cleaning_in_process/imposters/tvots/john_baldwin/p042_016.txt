I send you a note just received from Briscoe - the second since yesterday - He complains I think with great force of being turned loose with his judgment overhanging him that he is "incurable but harmless" If the authorities cant give him some other clearance I think they have no right to turn him loose upon the world - & such seems within law - Code  440 35 for it is there required that such a person shall be delivered to any friend who is willing in the opinion of the board able to take care of him. Who is ready to make such an undertaking in regard to Briscoe - especially if he is let out under the head of "harmless incurable." If let out in a way to avoid irritating and hurting him there might be a fair prospect of his going to work & making a living - but otherwise he will go with his old condition & be wholly unable to take care of himself. I certainly did not intend & am not willing to make any such undertaking as is required by the law referd to - & I shall expect the authorities if the asylum is then to discharge him in a manner to make him to care for himself - or to keep him in custody until some one is found to undertake the care of him - or until he is perfectly restored -
