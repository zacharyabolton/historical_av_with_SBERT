I have received yours of the 10th inst., and I concur very fully in your views as to the importance of presenting an undivided front at the election. Our only hope now is in making ready for the biggest fight that is in us. The Union is gone forever, and we may as well admit the fact and so deal with it. I am so busy that I have only time to say that I have written a letter to a gentleman in Pennsylvania, a copy of which I send you, and which you may have published in the newspapers.
