I have a note on One Jacob Painter of your county for Some Sixty Dollars and under Stand he has made his property over to a Woman he has living with him in order to avoid the payment of his debts. If you will examine the Transfer he has made and think the money can be made out of the property I will send you the note and get you to bring suit on it at once. The debt was made sometime before he made over his property. He is living near this place in the mountains Let me hear from you soon
