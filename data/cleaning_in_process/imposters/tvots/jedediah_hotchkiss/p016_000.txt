Though it is quite late, My darling -- I am weary, yet I know you will be anxious to hear from me & that you have often thought of me this day -- with all the hearts devotion of a loving wife - especially as this is my birthday -- but I cannot speak of that - We are still confronting the enemy on opposite sides of the Mine Run some 14 miles N of E from Orange C. H. we have thrown up a long line of strong entrenchments & await their coming -- in some places the lines are not more than 200 yds apart -- and today we have had some heavy artillery firing from the enemy -- to wh. we did not reply much, reserving our fire -- they did us some damage -- a few wounded by uselessly exposing themselves & 3 or four killed -- whom I did not learn -- the enemy has been moving to our right & we anticipate a fight tomorrow -- some little skirmishing has been going on too -- Mosley fell on the Yankee trains at Brandy & destroyed a number of wagons & brought off prisoners -- & Stuart fell on the rear of Sedgwick's Corps below here & took a number of prisoners --  Today has been very cold & chilly -- a keen north wind, but our men endure all without a murmur, models of patience & fortitude -- God must bless our arms -- for there is so much devotion in our Army & so much reliance on the justice of our course --  All are in fine spirits & hope for the best --  Good bye & God bless you -- All my loved ones at home -- Write as usual -- & I shall get it --
