I just recd. your letter of the 13 th  telling me of the sad condition of poor Allie -- Heaven help her -- I am so sorry I was not at Home to cheer & console her, it is such a blow to her & to you -- alone as you both are -- I can only attribute it to the condition of his system, his nerves shattered by the rackings of his disease -- I do not want to think it anything else & feel that as soon as he recovers from his prostration he must feel that he has cruelly wounded the feelings of one that confided so fully in him -- almost outraged them after desiring, almost insisting upon her remaining here -- I cannot bring myself to think he would act so meanly & must lay all to the charge of his situation & hope Allie will do so too & cheer up & await the return of health to him & not by brooding over it impair her own I know the depth of her womanly love & how it must prey upon her spirits, but she must lean upon that Almighty arm that changes not & fear not, trusting that all will yet be well -- She need not fear want of any kind -- for we have told her that our home is hers & she is as one of our own children & I trust will so feel & think. It is hard to have ones cherished desires crushed in a moment & when we thought our joys almost complete to have them suddenly turned to sorrow but such is life -- such is the expereince of everyone & it is sound philosophy & true religion to meet the changes of life with resignation & compassion when we are assured that we have fully done our duty -- so I bid you all cheer up & hope for the "smiling face" behind the frowning providence. I am glad she was met so kindly by Rhett & the others -- so was some sunshine to the stormy day -- I can also imagine the F. has been  by some complaints of his poor old fatherwhose heart is unsanctified by religion has no joys of its own & feels restless & complaining & these complaints to F in his condition have almost unhinged him & hence his words & manner -- so I think it may be & a little time will restore him to himself -- Let us fondly hope so -- But I will say no more now -- though it presses sadly on my thoughts amid all this bustle of the moving of a mighty host. How full your feelings were my Dear your letter attests, for you mentioned nothing else save that you were well I have written to you 3 times & sent you some money -- hope they have all come to hand -- I wrote to you last form Bristol we could not catch the Yanks to fight so we have destroyed the R. R. & come back to Culpeper & encamped -- I spent last night at Mrs. Wise's her daugthers were well & had gotten along well, but were much surprised that their mother had not come over & had only heard from her by the letter I brought over -- they are very anxious for their mother to send after the stock as they have no feed -- I wish you would tell Reed to send my butter over, our camp will be near Brandy at present -- he can find some one that is coming over to take charge of it & we will pay expenses & send him the amount as soon as we hear from it -- I think you had better buy a few bushels of potatoes of Mr. Geading -- I shall want a few bushels when we go into winter quarters -- I will send you $100 in a few days -- Hope you are getting along as comfortably as your situation will allow -- Much love and kisses for all the family - Good bye & God blessyou all
