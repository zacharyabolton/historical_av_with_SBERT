We fought the enemy on Sunday and whipped them off the battle field killing many, that was half way between Harrisonburg & Port Republic, then yesterday we came this side of the river, burned the bridge & then fell on Shield's advance, 3 miles below Port Republic and smashed 2 Brigades all to pieces, capturing 6 pieces of artillery and pursued them 12 miles, capturing some 800 prisoners, and we are now moved up into Brown's Gap, out of their reach having only our front to guard, and now I suppose the Gen will commence some more strategy, which may result in driving the enemy back out of the Valley -- we have been wonderfully preserved, our loss has been small, and we have inflicted some severe blows on the enemy, Providence seems to have favored us in all our movements, and we have come out of the very jaws of destruction several times, as it were -- The Yanks actually came into Port Republic while we were there, but our troops bravely drove them back and kept them from destroying the bridge --  We did not get much sleep last night and I feel awfully stupid, so I will close this, but write soon -- I am very well, hope you are all getting along well -- May God bless you all --
