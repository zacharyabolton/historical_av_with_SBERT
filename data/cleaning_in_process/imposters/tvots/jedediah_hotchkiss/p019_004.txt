 I last night recived your fine letter of the 10th (Monday). I have written to you since then, from New Market, & hope my letter has come to hand before now & cheered you up some - I am truly sorry you feel so despondent & take so much "[unclear: though] for the morrow" - I am sure I could cheer you up if at home, but you must "fear not but trust in Providence & remember that the Lord has always provided for us & promises that the seed of the righteous shall never be forsaken" We have been here now three days - found the Yankee pickets at Strasburg, our cavalry, drove them off & we moved some infantry & Artillery to the top of a hill & shelled a brigade the Yanks had on picket & made it scatter every way, then opened on one of their camps & they ran from it pell mell, leaving everything, they then advanced some troops across to the hill we were on, not knowing that we had infantry there & our men met them & drove them back with considerable loss - we captured 65 prisoners & killed & wounded a good many - among the killed was Col. Wells who commanded the Yankee force that came up the Valley last winter - we had 22 killed & about 120 wounded - since then no action has taken place, each party looking at the other & wondering what it was doing. The prospect seems bright in every quarter - things get along well at Richmond & Hood has surely made one of the boldest movements of the war & must be successful if the half that is said of his army is true -- in fact we have always gained by taking bold measures & if Sherman is compelled to leave Georgia there will be a great revulsion of feeling in the North -- & peace sentiments will be in fashion again. Connecticut appears to have gone for McClellan -- we are desirous of hearing from the Pa. election -- a lady from the West, who has lately come to New Market, says the West will go for McClellan, & Price is doing much in his favor by occupying the larger portion of Missouri -- I hope you may be able to get some wood for present use -- I intend to get home before long & attend to the hauling & cutting up of a winter supply -- I shall be able to get fodder enough & I will put one horse into my pocket if I can do no better. I am sorry Mr. Geeding got offended, for I thought the government would impress his hay & he would be just as willing to let me have some of it but no matter -- he has done much for us & I have no right or reason to complain of him -- I asked you about Capt Sterrett in my last did he have time to go to Richmond? I do not need my clothes & prefer that you keep them at home -- I am sorry you were disppointed about coming over to camp, but I knew our movements were very uncertain as I wrote you -- I do not know what we will do here -- I will write often -- Write soon -- Love to the children -- & may Heaven bless you all
