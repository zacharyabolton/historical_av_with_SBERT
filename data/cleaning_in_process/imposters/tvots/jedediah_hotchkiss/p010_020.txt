I have got back here from my trip to Dry River -- very tired -- and as Imboden is going tomorrow through Briery Branch Gap and I can save 50 miles ride by staying here and going that way, and get rest for a half day & night, I think it best to stay and rest myself fully before starting, though I should like very much to come home. They buried Frank Emmitt and young Harman at Mossy Creek today -- Mr. Brown is complaining some. I want Mose to get my horse & bring him back -- I write a note to Nelson about him [tho' EXPAND TO though] Aunt Margaret is well. I will write to you very soon. See if I left my white hdkf at home, I thought I dropped it there. Send me the gloves if you have fixed them. If there is any authentic news from Jackson & army write to me by Mose. If Nelson is not at home see that my Leather halter is on my horse & have my saddle, blanket, & bridle all on my horse. If Cy paid for putting on a shoe give it him. I suppose I shall soon be home again -- Good bye & God bless you
