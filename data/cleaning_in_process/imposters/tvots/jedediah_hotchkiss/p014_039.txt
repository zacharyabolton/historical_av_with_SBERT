I wrote to you a few days ago that we were on the morning of a sanguinary conflict -- or all expected it -- after the boasting of the Yankees about Gettysburg -- one would have supposed they intended to capture us & all we had but they come on to near where we had selected our position on the W. Bank of the Antietam & went to fortifying - as though they expected us to go and take them -- we awaited them for 3 days until we found they did not intend to come out of their strongholds & then yesterday began crossing the river at Williamsport back into Va -- to rest & collect, reorganize &c & thus for all has gone on successfully -- our trains are all over the troops began crossing at 1 A.M. today, over a pontoon which was built in 1 day & I suppose the crossing will be successfully accomplished without even an attack & the 40 miles of wagons which Meade has sworn to have when night comes today will dot the green fields of Berkeley & Frederick -- The talk of the Yankee papers about the routed & demoralized condition of our army is the purest of nonsense -- We could have remained at Gettysburg if we hadseen fit -- the enemy did not come out to attack us & only followed when the found we were gone -- making a feeble attack upon our rear some 8 miles from Gettysburg -- which our rear gurard repulsed -- The enemy's cavalry came through at Mt -- road & destroyed two or three hundred of our wagons -- a third part perhaps of those we had captured from them since we started -- a few pawns lost on the chess board of war -- We did not take the heights at Gettysburg for they had already cost us too many lives, but came away from them at our own pleasure -- and today the Army of Northern Va. stands, as it has always stood, the sure defense of the heart of the Confederacy & though disaster may befall our arms elsewhere it has not as yet befallen them here & by God's blessing we hope never may we have lost many men, but they died bravely on the field of honor, not in inglorious retreat and their living companions only left the gory field until they had so crippled the foe that he was powerless to do them harm -- We regret the loss of Vicksburg, becasue of the noble stand she has made & the heroic endurance of her citizens & soldiersbut she is not the Confedracy & freedom does not die with her -- its fall sets free a band of noble spirits to harrass and annoy the enemy in his imagined possession of the Mississippi & he will find his much coveted & dearly obtained prize an apple of Sodom now he has gained it --- Our army is in fine spirits and ready to meet the foe any where in the open field What we are to do next I know not - but we are in good hands, & all confide in the wisdom of those that direct our movements-I. I have an assistant now & therefore do not have as hard work as formerly -- he does most of the drudgery Maj. Harman bought 2 lbs. of indigo and sent to his wife -- 1/2 lb. of it is for you & he will write to her to send it to you -- we only found it at Williams-port & it was $10-a pound -- I did not get the other articles mentioned in your last but will bear them in mind -- I shall soon know if my bundle went home -- & will see to it -- I have 2 prs of silk gloves, some hdkfs & 10 yds fine cotton, I dont know what, wh -- I will send soon -- Only see if Brown will take the money & I will sendit -- I will send you some more very soon -- I fear you may need it. I have some tea also for "the old lady" bless her heart -- I would like to take a cup of tea with her & rest my weary head in her bosom -- weary of the toils and turmoils of war -- Heaven grant they may soon end -- I long for home & all its sweet delights, its innocent repose & quiet -- I shall try to come home, but do not see any chance now, in the midst of active operations such as we must have this summer I saw most of our neighbor-boys a few days ago -- Heizer, Hoover, Stover, Drinkler, Shumate, &c &c -- they are all well -- we have had rain, rain lately & the rivers have been foaming --   I think it well to give Nelly rest during the summer -- let the children enojoy the free air & fruits of the season -- I am sorry the croup continues to attack Anna so much -- I would try oiling her throat with sweet oil often washing it -- I have another bottle for you -- very fine oil -- write soon I forgive "the pouts" knowing htey are love ones - only they are not as sweet as smiles and kisses, you know Kisses & love for the children --- William is very hearty & we are on "Old Virginia's shore again -- Write soon -
