I have time to write but a few lines, we captured the place this morning with small loss, only about 156 killed & wounded & we took some 3000 prisoners, 22 pieces of artillery, many small arms & large supplies of all kinds -- Milroy got off with a few cavalry, but we are pursuing him -- his army is scattered far & wide, and we have also taken Martinsburg & prisoners and stores there, & 5 more guns -- we shall go on tomorrow, to some further point -- This has been one of the most complete successes of the war, our men behaved splendidly Milroy's surprise was complete -- . I am well & we are all in fine spirits -- I enclose you (60) sixty dollars in this -- I must go to  so excuse this. My love to all -- good bye & God bless you
