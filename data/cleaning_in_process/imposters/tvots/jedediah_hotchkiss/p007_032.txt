I recd your two letters by Mr. Frazier & one from Nelson by Mr. Hunger & was indeed glad to hear from you, though deeply moved by your anxieties and distress concerning me - - I wrote to you the very day after the flight from Camp Garnett & hoped you would get my letter before you heard of the fight, & I wrote the next day too that you might surely hear from me & told you the main events of the fight & wrote fully to N. yesterday. I am sure you have heard from me before now and are relieved from apprehensions -- I am faring finely now -- mess with Capt. Lilley's men & have a good suit of clothes given me by them when they chose me an honorary member of the company. We have provisions that were sent us from Augusta & then our mess has a good cook in it. I am sorry you have so much concern for me, because it wearies you out - tho' I am as much concerned for you & my darling children -- but but have not as much time to brood over it being in the whirl & excitement of camp life & in the midst of stirring events that attract & at the same time distract the attention The men are gathering in slowly -- some 6 or 700 were taken prisoners but they have been released on their parole of honor we are informed and will be here today all except Col. Pegram who was a U. S. Army officer & him they have taken to Ohio as a prisoner. Gen. Garnett was killed & his army is now on the way here by the way of Hardy Co -- having had a desperate fight, lost most of their baggage and had a few hundred killed, inflicting a considerable loss on the enemy -- The men that came through on parole yesterday say the enemy buried 137 of their men & 27 of ours after the Rich Mt. fight -- they say the enemy had 20000 men there while we had but 1800. I do not want anything now except another flannel shirt & you need not send that unless I send for it. You may send me 3 collars & my wollen vest if you have a chance. I saved a plenty of socks & drawers & got a new pair of shoes & shall get an overcoat from the pub. stores I shall write to you often & when I know what I shall do myself I will tell you what to do. I am acting as the Adjutant of our Regt. now -- The stage goes in a few minutes -- I am getting used to sleeping on the floor &c write often I get all the news by Nat. Tyler Ed. of the Enquirer Love to all my sweet wife & kiss the babies for me.
