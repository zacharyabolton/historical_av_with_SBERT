I hope you did not freeze last night -- it was a stinger -- woollen blankets alone saved me -- & then I had to find the warm side of them several times -- I dreamed of you -- Capt. Sole goes down this morning & offers to take my satchel so I send it -- I will have to put off my coming to the week of the S.S. Convention -- for I cannot come next Sat. & then too -- I had made arrangements for you to come here a week -- thinking the fine weather would last & then come down with me -- Col. Harman said he would give you a free ticket & if it moderates & gets warm again I wish you would see if you cannot get someone to stay with the children -- & you come up here for a week, by way of variety & then go back when I go. The prospect now is that W. W. Walker a stump speaker, M. E. Preacher, Ci devant Prof. &c from Westmoreland Co. may be elected Supt. as a reward for party services -- Ruffner went down last night & wanted me to go & I had a ticket offered me but did not think it would pay considering the exposure after so much warm weather -- If you can come write to me & send down to Capt. Sole to the Va. Hotel & he will send the stage for you & arrange all -- . I have only a moment to write -- Nelly's letter came & I will reply -- Love in abundance for you all -- Don't expose yourself
