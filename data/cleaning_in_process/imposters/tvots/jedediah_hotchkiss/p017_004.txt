We met the enemy yesterday at Wilderness Run, the boundary between Orange and Spotsylvania & repulsed them from three desperate attacks, taking some 1300 prisoners & 3 pieces of Artillery, by our corps -- our loss was quite heavy of course, having Gen. Jones killed, Gen. Stefford mortally wounded &c &c. the 2nd Corps fought them some 5 miles S. W. of us on the plank road -- we on the same old turnpike that passes through Chancellorsville. Sedgwick's Corps was in front on one side. Burnsides crossed to our front late yesterday, & today we expect the most terrible battle we have ever had -- God be praised for our success & with his help we have to do even better today -- all things are ready for it. I am still unhurt but very tired. The field of the [unclear: damage] is an awful one -- Good bye & God bless you
