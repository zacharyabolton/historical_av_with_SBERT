I wrote to you the day we left Winchester & enclosed some Ribbons for the children & one or two other things -- I have not heard from you for some days but knowing that you will hear all kinds of stories & will be anxious to hear the truth I will write again, though briefly -- We came back here on Saturday the enemy advancing in force to the vicinity of Strasburg but halting to deliberate as soon as they found we had reached a place where we intended to fight them & since then they have been lying on the banks of Cedar Creek, 3 miles beyond Strasburg & we on the banks of Tumbling Run 2 miles this side of S.-g with an occasional forward movement of Cavalry & skirmishers first on one side & then on the other, with no results -- We have been having a signal station on the end of Massanutten Mt. above Strasburg -- yesterday the enemy sent up 60 men to capture it, but our men got away & we sent up a company of sharpshooters & drove them away, capturing three & killing two of them, with no loss to us -- today they have sent up again & we have sent to dislodge them -- that & some little skirmishing is all that breaks the monotony of staying out here all day in the sun & dust awaiting the advance of the enemy, or for "something to turn up" -- -- it is verytiresome, but I suppose will not last longer than today, for Anderson with Longstreet's Corps, reaches Front Royal this morning & Fitz Lee is already there, so we will soon be in Condition to assume the offensive again & start Sheridan, who now commands the "Yanks" here, on the track so well beaten by Banks, Fremont, Shields, Milroy, & Crooks & Co. We just got a letter from Mosby in which he says he fell on the enemy's train day before yesterday at Berryville & Captured & destroyed 75 wagons, got some 200 prisoners & some 600 mules & horses & killed a good many & also he fell on a scouting party that was going to Culpeper & routed them capturing & killing a good many, Mosby is certainly one of the bravest spirits we have -- quiet & modest, a fine looking fellow, but always in motion & reaping a rich harvest of spoils -- William & Sam. Chapman are both captains in his command -- & are highly esteemed by him, I understand --  We had a little rain last night & it is pleasanter today than heretofore -- it has been intensely hot -- but we have managedto stand it so far -- & if we can whip the force that is now before us it will be a fine thing for the country. I think, as heretofore, that this campaign will go far to end the war & do not think there will be much if any fighting after this campaign. No doubt the entire army will be here before long & the field of battle be transferred to the Banks of the Potomac or North of it. Grant was at Harper's Ferry a few days ago & is, no doubt, trying to get away from Richmond as best he can -- I got a very fine young horse in Maryland, it only cost me $100. in Confederate money, as Gen. Early let us have horses at the cost price there, paying in Confederate money the value fixed on them in Federal -- it was a good thing for me & will enable me to sell one of my horses & help to get along &c whenever Charley gets in order I want to sell him if horses command a good price I hope there may be some cessation of active operations so I may get home for a few days early in Sept -- My shirts are getting somewhat worse for wear & I think I shall try to buy some ready made ones if we get where there are any, I believe white ones do as well as any others in the army & they usually last longer -- I do not think it best to have any pants made of my cloth just now -- if you have not done anything to them just keep the cloth safely -- I will do all I can for your memoranda bless your dear little heart I wish you had all the things you want I hope Parkins carried up the box of cups & saucers & that you have gotten it by this time. Write me how the children like the books -- I sent them &c &c Write me my love -- I know you have hard times this hot weather & wish I could be at home to attend to affairs but be of good cheer -- all will yet be well -- Love & kisses & blessings for you all --
