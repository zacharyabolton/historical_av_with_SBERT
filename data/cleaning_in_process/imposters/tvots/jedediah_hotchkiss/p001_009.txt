I must now go to my cold bed -- and wake up cold in the morning -- the worst part of camp life -- but I can stand it, and will not complain, when thousands are worse off than I am -- I was going to say infinitely -- I write to Nelson to have some meal & hominy ground -- It don't matter much abut the hominy if not easily procured -- May the God of peace be with you all & bless you -- Good night, my love -- pleasant dreams to you & refreshing slumbers --
