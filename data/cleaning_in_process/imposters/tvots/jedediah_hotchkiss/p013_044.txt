I must write to you again upon the eve of an expected battle, that must be one of the most sanguinary of the whole war -- The enemy commenced crossings at an early hour this morning, lower down the river than before, about a mile & they had quite a fight with our picket there & captured a company by flanking them -- we opposed them & opened some artillery on them with marked effects keeping them back under the cover of the bank, but this shore is commanded by the other & as soon as the fog cleared away we retired to our old position & they have been massing troops in our front all day -- & had over 20,000, over, at dark, and will probably get most of their army over during the night -- and tomorrow, O! tomorrow, Death will hold high carnival -- but I am sure, with God's blessing, we shall whip them -- they made a demonstration also up in Culpeper, as if they thought of advancing towards Richmond by two routes -- I think we have men enough for them & they are all in fine spirits -- they cheered Gen. Jackson heartily as he rode along the lines - - he sent his wife back to the Junction this morning -- she has only been a week with him -- enjoying the bliss of conjugal affection & he especially delighted as a father -- I did not call to see her -- expecting to do so today -- she is about your size, perhaps a little taller, and slenderly formed -- I do not expect to be about much in the fight tomorrow, as there are enough to carry orders, unless something should happen to others, when I shall take the place of some of them -- but it is somewhat remarkable that not one of Gen. Jackson's Staff has ever been wounded seriously -- his prayers are a safe shield -- & he prays much for his own military family -- I shall send you some money $50, in a day or so, as soon as the month ends, and I want you to buy all the meat you want, cost what it may & anything else you need -- what is money good for if not for buying what we want -- I can get the money to buy Lindsey's place & think I shall buy it -- it can do no harm -- for it is worth what he asks for it, and if you prefer staying where you are I can rent it, but it is so much more convenient, water, wood &c and then you are not off so by yourself -- Mr Earitt is in hearing distance -- &c &c -- you do not say what you think of it since you have heard the price -- I want to write to Mr. C. Bear to condole with them for the loss of Willie, but they should not mourn -- he was taken away before "the cares of this world" had damaged the purity of his character or contaminated the well of goodness that in him was an ever flowing fountain -- and he has been transferred to Heaven while his ardor for truth, purity & goodness was in its prime. -- and of him I can say, as much as of any one I ever had as a pupil, that of him I knew no guile -- peace to his memory he is one of the blessed martyrs in the cause of liberty -- he has gained by his exchange of worlds -- & though they "miss him at home" let them remember that "a correspondence fixed with Heaven is aye a noble anchor."  I am sorry you had such a time with Nelly after she ate alum -- she should not eat anything unless you tell her she may --   I would like to see you all so much -- and I do pray earnestly that we may soon be able to end this war and that I may again return to the bosom of my family -- I know you pray so too --  I feel hopeful for the morrow & will write to you after it has passed --  Love & kisses for you all -- Write soon -- excuse brevity -- we breakfast at 3 tomorrow & I must sleep -- God bless you --
