The Yankees have just gotten over the river again -- after 4 days fighting one of the most severe & bloody battles of the war in which our loss has been very heavy as could have been expected -- while the enemy's has been much greater & he has been completely beaten -- in his own chosen & fortified position his forces routed & demoralized & the boasted "fighting Joe" taught that human efforts are unavailing when in a wrong cause -- I am thankful to the Almighty that he has spared my life through the many dangers of these horrible days -- while we have to mourn the loss of so many loved ones -- our hero General lost one arm & had a ball shot through his other hand, and he is lost to our country for a considerable time -- but is doing well & I hope will soon be out again -- but my tent mate -- my amiable friend Boswell is no more -- he fell, struck in the heart, by two balls & I buried him on Sunday evening, as the moon rose, in a soldier's grave -- with many tears & a feeling prayer by Mr. Lacy -- poor Boswell --  The battle took place some 10 miles above Fredericksburg -- We turned the enemys flank & took them in the rear before they knew it & fell on them with great force -- our loss all told has been some 8 or 10,000 -- & the enemys not less than 15000 & we have taken 5 or 6,000 prisoners Gen. Paxton was killed & J. Addison Bell -- what an affliction for his poor mother & father -- They seem to lose a son in every battle -- they enemy's raid did not do much harm & our R. R is again in order -- Hooker made a speech here before the battle & told his men that he had Lee surrounded, had cut off his communication & he had but one days rations & must surrender or starve -- but we did neither -- We have had a severe time, fought in the dense woods & could not do much in the way of pursuing the enemy -- but had to drive them by inches as it were. Hooker had 5 Army Corps, over 100000 men -- I have been up day & night, a good share of the time & am not in a condition to write much -- but will write soon --   Good by & God bless you all
