I wrote to you a few days ago -- the evening before we started dow the Valley -- I now write again from the same old camp -- We went down to Newtown -- drove the Yankee Cavalry away from Middletown -- found them fortified at Newtown -- made some demonstrations -- Our Cavalry on the "Back Road" -- three regiments -- were attacked by Custers Division of the Yankee Cavalry & driven back several miles -- we then brought up the rest of Rosser's Division & fell on the flank of the Yankee Div. & routed it & drove it over 3 miles, scattering it in every direction & capturing over 200 prisoners & holding our first position -- in the meantime another body of Yankee Cavalry attacked McCausland's Brigade of Cavalry at Cedarville, in the Front Royal Road & he drove them back, they came again & he drove them back & supposing they would not come on again he was grazing his horses, when they got reinforced & came on again & found him unprepared & drove him back several miles & got 2 pieces of artillery from him -- he lost about 100 men -- all told we skirmished some with the Yankees on Saturday then fell back that night to Fisher's Hill, then came back here yesterday -- We went to find whether Sheridan was still in the Lower Valley & found him with his whole force & strongly entrenched - we got the late papers & found that Lincoln was elected -- by a large majority -- the Yankees are rebuilding the Winchester R. R. & fixing to have winter uqarters in the Lower Valley -- . I got chance to sketch the line of battle &c at Cedar Creek William came to me at Fisher's Hill - got back here when I expected -- I got your letter, & Maj. Bells about Green's baggage, but found no letter from Mrs. Butcher in the coat pocket -- you certainly did not put it in -- send it to me & I will attend to it -- her funds were not lost by the burning of the bank's money. Col. Smith has come up here as Chief Engineer of the Army -- just the news I want here & he tells me that the Chf. Eng. will give me the highest civil appointment in his power & a salary of $4000 a year -- he cannot commission me because I am from Virginia -- they all make such a fuss about appointments from Virginia -- that will be better than I expected & I shall be very much gratified by it -- & hope soon to get the appointment -- say nothing about it -- I am glad you got some wood & hope you will have enough until I can get you more -- I suppose our winter quarters will be some where in Rockingham -- if so I shall get mine at or near home -- at least in Staunton -- won't that be good -- then I can get home at least once a week -- hope you are not going to have the rheumatism. I can let you have my two smaller flannels (shirts) as I have two others in my box in Staunton & you had better use them -- Mr. R's things were all right -- I sent you $20. in my last. I send you $20. in this also. -- & I will try & supply your wants -- the Q M. has no money now or I would send a larger amount -- but will keep sending -- You say you got your 4 th  bbl. of flour -- & do not see where the 5 th  is to come from -- I engaged from Sieg Trimble, Hanger, & Geeding & you got one from Smith through Glossbrenner I thought -- that makes 5. I want to provide for being at home some during the winter -- Mr. Seig is also to have some potatoes for us -- I sent to Md. for the articles Miss Kate wants -- Put me up some pickles & things & buy some apple butter if you can if you have none to spare. I shall be after my meds chest again in due time -- I shall not draw on your resources though as heretofore -- things are too scarce -- but then your storehouse always seems to yield something -- & I have unbounded faith in it -- It has been bitter cold & I found my blanket a great comfort I tell you -- The new coat fits finely -- only I did not mean to have it sent here -- Many thanks for the chestnuts to Nelly and Anne & the 3 apples -- Heaven bless you all I am glad your pest is gone -- All things "work together for good" Write soon
