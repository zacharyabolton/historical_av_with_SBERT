We have now been a week on the war path -- fighting more or less every day, & still the horrid work goes on -- thru the heat & dust of this dry "spell."  We fought the enemy, with varying success, but the results of advantage were only until Saturday night -- then the enemy left the vicinity of the Wilderness & moved further down the river & of course we followed on parallel roads, Keeping ourselves between him & Richmond & skirmishing as we went on -- cavalry performed prodigies of valor, fighting stubbornly, every advance of the foe & losing heavily -- Ab. Hanna was killed, Bumgardner wounded, a young McCourt killed &c &c -- our advance met that of the enemy at Spotsylvania C. H. & drove it back in confusion on Sunday -- Monday we skirmished with them on opposite sides of the Ny, holding them in check everywhere -- yesterday the enemy made constant & heavy attacks all along our line, attempting to take some of our positions 8 or 9 times & late in the evening, by missing 3 divisions charging down on one line, they broke it and captured the line of breastworks passing over Doles' & part of the Stonewall & Daniel's Brigades but Gen. Walker gallantly brought in the rest of the old stonewall & drove them out aided by Battles Brigade, the enemy again & again attempted to take the position with a fire of death perfectly terriffic, but all in vain & though we lost many our line stood firm & by God's blessing, the battle was not to the strong alone --. in themean time Gen. Early, in command of 2 divisions of Hill's Corps, flanked the enemy's right & came down on them in Jackson style, carrying 3 lines of the entrenchments & driving them a mile & a half, the fighting kept up until in the night -- I never heard heavier firing & of course we have to mourn the loss of many brave men -- Gen. Lee was in the midst of it cheering on our men. Col. Higginbotham of the 26 th  Va was killed. In the previous fight Thos. Reeves was killed. Yesterday Capt. Turner of our staff was severly wounded in both legs -- Capt. Ister was wounded -- The enemy had over 15000 wounded in Fredericksburg day before yesterday & they had their negro brigade there -- some of their cavalry got through our lines and went in to the Central R. R. & did some damage, but I heard that they were captured The enemy was handsomely repulsed below Richmond by Bushrod and Johnson & we hear cheering news from Western Va -- . Mosby has broken the Orange &  R. R -- the enemy now communicates by the Acquia Cr Rd. Grant fights stubbornly & keeps butting his head against our breastworks & is getting it badly bruised. We have been eminently successful & have abundant cause for thankfulness. I am in good health & getting along very well & hope you are all getting along well. Be of good cheer & may the Lord bless you -- Love for you all
