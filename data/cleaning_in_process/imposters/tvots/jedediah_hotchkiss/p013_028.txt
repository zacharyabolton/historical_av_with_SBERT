I wrote you a few lines the other day when I received your welcome letter, but promised that should not be a bar to my writing agian today, as usual, so I am now prompt to fulfill my agreement, and you must credit me largely for doing just what you desire. I suppose I write to you today for the last time from this place, for orders are out for us to move, at dawn tomorrow, to a new camp, just in the rear of the last battlefield, 8 miles up the river from here, and we shall go unless this storm, that has opened upon us today, with thunder and lightning, rain, hail and sleet; shall continue with too much fury. We have been here just three months, a long time, but how speedily it has gone, inaction has made it seem short, not like the month, yea year long weeks of the busy summer that preceded this long rest, now, alas! again to be broken by a repetition of the same sufferings, privations and bloody battles that marked the previous Spring, Summer & Fall, I was going to add, Winter; for the last battle was almost mid-December. Activity must soon succeed to this quiet and the storm, the tempest & the hurricane of war begin to rage again -- O when will it cease, when shall the plowshare of death give way to that of life & the land enjoy its now desecrated Sabbaths once more. God grant to shorten these days before we all perish -- You ask me what I think of the signs of the times -- Speaking from the outward & human appearance they are gloomy and portentious enough, to us: the whole sky is blackend by the prodigies War has conjured up, with aid of its sister furies Pestilence & Famine, and only evil seems to threaten us, but it was even so one year ago, the same gloom palled our land and the same spirits of evil were everywhere brooding over it, but we bowed humbly before our God & confessed our sins as a nation, we girded up ourselves as men, and lo they all passed away and "the winter of our discontent" became a glorious summer of rejoicing, crowned by a plenteous harvest time of farms and blessings -- so may it be again, yea I am confident it so will be --  "Indulge not the Lord by feeble sins  But trust him for his grace  Behind a frowning Providence  He hides a smiling face." I have always found Him "a very present help in time of need & so I trust he will continue to be to our land and nation as he has been to it in times gone by -- but not remote.  So let us take courage and be of good cheer for the Lord of Hosts is our helper & we will not fear what [unclear: waits us] can do How the storm is raging! the hail and rain are pouring down on my canvass roof and a chilly dampness attests the penetrating effect of this moistened atmosphere -- all seems gloomy & cheerless, dark and disagreeable, but tomorrow morning may and likely will, find the sun streaming thorugh the dissipating vapors & cheering us with a spring morning -- thus, ever, it happens with human things -- as you wrote me, in halcyon days of the now long ago that "every cloud has its silver lining", so let us reflect that "joy cometh in the morning" and "fear no danger", trusting to Him that is mightier than the mightiest. We have had a very good place here, the climate has been mild, though damp, and we have had a good degree of health and comfort here and I can but think Providence wisely ordered that McClellan should leave the Valley & we follow him and find our winter quarters nearer the sea & in a milder climate. Things have changed much since we came here, one large forest covered the crest of the chain of hills running along from one to two miles from the river, and stretched back for nearly a mile and in the edge of this forest, peeping out towards the river, were the baronial, almost, mansions of the old F.F.Vs of "The Northern Neck", but we have had our camps along these hilltops, and the trees have disappeared & houses that never looked at each other in the almost century they have been standing stare each other impudently in the face -- having barely the trees that surround them left to tell of the lordly race from whose destructions they are spared -- so it is here -- but across the river they too are gone and whatever new generation shall live in that land they cannot say they sit under the trees their fathers planted -- We pay nearly One Hundred thousand Dollars for damages to the farms on which we have encamped & from that you may form some idea of the "abomination of desolation" an army produces -- Boswell has sent after a servant and when it comes I shall try and send William up to help make garden & he will make Allen help him & so push it along -- I hope Nelson has found some one to buy the farm -- if I could only get away for some two weeks I think I might find a purchaser, but it of no use to ask now -- for the days of activity are coming one and we must work -- besides I do not wish to do anything that might lead to a loss of my place with Gen. J. for then I should be compelled to join some company and serve there, or only be detailed on a private's pay -- Gen. Jackson wants me commissioned & I may get so by the application I have made, but so many appointments have been made from Va -- that it is next to impossible to get any one appointed from that state -- as it is I am here by Gen. Lee's orders & so far all is right, but the officers at Richmond are doing all they can to get every one into the ranks that is not commissioned -- but I do not fear -- my services are needed here -- they are appreciated by those I am with and I have to well committed the lesson "Learn to labor and to wait" to forget it at this time -- so I may not absent myself much as I desire to close my business matters, but I shall press them up as much as I can - - Be of good cheer my love & pray for a shortening of these days of separation & may God bless you in all blessings -- Write very soon -- we have no news -- Love for you all --
