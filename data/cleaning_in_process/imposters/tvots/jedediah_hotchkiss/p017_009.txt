Yesterday we had a terriffic battle from 4 AM to 3 P. M. the hardest of the war the enemy under cover of a dense fog came in our line at 4 AM & broke it & captured 20 pieces of Arty -- we drove them back & fought them all day -- repulsed every attack & are still masters of our position -- We lost heavily in Killed wounded & prisoners but are still in good condition & they have done the best they could -- two of the Bell boys were killed -- Gen. Wilkes had his arm broken & Gen. Johnson was captured -- the result of the dense fog whichcoverd the first attack of at least 30000 men on one point -- we gained every advantage after that & have great case for gratitude as Grant threw his whole force upon our corps -- We drove them away & a mile from our right -- Grant tried to break our center. It rained nearly all day but the fight was continued -- One of Rodes' staff & one of Early's was killed -- Mrs. Wise's son was well last night -- I came by his battery after the fight -- [unclear: I am] well  haste
