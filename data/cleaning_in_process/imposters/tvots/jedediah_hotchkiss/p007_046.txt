A thousand thanks for the favors sent -- I send you a piece of cheese & sugar -- I shall get a furlough as soon as Maj. Reger returns & come home for a few days -- have not time to write -- was too busy as we had a change of rulers & new orders to attend to -- will write more tomorrow -- we are getting along finely -- Keep up good cheer & all will be well -- I have the rank & pay of Captain & not half the cares & very little risk from exposure -- Good bye -- love & kisses [unclear: for] the babies --
