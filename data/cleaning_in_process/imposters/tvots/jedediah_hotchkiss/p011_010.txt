We are now encamped some four miles North of Gordonsville, in Orange Co, on the waters of the Rapidan, in a very pleasant rolling country, on the slopes of the South West Mountain, in full view of the Blue Ridge, that reminds us of our homes, the General says, and on the road leading from Gordonsville, through Madison C.H. and on to New Market, in a very pleasant region, where we have an abundance of good water, and where our worn out and exhausted men can be refreshed after the toils and dangers of the Richmond fight -- So much for our locality -- a very good one I may add -- now the next question you will propose will be how long we are going to stay here, and where are we going to &c I can only say the General has fixed the camps so that our men can drill and has selected a quiet & nice place for Hd. Qrs. with much care and that we have quietly pitched our tents and gone to work on our maps, so it looks as though we might stay here for some days at least. The Yankees picked themselves up yesterday and left Madison C. H. and the vicinity of the Rapidan and retired beyond Culpeper C. H. having, no doubt, got notice that Jackson was moving towards them, and Pope, after all his boasting, is none too eager, I will warrant, to meet the victor of many fights.  My clothes came to me on Sunday, quite unexpectedly, but very acceptably, though I was disappointed in not finding a letter in them -- for I wrote from Staunton and also the day I got to Gordonsville -- but I suppose you overworked yourself fixing up my clothes and had no time to write --. I will write again soon -- Direct to Gen. Jackson's Hd. Qrs. near Gordonsville. I am very well. May God bless you all -- write very soon
