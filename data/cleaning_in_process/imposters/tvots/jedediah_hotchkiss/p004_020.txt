I have taken the liberty of making you one of my references. I hope you will heartily concur in it, and give us your influence. I have sent some one or two circulars to gentlemen in your neighborhood, and I enclose two which you will please give to any one that has sons to educate. I hear that you are getting along well in Lovingston, and I am heartily glad of it, for you deserve to do well. We are having very warm weather here just now, and very dry. The Major is dealing quite largely in cattle, but is not doing very well with them, I am sorry for he is a good fellow, and needs to do well If you come over to the Valley you must call and see us. I got an injunction in my Brodt suit, and a new trial. Could you send us one of your sons? My kind regards to your lady--
