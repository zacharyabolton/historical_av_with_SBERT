I am here a few moments today -- am quite well & we are getting along well -- are fighting Grant some 10 miles from Richmond. Poor Col. Willis of the 12th Ga. was mortally wounded yesterday in a small fight that we had. -- I suppose the big battle will come off soon -- I am very anxious to hear from you -- God bless & Keep you all -- in great haste --
