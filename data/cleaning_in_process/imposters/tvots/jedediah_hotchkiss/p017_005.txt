We have had another day of fighting and now, at 5 A.M. today, it has begun again. The enemy made an attack yesterday at 5 A. M all along our lines, sending up four solid lines against our front -- but we repulsed them handsomely, with tremendous loss to them & not much to us except in officers -- it is thought we killed & wounded ten times as many of them as they did of us -- we drove off all their attacks on our line every where & were masters of the position -- We captured 2 Brigadiers just at dark, one of them Seymour that commanded at [unclear: Aluster] & they were here last night. Col. Warren of the 10th was killed - Capt. Wilson, Danl Wilson's son, was wounded in the leg -- not a very bad one -- . Col. Thompson Brown was killed -- our loss in privates quite small -- Longstreet gave them a good dose on our night surge think the Yankees are leaving -- but I think not, for they have a large army -- have soked it up from every direction & have staked all on the issue of this battle -- they burned Orange C. H a few days ago -- the scoundrels -- Gen. Lee led a gallant charge yesterday -- he praises the counduct of our Corps much -- we have our Army closed up & can make a fine fight with God's blessing -- Many of our men have not beeen engaged yet. Love and Kisses for you & the children & may God bless you -- write to me -- in haste
