The stage is now going & I only write for fear you did not get my letter from Yeager's saying I was &c -- We got here last night -- shamefully hurried on -- a disgraceful retreat, but the loss will be regained -- the men came in slowly, but will most of them get here I think & our loss will not be much. There is a large body of troops here now & I hear that orders have been issued for going back -- & I am glad of it -- our Col. has not come yet -- I led out the men on one side -- I got drawers, coat & socks in Beverly, took them from the public stores just before the enemy came in -- I only need 2 shirts -- but you need not send me anything now -- I will send you the money tomorrow to get some grey cloth for a pair of pants -- I do not want anything sent now. As I wrote before, only [unclear: Wymont] & Jas Wilson are missing of the Cavalry & they are thought to be killed surely. The rest of the Augusta men escaped safely -- I got yours of the 19th last night -- made me feel happy -- hope you are all well -- love to all Kiss the children -- Pa often wants to be with them & ma -- I am now entirely at sea & do not know what I shall do -- All the Augusta Militia will be here tomorrow I will write again -- God bless you -- Did you get the $5 I sent you -- Write to me here -- I have had no time to write & am pretty much used up after a retreat of 60 miles day & night -- but got cleaned up last night & slept well -- I will write to Nelson too if we stay here at all
