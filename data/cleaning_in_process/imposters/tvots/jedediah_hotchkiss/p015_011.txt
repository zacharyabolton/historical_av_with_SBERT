I have not heard from you but once since the one joyful day I spent at home & feel uneasy at your unusual delay, but think the excitement that has been in the Valley may have prevented, in fact unfitted you, for anything but care for the passing hour -- I suppose the danger of an invasion of our quiet home has passed away & I thank God for it, & you are saved from the presence of our cruel enemy. It is Sunday morning, we have had a sermon, a morning lesson, from Habakkuk & all but myself have gone over to the churches, I remain to attend to anything that may need attention, but all is quiet & in war we are almost in profound peace -- in fact too much of ordinary life is becoming a part of our camp life, and the tendency to amusements is far to prevalent fortimes like these. But there are two sides to this question & much philosophy & some Scripture in the song "Let the wide world wag as it will, We'll be gay & happy still" & the text "There is a time for all things" & "There is nothing better than for a man to eat & drink & enjoy the good of his labor". The Fast day was well & solemnly observed, but yesterday there was a gay picnic, with music & dancing, at Gen. Johnson's Hd. Qrs. -- to which all the officers of the Division & the Corps Hd. Qrs. were invited, all but two or three went from here -- I did not feel like going -could not think so much gaiety right, though I am fond of rational amusements & like the cheerful phase of things. I have been very busy & have much to do just now, as the surveys of the country, from the parties in the field are coming in & I am making copies so we may have a set of accurate maps for our use & this long rest is a perfect harvest time for business, & I cannot now see my leaving time, but shall obtain it before the winter that I mayprepare for it for you, & have things comfortable fixed up -- (D. V.) Mr. Lacy recd a few days ago a box of the nice English Bibles & Testaments procured by Dr. Haze & I got a set of the Gospels, four pretty little volumes, in flexible black covers, beautifully printed, for Nelly, as she is learning the Scriptures, they are very pretty every way & then the dear child can have the satisfaction of learning a whole volume -- I shall send them when I can safely & I have another set which I shall keep a volume of at a time to read, but send the others to you, in charge for my darling little Anna, whenever she shall begin to learn the Scriptures & I have a nice Nonpareil Testament for My Dear Little Wife, which I think she will like, it is small & plain, clearly printed & has a soft & pleasant cover & I think will add a new pleasure to the reading of the Sacred Volume she loves so well --The weather has been quite cold for several days & I slept cold last night for the first time in a long while, but such is a soldier's life. I have a copy of the Life of Jackson, which I wish to send to you though it is not very good & not very entertaining to us that have read the living Man -- yet it has in it much to interest others -- Gen. Lee is still in Richmond, maturing something I suppose & the cool weather will invite to action & soon the horrid carnage of the battle will disquiet the eye & sicken the heart. "O when will man cease to do evil? & when, O Lord! will Thy kingdom come & Thy will be done on earth as in Heaven -- I heard Harman wish to go home to-day & infer that his wife is in an interesting condition -- Mrs. Ewell is still here, but do not think her presence is very good for the Old gent -- so says the Dr -- the "bold, bad man" as our Capt. Johnson says --  I have no news my Dear -- my letter is very dull & I am rather stupid myself so this letter will only be like opening the door & looking at you, or rather letting you look at me & then bowing myself out. Write to me, my Love, if only a little & asking for "Heavenly blessings without Number" for all my little home circle, I will say good- bye
