 I have not had time to write to you since I got back -- for the Gen. started me at 1 o'clk the night I got back, for the top of [unclear: Peaked] Mt -- to observe the movements of the enemy about Harrisonburg & then I got back as the Staff started up towards here and since then have been busy all the time, with a whole Regiment of men, mending the worst road I ever saw in the Valley of Va -- we made miles of corduroy road. The whole army is up here now & on the way to Mechum's river, over the Ridge up the Va. C.R.R. and and I think we will come from there to Staunton, but do not know -- we left Ewell's whole army at Conrad's Store -- he came up as we left -- I must close for the courier is going -- I am perfectly well & hope you all are Just got 2 letters of yrs & Hamilton's -- Good bye & God bless you
