I wrote you a brief note, yesterday, telling you of our victories and that I was well, and this evening I will write you more fully, after a day of enjoyment in which I wish you could have participated & enjoyed some of the good things they left behind in their hasty retreat -- delicacies of every kind, in getting up which the Yankee nation seems to have surpassed itself -- But to begin, I will not say at the beginning for that would embrace thirty days -- but after the battle of Kernstown, on the 23rd of March, and briefly relate the movements by which we got Winchester and drove the haughty & insolent foe back from our Valley -- From the 23rd of March to the 18th of April we slowly retired before the superior numbers of the enemy, resisting his advance at every favorable spot, and only moving back when he came on in force, and, finally, when we reached Harrisonburg, by leaving the main road and throwing ourselves into a defensible mountain pass near to the forces of Gen. Ewell, we prevented the advance of Banks upon Staunton & put ourselves in a position where our movements could be concealed, we were there until the 30th of April, showing resistance down the river, below us & also towards the enemy's front at Harrisonburg, completely [unclear: puzzing] everyone in regard to our movements, on the 30th Gen. Ewell & his army moved up to Conrad's store and we moved off to Port Republic, the force at Conrad's Store being still about the same, so Banks thought it was all there still, then on the 3rd of May we crossed over the Blue Ridge, and Banks heard that we had gone to Richmond, but the force still there i.e. at Conrad's [unclear: puzzed] him the more then we rapidly crossed back to Staunton and on to North Mountain & pushed back the forces of Milroy & fought the bloody battle of Bull Pasture Mountain & drove Milroy, demoralized, back to Franklin & by leaving the Valley made Banks think we had run away from him to carry on the war in Western Va, then he moved back to New Market for fear we wd. fall on his flank, but let Shields go away to Fredericksburg to join McDowell, supposing, no doubt, that Jackson was too far off to get back soon to his front, but was completely deluded by the appearance of Cavalry all along the Mt. coming to the conclusion that Jackson was at Brock's Gap, Jackson having, by the move westward, divided Bank's forces, at once moved rapidly to New Market and making a demonstration towards Wood-stock as if he intended to go that way, he suddenly sent the forces of Gen. Ewell, which had been concealed by the movements of Cavalry, towards Front Royal, preceded by a large body of Cavalry, which place they reached on Friday and by a sudden attack drove out the forces of the enemy there, captured a large amount of valuable stores, about 1000 prisoners, two locomotives and trains of cars, the stores worth from one to two hundred thousand dollars. The regiment that made the attack on our side was the First Maryland, and the one that it attacked was the 1st Yankee Maryland, neighbor against neighbor, ours took the flag of the other & then the Louisiana Tigers joined in the pursuit and followed them so closely that they could not burn the bridge behind them though they got it on fire, and when some attempted to escape on the train to Strasburg the found that Ashby had been sent across the country to our left and had after a hot engagement, in which Capts. Shotts, Fletcher & other gallant men of ours were killed, drove away the force of the enemy at Buckton Station, between Front Royal and Strasburg and torn up the track and cut the wire before the attack at Front Royal, so when the train ran up that way it found the track up and came back to find us hotly pressing behind, so there was no alternative but to flee towards Newtown, 14 miles distant, which began at about 6 P.M. and then the splendid cavalry Regiments, two, some 1000 men under the command of Gen. Steuart, charged after them like a whirlwind, capturing wagon after wagon, loaded with valuable baggage ammunition, them horses that had been cut loose and squad after squad & company after company of men, officers & all, until some wearied out by the hot pursuit, halted behind a fence and buildings, and, in the darkness, poured a deadly volley into our men, but, though some 10 or 12 were killed or badly wounded, there was no halt, but with uplifted sabres our men rushed upon the ambuscaders, over the fences, and scattered them to the four winds, causing many of them to bite the dust, and inflicting horrible wounds upon others, there a perfect stampede of them occurred in every direction, seeking to escape from the dreaded "horse & his rider", but in vain, and hundreds of them were captured that night and the next morning they were brought in from all sides by men women & even servants, (what few were left, for many preceded them in their flight and we captured many of them.) The spoils were large embracing 2 pieces of artillery and about 800 stand of arms -- all the field and staff officers were taken -- We desisted from the pursuit and rested after midnight, but at an early hour the next morning, the 24th, the forces were in motion, moving on the road as if going to Newtown, but about 11 o'clk the Gen. started me on the road towards Middletown and Strasburg to find where the enemy was, I soon started up a picket, that fired into us, (some 20 Cavalry and myself), which I reported to the Gen. and he sent up some infantry of the 8thLa. Regt to aid me, which we threw out as skirmishers and pushed on through the woods, and drove to the enemys picket, and found that they must have a force in that direction, the Gen. then sent up Col. Ashby with cavalry and flying artillery and we moved them up rapidly, reaching to near the McAdamized Road, when we discovered a body of Cavalry massed before a church in Middletown, and saw their trains moving up the road, previously we were informed by the Gen. that Gen. Ewell had gone to near Newtown with with a portion of the army, thus protecting our right flank -- as soon as the shell fell away the Yankee cavalry they began a stampede, and as there was a Regt of some 700 hundred they filled the road for some distance, the companies of the 8 La. moved promply forward and just gained the crest of a low ridge, along one side of which the road ran, as the cavalry passed, and poured into them a deadly volley, and such a tumbling of men and horses, as the General afterwards remarked, "it looked too bad to see so many of them disposed of at once", the artillery was at once brought up and thundered on the retreating line and Ashby and his cavalry dashed rapidly forward to a turn in the road and cut off those still going on, and captured the train of several regiments, any number of sutler's wagons, loaded with every luxury, and hundreds of men and [unclear: richly]  horses -- the pride of the Yankee army, it's superbly mounted Vermont, N.Y. & Pa. Cavalry, that had exultingly and insolently rode over our Valley, was melted like snow before the sun, and the road, for miles, strewn with the choicest of viands & most valuable of goods. I am not vindictive, but I really did not feel sorry to see the horse & his insolent rider laid low, it seemed a just retribution for the evils they had inflicted on an innocent people.  We had by this move cut off the rear guard, two regiments, of the enemy at Strasburg, and we turned towards them, when they set the bridge on fire, across Cedar Creek, set fire to their stores in Strasburg, and then commenced throwing shells at us, but we soon stopped them and they started in flight, but we could not cross to pursue them, so we could only drive the from their baggage a distance, and then start, at about 5 P.M. with our whole force, save one Regiment, towards Winchester, and lustily did the Regiments from that part of the state cheer when they were ordered towards their homes, then commenced one of the movements in which Gen. Jackson shows forth his iron will, he wished to reach Winchester, on the hills West of it, before the next morning, and he was now 12 miles off, after a march of 12 miles, and it soon became evident that the foe intended to dispute his progress, for they began, soon, a heavy fire of artillery at our advance, from every hill top, made a stand near Newtown and drew up in line of battle trying to turn our flank, but we drove them from that at about dark, capturing many more wagons, then they began to burn up their train, loads of every thing, rice, sugar, bacon &c, and 6 long boats intended for a pontoon bridge and, by the light of these, they fought us with desperation for miles ambuscaded and fired upon our men from behind walls and from thickets, but still Jackson's iron will was bent on attaining a certain point and he rooted them from every strong hold, resting not through the long and wery night, driving them across the bloody field of Kernstown and, early on the morning of the 25th he drove them from the hills before Winchester, and aided by Ewell on his right, who had moved along in that position, he poured a deadly fire into them, and when Banks attempted to retake the hills he met such a storm of leaden hail from the "Stonewall Brigade and our other gallant troops that, though he fought well, and we even ordered up reinforcements, at that moment the intrepid leader, in front, amid the roar of musketry and artillery, devoutly raised his hands to heaven, as if for Divine aid, when the enemy's line wavered, fell back, and fled, "now" says the General, "swinging his plain grey cap, Let's shout, and at his shout up went that of the host with him and all dashed forward in pursuit, the day was won, and through the streets of Winchester we pursued the foe that had gloried in its pride and power but two short days before, amid the huzzas, shouts, tears, thanks, looks of unutterable delight, waving of Confederate flags & handkerchiefs of its whole liberated population and by the crackling of the flames where the vandal foe had set on fire the very center of the town where his stores were, piles of shells that would have blown the town to atoms, it was a proud entry, and through we went, the sons of Winchester in the lead deling death to the foe at every corner and when we reached the other side of the town, the General, now thoroughly aroused, turned and said "Order the whole army to press on to the Potomac," and on it came, and on sped the foe and after them we hurled shot, shell and iron hail, for miles, until the General ordered our men to halt, and the cavalry to be brought up to pursue, he then turned to go back to meet the cavalry, passing along through our 3 united armies, who had had eagerly sought the ordered rest after 40 hours of exeration, but they felt not the labors they had endured for all even the dullest, now was the consummation of the long marches, the short rations, the sleepless nights, interdicted furloughs -- victory had come from them, and as the hero of it turned back there was one shout of triumph, one spring up, one waving of hats from one end of the long line to the other, all murmurs were hushed, and "Old Jack" was the greatest of warriors to them and the idol of the hour's affections We pursued the enemy with Cavalry 22 miles beyond Winchester and have captured in all over 2000, over 200 wagons with horses & harness, a vast store of medicines & hospital supplies, more I suppose than we had in the whole Confederacy, a large amount of valuable ammunition &c &c and sent Banks and his proud army in confusion and dismay across the Potomac and where we go now will be for our own choosing We destroyed the B.& O. R.R. at Martinsburg and captured more stores there than here, large stocks of provisions &c.  I have not time to write more, let the friends & neighbors all read this if they desire. Love to all.
