We are about to start for Mt. Crawford -- I did not come home yesterday, my horse being too weary & it was thought we could start at daylight today -- I hope you will not feel much disappointment, though it would have given me the greatest pleasure to have been able to be home once more -- I hope though it will not be long until I get home again -- I do not need the clothes I left at home as I put on others in their place. Get along as well as you can -- get Snyder to cut up your wood & Capt Sterrett to haul it & leave it for me to settle -- If you want any more money call on Dr. Hamilton for it -- but only get it if you need it. I could not send Wm out as we did not stay as I expected -- I made arrangements for Bishop Glossbrenner to bring you in to see the troops, but it will be too late, events hurry us off sooner than it was anticipatedI leave most of my baggage with Maj. Bell as do all of us -- & he is to take care of it -- I shall not give you more to trouble for then you already have -- Mrs. Gen Rodes has gone out to Wm. Nelson's to stay --. Go up to the Bishops & get some cherries -- he said he would send & bring you up -- You will get all the Richmond news in the Papers -- Mr. Col. Wm Bell is to be buried today --  Be of good cheer & I hope this campaign will end the war & in Gonds good providence bring me to remain in my quiet home & bear my portion of its cares -- & free from the double load of duty imposed by these cruel times Write to me to the Care of Lt. Gen. Early Hd. Qrs. Valley District, through Maj. Bell -- Good bye my loved ones & may the Great Protector be with & defend you -- I shall write as often as I can & you do the same
