I wrote to you an acct. of the battle of Thursday & a few words more. We are now at McDowell but go on today, the enemy have left Monterey and are retreating towards Moorefield -- We are still pursuing them, how far I cannot tell -- We spent last night at F. Hull's -- the Yankees abandoned a large quantity of stores here, baggage &c -- I got quite a number of things and enjoyed plundering them, retaliating for Rich Mt. We lost about 36 killed & had 300 wounded at the battle. The enemy retreated that night -- rapidly. We have buried about 30 of their dead -- they carried some off -- and had a very large number of wounded They abandoned some here -- We took a Col. and several prisoners yesterday -- Our men are weary but in good spirits. Young Harmon of Mt. Solon was killed. Col. Gibbons of the 10th was also killed -- Send this up for them to see at the Upper house I am enjoying excellent health -- Hope you are all well -- this country is a scene of desolation. Living scarce. I shall want to get some butter, pickles and crackers from home if we stay here long -- I will write. Send you letter to the Quarter M. at Staunton to forward to me -- write soon & often. God bless you and the family -- Kiss the children for Pa --
