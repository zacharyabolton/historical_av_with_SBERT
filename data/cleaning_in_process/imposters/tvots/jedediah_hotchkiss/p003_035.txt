I enclose you the original bill of Butler & Co. -- made out agst. H & B. & the Or. taken off by Brodt. There is money Due Brodt from Saml. Bell of Glade, Waller Oder & W m  Andrew of Mossy Creek. I think these will cover the claim & costs. I also enclose a letter that I got from Butler & Co. in reference to Brodt's claim. Fix the thing up right & if necessary write to Butler & Co. Brodt has sued me for what I owe him. In addition to Butler there are unpaid debts of the Co. that he is to pay so I want to keep him from getting a judgement as long as possible. I wish you to attend to the case & get it on the "disputed docket" My regards to your estimable wife.
