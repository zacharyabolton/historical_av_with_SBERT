Your good little letter, along with Nelly's first effort, a very good one too, came last night & I was very glad to hear from you and as you think it would add to your comfort to hear from me oftener I cannot refuse to take a few moments from toil to indulge in the more agreeable duty of thinking of, and writing to the loved ones at home -- I wrote Sunday and sent you $10 -- and I will enclose $2. this time & must draw my pay and send you a larger sum at once, by some one -- I think you have a check, have you not? I dont remember. I never heard anything of the trouble between Capt. S. & Dr. H. -- I am sorry for it -- What was done. I will write to Nelly in a few days -- We are still here, but may move soon -- My store holds out well -- enough for a month more at least. Mr. Phillips sent me 500 soups -- I told you of them they are very nice -- but not of red -page two- pepper &c -- it only takes 30 minutes to prepare them. I hope he will remember the seeds -- I will try & remind him some way -- before long -- We finished the apple butter last night & you would have laughed to have seen Bos scrape the dish -- he says it was as good as preserves. We have a joke on him from last year, a man where we staid said he "ate preserves like it was apple butter", so he has the name of Preserves now & then -- Yesterday finished a map to accompany the Report of the battle of Winchester, wh. the Gen. pronounced "beautifully executed", & Col. Faulkner "remarkably accurate".  The mail goes soon -- I will write more very soon -- Write me soon, good letters, they are if short & excuse this short one -- I am very well, thank God. Kisses & love for all at home
