I have been off on a reconnaisance communication & so have not written to you before since I rec'd your last very welcome letter -- I am glad you have gotten over the 'blues' as you say -- dont let them get hold of you again -- they are poor comforters I reckon -- I never cultivate their acquaintance for that reason -- I got my bundle of things sent to Staunton -- hope it got through I sent it to the care of Maj. Bell -- There were 20 yds brown [unclear: fullned] cloth, 12 yds of Osnaburg -- 2 yds, wide gray cloth, 1 pr garters & 1 pr shoes for you, 1 pr for Nelly & 1 pr for Anna - - 1 lb of tea, 1 lb of Soda, pepper, a fine comb, a silk pocket hdkf, some cloth for sleeve lining, buttons, a box of patent thread a doz sps a spool of white thread -- some velvet tape to bind my coat &c -- Take care of them till I come home & make disposition of them -- Engage Miss Fisher to make me a suit of clothes before long -- I have not been able to find any shoes for Allen as yet, but hope I may yet find some - - Get a lot of candles made up if you can, tho' I do not see how you can are to get them or the materials for them. I cannot [unclear: find] my dress materials -- they are all picked up --  We had a cavalry fight near Martinsburg, a few days ago, repulsed the enemy with much loss -- we lost some Everything is quiet -- the enemy is in Harper's Ferry in force, but we picket to within 3 miles of there -- Old Abe paid the place a visit a few days ago and they went wild at the sight of their king -- We did not attempt to hold Harper's Ferry, we removed all our captures, burned the bridges &c and then abandoned the place -- the enemy soon after occupied it -- The party that holds the Maryland Heights has the key to Harper's Ferry and so occupies it -- Our army is still not far from Winchester -- I am going back today, but am in hopes that I can come back up the Valley in a few days -- I was up as far as Woodstock.  Mr [unclear: Bayley] was to carry up my bundle, I left it with Maj. Sam Yost at Winchester, where he is Quarter Master, and he promised to send it on --  I have recovered from my attack of diarrhoea since I left camp & have been riding about, and am as hearty as can be now - -  Keep in good spirits my love & hope for the best -- all will yet be right -- love to all & kiss the babies
