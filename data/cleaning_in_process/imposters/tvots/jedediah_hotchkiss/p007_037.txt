Came over here yesterday with the Reg. -- we left late in the day I had a long letter nearly written -- but it is out of the way in the baggage of the camp & the rain is pouring down so I can only write a word or so. Maj. Reger goes to Staunton & will take this We have come back here to recruit -- I shall be able to come home in a few days -- as soon as Maj. Reger gets back -- and I will then see that all things are properly fixed. I was a little sick last night, for the first time since I left home. I went up to Felix Hull's and begged a cup of tea & was much relieved by it & the slept well, on the ground floor of my tent. We would be very comfortable if the sun wd only come out for a few hours -- It will not be more than a week before I shall come home -- & then I should know what I shall do all the time. I cannot come now If have not yet got any of the things you say you have so kindly sent me -- They can now be left here -- we are encamped by the side of the road where they cross the bridge. I wish you could come out here -- I do wonder if Harvey Bear would not hitch up his carriage & bring you & his wife out for a day & see us -- it is only one days ride. God bless you -- good by my love Love to all --
