We are off again, this morning -- March to the river today & there we go I know not where save that we are keeping the Yankee nation in perpetual ferment -- We yesterday got the Yankee papers of the 2 nd  in which they say that our Cavalry confiscated $100000, of the people of Chambersburg, which they would not, or could not pay & he carried out his threat (Gen. McCausland) & burned the town, destroying all the public buildings & some  dwellings The people of Pa. are terribly frightened & the Governor takes any men that will come -- regardless of time or circumstances and issue arms to them -- Mosby also crossed the river below Harper's Ferry & made a demonstration towards Frederick & made the Yanks move away everything they had -- they thought 30,000 men were coming again to go where they please -- They say they lost 5000 men in attempting to keep the salient they blew up at Petersburg & were quite glowing over the result, advertising that they accomplished nothing -- & suffered great loss -- they say the colored troops were verybadly used up -- They had 9 tons of powder in their mine & had been a month excavating it -- I sent my box up by J. Parkins & it may be some days before it comes -- We are going & I must close -- Love & blessings for you all --
