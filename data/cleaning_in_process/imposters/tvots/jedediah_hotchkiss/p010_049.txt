Your note & the clothes came to hand by the bishop -- I found some flannel shirt in town wh. I bought am sorry I cd. not send you word of it before you spent so much labor to make my old one comfortable, but I will wear the old one and keep the new, because of your labor of love on it -- We have no additional news of any note -- The enemy made a stand Wednesday P.M. some 20 miles below Richmond, at Turkey Pt -- planted 26 pieces and recd. some reinforcements, and we had a bloody fight with them until 10 P.M. but finally took the artillery and drove them to the bank of James River, where they were getting to their gun boats & transports as fast as possible, but they cannot possiby get away half of them, and we are after them with fresh troops -- There is no doubt of our ability, with God's blessing, to dispose of McClellan and his boasted army.  I have taken a cold and do not feel very well today, but am better than I was yesterday. I shall come home tomorrow evening if nothing happens -- it will be late perhaps -- and I will stay over Sunday   Love to the children May God bless you all
