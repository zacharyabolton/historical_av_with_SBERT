Your letter of the 28th came duly to hand -- and gave me much pleasure -- Humphries is going home today and I can only write you a line or so for he just got his leave & is off I have gotten over my cold & am very well -- Boswell got back yesterday feeling badly for a tragedy that happened while he was gone -- I will tell you about it when I have time We had a bad storm -- but it has passed away & is now pleasant -- I expect to ask for a furlough in a few days -- My love for you all Be joyous & all keep well -- No news the Yanks are stuck in the mud
