Capt. Carroll, one of Gen. Ewell's aides is going up to Staunton today and I avail myself of the opportunity to enclose you One Hundred Dollars, as you may need it for some purpose, and I may not soon have another opportunity as good. If you can you may take up the a/c of Dr. Butcher in James Bear's hands, one or both, just as suits you -- see that they are receipted to me as "Exr of Dr. O. Butcher dec'd" and that they have been sworn to before a Magistrate, I will send more if you need it -- I shall be under the necessity of buying a horse, for I can hear nothing of mine, and that is terrible at such a time as this with horses at present prices, $600 to $1000, but there will be a way though I may not see it now -- I trust in a Providence that has always stood by me -- Do the best you can to spare and provide -- which I know you do & will, bless your sweet heart--: I do hope the days of rest & peace may come again when you will not have to be thus left alone to endure so much - - I hope you can succeed in getting Allen fixed up -- has Thomas made his shoes yet? &c &c -- It will require $200 to pay sent him at Christmas -- I now have $230.-- & shall have $280. more at Christmas - - & hope to lay $200 aside for helping to pay for a horse - We are still at the Morton house, but were started offday before yesterday, as the Yanks made a demonstration, but we came back -- I have not time to write more, as Carroll goes this moment --  God bless you all & love to all
