We got here yesterday & are resting today -- the enemy has gone on down the Valley they did a great deal of burning -- I am very tirde -- it is really cold this morning -- Keep my coat until I send for it -- The news from Missouri & Georgia is very cheering -- I send you a piece of a Broome Co. paper Send it to Nelson -- the Courier is going & I can only say blessings on you all & love for you -- Write me often -- I suppose we shall go on --
