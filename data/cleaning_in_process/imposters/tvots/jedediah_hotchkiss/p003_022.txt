Your favor of the 28 th  ult. came duly to hand -- accept my thanks for this last expression of your friendship. I regret my inability to accept the offer and come to your new home, for I doubt not the school would be successful, and I should delight to be in your immediate vicinity: but I am now under obligations to unite with my brother in the purchase of the Addison Cochran farm at Churchville, with a view of opening a female Seminary there. We are under obligations to accept if certain arrangements can be made. If they cannot be made I would entertain a proposition to go to Lovingston. I suppose the people would be willing to pay 50 or 60 dollars a Sess. for tuition. I am doing very well here, this year, but am not perfectly satisfied. This is a delightful place to live & very agreeable to a one that is somewhat of a recluse. I am pleased to hear that you are working your way into business. Never Despair is the word. What about the interrogations that Harman & Bell were to serve on me? I have not heard from them yet. If you come over to Staunton, stir them up -- let us finish up the suit if possible. If there is any prospect of my coming to L. I will let you know-- My wife joins me in kind regards to you & yours.
