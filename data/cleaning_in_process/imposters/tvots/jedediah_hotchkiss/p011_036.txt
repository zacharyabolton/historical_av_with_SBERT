We yesterday drove the enemy beyond Groveton after a hard fight -- We routed them from Thorofare Gap on Tuesday -- then fought them near Gainsville on Thursday -- on Friday drove them some two miles -- then came back to our old position between Gainsville & Groveton & yesterday fought the enemy there and drove them away with great loss -- and our reinforcements are coming up, and we may fight them today on the old field of Manassa -- the line of hills near Groveton was our line yesterday -- Jackson went to Centerville & Manassa on Tuesday & captured immense stores -- destroyed some 200 cars, loaded with everything, captured many men, servants, arms &c, and put the enemy into a perfect panic -- after destroying the bridges, R.R. &c and breaking their communications -- he then moved back towards Gainsville -- the Yanks in the meantime left the Rappahannock & Warrenton and advanced towards Thorofare Gap where Longstreet met them & drove them back with slaughter, then he & Jackson united & have fought them two days -- our loss is considerable -- Gen. Ewell is badly wounded, loses his leg & may die -- The people here are perfectly wild with joy all true -- the ladies come out to shake hands & feed all -- I am well -- & will write soon more at length. All things go well by God's good providence -- Let the friends see this --
