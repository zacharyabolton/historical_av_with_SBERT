6 1/2 A.M. Tuesday We spent last night here, at [unclear: C. Landes] near Mt. Sidney, had a large barn for the men -- the three Regiments are here, but not more than 400 men have come up yet but they are constantly falling in. I slept in the House by the fire, slept soundly, but Mr. [unclear: Hayshead] said the floor was too hard. The men are in very good spirits as many of those that at first ran away have concluded that it is best to come on & not wait to be drafted for the war. I saw Mr. Register Martin & Tebbs yesterday. There is much excitement about the movements of our army up this way & the road yesterday was full of wagon loads of servants, furniture, machinery &c on its was up the Valley. Gen. M househould went up. It is said that Gen. Jackson has come back to the Narrow Passage this side of Woodstock. The road there shuts up the whole Valley & can easily defend the passage. I do not suppose he will come any farther this way though there may be a necessity for coming up to Staunton.  Mr. Arnold comes back to Churchville There were some 40 preachers there & not many changes were made  March 19th We reached Harrisonburg last night It was very pleasant, tho' a little too warm & dusty. The three Regiments encamped together at the Steam Mill just below town & I came out to [unclear: Frick's] with Col. Sproul, Dr. [unclear: Umlah] &c. 5 of us. We were very comfortably entertained. We leave this morning at 9. The Rockm Militia has been released for ten days. They are quite averse to going I will write to you anytime soon. Our army below here is near Woodstock. Kiss the children God bless you all -- Good bye
