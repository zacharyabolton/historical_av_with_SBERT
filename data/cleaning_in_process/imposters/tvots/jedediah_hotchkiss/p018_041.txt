I got to camp yesterday -- came as far as Big Spring on Monday & yesterday came here where I found the Army after the severe battle of Monday. The first I heard of the battle was at New Market & a few minutes afterwards I met the body of poor Gen Rodes, borne by his staff to his afflicted wife -- We have never suffered a greater loss save in the Great Jackson -- Rodes was the best Division Commander in the Army of N. Va -- & was worthy of & capable for any position in it -- Saturday Gordon's Division went to Martinsburg, with Jackson's Cavalry & drove the Yankees out & burned a bridge they had built for the R. R. & then came back to Bunker's Hill -- Monday the enemy came on & attacked Rodes & Ramseur at Winchester, the fight beginning at 3 A. M. It was fought stubbornly by them -- Rodes being killed during the fight & we gained some advantages -- held our position & the day was going well with us -- Gordon got back about noon & formed the left of the line near Martinsburg Rd -- our right reached across to the Berryville road -- but about 4 P.M. the enemy massed his cavalry on our left & they made a splendid charge & our cavalry broke & ran away -- creating a stampede -- the Yanks did not pursue them but turned the flank of our infantry -- Gordon's Division & got in its rear & came down on it & took about 1000 prisoners -- but not without loss the infantry forming & firing on them -- that put an end to the fight & we fell back to Newtown -- losing 3 pieces of artillery -- but no wagons or anything else -- All agree that but for the conduct of our cavalry we would have won a complete victory notwithstanding the fact that Sheridan had been very largely reinforced & Grant himself was there at least we know he was there the day before. Everything is here now in good order & the enemy has halted near Strasburg -- I saw Maj. Newton -- he is wounded in the foot -- Col. [unclear: Frank] was mortally wounded -- Gen. Godwin was killed & Gen. York lost an arm. We captured over 300 Yankees -- I was quite tired when I got here last night - I shall have to send my coat home to have it made -- have it lined all through -- I shall see today who of our neighbors is wounded or missing -- Gen. Early had 2 horses killed under him & Col. Pendleton made a narrow escape -- Goodbye -- Write soon -- & May God bless you all --
