 We left Culpeper yesterday the enemy having come in the day previous & got a decided advantage over us by capturing nearly a Brigade some 1300 men that we had on picket across the Rappahannock. They also got our advantage in position at Kelly's ford & so drove our men from there & then crossed in force as we came back to a line of battle -- about 3 miles from the C.H. -- and there we waited all day yesterday for the enemy to come on & although we only had a tolerable position they advanced very slowly, & as Gen Lee did not like the position for a fight and intended to come back to Orange Co. anyhow we broke up camps & came back last night to our old quarters, where I found the Gen -- when I came from home. I was up guiding the troops all night before last & we rode until quite late last night before we got hereso am rather dull today & only write because I have not written for several days, not since I got your letter - - Maj. Bell sent the butter down, it came safely to hand -- very nice & we have enjoyed eating very much since -- as we have had light rolls & you know I can do my duty when they are on hand. We are in a house again thank good luck & very comfortable fixed or will be -- having a large, light & airy room, and shall fix up today & go to work again -- We think Gen. Lee will fight again this year to overcome the two almost disasters this army has met with both traceable to our own short comings. I sent you some money by Mrs. Wise & will avail myself of the first opportunity to send you some $200 -- that may have to pay for your fall supplies &c I am sorry poor Anna's arm is "so sore" hope it is well by this timethe poor little bird -- I wrote to Nelly & I suppose my letter has come to hand -- I enclose you a Yankee stamp & you can write to your mother, one page of letter, purely on domestic matters, and endorse your letter "By flag of truce" & enclose it to Brig. Gen. Winder Richmond of  paying the postage on the encolsure & ask Gen. W. to forward --  I wrote to Father by another channel, somehwhat doubtful, a few days ago. I hope Allie is getting much better & I am anxious to hear from you all --  Good bye & God bless you  Write soon
