I owe you an apology for delaying to acknowledge the receipt of the [unclear: tracing] of the Map of the Battle of Greenbrier River, which came while I was especially busy. Please thank Nannie for her artistic work in copying this map. I am also obliged about information concerning Boswelts note book. I take great pleasure in endorsing your application to become a "Daughter of the Confederacy". Ann delighted that you have decided, at last, to do this. Your xmas box came duly to hand, for which we all render many thanks, The only thing yet seen in it is the fine "colored gentleman," Ellen caught sight of him, as he was not concealed, and seized him upon him with inerepressible delight. It has been a source of much comfort to her during the past few days while she has been suffering with a bad cold. Your aunt has been laid up with a bruised shin, but is now on the mend. I had a gauty foot some two weeks ago, but soon got rid of that and am getting along finely, gaining in flesh (now weight 170) and am improving generally. Am working quite steadily on my Memoirs, getting materials into shape &c, so I may begin work on them with the new year. I may run down, for a day or two, next week, for a change, and to pay you all a short visit, as I do not expect any of you to visit us.
