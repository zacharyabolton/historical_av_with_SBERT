I send my wagon out today for some hay -- I am very busy & cannot come out today, but may tomorrow. I go to Kinney's for dinner & Phillip's for supper -- so shall be very well provided for -- I do not need any more butter now -- but if you have any more bread, or nicknacks of some sort, send a few. Tell Harriet to send me some onions & paper gross -- & I want some vinegar in the bottle I send -- I want a map of the Richmond Coal Field that is some where at home Send me two, oz glass stopd  vials & one larger one, empty the contents into some other & soak off & save the labels. Send my tick if washed -- I send out a few pieces of clothes -- wash them for me & send by some one if I do not come tomorrow. Have some fine hay put in my tick -- I shall know about a servt. today -- There is no news -- Jackson was in a day's march of McClellan from Staunton at last accts --  God bless you all
