I send you the case of A. S. Barnes & Co. agst. Hotchkiss & Brodt. I enclose their bill and a note -- [unclear: garnishee] Odor for any claims yet in his hands and there is a bureau & shower bath at the M.C.A. Boarding House that ought to be secured for the payment of this debt. Use the note if you wish -- but it must by no means get into Brodt's hands-- the same of the note which I gave for Butler & Co. If you give them up endorse on them that I owe no part of the debts. Attend to this at once as the Old Scamp is getting wind of our doing and will try to head us off. The amt. due Barnes & Co is $38.64 & I think that can be made from what is in Odor's hands & the Bureau & Bath. I send you the letter of Barnes & Co & shall inform them that the claim is in your hands. Attend to the N. Y. Judgement--
