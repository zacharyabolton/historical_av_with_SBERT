 We have had 3 days of uninterrupted storm, terrible to soldiers, and our men have sufferd much, though they have been in their tents & have kept up fires as best they could, I am still fortunately under a hospitable roof, and by a good fire for which I am certainly thankful -- we are still in the same situation -- no news. I hope Anna is doing well -- I am anxious to hear from you, but suppose the mail is interrupted -- the mail is now going -- so good bye & god bless you -- I am perfectly well --
