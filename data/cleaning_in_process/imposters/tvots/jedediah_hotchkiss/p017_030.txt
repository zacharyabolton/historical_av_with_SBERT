How I have longed to hear from you in this time of peril & suffering with which you have been surrounded -- I have hoped, for the best & still hope, tho' no tidings came from our side of the county. Mrs. McGuffy just got a letter from her sister -- Miss Howard, mailed today telling of the work of destruction by Staunton & they say the country for 10 miles around has been devastated -- I feel that your discretion which rises with the emergency was equal to it & you escaped -- but I am fearful the shock was too much for you -- yet I shall patiently await the arrival of authentic news. Grant is still sliding down towards the James, but sliding away from Richmond at the same time. We have had plenty of skirmishing but very little fighting since the 6 th  which we threshed Grant badly --  I have had an attack of dysentery but am getting over it now -- be sure to write soon to Hd. Qrs. 2 nd  Corps care of Gen. Early. I hope to see you all soon & to see you well delivered from Yankee visitations -- Love & kisses for you all
