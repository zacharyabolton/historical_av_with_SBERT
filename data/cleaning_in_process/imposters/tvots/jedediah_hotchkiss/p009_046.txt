I read with streaming eyes by the camp fire, where we stopped after a long advance & a weary & rapid retreat, your two letters, both mailed the 21st, & the first news I have recd from home -- sad, sad, may God forgive me for the sorrows of last night & may he in mercy have spared my child -- but I am now resigned -- May you be supported in your extreme sorrow -- I would that I could be with you, but it is forbidden me -- & it is now too late to reach you before the crisis has passed -- I wait in painful solicitude the further news -- We had a bloody battle on Sunday resulting disastrously to our arms, though our retreat was conducted in good order -- & our front only fell back a few miles -- Jackson was deceived as to the number of the enemy when he started after them & they came on him with overwhelming numbers -- the 5th Va. stood the shock of battle & stooped the advance of the foe -- we lost some 40 killed & some 300 wounded -- the enemy refused to let us bury our dead or bring away our wounded -- saying they neither asked or gave quarter -- we met ambulances all day yesterday with wounded men, wounds of all kinds in them -- Col. Echols was one it was a sad sight for us to thus meet them but we went on until we met Jackson & were ordered to retreat. We are now some 10 miles from the enemy & about 60 miles from Staunton -- I will write again tonight -- & hope to hear more today -- May God bless our neighbors for their kindness to you & sustain you under the burden of sorrow falling upon us -- None of the W. Augusta Guards were killed some were wounded -- write to me to Mt. Jackson to be sent on if the Augusta Battallion of Va M. is ahead of these  May God be with you  My love to all -- kisses for my children if any are spared to me -- & God be praised that they have been dedicated to him --
