I have a chance to send a few lines by a direct carrier -- Mr Points, who came from Staunton yesterday -- Maj. Bell wrote to me & said he had sent my bundle home -- I am glad it got safely there -- We left Strasburg last Sunday morning (today is Wednesday) met the enemy under Crook, (Hunter having been displaced) & defeated & routed them & have pursued them across the Potomac at Williamsport -- capturing several Hundred, killing & wounding a large number, captured some wagons & caissons & caused them to burn over 70 wagons -- they went in great confusion & rout & our infantry, some of it, marched 30 miles that day -- we had a hard rain at night which made it too dark to pursue & so the wretches got away -- but they got a good threshing & that too in the Valley where they had so misbehaved -- I saw Mr. Trotter & he gave me an account of your troubles with Jordan -- glad they are over, but do not like the way it had to be done -- I hope he may get his deserts -- I have reported him to the enrolling officer at Staunton & hope he will do something for him & his son -- but do not say anything about it -- We had a fine rain Sunday night -- & it kept on until noon on Monday I tell you it did a vast amout of good -- I hope you had a rain too -- & that things are growing -- I have not heard from you for some days but hope to hear soon. I am in excellent health -- but get very tired marching as much as we do -- but I like it better than lying idle in camps -- We are now destroying the R. R -- 5 days after they got it started -- send me a new list of little things you want for I have lost the one you gave me -- Excuse my short note -- for the courier is going -- Love & kisses for you all -- Write soon
