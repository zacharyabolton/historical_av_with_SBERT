We are now again on the move -- Gen Lee is with us & Gen. Longstreet & a host of men & I suppose we shall make a big move now -- I have been working very hard & until quite late, as I have not been able to write you a long letter, as I intended -- but now while we are lying by the road side, waiting for the army to move on, I will write you from under a tree My barrel came, but, poor me, the bottom fell out of the pitcher & the butter all melted & greased the potatoes before they were cooked & they have since taken the rot and all gone to corruption -- The bread was excellent -- I gave a loaf of it to the Gen -- who is very fond of light bread. The onions go finely & I carry them, while on a march to quench thirst they do it admirably. I wrote to you the day after the battle of Cedar Run -- there was no fighting on Sunday -- we held the Battle field, gathered up our wounded, buried the dead, collected arms & watched the movements of the enemy -- we had about 900 men killed & wounded & I see by the late northern papers that they admit a loss of 1500 killed & wounded. It was a very hard fought battle and I felt very thankful that I escaped unhurt. Monday morning the surgeons of the enemy came out under a white flag to carry off their wounded -- who were still on the field -- & just after they got them a large cavalry force was seen advancing -- Gen. J. E. B. Stuart (Cavalry Maj. Gen. -- the noted one) who was in our front -- sent word to them that if they advanced any further he would seize their ambulances -- and -- "Either respect your flag & go back, or come on -- It makes no difference which" They said -- ([unclear: Bugard], the Yank Cav. Gen. in command) that they would go back until they could see Gen. Pope & they then asked for a truce until 2 P.M. which was granted, & they came & gathered up their dead & wounded while we kept gathering arms upon the same field. When they first came on, one of Siegle's staff began to gather arms too & one of our officers told him that was contrary to the rules of a truce & he got mad at it, when an officer of his own army came up & wanted to know what he was doing & by whose order -- he sd he was one of Gen. Siegle's men & was gathering up those arms by his order -- he the cursed him & told him Siegle had better send some one there that was not a d-d fool --. The fellow succumbed & went off -- Many Yankee officers came to the field & they & our men conversed freely -- Many of them were quite sick of the war -- They asked to have the truce extended to 5 P.M. -- which we granted -- We then sent back our baggage train & came back that night, unmolested, to near our old camp. Since the battle a good many deserters have come in from the enemy -- 12 at one time -- from Western Va -- they say that many of them intend to desert -- even whole Regiments -- Gen. Jackson paroled these men & let them go home. One of the 5th Regt in the fight was met by 3 Yankees -- he had lost his bayonet & had no cap in his gun -- he clubbed his gun & knocked one of them down (here he stopped --) & what of the other two, said the Adjutant -- Why I ran away from them as fast as I could -- There was quite a scene at the preaching which Gen. Jackson ordered day before yesterday: he had been to the 5th Regt to preaching & was coming back, passing by the Brigade of Gen. Taliaferro where Mr. Ewing was preaching -- Gen. T -- says, in the midst of a splendid  -- but at sight of the old Gray Cap coming down the road the men all broke & rushed to the road side to cheer the Gen. as he passed -- leaving Mr. Ewing in amazement in the height of his eloquence. Gen. Taliaferro says he intends to have Gen. Jackson arrested for disturbing a religious meeting & a Presbyterian one at that! We took 19 wagon loads & one car load of arms from the battle -- Gen. J. says that is the best way to get arms -- to go & take them. Capt Lilley behaved gallantly in the action -- he seized to colors of the wavering regiment waving it in advance of them rallied them & hurried them on to the fight -- Andrew Newman behaved well too & was wounded in the leg -- Esq. Gamble lost his right arm & one of the Korncofe's of North River his leg -- Grady, son-in-law of [unclear: Humpheys] was taken prisoner it is said -- There is quite a commotion in the 1st Brigade as to who shall command it now that poor Winder is no more -- the officers some time ago united in a recommendation of Wm Harman, at the earnest solicitation of his brother, for a Brig. Generalship -- from mere charity they say, of course not expecting him to command them -- but as soon as he hears of Winder's death they (His friends) press his case at Richmond & produce this recommendation as evidence that the 1st Brigade wants him -- thus caught, the officers back out & send a counter petition that they do not want him -- & ask to have Baylor made Brigadier & so it goes -- My bottle of ink came safely -- & says the welcome word on it that you are well -- It will be of no use to send any more provisions till you hear from me, but write through Maj. Bell & I shall get it -- I will write as often as I can There is no telling where we shall go to, but our faces are Northward & we are moving -- I have money but do not see any way to send it -- so get the check cashed that I gave you if you need any before I send to you -- I will send the first opportunity -- Any of the men around you will cash the check --  May God bless & keep you all -- I hope to come home, if spared after this move -- Tell the children to be good & remember their Pa -- Tell Allen I hope he will be a good boy & do what is right --
