We are all packing up & fixing for a move, as the enemy is reported advancing up the Valley -- their advance having reached Mt. Jackson -- their intentions are not fully developed yet, but the impression is that they will go across the Ridge from New Market -- I should have sent William out today but for that -- if we have to go away get Snyder to kill your pig -- Mr Christian Bear told me yesterday he could spare me $200 -- so if you need any money call on him & tell him I want you to have it -- do not get it unless you want it. He wants Webster's Dictionary & said he would give you a barrel of flour for it -- that is now ten dollars in specie -- I told him I thought you would like the bargain -- it is a good one & you can hide the flour & keep it -- I think -- I hope this will blow by & I got home & get you fixed better. Sandy will finish cutting your wood & I will pay him -- I think you will find Christian Bear a good man to call on if you need any aid -- I had a long talk with him -- I have clothes enough to get along -- so do not be troubled about me -- If I need any I will send for them -- but if any ones come tomorrow send my flannels & shirts -- only by some safe way -- & I do not think you had better look much for a way -- for I can send after them -- Be of good cheer & hope for the best & the Lord protect & defend you all --
