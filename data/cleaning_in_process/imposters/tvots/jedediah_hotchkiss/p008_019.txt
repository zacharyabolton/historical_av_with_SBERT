I just read 2 letters of yours & I am sorry that I have not been able to reply to one I got the 9th but we started that day for the enemy & were gone 7 weary days -- slept out of doors &c & went without food -- we did not accomplish what we started for because Gen. Jackson failed to attack, all others were in position -- we took some 130 pris -- killed 30 -- we lost 4 & 4 wounded -- but no more now for I must tell you that I start homeward tomorrow evening or early the next morning -- slowly of course for the roads are very bad and I am quite weak from fatigue I shall be between 3 & 4 days getting to Green Bank & want to rest there at Mr. Arbogast's some 2 or 3 days & I want Nelson to come that far & bring me on home -- So be patient my dear & by a Good Providence I shall soon be with you & can tell you all -- I want to see every one of you -- love to all Good bye
