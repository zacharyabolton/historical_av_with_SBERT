I have only time before we ride to place our troops for another sanguinary battle on the banks up the Antietam God grand we may be successful -- I am well -- very well, we are all hopeful & in good spirits, never better -- Gen Lee has issued a soul stirring address this morning -- and our men will perform deeds of valor -- My bundle I heard from Dr. McGuire's in Winchester -- you may send by Frother's stage after it -- I shall do all I can to get it home Good bye & God bless you all We hope for good & feel it will come -- write soon
