I wrote you a few lines day before yesterday, immediately after our desperate battle & hope they reached you -- we have not had any fight since then -- only a little skirmishing -- the enemy has fallen back from our left & we drove him back on our right, he is still lying between us & the river -- not daring to attack & unwilling to retreat -- his losses have been great -- as we find many dead in the lines he has abandoned -- many more than we have lost -- Our loss has been far less than at Chancellorsville -- 3500 it is thought will cover all our losses since we started, & we have captured some 4500 of the enemy -- saying nothing about the killed & wounded -- the Yankee papers say the lost 20000 in the first fight -- if so they have lost 50000 in all -- too large an estimate I suppose, but not much, for they made 8 or 10 attacks upon our breastworks, where our men were defended & protected & were repulsed with terrible slaughter we are cheered today by the news from the Valley -- but saddened, deeply saddened by the death of Gen. J. E. Stuart -- one of the noblest spirits in the Confederacy -- peace to his ashes, his memory is embalmed in the hearts of his countrymen -- for he has done noble service for us -- he has gone to join our noble army of sainted heroes above, Jackson, Ashby & hundred upon hundreds more -- Heaven console his wife & defend her & his babes -- how little I thought I witnessed their last farewell when I saw them part at Orange C. H. the day I first came back to camp. Gen. Daniels has died too, a noble North Carolinian -- Heaven hasbeen merciful to us in enabling us to keep back the past that came like an army of locusts, but what a sacrifice have we made to propitiate the favor -- I suppose we shall have to fight Grant again & perhaps not far from here, but I have an abiding confidence in our ability to cope with him, by Divine assistance, -- his army has become demoralized by his repeated & unsuccessful attacks, though he gained some temporary advantages & took considerable artillery from us -- yet his men know that he has made no advance towards conquering our army & that he has made no progress towards Richmond -- the time of many of them is out & they are going home -- the larger portion of his veterans has been destroyed or captured --  May 16th All quiet still this morning -- we are in the same position, the enemy has gone towards Fredericksburg -- we have had heavy rains every day & it is very muddy -- I have no time to write more -- Love & Kisses for you all & may Heaven bless you -- Write often --
