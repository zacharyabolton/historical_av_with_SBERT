Yours of the 2 nd  came to hand yesterday -- we went across the Potomac on Friday -- took around by way of Sharpsburg, to near Hagerstown & came back via Williamsport -- got 150 beeves, 2000 bush. of corn, a large lot of leather &c, drove away the Yankee cavalry -- killed 4 & captured 8 of them & we had one man wounded & Saturday came back across the Potomac & on to our old camp I got you a bonnet pattern, sent for it &, did not get the one I wanted -- but you can see if it pleases you when it gets home -- I got two neck ribbons for the girls -- could only find one bright colored one -- I enclose them & 2 skeins of silk & a yard of elastic cord & a paper of needles -- I will send 2 spools of white cotton thread & one of black thread -- all I could find -- such little articles are very scarce & dear -- & there are calls innumberable for them -- We sent our Cavalry over to demand of Chambersburg $100,000 to pay for the houses of Col. [unclear: Boteler], Andrew Hunter & Ed. J Lee, that were burned by the order of Hunter, informing them, if they did not comply that we would burn the town -- The demand was made & they laughed at Gen. McCausland -- & refused -- he obeyed his order & burned the town -- destroying some 250 houses -- he then left & went westward -- followed for some distance by Averill, but slowly - our forces came back across the river & to Moorfield where he encamped -- Johnson'sBrigade being towards Roumey -- Averill followed & fell on Johnson at daylight -- finding him asleep -- & routed him completely -- Johnson was culpably negligent & the affair was extremely disgraceful Johnson barely escaped, in his stocking feet & on the bare back of a horse. There is but one opnion about Johnson -- & the only wish is that he had been captured also -- He did good service in Md. & is a bold dashing fellow, but has no discipline -- Averill got about 400 of our men -- I suppose & when he had gotten them he put back as hard as he could go - - The enemy is said to be moving quite a large force to Harper's Ferry & we know that part of Grant's army is coming this way -- but we have arrangements made to meet them in all directions -- We moved today back to near Winchester to to cover the roads leadingto the passes in the Blue Ridge -- It is very dry here also -- I am sorry it has been so dry at home -- as I heard that it had rained there -- I am glad Mr. Geeding will attend to my horses & will be much obliged to him -- Miss Priss F -- had better dry up -- for I know what the people of Staunton think of Allie -- I can get along without Hdkfs until I get a chance to get mine -- I am wearing some of my flannels -- they are large enough -- I will get you what I can of your list -- I wrote you what I sent in the box -- it will soon get home -- & I enclose a few items that I have now I am delighted that the ribbon pleased you -- for my taste is not good -- Glad Anne is improving -- She shall have the red ribbon for it -- I certainly answered all your queries in my last letter seriatum -- I enclose you a few envelopes & will put in stamps if I can get them before I send -- will try for a cloak -- but the chance is poor I fear -- our money is at such a heavy  -- write often -- Love to all & God bless you --
