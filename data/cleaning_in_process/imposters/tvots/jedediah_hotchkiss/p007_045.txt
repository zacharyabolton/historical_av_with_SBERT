I promised to write to you from McDowell the next day after Nelson left -- I found myself sick -- truly sick from head to foot -- had a severe pain all might in my abdomen -- was fainting sick -- one of the boys gave me a dose of [unclear: Radmay's] Ready Relief & I commenced vomiting & purging in earnest, but was still in much pain so I took another dose -- the [unclear: hottest] medicine I ever saw -- it produced no nausea but vomited me in a moment & I kept on -- then I besthought me of the tea you so kindly sent me & had one of the boys go to a house nearby & get some made for me -- it was good but it did not stop my ailings -- so Capt. Lilley proposed about dark that I should go to Mrs. Alexander's, near by, where I was very kindly cared for, put in a clean bed -- the first one I have been in since I left home -- was very sick until midnight, lonely enough too in the midst of a house full of sick & well -- but by keeping quiet my diarrhaea got checked & I slept some, in the morning they gave me a nice cup of scalded bread & milk & it braced me up a good deal -- that was Sunday morning & the order came for us to move back here -- it is too bad that they will always move here on Sunday, but there was no choice & as I was the only staff officer here I was almost obliged to come so I got Mrs. Alexander to give me a canteen full of boiled milk & laid down on the top of a baggage wagon & jolted over here -- kept up by my canteen of milk -- we pitched our tents in the edge of town & I went to my bed on the ground -- I was not able to help fix up but Cadet Holt who stays with us -- who formerly lived at Jenning's Gap, kindly fixed up things & made me a good cup of tea & one of the boys got me a nice piece of light bread & I ate quite a supper & slept very well -- Yesterday I had a good many orders to issue & copy & was asked to copy a map for Gen. Loring too & so the day wore away in full employment & I did not get a chance to write & today I have been very busy & made a map which was a theme of much praise & [unclear: which] will not doubt secure me a situation in Gen. Loring's or Lee's staff, so Col. Stevenson, Gen. L's Adjutant says & he has the Gen's confidence -- they all want me to stay in the Regt. tho' as Adjutant but that is not my sphere -- I am promised a furlough -- but do not want to come home until they paymaster comes here so I can get my pay for what I have done, that I may be able to do what I wish to for your & the children's comfort. If I get the post I want I shall continue at that all the time as that is congenial to my taste. Maj. Reger got back today -- fixed up in good style -- a bran new suit from head to foot -- he was in Richmond & went to see his family -- he came back through Churchville & is full of praises of the pretty girls he met there - - in the road as he passed through. Since dark Cadet Holt & I went out on a straw or hay -- seeking expedition, as the ground is getting rather hard since it has been dry for a few days -- the Quarter Master sd there was none, but we went way down the road to where the hay stacks had been & I filled up from the leavings one of my blankets which I had sewed up into a bay for the purpose & I expect to sleep gloriously tonight, as I washed up this morning & put on clean clothes -- the new shirt you sent me -- it is first rate -- sleeves a little long, but it makes no difference -- I want pay day to come so I can buy you a lot of calico here -- as they have a good deal & sell it at the old prices -- I have been trying today to get some washing done, but the pollution of the place is such that the waters are not in a condition to wash with, unless brought from some ways -- it is the worst place in the state for men to be that are not well -- there are few houses & they are full of all sorts & conditions & the sick have a hard time, some of them die daily -- but the well men are now very well supplied with tents -- we got ours today & I wish you could step in & see us -- a wall tent, quite like a house -- stand 1 chair & 1 camp stool, boxes, clothes guns & swords all round -- & Maj. R -- & myself along writing to our wives -- he has quit & I am very tired -- and then tattoo has beaten & we must off to bed -- I have a very bad cold but that will do me good & am feeling very well -- write to me here & I shall get it -- there is no news here -- we may move to the Alleghany or to Huntersville any day -- God bless you & the children -- Love to all -- keep in good spirits my love --
