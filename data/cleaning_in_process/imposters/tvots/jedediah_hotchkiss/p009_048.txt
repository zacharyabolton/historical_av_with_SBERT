Yours of the 23rd was recd. last evening late & gave me some hope of Nelly's recovery, as she lingers on so well -- I gave up all hopes of hearing of her alive after your first letter that I recd. We stood all day yesterday at the narrow passage waiting for the enemy to come up, but Ashby drove them back & so we fell back to near Mt. Jackson -- the train was very long & it was 5 o'clock when we started & it was late when we got there back -- I got your letter after dark -- There are many that want furloughs to go home, but all are refused -- I have come up to town to ask for one by the influence of Col. Baylor but it will have to go to Woodstock for the Gen's Approval & I am in poor hopes of his approving it as he wants troops so badly & Baylor trusts the Battallion to me more than the other officers. We are poorly provided with tents & cooking utensils but have guns enough The battle of Sunday last was one of the hardest yet -- the enemy had 25000 & we 2500 engaged -- our loss is not nearly as great as reported & many of our men are still coming in -- we took 10 prisoners -- Gen. J. says he accomplished all he expected by his move I am in good health tho I have a little cold. Do not look for me though I will come if I can -- If our darling Nelly should die have her buried at Union -- but God grant she may be spared to us --  I have but a moment to write & must close -- Good bye. My love to all -- God bless the kind friends that aid you
