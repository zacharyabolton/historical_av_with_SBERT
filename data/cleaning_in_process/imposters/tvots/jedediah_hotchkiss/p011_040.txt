I wrote to you last from near Groveton, on  [unclear: Saturday], the day of the great battle -- a little more than a week ago -- and since then we have been moving so constantly that I have not found time to write -- but now, after a good days work, and some delay in one place -- I will bring myself, by compassion to write my usual summary of events, though it will be some time before it reaches you -- for we are far away & our line of courriers is not fully established -- I went on Sunday over the battle field of Thursday, Friday and Saturday and never have I seen such horrors -- I thought I had seen war & bloodshed in its worst shape at Port Republic & elsewhere, but that was nothing -- as the Yankee papers say their dead were strewn over a space 5 miles long and three wide -- piled up in many places -- sometimes in long lines as they stood in the ranks, and then one on another where they attempted, seven times, to break Jackson's line, and were as many times repulsed -- The enemy was stretched across two ridges, and in the intervening valley, Jackson was posted on our left and Longstreet on the right -- the column of Longstreet swept around the enemy's left and forced it in on its center & right, and there Jackson fell on the mass and routed it -- fully as much as any disciplined army can be routed -- we captured several thousand prisoners -- men from nearly all the northern states, many pieces of artillery and a large number of small arms -- and, the richest of all, we captured some 60 citizens of Washington that had come up to see us whipped -- Part of the battle was on the old field of Manassa -- We lost many brave men -- Baylor, Capt. White (a son of Dr. White of Lexington) -- the brave Ewell lost his leg, but there is a chance for him to recover -- We paroled the Yankee prisoners and sent them home at once, except the officers, and let them come and get their wounded -- and Gen. Lee told them to come and bury their dead, but they did not come and they lie in thousands over the battle field, rotting & enriching the soil they vainly boasted as their own -- We left the neighborhood of Centerville on Sunday, a week ago yesterday and by taking a circuitous route we got on the flank of the enemy and they were compelled to evacuate Centerville, which they did on Monday & we had a fight with them late on Monday evening in the midst of a terrific storm, in which neither side could claim a victory though our loss was small and theirs quite large, including two Brig. Generals, Kearny & Stevens -- Fletcher Webster, one of Daniel's sons was also killed -- The enemy retreated during the night and went on, through Fairfax C.H. and to their fortifications at Arlington -- having left those at Centerville Stuart pursued them through Farifax C.H. & caught some 40 & took 15 ambulances -- & he said the ladies were so glad to see him that they kissed him -- he there found his Parson that the Yanks had taken prisoner & by him Pope sent word to Stuart that if he wd. send him back his coat he would return his hat --. Tuesday we turned across the country, through a by road, and came over to Dranesville -- a place memorable you will remember for a fight of Cavalry in which Stuart got the worst of it, some time last year -- The people were delighted to see us and we were very kindly treated -- The dew falls very heavily there -- my bed clothes were very wet when I got up from my night's sleep under the canopy of Heaven. -- Wednesday we went on up to Leesburg -- the county seat of Loudon -- passing by the memorable field of Ball's Bluff, where the enemy was so signally defeated by Gen. Evans -- a magnificent country -- and the people were very kind -- I got some of the finest apples I ever saw -- The people there have suffered most from a band of so-called Home Guards, made up of men from the North that had settled there, and the scum of the population our advance guard caught & killed a number of them -- we spent the night near Leesburg, at a splendid spring -- Gen C.H. Hill passed through Leesburg today towards Hauling ferry and cannonaded the enemy at Point of Rocks and drew their attention up that way, and one detachment of the army made a demonstration towards Edward's Ferry -- Thursday we started on from Leesburg and turned off the main road and took to the right and towards the river Potomac and then our troops knew for the first time that they were surely going to cross into Maryland, so completely had our movements been kept from all the officers and men of our command -- all were joyous at the prospect and marched with a light step -- fewer straggling than I almost ever saw -- We went down and crossed at a ford but little known -- White's, and a grand sight the crossing was -- the passing of the Rubicon was not more memorable for we were really advancing -- we had driven an exultant foe, in less than two months 150 miles, far away from our own capital, and were now threatening his, were taking our army where it had never been before -- the 10th Regiment was in the advance (only a small cavalry escort of Marylanders being in front) -- with the Virginia Flag proudly streaming out in a gentle breeze and under an unclouded sun, and then followed other regiments and there were 3 confederate flags and the Virginia one in the river at once and a dense column of infantry banding the stream -- fully a quarter of a mile wide -- Gen Jackson and his staff in front -- he on a cream colored horse, more than usually attentive to all that passed -- and men on reaching the opposite shore the band struck up "Maryland, My Maryland" and the troops shouted in response -- the scenery was in keeping -- all grand and glorious. After we got over we were presented with some mammoth melons, and we regaled ourselves to the full -- We found the canal, on the Md. shore, full of boats, on their way to Washington -- entirely ignorant of our approach -- We stopped them by Gen. Hill's letting off the water above, and we went on up the bluffs and into the river road -- the news of our coming spread rapidly, and young men & old flocked to see Gen. Jackson, whom they look upon as their deliverer -- we passed on through a corner of Montgomery Co, and crossed the Monocacy river and encamped near three springs in Frederick Co -- six miles from Frederick City, where the people came from every direction as the news spread and offered us anything they had for the use of our army -- did not object to the burning of rails and the using of roasting ears, which was the only food our men had, save the quantities the people gave them Gen. Jackson ordered the men to prepare a days rations of roasting ears and he had the same prepared himself -- one of the citizens presented the Gen. a splendid iron Grey Mare -- I worked most of the night preparing a map of the vicinity of Frederick City, as we expected opposition in going there Saturday morning we were in motion, but were caused much alarm by a serious fall that our beloved General got from his new horse, which was too fiery, and plunged and threw him & he was compelled to ride a while in an ambulance, but Gen. C.H. Hill came up and took command a went on to Frederick City, which he found evacuated -- the enemy having burned up many things before leaving there - - Gen. Jackson soon got better and came on to near the city -- I went over soon after we halted -- our men were in a paradise to them, and those that would take Confederate money could not hand out goods fast enough -- especially such things as boots, shoes &c -- and especially eatables some refused to take Confederate money because they said they had to pay notes in bank and our money was not bankable here, though it soon might be -- but many sold freely, especially of the needed articles & many things were bought -- I got the shoes you wanted, but did not buy many things because we are so far off and our transportation is limited and we do not know where we may go &c &c If I can see any way of getting them home I may get some necessary articles. Many of the Unionists left before we came, and in much terror -- about half the population is strongly with us & they are willing to do anything, and I suppose most of the young men of that portion will enlist -- our coming was wholly unexpected and the enemy was completely deceived, calling our advance only a cavalry raid -- We are only some 15 miles from Pa. and I do hope we may go there -- There is said to be much excitement in Baltimore and fighting is said to be going on there, how true that is I do not know -- I am in excellent health -- and enjoy this excitement, but we are far away and when I may hear from you I cannot tell, but write to me through the old channel -- I would like to hand you some of the nice things to be had here, but my arm is too short -- Be of good cheer -- the skies are brightening for an end to this bloody war -- we have to fight once more and no doubt soon --  Good bye and God be with you --
