I intended to write you last night a long letter, but Col. Harman came to my room after I came from church & we talked until past bed time & so I failed to do my duty to you -- but you must forgive me this time -- I went to church twice -- Mr. Pratt preaced one of the best sermons I ever heard -- Mr. Guy goes down this morning & offers to carry a bundle for me -- so I send down my dirty clothes that you may have them washed up this week -- I shall be home either Friday or Saturday, for several days (D.V.) I got a letter from Mr. Robinson from Baton Rouge -- he is very well & thinks they will get along better at B. R. having as many cadets as they had before the fire -- I dont think he will come to Va. he is afraid of cold weather -- says you must write to him -- The key is in the side pocket --   Good bye & God bless you
