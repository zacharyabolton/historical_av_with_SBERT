I have just got here 9 miles from Churchville, & here we shall spend the night -- We shall pass Jenning's Gap some time tomorrow, and I think Nelson will bring you all up to see the army pass -- I will write to him -- I want you to send me up the eatings you have fixed for me, some butter extra & crackers, or whatever you have for me -- a little pickle perhaps -- &c &c but I must close -- I may come home tomorrow -- put the fixings up & I can empty them into my mess chest send considerable
