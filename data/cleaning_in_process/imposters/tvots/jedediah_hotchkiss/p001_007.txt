I wrote the preceding to you yesterday -- we fought most of the day -- had a desperate battle -- but repulsed the enemy with much loss to them, but not very heavy to us -- we broke the back bone of Burnside's Army -- he had his best troops engaged -- not more than 1/3 of our army was engaged -- the battle was fought along the bottom & on the 1st terrace this side of the Rappahannock -- Tom Kinney was not hurt -- he wants me to say - - I escaped unhurt -- thank God & hope to today -- the battle has already commenced -- 7 A.M. and today will go far towards deciding the fate of our country -- Our line will advance today. Send word up to Nelson of the result &, that I am unhurt I will write to you tonight  Good bye & God bless you
