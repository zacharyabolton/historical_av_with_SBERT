This is Sunday night & though I have written to you this week & have nothing of interest to communicate, I cannot forgo my custom of having a chat with you at this time regularly -- It is said the enemy has removed his infantry across the Rappahanock into Fauquier Co -- only keeping his cavalry in Culpeper -- his trains of wagons to his calvalry pass down to their camps in full view of our infantry camps -- & yesterday some of our men went over yesterday & had a skirmish with them. Some think Gen. Lee may go over to attack Meade, but I hope not, it is too late in the season, & we might find ourselves in the midst of a winter storm & suffer much. Today has been quite cold, sharp wind -- I have spent the day at home, reading & talking. Read Doddridge's Life, my Bible &c. Mr. Lacy preached in one of the Brigades not far from here -- He is a good talker & has now formed one of my mess & consequently I see much of him -- he always has something good to tell & whiles away much of the tedium of the men -- society, camp life &c. Everyone longs for the conclusion of the war & a return to their homes, yet no one talks of giving but until our liberties are obtained -- come what may. A few days ago, while we were in the [unclear: near ch] I found Wash. Reeves & Lil. Stout marching back from where they had been as a guard & they told me they had not had any rations for a day & a half -- so I invited them to come and spend the night with me, as our camp was near -- & I had a big supper prepared and you may believe they did it justice, it would have done you good to see the hungry fellows eat -- they slept in my tent & breakfasted with me & then went to camp -- very grateful for my hospitality -- they are both good soldiers - Reeves an excellent one & very neat -- Lil retains much of his former self, but has been improved by the duties & labors of a common soldier -- Our men endured much hard labor unrepiningly during our late movement - - in fact I do not thing the world ever saw a nobler & more unselfish set of men than the Army of Northern Va -- I shall apply for my furlough some time about the 20 th  & intend to ask for 20 days. I much hope that Richard will come up before I get home -- I know Garber is very loth to part with him, but he promised me that he might come when he got his fall work done -- But some way will be provided I trust, for the Lord has been very gracious to us in these days of trial & suffering & let us humbly acknowledge his mercy & strive to obey in all things his most holy commandments -- Kiss my little daughters for me, may the Lord make them good & amiable, abounding in modesty & all Christian graces -- May the Lord bless & keep you all -- My loved ones --
