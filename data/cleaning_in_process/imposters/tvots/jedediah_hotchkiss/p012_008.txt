I only now have a chance to mail my letter at New Town -- and will add that Stuart went to Pa -- took a round through Chambersburg &c -- captured some 2000 horses, a large number of negroes -- stores &c and destroyed immense stores -- He went the whole way around the camp of McClellan & came away back by Leesburg -- he crossed the Potomac 1st at Hancock -- I am now at New Town -- My bundle went up to Maj. Bell -- so it may get to you - - I am very well --
