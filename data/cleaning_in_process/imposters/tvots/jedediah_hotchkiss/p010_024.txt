I suppose you will all have heard before this of the action of yesterday, on one of the highest points of the Bull Pasture Mt, on a cleared ridge we repulsed the enemy's attack, made about 6 P.M. and kept the battle field & they have precipitately retreated from McDowell, burning up their stores there. We had some 25 men killed and I suppose over a hundred wounded -- we have no means of knowing the loss of the enemy but it must have been considerable -- they carried off their dead & wounded in the darkness that followed the fight Col. Gibbons of the 10th was killed Gen. Johnson was wounded in the ankle I have not been able to find out the others -- for we were up, going about, until 2 this morning & then slept 2 hours & were stirring again I have no idea whether we shall follow them or not They were reinforced yesterday before the battle & expect Fremont tomorrow I am well but very tired -- just rode of the battle field -- a sickening sight. God be praised that we won the day. I will write more soon Love to all -- God bless you --
