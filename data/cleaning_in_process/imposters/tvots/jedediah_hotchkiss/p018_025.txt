We are again on the Banks of the Potomac -- we drove the Yanks down to Harpers Ferry, spent two days in front of that place, then came away yesterday, leaving the 1 st  Corps in front of the enemy there & came to this place, met all the Yankee cavalry on the road -- they said they were on the way to Staunton -- had three days rations for man & beast -- commanded by Custer -- we met them at Leetown & routed them driving them in every direction -- & killed & wounded a good many & forced the rest back across the Potomac & to Harper's Ferry, so nipping in the bud one of the biggest raids they have ever undertaken -- We lost but few but they were fine men -- Col. Monaghan of the 6th La. was killed -- & Col. Wolf of one of the Western Va. Regts. Gen. Gordon was struck by a glancing ball, in the forhead & bled profusely, but was not much hurt -- he did not get off his horse or stop to have his wound dressed but pressed on after the enemy all sprinkled over with blood -- the very personification of a hero -- The Yankees say they lost 500 in the fight -- I suppose 100 will cover all our casualties -- Our cavalry went on to Williamsport & today will cross the river We shall also move -- The Yanks will not get much rest here Gen. Early believes in motion & keeping them well stirred up -- We never stay more than 2 or 3 days in one camp -- The country owes much to Gen. Early -- & his vigilance I think will keep this Valley safe from incursions of the enemy -   I hope my letter with the ribbons &c in, my box with the cups & saucers & Tumblers &c, & the little bundle with the bonnet pattern in, have all gotten to you safely -- If you do not like the bonnet pattern you can sell it. I will get everything I can for you - rest assured my dear One -- I want to send you some money but the comunications are so uncertain -- I will send before long -- I have not heard from you by letter for a long time -- two weeks at least -- but Jacob Henger told me you were all well & quieted my fears that you might be sick -- but do write -- I long to hear from you & have an ardent desire to come home, but no chance while we are so busy & if we can only end the war I am perfectly willing to endure this season of activity -- the signs are brightening & I still confidently  a conclusion of hostilities with the ending of "Old Abe's" reign -- I have not time to write more now -- Kiss the children for me, they must be good girls -- I hope Mary is doing all she can to please you -- if she is industrious & diligint I will bring or send her a present, tell her -- Write to me often --  Good bye & my the Lord bless you all --
