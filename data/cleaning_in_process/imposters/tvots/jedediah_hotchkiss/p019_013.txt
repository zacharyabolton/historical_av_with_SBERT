I send William, he will tomorrow get to Mr. Hamilton's & the next morning come home, then you have him do what you wish to have do . . . put away your vegetables &c &c -- let him find out from Mr. Heizer where to cut wood & go & cut for about 4 or 5 days -- I want him to get back by the 10  th   of Nov. unless I write to the contrary. I have him ride up a horse that he can put into pasture -- Mr. Geeding will let it run in his I suppose, or Dr. Wilson as it will not be more than a week -- have him get the axe that Mr. [unclear: Euritt] fixed & grind it up he will reach home Wednesday morning, let him go to Mr. Hamilton's over next Sunday & then start for here direct on the 9 th . Did you charge Allie Hanger not to let the desks be cut? - Get the flour from all that I named on the list I gave you -- I am trying to pay all up at Christmas -- glad you got buckwheat -- I am very much pleased to know, by your letter, that you are succeeding so well in getting things together -- Make the most of William's time you can now, & I hope, by & by to come home myself with him & get up a full supply of wood for winter but he can cut up a lot now & perhaps when I come with him we can get the Cold man you spoke of to help & haul up wood, with my own horses if I can do no other way. Mr. R's shirt fits only a little too narrow in the back -- I send you a copy of Gen. Early's address to the army -- we are getting well organized & are prepared to meet any force that may come up -- we have been reinforced by some Cavalry from the S. W. & all things wear a cheerful aspect -- I do not think there is any idea of evacuating the Valley -- Of course an army could be subsisted as well near Staunton as any where else, as there is R. R. communication -- . Send my towel, hair brush, & white blanket by Wm -- I hope my Saddle bags have gotten home -- send them back by Wm. Maj. Green's things, bed & carpet bag were sent to Maj. Bell -- & he was to send them out. I do not know what became of them -- I hope they are safe. I will provide a blanket for Mary & think I can get shoes, what is her no: -- I shall yet have a chance to get the gloves for Miss Kate, I think -- Have my coat turned. I shall draw pay tomorrow & will send you some money -- Write soon -- I will write again in a day or so. All quiet. Love & blessings for you all --
