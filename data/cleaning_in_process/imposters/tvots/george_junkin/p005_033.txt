Enclosed find eight dollars: to pay my Repertory for the years 1860 & 1861. And my son Ebenezer D. Junkin's for 1861. Please forward with proper direction for his = Brownsburgh-Mine for Jan. has arrived & I see it does not approve of Dr Palmer's sermon. I have not seen the sermon, but only an extract, which I deemed, execrable. The first article in the Rep. is condemned by the two colours, White Brown, but I cant see why. We are in fearful times, but the Lord reigneth & I have no serious fears for the issue. I feel like Gen. Jackson-"the Union must & shall be preserved" and "their object is disunion; but be not deceived, disunion, by armed force, is treason." I hope no one will be hung, tho' a few deserve it. I have no confidence in man's wisdom; but as I said in my last baccalaureate, God made this government & he will not let man destroy it. We are well & the College gets along quietly.
