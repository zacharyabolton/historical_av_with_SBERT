I would have written to you instead of writing to Mr. Harris, but I did not know your name. Whatever money is due me from Mrs. Branham, I wish you to collect for me and place it in the hands of My Sister, Winny Williams to help to buy provisions for my children to subsist on until I come. By Mrs. Branhams own account there is nine dollars & seventy five cents due me now from her. Give my love to Miss Sidney, Mrs. Branham & family Dr. Atkins, & family. Tell Mr. [unclear: Freer] to come her & spend a week or two, that he would be well pleased you will please let me hear from you soon and direct your letter to the care of Mrs. [unclear: Gacchurie] White Sulphur Springs. There are now between 5 & 6 hundred persons here. Give my respects to all the colored friends at the boarding house.
