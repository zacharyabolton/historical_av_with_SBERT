I am truly sorry that I did not see you during my short stay in Staunton, that I might confer with you in regard to Mil Com affairs, and especially the church matter. I found that Wm Clark the pastor understood me that you took his papers without authority, but I distinctly said that you were acting under orders that I knew nothing of, but as you had taken charge of them, it was not necessary for me to hear the case. Again he asked why I came into your district, I replied that as you were a civil agent, you could not act as a Military Commissioner. I should be only too happy if you would assist me in the arduous duties of Mil Comr.
