Please inform me of the whereabouts of Major How, also when, and where he bought the black mare. Some man from Staunton has claimed her as his property. I have not yet succeeded in getting just the horse I should like for Dandy, the man who owns the colt I mentioned, is from home. I have had one or two offers for him but they do not quite suit me. Please reply at once and
