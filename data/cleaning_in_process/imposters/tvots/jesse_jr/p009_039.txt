I received your letter yesterday eavening which was dated the 2nd. I was glad to heare that you all was well and hearty but i was sorry to heare that you was disappointed in my [not] coming home but I thought it best to tell you the truthe. I dont see any chance of a well man to get away from heare with out runing off and I dont like to do that without a good cause but if sickness get in our family I will strain all the nerves I have I will raise the blockades and come home let the consequences be what it may or will try but if it is so that I dont get home you must trust in providence. I think you will have some neighbours that will give you and you nead not be oneasy about me volunteering before i see you and the children thats one thing sertain. conserning the barger business I have riten to you the first of October so I thought you new that we oad [owed] him. their has bin severle letters I sent that I received no answers.
