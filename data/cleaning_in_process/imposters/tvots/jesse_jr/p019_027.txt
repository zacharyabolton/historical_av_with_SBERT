I take my pen this Sabath morning to drop a few lines to inform you that I am in good health and Praying that this may find you and all the family injoying the same bessing. my health has bin good since a prisoner but am deprived of many comforts that we wonce injoyed but i trust this crewel war will soon come to a close so we could injoy our selves as the past. The health of the camp is good at preasent. the Officers in charge hear spairs no pains in promting [promoting] the health and comfort of the prisoners. Our rations are of a good quality. Some complain that they they dont get enough but i think it is a nuff. Anderson Stombaugh, Knott, Jacob Michael Wright, E Samuels and A Hansberger are all well. Send brother David Rolston poast office address if you can. I rote in my letter for some green Back money. if you had it send it if you can as i nead some littel hear.
