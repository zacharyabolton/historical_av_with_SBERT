I received your letter dated August the 27th last eavening. it put me out of sorts to heare that you have not heard or got no letter since i hav bin in this camp. i have ritten some 7 letters to you since the first day of august. i think it long between your letters. i have received some 3 or 4 that was dated in august from you. i cant tell why mine dont go to you. it haint because i dont start them but i trust that they will come to hand yet. it must be the falt of the mail some whare or how i dont no which. if the paret is with calf and her is not it may be that it would be best to beef her tho i leave that with you to judge. it will suit me the way you think or doo best. you want to no what i think of the war. i think it is a hard war but i dont think that it can last a great while longer tho it may last longer than i think. they is a good deal of confusion amongst some of the soaldiers in some of the brigades. it is moastly of the noth carolineans. some virginians they say that the South is whiped but i don't think that and i don't think that the yankeys will ever subjugate the south by fiting. for my part i can't say how long it will last but i still hoap and trust god will soon see fit to put a stop to this horabel war. we have had a great revival of religion in our brigade and still a going on yet. Many have professed [part of the letter is gone here] I must come to close by informing you that i am well and i hoap and trust to god that this will find you and all of the family injoying the same blessing of health which God has bin so kind to bless me with.
