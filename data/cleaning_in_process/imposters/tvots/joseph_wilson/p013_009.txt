I received yours of the 17th just a few minutes ago I was just in the act of writing to you anyway I perused it with unbounded pleasure & love. But I have not heard a word from home since I left nor feel any ways uneasie about it, for I know Maggie will write when she has an opportunity nor I have never since I have been in the army for I have always considered it my duty to write to her 2 or 3 times to her once. But to acknowledge I do wannt to hear from her & [unclear: Warler Elmer ]all that I have on earth to care for Bell you seemed  what inclined to think I ought not become dissatisfied in the Army & he contended I know that I just as mutch to care for as any other man & I know that I have the same priviledge to hire a subscribe as they that has done so & more over I love my Wife & child as mutch & will do as mutch for them as any other man & would love to remain at home with Them as well as as well as any other man, & I dont know how soon I may be with them & again I may not see them till the war is over. for this reason I have been appointed Assisting Quarter Master of this regiment 14th till it is organized & then I have the best of nine chances out of ten for the appointment of Capt. Q.M. and if I am pleased with it & get the appointment I will remain in servise Bell you wannt me to write to Pete I would do so with pleasure but know it to be useless to do so for I have written to Jacksons several times & none ever reached ther destination. Well I must give you the [unclear: points] of the Brigadier General [unclear: A.G. Jenkens] Briggade in the first plase we were ordered here in Campt a Camp of [unclear: instruction] every thing disarranged every body dissatisfied & no nothing you may say but all I have to say about it is in the plase of it being a Camp of instructions it a Camp of [unclear: diserfaction] at the best no rules nor nothin as I have said. The Company that have [unclear: going short] at all times in the day & night they even spent by volleys & do just as they pleas & one hundred Yankeez could come & rout the hole Camp. The weather is very rough & bad we had a very pretty snow last night it fell about five or six inches deep but there was enough for a foot of snow it rained all day yesterday & consequently it melted. Bob Love is improving very fast I think will be able in the cours of a [unclear: couble ] of weeks to join his Company & several others are sick, but I still remain the same old seven & six. I have no neus of importance of war to communicate. So I will have to close for the pleasant present. Give Miss [unclear: Clemmins] [unclear: my] respects & Mr. [unclear: Brarey] my regards & ask him how his arm is get, & weather he is ready to take anothe fish or not, tell him to hold himself in reaching at all times that I may be there any day to fish & till then the hook I thought I had lost I found in my Coat afterwards & write often & direct as follows
