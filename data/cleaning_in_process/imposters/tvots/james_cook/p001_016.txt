I received a notice from you through Alfred Stribling (Col) to pay him $7 50  which he seems to have claimed of me. Said Alfred Stribling contracted to work for me one year commencing on last November 27th for $90.00 & house firewood some ground for corn & vegetables, his board, all furnished free. After working 12 days he quit without any provocation & went into another man's house. From a former settlement he owed me $2.00 which he gives me no credit for. he quit at a time when I needed him worst. (working at corn) & caused me a great deal of trouble to get a hand in his place, hands being scarce at that time. I have no disposition to take advantage of this man am willing that the case be tried before a magistrate I am acting as agent for my mother
