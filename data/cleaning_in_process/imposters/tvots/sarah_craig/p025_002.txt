yesterday Archibald Smith came for the things that Ellen Taylor had left in my care until she sent for them; these I let him have & such other things as I could spare. I too was greatly astonished, when I saw the letter from you, concerning the wages of said Ellen as I thought we were square. As to the crop of Corn & Potatoes raised by Toby Taylor (Ellens Husband) I will say that I had to study awhile before I knew what it meant; then I recollected that told Toby that he might have a piece of corn (about an Acre) if he would attend to it; but unfortunately for him he took sick and died before the corn was gathered. I also told him he might have a piece of ground for Potatoes; he planted them, and died before they came but they were never gathered in, they rotted in the ground. This you see was before the negroes were free (in 1864) so I think I am clear of that. As to Ellen's wages, I told her when she first was set free that I would give her her victuals & clothes if she would stay with me. She stayed until about 2 months ago, when she left; and now I think it would be great injustice for me to have to repay her. I sent you a note by A. Smith stating that I would be in town in a few days & see you but other arrangements makes me write this to you instead. I hope this will make all things right.
