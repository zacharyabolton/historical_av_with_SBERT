I seat myself this morning to write you the limited page. Received a letter dated 12 Sep last week. All are well this morning. Hope you also are in health and tolerable comfort. I have sad news to inform you of. Your friend Sergt Ben Hupp was killed last Wednes 19 th  at Cedars Creek. 'Twas a great shock to me to hear of it and I judge will be much more so to you who was an (almost) inseperable companion. Seems as if death has come nearer to you than ever before. We can't help but feel his death. Not more than 3 weeks since he was at home and now dead Can scarce believe it's true. Ought not this to be sufficient to rouse you to reflection? Yes and God grant we may not be hardened by this, his Providence. Mrs H only yesterday eve received a letter from Baylor informing her of the circumstances the first she knew of it Dave Beard's detail has been out short and he has now gone to the company started last Friday. Had been in the trenches at Richmond 3  weeks appears very willing and glad to go back. Details from neighborhood all gone Suppose as I (thoughtlessly) was the cause of a misunderstanding in the case of Wrights negroes had best rectify it Twas only the men who went away the one belonging to them and the hired man. Reed Hanger is home a young man with him stoped as you had requested Hope you will get home before winter if not can we send from here any thing for your comfort or will you be allowed to receive.
