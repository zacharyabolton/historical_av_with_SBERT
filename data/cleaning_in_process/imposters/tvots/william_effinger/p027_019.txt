A freedman is now up on bail to be tried at our May Circuit Court upon a charge of bigamy The first marriage is alleged to have been under the act of the Va Legislation of 27th March 1866 - immediately suceeding which a large number of freedmen went to your office (then in this town) to be registered Among others I have been informed this one Samuel Hall alias Samuel Johnson alias [unclear: Doctor] [unclear: Damin] - He has gone by the three names but doubtless used the first at that time He is the one who lodged complaint against Genl S. H. Lewis of this county for driving him away from his wife Eliza formerly the slave of said Lewis Eliza claims him as her husband and any information you can give will probably further the ends of [unclear: justice] justice - If the facts be as stated in regard to the complaint and registration could some one of your Bureau attend the trial and give evidence? Please let me hear from you
