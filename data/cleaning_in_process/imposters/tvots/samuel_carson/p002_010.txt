 I should like so much to hear from you. But its almost impossible to from the fact that we change our position so often. I trust however that you wont forget me. But that I may continue to hold a place in your memory Dearest is all I ask. I think of you often & of the many happy hours we have spent together, & still hope that we may meet again
