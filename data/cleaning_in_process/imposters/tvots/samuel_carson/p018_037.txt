 Your kind letter dated Aug 5th was received the 16th and believe one was read with great interest. Would have answered immediately, but was expecting to leave every day, consequently I thought to defer writing untill I arrived at my destination. We were landed here on the 7th [unclear: inst] having been on board the "Steamer C[unclear: rescent]" 19 days, had a pretty hard time I tell you. Our position at present is between Fort's Gregg & [unclear: Wagner] which could be made very uncomfortable to us, but so far has not. Hope the time is not far distant when in the providence of God I may see you all again.Please remember affectionately to all my friends and relatives, and believe me as ever your devoted Cousin
