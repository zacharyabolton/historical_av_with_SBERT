Thinking you would like to hear from your friends--I will embrace the present opportunity of writing you a few lines concerning them. When I left home which was about the last of Jany your father's family were all well, saw your sisters at church the Sabath before I left--also your brothers Rue & William-- Since that time your brother William has been assigned to the 50 Va Infty - A great many changes have taken place in your old neighborhood during the last few years which time & space will not allow me now to enumerate. Among your acquaintances who are here are James B, McCutchan, Henry A. Wright, Thomas M. Smiley and James T. Beard. We are getting along as well as could be expected considering the large numbers that are here. So far as known to me, there is but little sickness among the prisoners. We have divine services every night - and prayer meeting every morning which is being productive of much good & many have been hopefully converted. But I must close for the present.
