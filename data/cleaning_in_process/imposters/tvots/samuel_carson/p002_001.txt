How are you this morning well I I hope. We are still here all in a pile /Are so close together that we cant turn over without turning on someone I trust they will soon [unclear: scatter] [unclear: us] so that we may get more room in camp. After the battle of Sharpsburg of which I last spoke we fell back to Shepards Town on this side of the river. The Yankees following us closely, we had scarcely got out train across untill they [unclear: opened] from the opposite side. They made a bold attempt to cross but this they could not do - however that night they succeeded in crossing part of their forces at another ford  attacked our forces left to guard the ford we had crossed but they were driven into the river killing & wounding some say several thousand - some [unclear: too] were taken prisoners some of whom had been "paroled" a short time [unclear: before] - these are the kind of men we are fighting - but I guess they won't fight us soon again. Well I must close for the present hoping to hear from you soon.
