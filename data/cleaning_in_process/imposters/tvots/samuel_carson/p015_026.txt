After waiting some three weeks for an answer to my last, I have again seated myself for the purpose of writing you a short Epistle, however interesting it may prove to you. I have but little news to write you from this quarter. Things remain pretty much as they were when I last wrote you _ with the exception, that the Yankees have moved more to our left,- from some cause or other not laid down to us on this program. It is reported by our scouts, that they have sent one Corps to the west or some other point; this may or may not be true, but of one thing all seem to be satisfied, and that is that Genl. Mead is satisfied to remain in his present position and not to advance on us in ours. Some little skirmishing occasionally occurs between our cavalry and that of the enemy, which in the end amounts to nothing. So it is with the infantry pickets along the Rapidan. Since we have been at this place, there have been some 4 men out of our Regt. who have deserted and gone to the enemy, last night a Lieut out of Co "G" deserted whilst on picket. A great deal of desertion is going on all through the army, and as many are being shot for the same offence. It seems the more shooting, the more desertion. The health of our men has not been so good since we came to this camp. There are now 6 men in our company unfit for duty: most of whom have had light attacks of fever, but are now on the mend & I hope will be fit for duty in a few days. I believe this is all I have to say for the present, so I will close hoping to hear from you soon. My love to Sister, little Jimmie & his siss
