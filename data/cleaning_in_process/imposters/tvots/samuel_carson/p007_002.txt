I am now seated on a bench in our Barracks (for the pres. at least) writing on a box of ammunition, surrounded by at least 2 hundred soldiers, all talking & laughing so much that I hardly know whether I can write or not. But I will endeavor to do the best I can under the circumstances as I have just finished reading yours & Jimmis letter which believe me was a source of much pleasure & I shall proceed immediately to answer it for fear that an opportunity will not present itself soon again. The 5th Regiment (of which we constitute a part) arrived here last night about dark after travelling about 22 miles from Charlestown. The day before we marched from Shepardstown a distance of 12 miles starting from their at about five oclock in the evening & arrived at our camp at 12 in the night. lay out in the woods on the ground like "Hogs" without anything to eat. This is the way soldiering goes. about one half of our men were so much fatigued. & their feet so sore that they could scarcely walk. my feet have blisters on now, as big as [unclear: ten]  . You have no idea how much we have to endure & yet I fear its nothing to what it will be. But if I have my health I care not what comes I can stand it as long as the most of them. I have no idea when we will leave this place. The Bridge together with all the publick buildings at the Ferry have been burnt by our troops & the place is now vacated entirely. Also the bridge at shepardstown was burnt the evening we left by Capt Doyle such a destruction of Property. not less than  of [unclear: it] destroyed & what [unclear: will] it be by the time the wars are ended? I had a little excursion over into Maryland the night before we left Shepardstown, some 20 of our men went out on a scout to see if we could find any of the Yankey's I tell you we ran a considerable risk nevertheless we went. We were at a place where a sentinal had been posted the night before but did not see anything of him. Then was a company of 35 camp[unclear: ers] about 3 miles from the bridge & if the Col. had'v let us we would [unclear: tried] them any how one [unclear: round]. But we had orders not to go farther than a mile & half - consequently we got no fight. I must stop for the present, it is so warm & I am so crowded that I cant write more. if we dont leave directly I will write you again & give all the news I can. As for the note enclosed - I hope you will not think any thing more about it. I'll say nothing more myself. & believe me to be as ever yours. My love to all,
