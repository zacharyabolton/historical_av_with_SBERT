 We have received instructions this morning from the Federal authorities that we would be permitted to receive anything in the way of clothing or eatables that may be sent us by our friends- whilst it is true I have but little acquaintance with you I at the same time look upon you as a friend, and will be very thankful for anything you may send. I arrived at this place on the 13th of March from Hilton Head S.C. where six hundred of us had been confined since last Aug. I have heard nothing from home since my arrival here, consequently can give you no news from that quarter. The two McCutchins & Henry Wright are still here. My respects to Mr. Miller.
