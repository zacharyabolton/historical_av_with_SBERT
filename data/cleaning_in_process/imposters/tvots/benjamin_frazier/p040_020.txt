I spoke with you about a year ago, and you then promised me aid, but the rascality of Henry Keys I did not get them, and as the appearance is for a very severe winter, and my family is clothed very poorly, I will again trouble you, to see if you can extend me any aid, in any shape. Let me hear from you.
