Your kind letter of the 8th ulto, came to hand when I was absent, and I have been at home only one or two days since, is the cause of my not writing sooner. I observe that your district went in Convention as you predicted. The difficulties surrounding our state are great enough, without the trouble and annoyance of  in responsable positions, many mistakes have been mande in our nominations this fall, but none has pained me so much as the one made by your people. I fear that we have lost the state through of blindness of our people. It appears that merit and ability afford no guarrantee for success, but that the greatest blusterer is to be the man. Your friends all know that you was the man, not only for your district, but for the whole state, and it is a public calamity that the country cannot have the benefit of your services in the next Congress. I understand that Judge C. Member from your county is making great efforts to concentrate the consolodation vote in his favour for the Senate. A friend told me that he had seen a letter from Genl. Mahone to a member saying that if he had the selection of the next Senate it would be Judge C. and it is upon that letter that the forces are being collected. I have been so much occupied with the State Fair and other matters that I have given but little thought to the subject myself. Know of nothing discouraging, my frds say they are sanguine, but no one can tell how it will go. I should be pleased to hear from you occasionally
