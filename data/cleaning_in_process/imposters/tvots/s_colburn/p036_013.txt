In reference to your communication dated 20th ult. concerning Cynis Bannister, I will state that I visited him this morning, read him your letter. He stated that there had been some difficulty between them which induced him to leave, has been absent about three years. I endeavored to impress upon him the importance of caring for his children. He directed me to say that he intended to return this spring, perhaps about a month hence.
