Your letter was received several days ago but I have not before had time to write or at least not an opportunity of writing. As to time I have no business to employ my time and think it more than likely that we will do nothing this year. Every thing is at an almost perfect stagnation. What few manufacturers that have ventured into the business at all have doneso on much reduced foarce and on much cripeled reacourses. One of them has actually failed already and others contemplate changing from manufacturing to steming. Paul was advised several days ago by H.A. Wise not to engage in any sort of business as yet as he thought that pecuniary affairs would receive even a greater blow than any which has yet convulsed the country. I again reiterate my prediction that the eastern part of the state will raise rise in revolt against the western and will yet achieve its independence even though the rivers run in blood. My own wish is that the revolution may be bloodless but that depends upon the western section of the state. I contemplate going south on account of my business there and I may if I find that I like and that I can make money take up my permanent abode in a more congenial clime. I have talked with Mr. Dickenson about a setlement. He says that the estate can be readily setled and that it is now and has been since you were down here in the hands of commissioners. After that is settled I contemplate going south and not before. I can not come up now as this will occupy my time until it is entirely settled up. All are well. Hoping that all are well I remain as ever truly and affectionately your son.
