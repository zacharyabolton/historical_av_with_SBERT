Your letter was received on the 19th. I will send Franks gun up on monday by the express train. There is nothing talked about here but that all absorbing  subject secession. South Carolina has gloriously vindicated her honor. She has passed her ordinance of secession and henceforth the 20th day of December will be as glorious a day for the South as ever the 4th of July was to the United States. We speak now of the United States as of a nation that has passed away as of a government that has lived out its allotted time and passed away into the dim past. More glorious things are looming up in the now near future.  Enclosed I send your bill. Mr. D. gave me $25. I would send the change but it would not be safe I will bring it up with me when I come. As you see it is $2.85. Give my respects to all my friends. Hoping all are well I remain your affectionate son.
