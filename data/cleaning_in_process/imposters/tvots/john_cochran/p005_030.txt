Your letter is received. I will not trouble you with a long one in answer -- as I expect to come up on Friday. I will bring up the things mentioned by you. There is very little of the sort of news that you care to hear. The house to day passed a convention bill such as it is. I do hope that it will be amended in the senate and not come before the people the "namby pamby" affair it is now.  We have nothing new from Charlestown to night. But I expect there will be stiring times there in a day or two. I think it more than probable the Star of the West is in the ofing waiting for the Brooklyn who will take the troops on board and attempt to foarce a passage to Sumpter. If she does I pray God that the Carolinians may be able to sink her with all on board. And wish most fervently that Scott was on board to share their fate. He seems to have forgotten that he was (not is) a Virginian. All are well
