I am owing [unclear: Joshua] $24.90 balance on services rendered. He is owing me $20 for children's board and $3 for Table ware broken by self & children. I did not send for you to come to my house to settle with Joshua, but told him that you said you would attend to it today & that you would be round after a while--about dinner time.
