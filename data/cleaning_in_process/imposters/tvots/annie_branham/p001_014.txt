I did not give Joshua an order & shall not do anything further in the matter until the whole matter is investigated by disinterested persons. My accounts must be examined to see that they are correct. If so--I am not owing Joshua anything--If I choose to give him the board of the boys I can do so, but I will not be forced to support servants and take all their impositions passively.
