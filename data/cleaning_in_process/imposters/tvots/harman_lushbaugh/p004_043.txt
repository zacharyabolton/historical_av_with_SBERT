The day I received your letter I saw Mr Speck who had received one also. And it was the first time that I ever had heard any thing in regard to the potatoes. he (Mr. Speck) says he never agreed to to take them as pay for what you owed him he said it would not suit him. I never bought them from him as your little Son supposes, But very late in the fall I concluded to have them dug thinking that you intended me to have them as no one came to get them I also measured them to see how many they were so when I seen you if you did not intend me to have them I would payyou for them. There was six bushels and a half, you can write to me and let me know who I shall pay for them
