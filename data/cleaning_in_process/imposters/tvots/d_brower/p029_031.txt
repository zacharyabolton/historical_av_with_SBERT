I have the honor to request Transportation to Stanton, Va. for Henry Williams aged indigent Freedman now at this Hospital. He came to this Hospital for the purpose of being operated on for Cataract, which operation has been done successfully and he is now ready to return to his home. If Transportation is furnished him the Government will be relieved of the Expense of his Support.
