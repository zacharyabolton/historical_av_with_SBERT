I received your letter (with check enclosed) in which you requested me to state what part of my Bill was for expenses, and what was Salary. I thought my last letter was sufficiently plain except the absence of items and will now forward them herewith. I informed you in my last that as I came by way of Washington, and as that is a different Route from what you are sending Teachers, you may think it is advisable to make a deduction from my Bill if so, please do so.
