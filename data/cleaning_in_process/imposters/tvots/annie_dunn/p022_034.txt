Please find a Bill of my expenses from Calais Me. to Staunton Va. My whole bill amounts to thirty two (32) dollars, but as I came through Washington instead of Via Richmond (as you are now sending all of your Teachers), I presume it has cost me a larger sum, so whatever you choose to deduct from my Bill I shall be perfectly satisfied, as I certainly do not want to be any extra expense to the Association.
