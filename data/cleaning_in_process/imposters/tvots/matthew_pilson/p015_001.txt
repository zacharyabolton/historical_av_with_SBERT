I was in Staunton yesterday and failed to get Rev. Mr Stuard to preach on next Sabath, Rev. Mr See had just ingaged him for next Sabath, he is going to the Army, I saw Mr Baker sayes it will suite him to be with us on Saturday and Sunday of next week would like to be with his owen people on Friday, that is the understanding unless we give him further notice, he says he can come the next Sabath if that will suite us better, I did intend coming by your House on my way home, but having to go by Fishersville in the morning and the day being so very warm, I was unable to do so. In hopes you are improving.
