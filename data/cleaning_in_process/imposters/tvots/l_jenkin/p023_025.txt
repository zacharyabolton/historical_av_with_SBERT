I have received your kind invitation to attend your soiree on tomorrow night. I thank you very much for it. It would afford me great pleasure I know to attend, for I am a dear lover of music & like to see young people enjoying themselves, & I doubt not you will have both good music & much true enjoyment on tomorrow evening. But my duties here are such that it is impossible for me to leave [unclear: home] at this time; I have an appointment to preach at Mr [unclear: Ind.] R. Berry's tomorrow afternoon. Permit me, my dear friends, to say a word or two of earnest counsel to you, for I feel a deep interest in your welfare. Just one word in a general way. Always in all circumstances remember that you have characters as young ladies to maintain, & never permit yourselves to compromise in any way the gentleness, modesty, & kindness which should ever characterize the true lady. But especially never compromise in the least your christian character. You are the professed followers of the blessed Savior- always remember that, & act accordingly. The highest, & most precious ornament of a true lady is genuine piety. Live near to Christ then, my dear young friends - study diligently your Bibles - be faithful in prayer & in the discharge of every Christian duty. This need not, & should not mar a single pleasure, or make your faces less bright. Be cheerful- live ever gay - but let your cheerfulness & gaity be that which becometh & followers of Jesus. Let y not your gaity be boisterous or frivilous. May the blessed Savior bless you richly, & enable you to gr grace in the knowledge of the Lord & Savior Jesus Christ.
