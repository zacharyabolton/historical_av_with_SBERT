Will you please accept my resignation to take [unclear: affect] on the first of June of this year, as circumstances occurring since my departure from home render my presence there a necessity. I regret that I am thus unable to continue in the work until the end of the term now so near, but I think by dividing my school among other teachers, (as the schools, on account of many going to the country, are growing thinner) my pupils need not be without instruction for the rest of the term.
