Yours of the 5th inst. is red. The Report of your speech, an extract of which I sent you, certainly made "injurious reflections" upon me, and contained matter "personally offensive." This, now, you fully disclaim; and, of course, I understand you as not approving or sanctioning the Report. You know that Mr. Wells & myself are extreme antipodes. If he opposes the "New Movement" for reasons of his own, I oppose it for reasons opposite to his own. I oppose both Evils, and he one, and it is hard for me to say which is worst. If yours be the better of the two, the worst may, perhaps, be most easily escaped from. I will take neither. Either must be forced upon me, and I will not only contest it for life, but have the contest to be carried out by my heirs forever. I dont hold to your logic that it follows that the Enquirer & I must be wrong "because of the association we were thrown into." - We have been thrown into no association whatever with Mr. Wells. The Enquirer & I are doing, what you were doing but very lately, opposing both Wells and Negro Suffrage. You and he are now both advocating it, and you have joined him in yielding to the wisdom of Congress the whole "organic law" of this old State; and the Enquirer & I are continuing our opposition to you both. But, if "Noscitur a Sociis" is to be the test, and you dont desire to be judged by your companions, let me tell you there are worse people than Wells to beware of - people who are not Wells nor Wises - and you had better seek better company when you next visit Washington. Your very mission there throws you necessarily into bad "association, I say this in the most fair & friendly spirit of a comrade who by signing the Ordinance of Secession with you, on the 17th June 1861, counseled the people of Augusta to fight for their Constitutional Liberty and for their rights of Self-Government.
