I seat myself to drop you a few lines to let you know that I am well hoping these lines will come to hand in dew time & find you all well. I am at Stanton. Our Regment come from Winchester with 19 Hundred prisoners. We had a hard March from Winchester to Stanton. It is 92 miles they got on the cars for Richmond & part of our Regment went with them & we are staying here till they come back. We will then start back to Winchester & then on to Maryland I expect for our army is gong there now. There is prisoners coming our army is cuting a big swag at the present is the scale. Dont think we had a good time coming through the Valley. We could get milk & butter, plenty milk, 5 cents a quart & butter 50 cents per pound. I spent money every day for mild. I cannot tell you how much was captured from the Yankees at Winchester & Martensburg but it was a great deal of property & 5000 prisoners. I dont know of any thing strange to write that would intrest you so I will close with but few lines. I have stood this March only my feet blister & get very but they are getting better. I must close for the present hoping to see you this fall. Write soon & Direct your letter as before. I may get them I have Rec. one letter from you since you heard I got back to my Regment. I was glad to here you was all well.
