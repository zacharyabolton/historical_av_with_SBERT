I write this evening, to inform you that Wilson has run off, and may possibly be about Staunton or somewhere in Augusta. There has been depradations committed here from time to time, and the overseer found out to day that several fine fat shoats had just been taken and wanted to know something about the disposition of them, and at dinner time told all the servants to go to the stable and he would have an examination; all went but Wilson, and we did not know what had become of him until we found he had broken open the cabin where his clothes were and taken them off. You know he is such a sly negro that he may have more in his head than we know of. You can have an eye to it, as he may attempt to go farther than this neighborhood You know he was once taken up in Augusta and has so many acquaintances that he may be harbored without its being known that he has run away, or perhapse may aim for a free state. It is late and I must send this off to night. All are well and send love to you all. Write often.
