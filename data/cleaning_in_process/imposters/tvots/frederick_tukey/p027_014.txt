I have the honor to submit in compliance with Circular No. 6 C.S. 1866 the following report of Bureau Affairs for the month of March 1867. The freedpeople are generally getting along very well notwithstanding the unusual severe winter through which they have just past. The Overseers of the poor have assisted, to my knowledge, 21 cases of suffering among them, and about fifty ($50) Dollars worth of clothing has been distributed by the Bureau. I have had many applications for Rations that I could not supply, simply because I had none. And I would most earnestly recommend that Rations in small amounts be furnished for this Sub.Dist. for the temporary relief of the Aged, Sick, and infirm. Also I would again call your attention to the necessity of providing Medical attendence for extreme cases. Am of the opinion that an allowance of twenty five ($25) Dollars per month to some one of the local Physicians would cover all such cases.
