Enclosed herewith please find a List of Magisterial Dists. and voting precincts with their boundaries for Augusta Co. Va. as they stood in 1860 since which time no changes have been made. It will take at least ten days to get any thing like a correct list from Highland County. I have written to the County Clerk to forward me the list and as soon as I receive it will forward it to you.
