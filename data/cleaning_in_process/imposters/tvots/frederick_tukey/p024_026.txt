I have the honor to call your attention to what I conceive to be an act of gross injustice practised upon a colored man by one of the Magistrates of this town, under the new order for the trial of criminal cases, and in regard to which I wish to know if an appeal can not be made, in accordance with the wishes of the plaintiff,  the Courts having jurisdiction under the Civil Rights bill. The facts, as brought out upon the trial this morning, are these: on Sunday April 15th, two ladies called at the house of a colored man named Rafe Willis, who lived in the upper part of a house, leading to which, a flight of stairs on the outside is the common thoroughfare for the family of Willis, and also of two others, when these ladies were about to leave, they found the passage obstructed by the defendant, Charlie [unclear: Frayer] [unclear: (Mo)] who was upon the stairs in a state of intoxication, they went back to the plaintiff, Willis, and requested him to have the steps cleaned so that they could get down, he then went partly down to where the defendant was standing and requested [unclear: them] to get off the steps, telling them that if they did not, he would call some one to take them off. [unclear: Frayer] then [unclear: rushed] up the stairs after him, saying that he would have no d----d nigger insulting him, and made a violent attack upon him, driving him up the stairs and into his own, Willis', apartment where the as- sault was renewed and continued until the parties were separated by the intervention of a man named Gardner, who dragged the defendant away. Both parties appeared before the Magistrate this morning: plaintiff, with his face and lips cut and swollen, and the defendant apparently untouched, after hearing of the evidence substantially as above detailed, the Justice dismissed the case, by binding both parties to keep the peace for six months in a bond of $50.00 each.
