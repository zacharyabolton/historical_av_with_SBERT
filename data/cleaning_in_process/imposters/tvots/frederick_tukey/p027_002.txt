I have the honor to report in compliance with circular No. 10, C.S. 1866, the following cases of Criminal Trials in this Sub Dist. for the month of Feb 1867. 1 st  Commonwealthvs.John & William Bird. (Freedmen) This was a case in which the Defendants were arraigned before an Examining Court on a charge of Arson. - I consider the case to have been conducted in a spirit of fairness towards the Prisoners - Resulted in a verdict of acquittal for William and John being sent on to Circuit Court for further examination. And strange to say, the one who had confessed to his Counsel that he committed the deed, was discharged. 2 d  Commonwealthvs.Thomas Brent & John Curry. (Freedmen) This was a case in which both of the Defendants were arraigned on a charge of Petit Larceny, and resulted in the acquittal of both of the Prisoners. 3 d  Commonwealthvs.William Wilson (Freedman) This was a case, in which the Defendant was arraigned on a charge of Arson.-- Much doubt was felt by the Court about the Prisoner being "compos mentis" - and I am of the opinion, derived from conversation with members of the Court, that he would have been discharged, had they considered him a safe person to run at large. As it was, he was committed for further examination before the Circuit Court. Propose to call your attention to his case by special communication hereafter.___
