You will probably recollect that some 4 weeks ago I submitted to you through Prof. Woodbury, a [unclear: propposition] on takeing charge of one of your Mission Houses in Portsmouth. Since then I have moved to Staunton, whilst on my way here I again saw Prof. Woodbury and he desired to know if I should [unclear: start] one in S. on the same   I told him yes, he said he would consult you and give me an answer but I cannot hear a word from him although I  written to him since I went to N.J. Now will you please take the matter in Hand and give me an [unclear: immediate] answer. Staunton will be an [unclear: entire]  field of operations and will want about 4 teachers, and in order for me to carry out my propositions one of them must be Miss McLeane and both she and myself would be verry glad to have her sister, Mrs Dunn come with her. Now if you will answer at [unclear: once] you will greatly oblige
