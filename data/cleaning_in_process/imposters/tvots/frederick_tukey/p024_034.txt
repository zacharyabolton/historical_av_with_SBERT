I have the honor to request that transportation be furnished from this place to Warm Springs, Bath Co. Va. (or to such station on the Virginia Central R.R. as may be nearest that point,) for Betty Scott, a freedwoman, and her great grandchild Wm Nelson. The woman is very aged and infirm, and the boy is but five years old, diseased and a cripple; they were brought here by their mistress a year ago, and left in a destitute condition; her relatives all live in Bath Co., and are able to help her when she gets there, but cannot pay her fare on the Rail Road.
