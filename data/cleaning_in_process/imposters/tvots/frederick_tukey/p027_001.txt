I have the honor to submit in compliance with Circular No. 6 C.S. 1866 the following Report of Bureau Affairs in this Sub. Dist. for the Month of Feb. 1867. The Freedmen are generally at work, at an average rate of wages of ($10) ten dollars per month and board for males and ($5) five dollars and board for Females. There are but comparatively a few cases of extreme destitution among them. them, and these are generally confined to the Aged, Sick and Crippled, and those who have very large families of small children. About fifty person have been assisted, by the gratuituous distribution of Clothing, during the month sent here by the Pa. F. Union Com. There is a general complaint among them that they cannot collect their wages when due which of course is a great disadvantage to them, and the only assistance which can be rendered them by the Bureau  Agt.  is to draw off their Bills, and put them in the hands of an Officer for collection. And this often results in judgement being defered from one Court to another until their patience becomes exhausted, and perhaps their families suffer for bread. There is considerable suffering among the Sick, for want of proper medical attendance, and I would earnestly recommend the employment (by the Bureau) of one of the local Physicians, to attend to such as are unable, on account of extreme destitution, to pay a Physician. Am of the opinion that one could be employed at a salary of ($25) twenty-five dollars per month, who would attend to all such cases, and to this point I would respectfully invite your special attention.
