I have the honor to submit the following report of Bureau affairs for the Month of Jany 1867. About fifty complaints have been made at this Office during the present month by Freedmen, the most of which have been claims against Citizens for labor. some of which have been settled by  Warrent  Trials before Magistrates with but little satisfaction or justice to the Negro. Some by Refferees and some are still pending settlement. The White Citizen seem to think that the Black Man has no right to complain of his wrongs, no matter how grievous they may be he must bear them all in silence, and if he ventures to make them known it is a heinous offence for which he must be brutally knocked down and beaten with the first thing that can be gotten hold of. This is the rule. I am glad to say that there are honorable exceptions to it, and am inclined to the opinion that the old prejudices are slowly wearing away. This is manifest more particularly in their general demeanor toward the Colored Schools, and Teachers than in any other way, for both (I think) are treated with more respect than they were one year ago.
