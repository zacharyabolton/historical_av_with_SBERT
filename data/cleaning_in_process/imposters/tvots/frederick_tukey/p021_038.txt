Yours of the 16 inst. is received and in [unclear: hopely] I wish to say, that if American Missionary Society should decide to take Dist. No. 1 and my proposition cannot be accepted on that account, I wish you to see that Miss McLeane & Mrs Dunn are again Commissioned & sent to Portsmouth they filed their applications at John St. last May, and are both regular members of the M.E. Church and have been for years as their parents have been before them, and I understand have been laboring somewhat for the association this summer at home, and forwarded them some money as the results of said labor which I think should entitle them to some consideration. The children here in the Valley have never had a days schooling and I think should not be overlooked for the benefit of those who have had school the last three or four years.
