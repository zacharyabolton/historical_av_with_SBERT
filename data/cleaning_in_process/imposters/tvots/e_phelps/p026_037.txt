I am acquainted with F. S. Tukey Esq Asst. Supt. of the Freedmens Bureau, and it is my judgement that he is well qualified for the office, and I would not hesitate to recommend him most cordially for such position. I came to Staunton last March, and have personally known Mr Tukey for some months. I must also [unclear: bear] my testimony to the [unclear: officering] of Lt. Cook who lately filled the same position in this place. I esteem both the gentlemen named and so far as I know they are both good officers.
