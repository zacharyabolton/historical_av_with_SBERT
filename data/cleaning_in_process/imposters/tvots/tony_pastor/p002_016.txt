 It is now late in the night & we are in a dark & dreary part of the world, whith gloomy prospects before us - but not withstanding all these things, I will devote a few moments in answering your kind favor of Apr 13th which I received at New Market on day before yesterday. I hardly know what to write about, as we are now leaving our beloved valley to the mercy of the Yankees. But we have certainly left - & are now on our way across the Blue Ridge. I suppose to join Johnsons Army. In a few more days you may expect to hear of a big fight somewhere. I will not trouble you with any more war news at present. But will say a word in answer to something you said in your letter. You spoke of being forced to come to a certain conclusion but you did not say what it was. Well I have imagined to myself what that conclusion was & from what cause you came to it I am [unclear: truly] at a loss to know. You have made such declarations before & I assure you you do me great injustice. I hope therefore that you will give yourself no more uneasiness on that subject, unless it is your pleasure to do so - please excuse this hasty note & I will if [unclear: prompted] write you again at my earliest opportunity. I wrote you twice since I left but suppose you did not receive either from the [unclear: tenor] of your last. I must bring this to a close for the present with a hope (however faint it may be) of hearing from you soon again. But if the Yankees get up the valley so as to cut off communication Remember that you will still be remembered most affectionately by your absent friend  Tony_ The Boys are generally well & in fine spirits. My love to all & [unclear: recain] the same. Farewell for the present.
