 Yours of the 12th has come to hand. And believe me it was read with delight - as it was the first, & the only one, that I have received from any source, since Brother was down, so you may well imagine how eager I was to get some news, especially from one who I believe to be a friend if nothing more. I have little  news of importance to write you at present. I believe I gave you all the particulars of our late fights in my last letter. We are encamped within a few hundred yards of the Cave at present, have been here for several days. I often think of the time we were at this place, & of the appearance that some of our crowd presented on their way from the Hotell. Alass; one of our crowd is no more, he has gone the way of all the living. But we trust our loss has been his gain. Dr. Thompson & Lady were with us yesterday & today, preached for us at the Artiller Camp on yesterday, had a good Sermon. To day he listened to Dr. Dabney who preached in our Regt. Joining with him in prayer he left for home this evening & can doubtless give you a full history of camp life. I walked out this evening to see some of my friends & accidentally happened on Mrs Brownlee & Cousin Pitt they were at the 25 Regt. I saw John Mines Tom McClure & several other of our old neighbors. they all well - Sam l  Lightner started for home this evening he looks very badly indeed. Well I must close for the present, as I know you are tired of such stuf. If you all care any thing about us poor soldiers, just pick yourselves up & come down We will take great pleasure in handing you around. We may stay here for some time yet, & we may leave any time. Old Jack only gives us a moments warning. My love to all & receive the same.
