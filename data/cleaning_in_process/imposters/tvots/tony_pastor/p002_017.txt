 I take the privilege of writing you a few lines this morning as I am going up to the mountain to day. I have not heard from you for some time & have come to the conclusion that you have forgotten me but I hope youthis is a mistake I have seen hard times since I  last wrote you. we had a hard march the other day to Shepards Town about twelve miles from this place. we were in a terrible hail storm. I thought we would certainly be killed. but an over ruling providence was over us. I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Baggs last evening at twilight I was very much surprised & agreeably [unclear: too]. Sam is here but I have not seen him yet.  I wish I had time to write you a long letter but I must stop for the present. may heaven bless you. & may I be permitted to [unclear: return] again and have the pleasure of seeing once more the object of my affections. Lieut. Mc[unclear: Harry] is going home this morning on a furlough. If you want to hear all about the [unclear: Ferry] just go over to his house as soon as you get this & you'll heare all.
