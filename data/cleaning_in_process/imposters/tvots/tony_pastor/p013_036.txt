 As Jim Buck is going to send a letter by Ms. Fulton to you in the morning, I will take the privilege of dropping you a few lines. I wrote you immediately after my return to camp but from some cause or other, I have (as yet) not heard from it. Don't know whether you got it or not. Perhaps I mistreated you in some way other, If so, I ask your pardon. You know we promised to write every two weeks, which I fully intended doing. But if it is your desire (which I trust is not the case) to cease corrisponding I of course submit. I thank you very kindly indeed for the interest you manifested in my wellfare. I will close for the present, As I only write to know the cause of your silence. And if I have done you injustice I trust you will forgive me
