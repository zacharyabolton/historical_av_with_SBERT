 I will take this opportunity of answering your welcome note sent in Buck's note, which I received several days since. I would have answered it sooner, but we were expecting to move our camp every day & I thought perhaps that it would be some satisfaction to you to know where we would be  in the future, so I put it off untill the present. Well I suppose I can tell you where our winter quarters will be now. We are encamped about 3 Miles from Winchester, on what is called the "[unclear: Pear]town" road. We have been engaged for two or three days putting up huts. not withstanding this is the Sabath, a great many of our men worked all day at them. some building, some chopping & others dragging loggs. All seem to be anxious to get in to their new homes. I have nothing much, worth relating about our trip to Bath & Romney except to say that we had a hard time of it. It rained & snowed nearly every day during our entire march - wich was about 26 days. But I suppose Buck has given you all the news worth relating. from the time he joined us in Romney up to the present; so I'll not trouble you with it again. I was greatly in [unclear: hopes] that I would get home soon to see you & all the rest of my friends but it is a settled fact now, that this privilege will be denied - unless I reenlist. Well I think I can stand [unclear: through] my time out. & then I will make a strenuous effort to get there. With this, I will close for the present hoping that I may still hear from you. Yours truly.
