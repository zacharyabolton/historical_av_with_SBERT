 I embrace this my earliest opportunity of answering your very welcome, & interesting letter, which I received before leaving Centerville - We left there on friday about 2 oclock & arrived at the Junction about sun set - We then transfered our baggage to the cars & took the same for Strawsburg, where we arrived [unclear: Sun]day,  he D was any thing else, but a pleasant one; from the fact that we were so much crowded. I for one lay on the top of the cars & slept, but was nearly frozen all the time. Every thing passed off very agreeably, considering - no accident occuring save one - & that was truly sad. One of Capt Roberts men fell off the top of the cars & got nearly killed. he lived about 2 hours after they got him on the train. He was an Irishman by the name of OBryan, the rest of the Irish belonging to the company [unclear: after] we got to Strawsburg got as "tight" as they could get. (This you know is part of their religion, or their rule at least - which they strictly adhere to) Well, I cant say now, how long we will remain at this place or whether we will go into winter quarters - this will depend entirely on the movements of the enemy. It was reported before we left Centerville, that the Yankees were advancing toward this place. That there was a number of them in Martinsburg & [unclear: Romney]. Also Shepards Town. But this has turned out to be false; except at Romney. There are about 5000 at that place & are busily engaged fortifying. I am glad to inform you that I am not as corpulent as you heard, but still remain about the same - but not near so good looking as the Gentleman you spoke of. Lieut Mc says he would certainly would like to kiss that lady & you too. he sends his best love to you & all the [unclear: girls]. Mr Miller has recovered. Says he was in the same fix but you can return my love good wishes, & To Maggie &  tell them I would like to see them so much, also all the rest. Excuse this short letter, nothing more at present but remain yours as ever
