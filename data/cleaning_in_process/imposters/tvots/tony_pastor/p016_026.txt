 Not having an opportunity of answering your kind and very welcome letter after its reception, I now take the opportunity of replying in a short epistle, although I fear it will not prove very interesting, oweing to circumstances over which I have no  controll . I have been quite well since my arrival at this place, with the exception of a slight cold. The rest of the boys are generally well. Stuart Brown has received a letter from his brother John, they are all well.
