 I have just this morning finished reading your kind note sent by brother John, & as I am some distance ahead of the regiment I will drop you a few lines in return. I wrote you a day or two ago, but for fear that you did not get it I will send you a few more. I have been enjoying myself for two days very much. I met with Cousin [unclear: Pit] at the Augusta Springs & she requested me to bring her to this place to see Jim - which I did & by the way I am now in closer with the galls - all on her account however. We are on our way down the valley again, if the Yankees don't make us take the back track. I have not time to write much, as our regiment will soon be up. your friends are all well so far as I know. I have been unwell for two or three days, but since I have gotten into the valley. I feel perfectly well. I suppose it is from the past that I have been associated with the fair sex (at least) to some extent. I hope it may continue to exert that influence. I must close for the present. Will be glad to hear from you often.
