 I will hasten this morning to answer your kind letter, which was received through Capt. Stricke. Was glad to hear from you once more, & to learn that you were still in the enjoyment of good health, a blessing which is of all others the most desirable. I have nothing to write this morning that will prove at all interesting to you We have changed our camp since I last wrote you which is about all that is worthy of note. We were compelled to do so on account of the "Confederates" which became so numerous that we had to evacuate our camp in order to get rid of them. All is quiet in camp this morning, no news from the enemy for several days, hope they may let us rest this winter, and probably by spring something may be done to bring about an adjustment of things in general Jimmie Buck has gotten back to us again he looks like he hadn't fared much better than we have been doing. Since we left him [unclear: able] was left with our baggage at Jeffersonton in Culpepper County, where he remained untill we came to this place. Two more of our noble companion in arms have fallen victoms to the fell destroyer, since I last wrote you. Namely John M. Gabbest who was wounded at "Cedar Creek"- and Franklin Black who was left in the rear when we crossed the Potomack the first time not being able to keep up, his father reed a letter from a yankee Dr. stating the fact. I pressume he was taken prisoner. I will bring this short note to a close as the mail is about to leave. My health is pretty good with the exception of a bad cold. The weather is quite cool has been raining a little & looks like we may have more
