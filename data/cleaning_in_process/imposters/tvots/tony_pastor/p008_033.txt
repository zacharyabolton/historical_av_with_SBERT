I received your letter a day or two since, but as we had just arrived at this place & had not got fixed up, I could not answer it as soon as I would have liked. But I suppose it will make no difference to you. I will be able to give you more news now, than I could have done then. We have passed through many hardships since I last wrote you. Have been on picket one week, but did not see any Yankees. We have fallen back about fifteen miles from Mason & [unclear: Memsonip] hill where we were first on picket. On the first place we fell back to Fairfax C.H. to give them a chance to come on; but they did'nt seem to show any fight, for they would not come out in any numbers. We have now fell back to this place & are fortifying as fast we can. This is the best place to have a fight that I have seen since we left Winchester. We have heard  cannonading all morning in the direction of Falls Church. The Yankees are said to be advancing in large numbers, & it is thought that we will have a fight at this place probably in a few days. We have news this morning that there are upwards of 200,000 marching in this direction. If this is so, you may expect to hear stirring news from this point. in a few days "sure" - We have late intelligence that the Linconites are pouring into Kentucky in large bodies & it is thought that there will be a big fight there shortly. I tell you they seem to be coming in all around, with a full determination to subdue. But I trust they will be defeated. We place too much confidence in our Genls to think for one moment of being defeated; & believing as we do that we have God on our side - & "if God be for us who can be against us" Well I must hasten on to a close, for fear that I will prove wearisome. Liet. Mc. wishes to be kindly remembered to you & all the girls of his acquaintance. I would like to see you all with your "[unclear: lively] [unclear: wasley's]" on, or your "___ _______". there are 22 of our boys off on the sick list. I don't know whether they are all at home or not. Buck is one of the number. We have just this moment received an order to strike our tents & get ready to march. so I'll have to stop for the present.
