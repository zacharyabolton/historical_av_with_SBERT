I hope that you all may find protection from the good old citizens of Augusta - write me on the reception of this &  me all the  & how you are all getting along. the boys bother me so that I cant write so I'll git for the present you must keep all the boys in good spirits. I suppose some of my friends are glad that I am gone, & hope that I may never return - as there are some who have not much love for me. To them I hope you will give my best love.
