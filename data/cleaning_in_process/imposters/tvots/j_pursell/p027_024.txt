Yours of 9th inst. was Recd N. Johnson. Left some money in bank when he left here, be also left his wife poor and helpless, and our authorities ordered me to use the money for her benefit, which I did. There is about $19.00 yet in my hands, in currency, & the note on Alex. Anderson, not paid, I think it can be collected. I think Johnson acted badley towards, his wife, he sold everything he could, from her & left her destitute, I advised him not to go to Virginia, but stay with his wife, I think he was slightly deranged, when he left.
