Your esteemed favour of the 5th Inst is just to hand and in reply I herewith enclose your renewal receipts for Mr Imboden and the Messrs G & M Hirsh. You will see that I have issued recpt to Mr I. for $25 00  which is 1 1/4 % the amount suggested in my last letter. Your remarks relative to an increase of $2,000 on Messrs Hirsh' risk has been noted, and our board declines either to increase the risk or diminish the rates. We would be satisfied to take the risk on the lives of Dr. F. E Lucketes negroes provided they are proper subjects for Insurance. In order to Insure them you may select some Physician of standing in Dr L. neighborhood to examine them but he (Dr L) must pay the Examination fees, and we will allow him a credit of Fifty cents on each policy that being the fee we pay our Medical examiners. We will Insure the negroes to an amount equal to three fourths of their value provided it does not exceed Eight hundred Dollars the head. Have you declarations for such risks? if not, I will send you the requisite number, upon hearing from you. What is the prospect for that kind of business with you? it is increasing here very rapidly.
