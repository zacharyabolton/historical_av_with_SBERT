Your esteemed favour of the 24th Oct was received a few days since, but owing to the engagements of our President I was no able until yesterday to ascertain his views on the subject of your letter, and for this cause I hope you will excuse my seeming neglect. I am now instructed to reply, that the premium which Mr Chs G. Lowe will give (3/4 %) is considerably lower than our rates, at least so far as his shop is concerned. As to his dwelling house we think that at least 1/4% too low, but if that is the rate charged by other Company's we would take it. The shop is lower by 1 1/4% than any risk of the kind of which we have any knowledge, -- 2% is as low [unclear: as any] risk of this character is taken by us, but even at that rate, the building  fire proof, other wise the risk is worth according to circumstances from 2 1/2 to 5%, by most Co's such risks will not be taken, indeed they are desirable with none. From the above you can gather the views of our Co as to Mr Lowes risk, which I need scarcely add is at the rates proposed respectfully declined. Your remarks about Mr Imbodens risk has been under consideration, and although 1 1/2 % is as low as we have taken such risks, yet we are from our knowledge of the character of Mr I. willing to continue his risk at 1 1/4 % but we would be doing injustice to our other customers to reduce his prem to 1% when the very best risks of the character of Mr I. are taken for others at not less than 1 1/4 %. The risk of Messrs G. & M Hirsh expires on the 2nd and that of R H Phillips Presdt &c. on the 13th Decr. next. Should they desire a renewal I will send you renewal receipts upon being informed of the fact. I shall be pleased to hear from you frequently. -- November 1st 1853 --
