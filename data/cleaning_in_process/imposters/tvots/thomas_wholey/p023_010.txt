I have the honor to call your attention to the following statement of grievance which has and still continues to occasion me considerable loss and inconvenience. I have been a resident of Staunton Va for the last fourteen years by my industry I succeeded in purchasing a lot here in 1861 before I could build on it the Rebel officials took possession of it in 1862 for a camping ground and in 1864 erected thereon a Barracks for their soldiers, which they occupied until the collapse of the rebellion. During all that time I received no compensation for its use. After the surrender of Lee I took possession of it and ploughed the lot up and planted it. I also put there 2,200 twenty two hundred feet of lumber for building purposes in May when the U.S. forces occupied this place they took possession of the building for barracks because because it had belonged to the Confederate Government. The result was that every expense and labor in the fencing and lot were lost. Capt T. J. Farnsworth A.Q.M. also took possession of the lumber I had put there promising to pay me for it, but never did. Since July the 58 Pen Vols have used it. The Q.M. of the Regt informed me that he had no authority either to recompense me for its use or give me possession of the lot, since they left I learn that the building has been turned over to the Freedmen's Bureau and as the building remains on the lot, I am still deprived of its use. I enclose herewith a deposition taken before Capt. Thos Johnson Provost Marshall showing that I put the lumber referred to on the lot and also enclose a letter from Col Clay to the Q.M. of the 58 Pen Vols in relation to said lot. I am and always have been a Union Man and have been so considered [unclear: such] in my neighborhood. I have never been in the Rebel service nor any of my family. Hoping this will meet your favorable consideration.
