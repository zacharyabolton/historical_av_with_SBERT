I most respectfully beg leave to call your attention again to my Case. Some time ago I call on your at your office and showed you my papers, as also a letter from Miss Van Lew Regarding the Building that is on my lot and represented how I had been treated by the Military Authorities. You give me some consolation and assurance that you would dough all in your power. In my case, the power lay with you to dough so. I know address myself you as a christian and a justice loving gentleman to dough something for me. I am a poor man, unable to put my lot in the same condition that it was in when they took possession of it. There was good garden and also a fance on lot [unclear: I know it a common] I am to poor to fance the lot and consequently cant garden on lot. I am  man If you dont dough some thing for me I must earnestly request of you to give Mr Tukey your Agent here &emissary to leave me Lumber enough to put me up a Shanty and fanse my lot he Mr. Tukey is now having the Building taken away. I have been treated very badly there is not a man in this county as been treated half as bad as myself -- hoping you will give this your attention and dough some thing for me. Hoping to hear favorably from you
