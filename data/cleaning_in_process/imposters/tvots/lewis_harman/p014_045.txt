Your letter of the 15th has just been received & as I expect we will be marching soon I will answer it at once. I started Dear Tom's knapsack home on the 17th inst. in the care of [unclear: Ferd Callighan ] who took Uncle Ash's baggage home after his sad accident which I suppose you have heard of before this. I have also poor Tom's knife & Testament which I failed to send by Ferd on the 17, I will take good care of both & send them home to you by first opportunity. Unfortunately I did not see dear Tom on the morning after he died, as we moved forward at dawn in pursuit of the enemy, when I had gotten back in the evening he had been buried by a party of his Company who had been sent to bury the dear fellow. The poor fellow suffered very little Dear Cousin, & I am sure he died as I wish to die & all other brave soldiers fighting in our most just cause. When I see you which I hope will not be a very long time from this I will tell you all I know. You must excuse this short note, as I have not the heart to write after my late misfortune in loving my dear Uncle. Good by love to all
