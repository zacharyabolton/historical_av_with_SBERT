I received your kind note by Kent and will send a few lines in reply in his letter to you. After giving Kent an opportunity of seeing the Regt I recommended him to join the Wise Troop, now commanded by Capt. Wm Steptoe who promised me to take Kent into his mess with him. I consider him second to no man in my Regt. In every way a gentleman he looks after his men & sees their wants are supplied. Your noble boy I am sure will do well and you may rest assured that any assistance that I can give him will be cheerfully rendered. If he needs anything at any time I will see that he is provided for. [unclear: For the] cavalry have to carry all they have on their horses and have but few wants. I think we will have an active campaign and hope the vandals may soon be driven across the Potomac again. With my kindest regards to Mr Langhorne, Lizzie & all of the little ones believe me very truly
