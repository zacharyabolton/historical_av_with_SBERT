In Capt. McDonnell's temporary absence, I inclose new sets - [unclear: vouchers] for schoolroom rest at Staunton, presuming that if new Lease is approved, the old one will be rescinded, from date of new one, please state if that is the intention. As a precautionary measure, please send the other set of vouchers receipted as well as them and return them by first mail. If the schools are to be closed all summer, I doubt if it will be thought best to pay $25 per month for an empty room till Fall. Please give my regards to Mr. Tukey and family.
