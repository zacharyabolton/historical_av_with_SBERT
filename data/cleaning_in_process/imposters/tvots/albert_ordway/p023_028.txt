From my letter book it appears that the letter concerning the two colored children for whom I advertised was written by Mrs. P. Marshall, Antrim Township, Franklin Co. Pennsylvania -- their Mother who stated that the children were carried off by some rebel soldiers. I have not the original letter on file as it was returned through Gen. Smith's office, July 5, '65
