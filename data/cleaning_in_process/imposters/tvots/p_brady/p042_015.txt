Any prospect of selling the Bath property I have a party here who is very anxious to see a specimen of the ores & in case he is pleased with them, he will go down and examine the property in which case I will give him a letter to You, no doubt Brady could furnish specimens if he felt disposed to do so, have you applied to him in the matter,
