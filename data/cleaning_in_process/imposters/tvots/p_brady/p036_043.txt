I beg to say that in Case Danl Brady will carry out his offer of Sep 3. Shortning the last four payments I will accept, giving him a full discharge from all further Claims, returning him two notes of 2500 each and a release as Guardine of my Children, he says the property of my Children passed into my hands, not so. it went to pay the debts of P. Brady & Co. after I was robed, I make the offer to accept his proposition now as I am pressed by my  for monies due them If you can get 5000 in good bonds as the proposes in June so much the better I would prefer an amicable settlement if it can be had on a fair basis, and trust to him to do more when he succeeds with his pattent, it is understood thus he is to pay your fees & all charges incured thus far
