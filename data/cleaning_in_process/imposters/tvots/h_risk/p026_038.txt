In my examination befor Capt. McDonald, in the case of charges against F. S. Tukey Supt of the Freedmen's Bureau at this place, I neglected to say that, at the time Lt. Cook was relieved several Freedmen in conversation about a petition then in circulation for the restating of Lt. Cook told me that they had no objection to Mr Tukey, what ever one, (Rev Ephraim Lawson) told me that he was opposed to the thing, that Mr Tukey had always been kind to the colored people and that he had shown a great deal of interest in the School for Freedmen &c. I will also say that I repeatedly heard that while Lieut Cook was here as an officer, he spent a great deal of his time in business hours in the Billiard Saloon in company with citizens who usually frequent such places of amusement. William Howard a freedman, who lived with me and was a scholar in the School, quit, giving to me as a reason that the Teachers (except Mrs. Dunn) were inattentive and that consequently he was not learning -- he is about 17 years of age, and very sprightly.
