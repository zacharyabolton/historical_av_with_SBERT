My report for the month of March has been delayed by the miscarriage by mail of several of the teachers' reports on which I depend for statistics. In the portion of my district which lies in your Department we had in operation eleven schools located as follows: at Lexington, three, at Staunton, four, at Harrisonburg, two, at Woodstock, one, at Front Royal, one. Whole number of pupils enrolled in day schools, (671) six hundred seventy one, with an average attendance of (544) five hundred forty four. The night schools averaged (259) two hundred fifty nine. The numbers diminish as the season advances.
