Enclosed you will find a letter from Chaplain Manly, which will explain itself. It is impossible for me to go to Staunton, for several days to come, perhaps for a week or more. I see no other way but to ask you to attend to it. You know the circumstances nearly as well as I do. It is my opinion that we had better ask for $300.00. I know of no building that is at all suitable that can be had in the future. If Mr. Lawson's church is not willing to give the necessary security, perhaps it may be well to help the African Methodists, who are trying to build, up near our house. If you need my name for anything if it will do, Miss Everbeth may syne it to anything that you and she aprove.
