I am surprised to find that your letter is dated so far back as Oct. 19. I suppose Mr. Scott is at Staunton, so you are relieved of the immediate charge of the school. If Mr. Scott uses the articles you purchased in connexion with his school. I am certain that the A.M.A. will pay for them. If I think the National will do the same. I hope [unclear: she] in Staunton in two or three weeks. I hope the school is prospering, and the "School house" under way.
