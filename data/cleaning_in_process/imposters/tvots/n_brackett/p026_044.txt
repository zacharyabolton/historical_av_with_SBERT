I have the honor to report that the schools in my district have been in successful operation during the past month. We have opened one new school in Charlestown W.Va. with two teachers, one at Woodstock Va. with one, since the beginning of the year '67. I have not yet received a report from Woodstock. Without it, the number of pupils in our day schools, at Staunton, Lexington, Harrisonburg, Front Royal (Va.) and Harpers Ferry, Martinsburg, Charlestown and Shepherdstown (W.Va.) is eight hundred sixty seven, average attendance six hudnred thirty six, average attendance at night schools, three hundred thirty one. We have met with no opposition from citizens during the last month, whilst we have urgent application from difference places to open more schools both for colored and white children.
