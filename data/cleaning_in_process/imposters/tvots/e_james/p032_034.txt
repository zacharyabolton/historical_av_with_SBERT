One barrel marked No. 2480 and two boxes 2481 and 2482 were 'Shipped' to me from New York on Sat. the 10th of this month in the Steamer 'Isaac Bell,' Gov't Trans. to Richmond, to go from there to Staunton, by railroad. The Ass'n directed them to the care of John Scanton, supposing he lived in Staunton. He is known there, but lives here, has been long a resident of this town, is a Union Man (Irish.) but respectable. Will you be so kind as to haul them up for me and send them on as speedily as possible? Not by express, if it is possible to send them without delay in a less expensive manner. Do you hear from Mr. Scott? the gentleman who was to teach the colored people. My school prospers finely. I have sixty two scholars and expect many more soon.
