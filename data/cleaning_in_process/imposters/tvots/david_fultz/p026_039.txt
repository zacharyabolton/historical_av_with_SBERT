With surprise I have learned that complaints have been lodged against Mr Tukey in connection with the Freedmens Bureau at this place. I made the acquaintance of Mr T. very soon after he first came to our town; and my Office being in close proximity with his, and having frequently attended professionally to [unclear: business] which came up before him officially, I had a better opportunity perhaps than any other person to view his conduct both as a private citizen and a public officer. And it is but justice to say, that his course has given universal satisfaction to all colors and all shades of party. He has happily mingled a spirit of moderation and conciliation, with a [unclear: firm] upright and impartial administration of justice to black and white, loyal and disloyal. I am satisfied that no man could [unclear: accept] that office who would be more acceptable to our people without regard to color than Mr T. I am not the less qualified to judge of the conduct private and public of Mr T. because of the [unclear: sentiments] I have [unclear: entertained], and maintained in relation to the rebellion. I never have had but one opinion on that subject, and that was, that such folly and wickedness never was exhibited in any age by any civilised people. This opinion I have expressed on all suitable occasions, for which I have been frequently insulted and threatened with personal violence. After the order directing a Freedmans Court, I was selected by the Freedmen to attend to their interest in said court, but owing to my professsional engagements I had to decline. This would show that I had their confidence, and never having heard a solitary complaint from any one of them, I take it, that there could have been no cause for it.
