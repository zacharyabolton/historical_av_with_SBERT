At a meeting of the citizens of the county on the last court day they passed a resolution that no one should hire the servant of another without the written permission of his master and as I had done so on the verbal statement of your servant that such permission had been granted but without having any written permission from you I at the request of the Boy write that he may get your consent to hire to me if you dont want him yourself. I have a great deal of work to be done and am in very great need of a hand being myself very weak handed. The neighbors are very much down on me for hiring him under the circumstances but I assure you I did it in good faith not intending anything wrong towards anyone.
