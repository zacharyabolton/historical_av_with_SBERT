You have been highly recommended to us by Miss Eliza Stanton, & we are very anxious to secure your services. We will give you a permanent situation if you are contented to remain with us. We have been giving a dollar a week. I will give you that if you will come. That is the price generally asked here. If you will come & have no way to come, tell my son what day you will be ready to come & we will send for you. Please come as soon as you can. I think you will be contented to stay with us: but if you are not after you shall be here awhile we will send you home so that you shall be at no expense. Come this week if possible & the sooner the better. You had better drop me a few lines lest there be some mistake as to the time you can come.
