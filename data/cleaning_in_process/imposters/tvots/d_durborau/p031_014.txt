Mr. Potter called with me this morning and requests that you go to Col J B Baldwin and request him to draw up the deed for the Lot No. 20 so that he can have his brother Joseph and wife Susan, Sampson & wife Sarah sign with him bounded by R. Turrel on the East. Brown on the west. Turnpike on the North & an alley on the South, etc.   I will take this occasion to state that this lot is not is not one on which the the house was burnt as I represented to you but adjoining it on the West. I was not aware of this until this morning and perhaps it would be as well if you would come and see before purchasing, yet in my opinion the lot is a cheap one. Do however as you think best.
