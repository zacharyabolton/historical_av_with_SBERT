You have no idea how glad I was when your dear letter was handed me. I thought I was entirely banished from your memory but your kind letter gave me understand that there is still place a place in your noble heart that sometimes promts you to think of me. Well in the first place I will tell you how it is looking in [unclear: camp] this day it looks and feels very much like snow it has been raining for several days hope it will cleare off soon for I get so tired in doors all the time I am so glad spring is so nigh most ever person are  but one deep  has been scarce, I took one good sleigh ride You wanted to know what kind of xmas I spent. I had a very happy time went to an xmas tree it was a very grand one but there wasent a present for me wasnt that too bad, but one consolation it was out of the neighborhood & wasent disapointed You bet I would like to see your little boy but would rather see my darling Friend I so often think of him I can hardly wait untill you send me there Photoes I will have some taken next Fall if I live & will send you one I guess I will get a letter from you about that time is Rose B staying with you now? wish I could step in and have a long chat I could tell you so much more than I can write but as we are deprived of that
