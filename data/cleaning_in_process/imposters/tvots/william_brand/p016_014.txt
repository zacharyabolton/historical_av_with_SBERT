I take the present opportunity of answering your letter of the tenth. I was truly glad to hear from you But alas it bore tidings that went like poisind misles to my heart I have set down before for the purpose of writing to you; but my heart failed me, And now with a sad heart, I attempt to drop you a few lines, My health is very good, this I sincerely hope may find you enjoying both health and hapiness, I have no news of moment; worth your attneention so you must look for an uninterresting letter You may well imagine my heart is full to over flowing; you ask me if my K -- would prove faithless towards me could I forgive her. Dear Kate you know that I have a forgiving heart If you should learn to love another man better than me; or that you could enjoy your future hapiness better with your first lover than with boor W. I would be heartless not to free you & forgive you; though I could never forget or seace to love you. To harber such thoughts as I have alluded to above make me feel miserable: To think that my first love should be rect or thrown away on one fair to good for me, one that is good pure & virtueous who made vows unto me while her first love seemed to be dieing away, Then after a long time she again meets him: & her old love is rekindled for him, & she to good and kind to hide it from me has opened her hold heart to me And asks me what she ought to do under such circumstances Dear Kate what kind of an answer can I give but pray Almighty God to help you to prove true to who ever you love; best; I am resined to the will of providence Dear Kate if you should ever learn to forget me I pray thee to never boast of having fooled me; thareby ading pain to a true but wounded heart, if you should sease to love I would have nothing to live for in this world; I dont see that I should desire to live out this war But would be wiling to throw my self in danger of the misles of death that I might quit this frail world & be at reast I will change this; to me; painfull subject. I hope that you are happy and are trying to interrest your kind & docile Brother that is now with you. I hope he may enjoy evry hour of his short stay at home.
