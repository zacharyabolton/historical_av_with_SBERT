I recieved your much welcomed letter a fiew days ago and now seat my self to drop you a fiew lines. My health is very good & hope this may find you enjoying the same blessing. The health of the Com. is very good at presant. We have evacuated Camp [unclear: Zollicoffer] & Campt in a half mile of Winchester. I believe that we are going to evacuate Winchester, as thay are mooving all the Guvernment property pack to Strausburg & all the sick are hurryed back. It is reported that the Yankees have posession of Martinsburg, Charles town & Berryville but I do not believe it and still hope that we may be ordered back to our Cabbins before long. The question was asked our Com yesterday, whether we would enlist for the war or not. Thirty five enlisted for the war the remainder say thay will stand the draft. I am no longer a volintier but a regular for the War be it long or short & my prayer is that the God of Nations may keep me as the apple of his eye. I will look to him at all times for he is able to save in the darkest hours of peril. It is an assurance most dear to know that he will not forsake those that put thare trust in him. I was very sorry that your Brother did not reinlist as I would like to have his Combany as a gide through this tempestuous world of war. I suppose thare is a grate deal of excitement in old Augusta at this time on account of the draft that is to be made this month. I hope that it may hit some of the speculators & hope I may have the pleasure of getting home on furlough before long. I would like very much to see you. Remember me in your prayers, that I may hold out faithfull to the end. Write soon.
