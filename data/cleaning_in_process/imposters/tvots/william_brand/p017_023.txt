I recieved your letter the first, Truly was I glad to hear from you. But it did not my consience reprove me for neglecting the idle of my heart. My dear Kate forgive me for I shall never forget thee or ever seace to love thee, It has been my constant wish to be with thee for the last two weeks I hardly know what has kept me from thy side so long. with out it is that you are at a strange plase to me & your sister being unwell Dear Kate I know thy generous heart has been severly tried of late & if I am spaired I will soon be by thy side to make thee happy if I can; be cheerfull be happy. If I am spared you shall never lack a friend or lover I will come up to see you next Monday if you think it advisable for me to come up. I know you have no lady friend on the plase & your Brother in law is no doubt very busy this time of the year I will come up Monday & if you think it advisable I will stay a day or two, God nows I would like to stay longer but it might not look well. I would write more but I have a chance to send this to the office so it may reach you tomorrow. Your Brother was well the last time I hurd from him. Bro. J is still safe My health is very good My wound is nearly well. all that makes me sad is to think my darling Kate is so dispondent fear not God knows I love thee & I hope to be blest with thee
