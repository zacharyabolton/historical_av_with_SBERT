Tis said that absence conquers loveBut oh believe it not.I've tried alas its powers to prove,But thou art not forgot.Lady though fate has bid us partYet still thou art as dear-As fixed to this devoted heartAs when I clasped you here.I plunged into the busy crowd,And smiled to hear thy name,And yet as if I thought aloudThey know me still the same.And when the wine-cup passes round,I toast some other fair;But when I ask my heart the soundThy name is echoed thare.And when some other name I learnAnd try to whisper love,Still will my heart to the returnLike the returning dove;In vain I never can forgetAnd would not be forgot,For I must bear the same regretWhatever may be my lot.Even as the wounded bird would seek,His favorite bower to dieSo lady I would with you speakAnd give the parting sigh.If other guests should come I'd deck my hairAnd choose my newest garments from the shelfWhen though art bidden I would clothe my heartWith holist purpose as for god him self.For them I wile the hours with tale or songOr web of fancy, fringed with careless rhyme,But how to find a fitting lay for thee,Who hast the harmonies of evry time.God bless you darling when the mornShames far away the mist of nightAnd trails above the waving cornHer gorgeous glory robes of light.God bless you when the sunset tintsWarm the high battlements of heaven,As day a fond warm kiss imprintsUpon the gentle brown of even.God bless you may your sleep be sweetAnd fraught with bright & peaceful dreams.And waking may your youthful feetTread mid lovers flowers by Crystal streams.Oh friend beloved, I sit apart and dumbSometimes in sorrow, oft in joy divine,My lips will falter, but my prison'd heartSprings forth to measure its faint pulse with thine.
