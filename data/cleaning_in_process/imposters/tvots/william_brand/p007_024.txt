I recieved your kind and most welcomed letter by the Capt. I was most happy to hear from you all my health is very good, and when this comes to hand I hope you may be enjoying the same; the health of our company is inproving smartly for the last two or three days and I hope before long we may all have good health and ever after. Your friend Jimmie V. is enjoying good health he is on duty to day. John sends his love to you he just know came hear and laught at me for keaping my hand over the wrighting. I will hafto stop writing at this time Saturday. This is the 15th day of July. I had to stop writing the other day for to go on battalion drill and it was my time to go on guard duty for Twenty four hours and this morning we ware drilling and again I have a fiew moments of leasure time I will write. I have not had the opportunity of seeing Mr JPL yet we are often parted hear for some times two or three weeks. I do not feel like writing this eavning and thare four you must excuse me if I may write a short letter. I suppose you all have hurd a crorect account of the skirmish of the 2nd of this month thare was but little loss on our side. The report is hear that we killed from Two fifty to three Hundred of the Yankees. That is the statement of one of Pattersons aids if all Johnsons force hear fights like the 5th regament did on the memorable seckond we will soon whip all the Yankees back into Maryland that is all that would escape the wiry arm of the South. We just now recieved orders to draw three days rations and cook one days it is said that the enimy is marching against us it may be so but it is sirtainly to thare loss, for our force now nearly eaquels thares and we have the most artilery ond our side we have some twenty stationed pieces and some five or six flying Batterries and all commanded by as brave as the bravest all the Southern troops are as eager to fight seemingly as they are to eat. It seems to me that will soon whip our enimies if our offices Just let us have a trial at them. I got acquainted with a gentleman by the name of Brand he is from with a lieutenant in the Withville company he said he never saw any one of the name of Brand before that was not relations he seemed to be very glad to see me and on parting invited me up to see him he is a docktor lately from Richmond & I think he resembles Cousin Joseph Brand some what I think he is about twenty eight years old from his looks. I shall call on him some of these eavnings before long. Cousin Abe is writing close to me we have a hard way to write hear. I have not had time to have my likeness taken yet put if ever I get whare I can posibly have it taken I will do so. I hope it may not be long untill peace may be made between the Confederate States and the corrupted north the drumbs are loudly beating know and some of our regiments have taken up the march towards our enimies. They are with in twelve miles of us and it may not be long untill death may step between us put if so I hope not for ever. I'll put my trust in the God of battles for he is able and willing to save those that put thare trust in him. I recieved a letter from Miss [unclear: Matit] she told me in her letter that you ware up thare to see her it is useless for me to write any more at preasent. I will inclose a pieace of poetry for you. I Dreamed of theThy head was on my sholder leaningThy hand in mine was gently pressedThine eyes so soft and full of meaningWare bent on me and I was blestNo word was spoken all was feelingThe silent transport of the heartThe tear that over thy Cheek was steelingThen told what could never impartAnd could this be a mear delusionCould fancy all so real seemAre fancys scenes but wild confusionAnd can it be I did but dream of theI'm sure I felt thy forehead pressingThe very breath stole o'er my cheekI'm sure I saw those eyes confessingWhat tongue could never never speakOh no tis gone and never neverFor me such waking joy may beBut I could sleep would sleep for everCould I thus dream of thee
