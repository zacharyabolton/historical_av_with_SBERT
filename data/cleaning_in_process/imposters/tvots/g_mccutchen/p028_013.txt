In regard to the appointment of Registers in this County, has any move been made yet that you know of, and has my petition to the Board been forwarded? I hope you & Capt. Tukey will intercede for me in the matter. I should have called to see you before now but for planting out a little crop Corn. If it is necessary for me to see you before I can be appointed as a register please drop me a few lines in the Post Office.
