I find that I have received the appointment of register at large for this county. Be so kind as to inform me when I shall qualify as register & before whom and any suggestions you may make to me will be kindly received. I received yours of recent date and will say that the Estate of John [unclear: P. W.] McCutchen will not be settled up for some time yet and you will have time to investigate the validity of Henry Alexander's claim fully before it is settled. hoping to hear from you by return mail
