Cousin Ash just told me that Claborn Mason was going hom tomorrow and I though the best way I could occupy my time was to would be to write you a few lines the sun is going down and camp is in quite a stir about rool call and lauging about the men who fell of their horses today on drill. When sent my horse home I commenced rideing a yankee horse I had captured in eastern virginia which I traded Ash Garber & then traded traded with cousin Asher & I have traded again with a man in (Co. I) for a large bay horse which was captured in Pensilvania so I am now well mounted. Tell ma that the pants I have are all torn up and tell her to send me a pair by Mason if she can if you can't get any cloth I can get some here for  five dollars ($5) Tell Sister Addie that I like the shirt very well she sent me by Capt. Eskridge and tell her that if she wants to write to cousin Martha that if she sends it down to me I think I can send it for her You must excuse this short letter as I did not know it in time to write before dark give my love to Ma & the girls and ask sister Seal if she ever got my letter and if she did why dont she answer it write soon to your son
