I recieved your letter today and as Cousin Fanny is going down to see you Cousin Tom this evening I thought I would answer it right off and set you a good example. I will thank Cousin Sally and the rest of them for sending your the jacket, &c. The company which Ned was Elected 1st Leuit. in is called Southern Fencibles hard run for names they have not been mustered into service yet but expect to be in a few days. Ned had been rideing around the county getting more volunteers. They have not enough men yet to mustered into service but will have this week. Mag Garber is not here but is in Charlottesville or somewhere near there. Will be here in a couple of weeks. I will give her a kiss for you and ask too if you want me to excuse this short letter as I have not time any more.  Ma told me to ask you if you wanted any writing paper and if you did to write soon and tell her.
