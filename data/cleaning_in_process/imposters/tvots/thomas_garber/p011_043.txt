 I received your letter of the 1st yesterday and I set you a good example by answering it promtly you complain of my not writing home often enough I acknowledge I do not but still I write as often as I can for the last three weeks we have been continually on the march night and day some times not seeing our wagons for four or five days then we had to live on the country people I saw Asher and Mike yesterday they were booth looking very well said they had not heard from home for some time. I dont think Mary land will go with the south I think more than two thirds of the people are Union any how they are were in the part I was in it is true as we passed along we would meet a Secesh family here and there but they were scarce. I never want to go back again. I would like to go through Penselvania but I dont want to stop in Mary land five minutes longer than I can help. Has Capt Eskridge got to Staunton yet I wrote home by the boy that drove his wagon. Tell Pa he owes me a letter so does sister Kate for that knife I sent her give my love to Ma, Pa, Kate, and sister Elen and write soon to your Brother
