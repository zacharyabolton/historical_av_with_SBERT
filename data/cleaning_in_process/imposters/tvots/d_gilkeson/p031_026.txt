Yours written and mailed wednesday 21 st  and postmarked same date reached Staunton Saturday the 24 th  that shows the importance or advantage of living near the R.R. where we could hear from one another so quick. My dear brother I am very sorry to hear of your having another dry season and another failure in crop. You have been truly unfortunate in that respect for the last few years I dont wonder at your having an desire to leave. It seems to me were I in your place though I dont like to advise I would try and rent out my land to some good reliable man that would take care of the place and keep it up and would try and get into some safe and honourable buisiness for a few years, some buisiness that would pay better than farming, I think I told you when I was there that I thought you had a turn for the nursery buisiness if that would suit your taste you might pay us a visit and get an insight into the buisiness and see what you could do this man Davis who has a nursery near Staunton has made a great deal of money. he and Tom Calbreath went into the buisiness together below Richmond were raising peaches and sending to the New York Market I think before the war and were making money at it by the way [unclear: J.] Calbreath has turned out badly is carrying on a distillery on the old place and is in the habit of drinking himself A great many persons think there is nothing to be made here farming now when labour is all to hire but when we are so successful in cropping as we have been this year I think we can make something although our expenses are very heavy there was finer crops of wheat made in this country this year than has been made before I suppose for ten years and then we may calculate again for ten years more there wont be near as large crops of corn made as there was last year My crop started very badly in the spring and I had almost despaired of a corn crop this year but rains set in about the right time and has been showery so I will make a good-deal of corn having cut about 40 acre if frost keeps off long enough though last night was very cool and so is to night I saw John Hamilton to day and he said there was frost last night said there could be no mistake about it that he examined closely and saw some on clover but there was certainly none to do any damage, but I dont like to hear of it am affraid it may come before corn is out of the way of it The health of our family is generally good though I have been suffering for a few days past with one of my spells but hope it is now wearing off Willie has been unfortunate of late snagging his feet on nails has been poulticing them some they are now better they dont keep him from running about all he can if he has to limp, he and Emma were both terribly long about writing I have been at them all week about but they never done it until this morning when I told them they must do it to day so they went at it Sallie has not taken up her school yet as she wanted to visit some while not teaching but will take up in a few days I suppose, talking of going up one day next week to see [unclear: Frank] Gilkeson and his new bride he was married a few week ago some day who lived near him in Culpeper said to be quite inteligent and refined but not rich, A letter a few days ago from Carrie to Sallie she writes quite discouraging is anxious for W m  to leave I dont wonder at her, I believe it will be all the same to James he will get along by himself about as well as with any lady he can then have every thing his own way. My paper is full give our love to all friends and write soon to
