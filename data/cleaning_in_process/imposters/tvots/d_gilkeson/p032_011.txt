After 8 O'Clock at night and after helping to peal 2 Bu. of peaches since supper I set me down to answer your last which was received several days since I am happy to inform you that we are all well, I have been very busy for the last two or three weeks more so I believe than usual trying to get through seeding finished yesterday sowed about 50 acres of wheat, and 8 or 10 acres of ryes Must try and top corn next week and then haul wood from white hill for two or three weeks which will be about the last of October must then thresh at home  and by that time must go to gathering corn so my hands are full until christmas We have a great quantity of apple this year and peaches too we are buying all we can want to take some 8 or 10 Bu. to town tomorrow they have been selling for a dollar a Bu. I understand [unclear: J.] Culbreat was in this morning with about 20 Bu. which he sold for  I have been trying to keep the fruit from wasting any more than I can help have made about 5 [unclear: Blls ] of cider which I intend for vinegar which if I can sell for even 20 cts  a gallon which is a low price is better than to let the apples not want to make 3  Barrels yet must put away 2 Barrels for drinking Mary has made 1 kettle of Pear butter and one kettle of Peach butter and want yet to make 2 kettles of apple butter my young orchard is bearing this year the Baldwin and [unclear: Halawater] are a large fine looking apple the Domino is also a fine apple the trees are full they grow in clusters I wish you could be here to see them and to enjoy them this winter when they get good to eat The children are well and seem to be enjoying themselves wonderfully I dont know what to do with them there heads seem to be so full of play I am affraid they dont get along so well with their studies they think so much about play I proposed to them to night to give up their Arithemetic and play altogether and see if that would not do them as well when they come to be grown but none of them would agree to that Willie said if they did not understand arithemetic some person would cheat them Mrs Dabney was here several days ago was very much struck with Willies likeness to father said she has noticed him at church [continued on side of page] and remarked that he must be a son of mine or some near kin as he was the very image of father, he took a horse over to [unclear: H G G.]  Mrs D to come over she said she knew him whenever he came from his likeness to father, I think I shall take willie with me to town tomorrow [continued side of first page] I believe I had better take him away as much as I can when they are out of school to try and get their minds off of play so much We have never had their linkeness taken yet [unclear: last] will the first opportunity perhaps may have willie's taken tomorrow, they said yours was not a good one Willie said at first he did not know it but I think he was joking I think it was a tolerable good one the children I believe have written my paper is about full [unclear: excuse] 1/2 sheet as I have been so busy that I have not had time to write in daytime We are to have an election of elders in our church next sunday but dont know who will be elected [unclear: H.G.G] John Guthrie D. S. Bell and Mr Van Leas are the present elders Mr Van Leas talks of resigning on account of his age I am affraid it will be hard to make a good selection [continued side of last page] Will add no more but would pray that the richest blessings both spiritual and temporal of our heavenly father may rest upon you and yours
