I worked for two months for Captain Miles Trice from Waynesburow before Christmas, and he promised to pay me $12, I have been to him several times and he won't pay me any thing I offered to take it in wheat but he wont pay any way I am living with Mr. Harden now been here four or five months and it is a buisy time with him he is about threshing his wheat and cant conveniently spare me at this time So I thought best to write to you immediately as Cpt Trice expects to go away the 16 of this month. I would be glad you would take some action on it as I worked hard for it and am wanting the money.
