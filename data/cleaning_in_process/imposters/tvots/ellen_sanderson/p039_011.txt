One Beverly White, colored, living in this place for several years past, asks me to write you to know whether transportation could be furnished by the Bureau to his wife & 2 children living at Mount Meridian Augusta County Virginia to this place. He left there seven years ago and now wants to get his family to this place, his home. Will you please advise me what the Bureau can do for him & oblige
