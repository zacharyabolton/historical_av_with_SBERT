Catherine Cox, colored, this day personally appeared before me, a notary public for the County of Augusta & state of Virginia, & made oath: That she was employed in F. S. Tukey's family during the winter of 1866, as house servant, & during the time I recollect distinctly of his going to Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Virginia on the day the last United States soldier left here & of his bringing home a supply of commissary stores, among which were tea, coffee, sugar, soap, [unclear: beef], candles, & a barrel of pork & salted mackerel, the two last  together. Thats when Mr Tukey left home he did not tell Mrs Tukey anything about his intent to go, & she was somewhat [unclear: anxious] consequently about him, & that affiant & some of the teachers laughed at her, & remarked in a joking manner that her husband had run away from her. That when the articles already named were unpacked, it was found that the coffee & sugar, being in the same box, were mixed, & that said Tukey spent some time in trying to separate them, one from the other. That one of the teachers, who was present when the mackerel was taken out from among the pork, remarked that she hated mackeral, & always did: That Mrs Tukey also remarked that she was sorry they were put together, as she was affraid the pork would taste of the mackeral. That affiant also recollects distinctly that Mr Tukey separated them, putting the mackeral into a  barrel, & then putting whole into his cellar, where he always kept the government rations. That she never knew of Mr Tukey using government rations in his own family, & that she is satisfied he could not have done so without affiant knowing it, for he told her which of the rations in the cellar were his, & what were the government's, and she (affiant) always got the provisions as they were used, from the cellar herself. And, finally she has been this particular in naming so many incidents, in order to show how it is that she is enabled to speak with so much certainty as to how the groceries were received & used.
