I received your note of the 22nd Dec. 1867 on last evening 13th instant. Mary Minor came to me and made a statement of the threat that Mr. Coleman had made, which was a breach of the peace. I told her if she made oath to her complaint I would give her a warrant and have Coleman arrested. she declared she would swear to nothing and got very angry and went off. I have not heard of it till I received your note. Mary Minor has always claimed to be an Indian. She was free born & some twenty years ago took up with a black Negro who was free born and having been living together since She is a woman of very high temper lives close to the public Ward & has several times gathered up stones & threatened to knock persons brains out. I have been told that she stopped Coleman in the public road and threatened him & he told her if she struck him he would shoot her, her husband has since told me he did not wish her to have any warrant & told her not to stop Coleman.
