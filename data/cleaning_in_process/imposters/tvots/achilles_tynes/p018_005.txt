I do now know the precise day of the month but 'tis either 27th or 8. This is the second day we have been resting here. Tonight we move. Three Brigd. of Cavalry start upon what is to be, if successful, the Raid of the War. Md., Pa. and O., and also N.W.Va., will see us ere we again draw rein. That is unless some unexpected circumstance should prevent. We part with our wagons here and perhaps may meet them next in Greenbrier of Monroe. What the main army will do I cannot say. L leave Spence and Gran with all my baggage with the wagons. Spence has Brown Maud. She is too fine to be killed upon such a trip. (The one) I ride on very little account, belonging to Spence- captured. Shall swop her off if possible. I have left in Spence's care the following list of articles. 7-1/4 yds. cassimere Blk.9 yds. white flannel5 pairs kid gloves, 2 cotton do.5 boxes hair pins (gum) 2 papers pins.4 sets spoons, 8 or 10 spools thread.8 pairs ladys shoes, two pair mens Do.2 Botts Clge.water, two Do. pomade8 or 12 linen Hdks.3 silk do.1 pair flannel and one pair cotton drawersOne cotton one linen and 1 calico shirtSeveral linen collars  Yanks are upon us!  False alarm, but we are moving northward. Good by my own darling girl. May heaven guard thee! Am off on a long, long perilous expedition, but fear not. Thou art a soldier's wife. Comfort my mother. Kiss her and Mollie for me. My love to Pa, your Pa and Eliza. I send many warm embraces, and my earnest love is always thine.
