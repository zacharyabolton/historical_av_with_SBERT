Owing to a mistake somewhere, the books we have at last received from P.O. are not what we want -- i.e. We need now five dozen Third Readers and one dozen Fourth, only a few Second, and no First, but they have sent seven dozen First and Second, and only two dozen Third, and no Fourth. There are besides Geographies and slates more than we can possibly dispose of. Mr. Estes suggests "that you write to Mr. Manly and see if he cannot exchange with you, giving the kind you need. If he cannot perhaps he can use those you have, and allow us to send you more from this city." Will you be kind enough to let us know, if you can help us either way. We are sadly in need of the books.
