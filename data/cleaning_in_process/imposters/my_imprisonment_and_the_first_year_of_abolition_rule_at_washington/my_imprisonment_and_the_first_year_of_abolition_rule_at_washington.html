      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHETHER a faithful record
      of my long and humiliating imprisonment at Washington, in the hands of the
      enemies of my country, will prove as interesting to the public as my
      friends assure me it is to them, I know not. It is natural for those who
      have suffered captivity to exaggerate the importance and interest of their
      own experiences; yet I should not venture upon publishing these notes and
      sketches merely as a narrative of indignities heaped upon myself
      personally. It is hoped that the story may excite more than a simple
      feeling of indignation or commiseration, by exhibiting somewhat of the
      intolerant spirit in which the present crusade against the liberties of
      sovereign States was undertaken, and somewhat of the true character of
      that race of people who insist on

      <hr />
      <a name="green2"> Page 2</a>
      <p>
        compelling us by force to live with them in bonds of fellowship and
        union.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been long a
        resident of Washington before the secession of the Confederate States,
        and, from my intimate acquaintance with public men and public measures
        under the old government, had peculiar and exceptional means of watching
        the progressive development of the designs of these Leaders of opinion
        in the Federal States, which, as I had long foreseen, would necessarily
        end in forcing on a separation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of my information
        upon this subject had been derived from the intercourse of society in
        the Federal capital; and would therefore have been unsuitable to be made
        public, if the relations of the North and the South had continued as
        they used to be - subjects of political discussion and party contest.
        But the Federal leaders have now carried the matter far beyond this
        point. After repeated and intolerable aggression upon the rights of
        these States - accompanied and aggravated by an insulting tone of moral
        superiority, until a union with such communities was no longer to be
        endured by any high-spirited people - they at length stirred up a
        furious and desolating war. For two years a torrent of blood has flowed
        between their people
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green3"> Page 3</a>
      <p>
        and my people. The noble State of Virginia, with which I am most nearly
        connected, has been devastated by hosts of barbarous invaders - always
        overthrown indeed in the field before Southern valour, but always
        destroying and plundering where they found the country unprotected;
        whilst my own dear native State of Maryland has been subject to a still
        more stinging and maddening oppression, in the utter destruction of all
        her liberties, and in the establishment of a brutal and vulgar military
        despotism, which has reduced the gallant old State to the debased
        condition of Poland or Venetia; and such 'order reigns in Baltimore,' as
        that moral death which tyrants call 'order' in Warsaw or in the
        beautiful City of the Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, therefore, the
        days of my former abode in Washington seem to belong almost to another
        state of being. That time - when I, in common with all our people,
        looked up with pride and veneration to the banner of the stars and
        stripes - appears to be now with the years before the Flood. I look back
        to the scenes of that period through a haze of blood and horror. Those
        men whom I once called friends - who have broken bread at my table -
        have since then stirred up and hounded on host after host of greedy
        invaders, and precipitated them upon the beloved
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green4"> Page 4</a>
      <p>
        valleys where my kindred had their peaceful homes. Many who were dear to
        me have been slain, or maimed for life, fighting in defence of all that
        makes life of value. Instead of friends, I see in those statesmen of
        Washington only mortal enemies. Instead of loving and worshipping the
        old flag of the stars and stripes, I see in it only the symbol of
        murder, plunder, oppression, and shame! and, like every other faithful
        Confederate, I dwell with delight on the many glorious fields where this
        dishonoured standard has gone down before the stainless battle-flag of
        the Confederacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, two years of
        terrible war, equivalent, an age of quiet life, have passed through the
        existence of us all, leaving a deep and ineffaceable track. Between us
        and those former friends there is a gulf deep and wide as eternity; and
        under these circumstances I have felt myself at liberty to be much more
        unreserved in the narrative of my personal recollections: suppressing,
        in fact, nothing which I thought would be either interesting or useful
        to my Confederate countrymen - except only when reserve was dictated by
        self-respect, or by the duty of avoiding disclosures which might
        compromise the safety of certain Federal officers, whom I induced
        without scruple as will be more fully seen in the
      </p>

      <p>
        following pages, to furnish me with information, even in my captivity,
        which information I at once communicated with pride and pleasure to
        General Beauregard, then commanding the Confederate forces near
        Washington. Whatever may be thought of the conduct of these Federal
        officers in betraying to an avowed enemy secrets material to their own
        Government, it will readily be admitted that after having made this use
        of them I should not have been justified in naming them, or affording a
        clue by which they could be discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in detailing
        conversations which passed either with me or in my presence, before or
        after my arrest, I may be thought to have exhibited too great
        bitterness, it is hoped that the circumstances under which I found
        myself may plead my excuse. It will be seen that I was well aware from
        an early period of the dark designs of the Abolition leaders at
        Washington, and that while they were holding publicly the language of
        patriotic zeal for the constitution and the law, they were already
        meditating, and preparing, all the dreadful scenes of lawless outrage
        and spoliation which have since that time rendered their names odious to
        the whole world It was well known to me what fate they were reserving
        for my own native State, and what diabolical
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green6"> Page 6</a>
      <p>
        agencies they were setting to work over all the country, both to destroy
        the Confederate States and to crush out the liberties of the North. The
        chief projectors of all these horrors, too, were well aware that I knew
        their plans and machinations intimately; and that, weak woman as I was,
        I possessed both the means and the spirit to throw serious obstacle in
        their way. Hence the keen and jealous surveillance by which my every
        motion was observed and noted, even long before my arrest. Hence, also,
        the useless series of torments and provocations to which I was subjected
        - the changes in my place of imprisonment, and the many attempts to
        entrap me into a betrayal of myself or the Confederate cause. Hence the
        long and wearisome captivity, to break my spirit, or goad me into
        undignified bursts of indignation - in all of which I trust I may
        flatter myself that they signally failed. Satisfied thoroughly of the
        justice and sacredness of our great cause, thinking only of the gallant
        struggle into which my kindred had thrown themselves, I was enabled, not
        only to 'possess my own soul' and keep my own counsel, but also to
        establish and maintain a continuous correspondence with Virginia, and
        reveal certain contemplated military movements of enemy in time to have
        them thwarted by our
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green7"> Page 7</a>
      <p>
        generals. For this I do not desire to take any special credit in the
        eyes of the public. I only performed my duty, and have already been
        gratified by the thanks of those who best can judge of the services
        which I endeavoured to render; and the matter is mentioned here merely
        as one of the reasons why it has been thought that a narrative furnished
        by one who enjoyed such opportunities of observation may be found not
        uninteresting.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that the
        language which was sometimes extorted from me in conversation, or some
        of the remarks now found in my book, are more bitterly vituperative and
        sarcastic, than in ordinary times, and upon ordinary subjects, would be
        becoming in the personal narrative of a woman. Those who may think so
        are only entreated, before they judge, to endeavour to imagine
        themselves in my position - subject to the stinging indignities of a
        Washington prison, having to encounter sometimes the vicious taunts of
        vulgar guards, sometimes the treacherous warnings or counsels of
        politicians pretending to be my friends; a little daughter, too, always
        before my eyes, torn from the peaceful delights of home, and the flowery
        path of girlhood, and forced to witness the hard realities of
        prison-life, and hear the keys grating in dungeon locks. No wonder if my
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green8"> Page 8</a>
      <p>
        nature grew harsh and more vindictive, and if the scorn and wrath that
        was in my heart sometimes found vent by tongue or pen.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, above all
        things, when I thought of my own State of Maryland - where sleep the
        manes of my ancestors - that I burned with indignation in my prison.
        While the great State of Virginia, with her strong river frontier of the
        Potomac, was enabled to bid defiance to the utmost efforts of her
        enemies, it soon became evident that Maryland, penetrated by great bays
        and rivers, and with her very heart opened up to the naval forces of the
        enemy, would be, for the present at least, overpowered, and prevented
        from casting her lot openly and decisively with her sister States. I
        knew also that every genuine child of Maryland cherished in their souls
        but one feeling - one burning desire to share the destiny of their
        section, and to perish, if need be, in the glorious struggle; and could
        well imagine how so proud and refined a people would suffer and chafe to
        see themselves treated as vassals and serfs by a race they have always
        despised.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the men were not so
        deeply to be pitied. They had always at least the resource of flinging
        themselves across the border, joining the Confederate service, and thus
        either opening a way to the redemption
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green9"> Page 9</a>
      <p>
        of their country, or at any rate meeting her oppressors on many a
        battle-field, and wreaking a righteous vengeance upon their heads. But
        the women of Maryland - the far-famed, delicately-nurtured, and
        universally-courted ladies of that fair State - they, whose slightest
        notice in days gone by was so dearly prized by Northern men - they, so
        essentially Southern in taste, and style, and association - to see their
        country ruled by hordes of the despised Yankees, and their haughty city
        tamed and cowering under the insolent sway of the coarsest of all human
        creatures! - to know that <i>'the tinkling of that little bell'</i> at
        the State Department could tear the maiden from her mother's arms, to be
        dragged to the pollution of a Yankee prison! The thought was often
        almost maddening; and it may well be that my profound sympathy with my
        people has coloured with a deeper tinge of gloom my views of the whole
        field of action.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all events, I have
        endeavoured in this sketch of my captivity to discharge a great duty.
        That duty was to contribute what I myself have seen and known of the
        history of the time. If the exposure therein made of the Yankee
        character, in the first year of its luxuriant and rampant development
        (after long compression in a condition of inferiority),
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green10"> Page 10</a>
      <p>
        shall add to the feeling of execration for such a race of people, and
        deepen the universal gratitude at the happy change which has severed us
        from them, and made it still more and more impossible that we can ever
        submit to any kind of political association with them again, then my
        poor narrative will not have been written in vain.

        CHAPTER II.
        <br />
        ON TO RICHMOND!
      </h3>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ON FRIDAY, August 23rd,
        in Washington City - the metropolis of this once free and happy land,
        the proud boast of which was that life, liberty, and property were
        protected by the law - I was made a prisoner in my own house, and
        subjected to an ordeal which must have been copied from the days of the
        Directory in France.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood boils when I
        think of it. But, for the benefit of all who may feel an interest in the
        subject, I will give a circumstantial account of an act which should
        shed renown upon the distinguished authors of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for my
        purpose to make a brief
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green12"> Page 12</a>
      <p>
        <i><em>résumé</em></i> of the incidents of the few months preceding. I
        might even go back to the advent of the <i>Scotch cap and cloak,</i> but
        will content myself with an event quite as remarkable in the reign of
        the Abolition <i>'Irrepressible conflict chief,'</i> whose shadow now
        darkens the chair of Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the allusion to the
        <i>'Scotch cap and cloak'</i> may not be generally understood, I deem it
        advisable to furnish information on that head, as a means of explaining
        the <i><em>modus operandi</em></i> by which the Abolition leader entered
        the national Capitol.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had been elected
        President by a strictly sectional majority, not having received one vote
        in the States south of Mason and Dixon's line - the great geographical
        line dividing North and South - arriving thereby at the very point in
        our political destiny which Washington, in his 'farewell address,' had
        foreshadowed as a cause for the dissolution of the Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the heated
        sectional contest which resulted in the election of Mr. Lincoln by the
        Abolition party, they openly proclaimed
        <i>'the higher law doctrine,'</i> and announced their determination,
        regardless of constitutional guarantees, to deprive the South of her
        sovereign equal rights, and to reduce her to a state of vassalage; for a
        feeling of bitter jealousy
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green13"> Page 13</a>
      <p>
        had been festering and strengthening in the Northern mind against her,
        on account of the superior statesmanship and intellect, which had always
        given her preeminence in the councils of the nation, and in the
        legislative assemblies.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to carry into
        effect this hostile determination to destroy the political importance of
        the South, they had seized upon what they conceived to be the vulnerable
        point in our domestic institution - well knowing that they could enlist
        the fanatical aid and sympathy of those who were ignorant, save
        theoretically, of that institution, and of the benign and paternal
        manner in which it was conducted in the South; having in view no object
        themselves of ameliorating the condition of the servile class, but to
        exterminate or drive them out, in order that their own pauper population
        might secure to themselves the superior advantages which were everywhere
        in the South monopolised by the slave population.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denunciations were
        levelled against us by the poorer classes of the North as
        <i>'a pampered aristocracy,'</i> for the reason they gave
        <i>'that a poor white man at the South was not as good as a negro.'</i>
        And the negroes, I must confess, always arrogated to themselves this
        social superiority, for the bitterest
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green14"> Page 14</a>
      <p>
        insult they could offer each other was,
        <i>'You are no better than a poor white Yankee!'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abolition party were
        not, however, prepared for the firm and dignified bearing of the South,
        at the result of an election strictly sectional and avowedly subversive
        of the Constitution; and they believed, according to their own
        established precedent, that mob law would take the matter in hand, and
        summarily dispose of the candidate elect, or prevent his inauguration.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excited and absurd
        discussions and plans were made at Washington and other places as to the
        means by which he should reach the capital. Lincoln had, however, formed
        a plan of his own, and, having far more reticence than had been ascribed
        to him by his partisans, executed it whilst these discussion were going
        on, and suddenly appeared at Washington, at six o'clock in the morning,
        under the disguise of a
        <i>'Scotch cap and cloak,'</i> announcing himself with characteristic
        phraseology in the apartments of his sleeping Committee of Safety at
        Willard's Hotel with -
        <i>'Hillo! Just look at me! By jingo, my own dad wouldn't know me!'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the
        16th of July, the Government papers at Washington announced that the
        'grand army' was in motion, and I learned from a
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green15"> Page 15</a>
      <p>
        reliable source (having received a copy of the order to M'Dowell) that
        the order for a forward movement had gone forth. If earth did not
        tremble surely there was great commotion amongst that class of the
        <i><em>genus homo</em></i> yclept military men. Officers and orderlies
        on horse were seen flying from place to place; the tramp of armed men
        was heard on every side - martial music filled the air; in short, a
        mighty host was marshalling, with all the 'pomp and circumstance of
        glorious war.' 'On to Richmond!' was the war-cry. The heroes girded on
        their armour with the enthusiasm of the Crusaders of old, and vowed to
        flesh their maiden swords in the blood of Beauregard or Lee. And many a
        knight, inspired by beauty's smiles, swore to lay at the feet of her he
        loved best the head of Jeff. Davis at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, nothing was
        wanting to render the gorgeous pageant imposing. So, with drums beating
        and flying colours, and amidst the shower of flowers thrown by the hands
        of Yankee maidens, the grand army moved on to the land of Washington, of
        Jefferson, of Madison, and Monroe; whilst the heartstricken Southerners
        who remained, did not tear their hair and rend their garments, but
        prayed on their knees that the God of Battles would award the victory to
        the just cause.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green16"> Page 16</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fear and trembling
        they awaited the result - hoping, yet fearing to hope. Time seemed to
        move on leaden wings. Imagination sounded in their ears the booming
        cannon, and many a time their hearts died within them at the sickening
        delay. Few had the hope which filled my own soul, or shared in its
        exultant certainty of the result. At twelve o'clock on the morning of
        the 16th of July, I despatched a messenger to Manassas, who arrived
        there at eight o'clock that night. The answer received by me at mid-day
        on the 17th will tell the purport of my communication - 'Yours was
        received at eight o'clock at night. Let them come: we are ready for
        them. We rely upon you for precise information. Be particular as to
        description and destination of forces, quantity of artillery, &amp;c.
        (Signed) THOS. JORDON, Adjt.-Gen.' On the 17th I despatched another
        missive to Manassas, for I had learned of the intention of the enemy to
        cut the Winchester railroad, so as to intercept Johnson, and prevent his
        reinforcing Beauregard, who had comparatively but a small force under
        his command at Manassas.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the
        18th, news of a great victory by the Federal troops at Bull Run reached
        Washington. Throughout the length and breadth of the city it was cried.
        I heard it in New York on Saturday,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green17"> Page 17</a>
      <p>
        20th, where I had gone for the purpose of embarking a member of my
        family for California, on the steamer of the 22nd. The accounts were
        received with frantic rejoicings, and bets were freely taken in support
        of Mr. Seward's wise saws - that the rebellion would be crushed out in
        thirty days. My heart told me that the triumph was premature. Yet, O my
        God! how miserable I was for the fate of my beloved country, which hung
        trembling in the balance!
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My presentiments were
        more than justified by the result. On Sunday (21st) the great battle of
        Manassas was fought, memorable in history as that of Culloden or
        Waterloo, which ended in the total defeat and rout of the entire 'Grand
        Army.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world's history
        such a sight was never witnessed: statesmen, senators, Congress-men,
        generals, and officers of every grade, soldiers, teamsters - all rushing
        in frantic flight, as if pursued by countless demons. For miles the
        country was thick with ambulances, accoutrements of war, &amp;c. The
        actual scene beggars all description; so I must in despair relinquish
        the effort to portray it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the
        disastrous rout of the Yankee army was cried through the streets of New
        York on the 22nd. The whole city seemed paralysed by fear, and I verily
        believe that a thousand men could have
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green18"> Page 18</a>
      <p>
        marched from the Central Park to the Battery without resistance, for
        their depression now was commensurate with the wild exultation of a few
        days before.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of that
        day I left New York for Washington, where I arrived at six o'clock in
        the morning of the 23rd, in a most impatient mood. Even at that early
        hour friends were awaiting my arrival, anxious to recount the
        particulars of the glorious victory. A despatch was also received from
        Manassas by me -
        <i
          >'Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon
          you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt. </i
        >(Signed) JORDON, Adjutant-General.' My first impulse was to throw
        myself upon my knees and offer up my tearful thanks to the Father of
        Mercy for his signal protection in our hour of peril.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my journey from
        New York the craven fear of the Yankees was manifested everywhere. At
        Philadelphia most of the women got off. I was advised to do so by
        Lieutenant Wise, of U. S. A. (son-in-law of Edward Everitt), as he said,
        'It was believed that the rebels of Baltimore would rise, in consequence
        of the rout of the Federal army.' I laughingly replied, 'I have no
        fears; these rebels are of my faith. Besides, I fear, even now, I shall
        not be in time to welcome our President, Mr. Davis, and the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green19"> Page 19</a>
      <p>
        glorious Beauregard.' He sneeringly replied, 'that I should probably see
        those gentlemen there in irons.' I received a scowl also from Mr. Winter
        Davis, who was a passenger from New York, and had been loud- mouthed and
        denunciatory against the South during the journey. I observed, however,
        that he and Lieutenant Wise got off at Philadelphia, deeming 'discretion
        the better part of valour.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large force was
        distributed throughout Baltimore, and it was even difficult to thread
        one's way to the train on account of the military, who crowded the
        streets and the depôt. Thence to Washington seemed as one vast camp, and
        on reaching the Capitol, the very carriage-way was blocked up by its
        panic-stricken defenders, who started at the clank of their own muskets.
        After a hurried toilette and breakfast I went up to the U. S. Senate,
        where I saw the crest-fallen leaders who, but a few days before, had
        vowed 'death and damnation' to our race. Several crowded round me, and I
        could not help saying that, if they had not <i>'good blood,'</i> they
        had certainly <i>'good bottom,'</i> for they ran remarkably well.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For days after the
        wildest disorder reigned in the Capitol. The streets were filled with
        straggling soldiers, each telling the doleful tale, and each indulging

        or Jack the Giant-killer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even senators entered
        into this scramble for stray laurels, for several assured me (Wilson and
        Chandler) that it was their individual exertions alone which had
        prevented the entire 'Grand Army' from precipitating itself pell-mell
        into the Potomac; and they were really indebted to the discretion of a
        subordinate officer, that the alternative had not been forced upon them.
        A telegraphic order had been sent to Washington by General M'Dowell, to
        cut the draw of the Long Bridge, 'as Beauregard and Johnson were hotly
        pursuing him with fresh troops.' This bridge spanned the Potomac just
        opposite Washington, and was the only means of crossing the river at
        that point.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimination, and
        recrimination, now became the order of the day, and everybody shrank
        from the responsibility of the forward movement. The commanding General,
        Scott, said, <i>'I did n't do it, for I was not ready.'</i> The
        Political Directory said,
        <i
          >'We did n't do it - it was that old dotard Scott, whom we will
          remove.'</i
        >
        President Lincoln said,
        <i>'I did n't do it - by jingo, I did n't!'</i> And so, in the end, the
        world was about as well informed as to who
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green21"> Page 21</a>
      <p>ordered the advance of the Grand Army as 'who killed Cock Robin.'</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this time I met
        Mr. Seward, who assured me That
        <i>'there was nothing serious the matter;'</i> that I might assure my
        friends, upon his authority, that all would be over in sixty days. I
        answered him, 'Well, sir, you have enjoyed the first-fruits of the
        "irrepressible conflict."'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seward had, a short time
        prior to his visit to England, in a speech delivered by him at
        Rochester, New York, as a bid for the nomination as President by the
        Republican party, made use of that remarkable expression of the
        <i>irrepressible conflict</i> between the white and black races,
        indicating, even at that early day, the policy to which he would commit
        himself in order to attain the object of his ambition - the Executive
        chair. At a later period, he endeavoured to explain this away, and in
        conversation with me said, 'If <i>heaven</i> would forgive him for
        stringing together two high-sounding words, he would never do it again.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By-and-by things began
        to quiet down. The hirelings of the Government press exercised their
        ingenuity in mystifying the people. The countless hosts of the enemy
        were described (these, be it known, at no time exceeded twelve thousand
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green22"> Page 22</a>
      <p>
        actually engaged against the more than quadruple force of the invading
        army); their masked batteries and military defences threw into the shade
        the plains of Abraham, or even the fortifications of Sebastopol.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be idle to
        recount the gasconade of those who fled from imaginary foes, or to
        describe the forlorn condition of the returning heroes, who had gone
        forth to battle flushed with anticipated triumph and crowned in advance
        with the laurel of victory. Alas! their plight was pitiable enough. Some
        were described as being minus hat or shoes. Amongst this latter class
        was Colonel Burnside, who, on the morning that he sallied forth for The
        'sacred soil,' is said to have required two orderlies to carry the
        flowers showered upon him by the women of Northern proclivities.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the muttered
        sound of the people's voice was heard from far and near asking meaning
        questions of the why and wherefore of the disasters. It was like the
        rumbling of the distant thunder presaging the coming storm; and well the
        Abolition Government knew that, if this discontent was allowed to gather
        strength, it would hurl them from their present lawless eminence to the
        ignominy they merited.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invaders had been
        taught to believe that a
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green23"> Page 23</a>
      <p>
        bloodless victory awaited them - that the 'All hail!' of the witches of
        Macbeth would greet them: and so possessed were they with the idea of
        their philanthropic mission as liberators of an oppressed people,
        <i>'bowed under the yoke of a haughty aristocracy,'</i> that many of
        their officers, particularly the famous New York 7th regiment, took far
        more pains to prepare white gloves and embroidered vests for
        <i>'the balls'</i> to be given in their honour at Richmond than in
        securing cartridges for their muskets. When consulted on the subject I
        said, 'No doubt they would receive a <i>great many balls,</i> but I did
        not think that a very <i><em>recherché</em></i> toilet would be
        expected.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fanatical feeling
        was now at its height. Maddened by defeat, they sought a safe means of
        venting their pent-up wrath. The streets were filled with armed and
        unarmed ruffians; women were afraid to go singly into the streets for
        fear of insult; curses and blasphemy rent the air, and no one would have
        been surprised at any hour at a general massacre of the peaceful
        inhabitants. This apprehension was shared even by the better class of U.
        S. officers. I was urged to leave the city by more than one, and an
        escort offered to be furnished me if I desired; but, at whatever peril,
        I resolved to remain, conscious of the great service I could
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green24"> Page 24</a>
      <p>
        render my country, my position giving me remarkable facilities for
        obtaining information.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of more
        fearful scenes, the inhabitants were leaving the city as rapidly as the
        means of transportation or conveyance could be obtained, and many even
        of the Federal officers sent their families to the North or other places
        of fancied security.

        CHAPTER III.
        <br />
        PANIC AT WASHINGTON.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a number of
        Confederate prisoners, who had been taken in the first day's fight when
        our army fell back from Bull Run, were brought to Washington, and on
        passing Willard's Hotel were set upon by the crowd who usually
        congregated there, and pelted with stones and other missiles, which
        seriously wounded a number. In order to prevent the prisoners from being
        actually torn to pieces, a company of U. S. regulars had to be called
        out to protect them to their quarters, the old Capitol prison; and
        during the march to that point the soldiers had repeatedly to threaten
        to fire upon the mob, who pressed upon them with shouts and obscene
        revilings.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green26"> Page 26</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I heard of
        the circumstance, I went up to the prison to minister to the wants of
        our sufferers, and found many with severe cuts and bruises. I was
        accompanied by my friend Miss Mackall, and had the satisfaction of not
        only being the first friendly face seen by them, but to know that I had
        arrived at the right time; for I found there an emissary of Lincoln - I
        had like to have said Satan - dressed in black, with a white neckcloth,
        who I afterwards learned was Mr. Commissioner Wood, one of the
        subscribers for Mrs. Lincoln's carriage and horses, and who received his
        appointment in consequence thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was with great
        earnestness haranguing the prisoners, and trying to persuade them that
        they would all be hanged unless they took the oath of allegiance to the
        Abolition Government. I listened attentively to the man, who did not
        seem to relish the addition to his audience; and afterwards, as rapidly
        as I could, assured each group of prisoners that man's threat was idle,
        and only for the purpose of intimidation, and for some false
        announcement to the world; that the Yankees were obliged to treat them
        as belligerents, and hold them as prisoners of war for exchange; that
        our Government would fearfully retaliate any violence against them, as
        we held an excess of prisoners of a hundred to one. This
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green27"> Page 27</a>
      <p>
        satisfied them, especially the younger portion, who each refused the
        Yankee pardon on the terms proposed. I afterwards took the list of their
        various wants, and, in conjunction with high parties, whom it would be
        imprudent to name, supplied them with clothing and other needful things,
        food and beds and bedding inclusive, as the Yankees had made no
        provision of any kind, save the naked walls of a prison. There was an
        ample Confederate fund in Washington for this purpose. Mrs. Philips and
        family also exerted themselves in this holy work.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady was arrested
        in Washington at the same time that I was, and after a short detention
        was sent South. She then became a resident of New Orleans. During the
        reign of terror of Butler in that city a Yankee funeral passed her
        house, and she was seen to smile upon her balcony during the procession.
        For this <i>grave offence</i> she was dragged before him, and questioned
        as to her motive for doing so, to which she dauntlessly replied,
        'Because I was in a good humour.' She was condemned to three months'
        imprisonment, upon a barren island, under a tropical sun, with soldiers'
        rations, and subjected to other gross and brutal indignities, until the
        poor lady's health gave way, and her life became imperilled. The
        representations and remonstrances of the medical
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green28"> Page 28</a>
      <p>
        attendant, who was more humane than his master, failed to procure any
        mitigation of the harsh sentence until the period had expired, when she
        was banished, an invalid for life. In the course of her examination
        before Butler, he said: 'I expect to be killed before I leave the South,
        by either you or Mrs. Greenhow;' to which she answered, 'We usually
        order our negroes to kill our swine!'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Charles Sumner was
        said to have been a complacent looker-on if not an actual participator
        in that chivalrous demonstration against unarmed prisoners. Mayhap his
        wrath was appeased by the sight of the bleeding victims, who could hold
        no correcting rod over his own coward shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after an
        order was given to exclude all visitors, in which I was specially named.
        In spite, however, of the prohibition, I had no difficulty in
        communicating when I desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after I passed into
        other hands my share in this good work; for more important employment
        occupied my time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yankee Government
        and Yankee Congress were now exercised upon the subject of reorganising
        their shattered hosts. The military committee was specially charged with
        the task, and certainly grave efforts were being made to this end, the
        primary
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green29"> Page 29</a>
      <p>
        object being to mystify the people as to the past, in order to make them
        blind instruments in the future; for it was now truly a nation of
        subterfuges and humbugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the solemn
        farce was enacted of admitting as U. S. senators the
        <i>bogus</i> members from Western Virginia. I was in the gallery of the
        Senate at the time, and happened to remark upon the proceedings to my
        own party, when a man sitting before me in the uniform of
        lieutenant-colonel of Yankee volunteers, in company with a number of
        other officers, turned and said, 'That is treason; we will show you that
        it must be put a stop to; we have a government to maintain,' &amp;c.
        This was the first effort of the kind to repress freedom of opinion
        which had come under my observation, and the beginning of that reign of
        terror for which we should be obliged to seek precedents in the age of a
        Nero or Caligula. Yet I confess that it did not surprise me. I leaned
        forward and said deliberately, 'My remarks were addressed to my
        companions, and not to you; and if I did not discover by your language
        that you must be ignorant of all the laws of good-breeding, I should
        take the number of your company and report you to your commanding
        officer to be punished for your impertinence!' Seeing me
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green30"> Page 30</a>
      <p>
        addressed by him, several gentlemen came forward, as also the
        door-keeper, who said, 'Madam, if he insults you I will put him out.' To
        which I replied, 'Oh, never mind: he is too ignorant to know what he has
        done.' This defender of the faithful, meanwhile, played most vehemently
        with his sword, and I expected momentarily to have it drawn against me.
        His brother officers one by one withdrew, and left him alone in his
        glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few moments after this
        scene a republican senator came up to the gallery to speak with me, and
        I related the circumstance, and advised him to go down to the Senate and
        move a revival of the alien and sedition law, as I supposed it would
        come to that, since armed ruffians were placed in the galleries to awe
        the crowd. This<i> 'brave'</i> bore it as long as possible, and finally
        got up and went out. I this man once more, upon the occasion of my being
        summoned before the U. S. commission, after I had been some eight months
        a prisoner. He was standing in the doorway of the building in which the
        commission was held, as if he expected to see me; a look of triumph
        lighted up his face as his eye encountered mine. I could not resist the
        temptation of significantly passing my finger across my throat, and
        saying, 'Beware!' - as Balzac's story of
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green31"> Page 31</a>
      <p>the poor Marie Antoinette and Joseph Balsamo came to my mind.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was destined to be
        a day of adventure. Quite an excitement was caused by a rumour that a
        battle was going on across the river. The Confederate forces were at
        that time in possession of Arlington Heights, the former residence of
        the venerable Park Custus, the grandson of Washington: from him it had
        come by inheritance to our own great General Lee. I went with my party
        to the portico of the Congressional Library, whence the best view could
        be obtained, and saw the smoke from the camp-fires gracefully curling
        up, and remarked, 'That is no battle. The rebels are cooking their
        dinners.' A number of persons had crowded around and joined in the
        conversation. Some one proposed to send back to the Senate for Chandler,
        Wilson, and Foster, the heroic trio who had fled so valorously from the
        field at Manassas, spreading the news of the defeat. I objected on the
        score of humanity, as it was not right to give such a shock to their
        nervous systems, since neither of those senators had been able to stand
        the fire in their own pipes since that hapless Gilpin race.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I fell into
        conversation with a lank lean man, with a big nose and a pair of green
        spectacles,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green32"> Page 32</a>
      <p>
        who asked me if I had ever witnessed a battle. I replied that I had
        experienced a <i><em>pronunciamento</em></i> in the city of Mexico. In
        the course of his remarks he said that he would rather give up
        Washington than that it should be held by means of fortifications, but
        that Lincoln, Seward, and the whole set were cowards, and a great deal
        more which I considered useful information. I knew that this man was a
        senator, and fancied that it might be 'Jim Lane' of Kansas, he whom I
        have denominated as 'Balaam's Ass.' He said that he had seen me in the
        gallery of the Senate, and asked what I thought of the proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I related the attack on
        my liberty of speech, and wondered what sort of performance we should be
        treated to next, whether a tragedy or another farce; and, I confess,
        gave a most grotesque account of the speeches during the solemn mockery
        of the morning, expressing my surprise that more ingenuity had not been
        displayed to disguise the unconstitutionality of the act, to dismember
        and defraud a sovereign state of her territorial rights, individualising
        Trumbull's effort as one for which a schoolboy should have won a 'dunce
        cap.' I saw a suppressed laugh all around, and that the person to whom I
        spoke seemed embarrassed,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green33"> Page 33</a>
      <p>
        and finally fell back and spoke with a gentleman of my party. This
        person came to me and said, 'Do you know that you have been talking to
        Senator Trumbull all this while?' I was quite as much amused at the
        <i><em>contretemps</em></i> as any of my hearers. But I should have
        considered it a reflection upon my good taste to have been previously
        cognisant of the fact, so assured Senator Trumbull that I had no idea
        that the subject of my criticism was the patient listener who stood
        before me - 'But for once in your life you have heard an honest opinion
        fearlessly expressed.' Abolitionist as he was, I must do him the justice
        to say that he behaved very well.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humbug still continued
        the order of the day at Washington. Another cry was raised that the
        Capitol was again in danger. This time the programme was changed. The
        hero of Lundy's Lane and of Mexico was to be laid on the shelf, to all
        purposes superseded. But he still stood a mighty ruin in their way,
        propped by the lingering confidence of a nation, and no man was bold
        enough to say, 'This is not the right man for the place.' Cunning and
        craft were the characteristic qualities called into requisition here.
        Seward, with jesuitical skill, affected to support the weak old man,
        wishing to enact the fable of 'the monkey and the chestnuts.'
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green34"> Page 34</a>
      <p>
        But even his selfish policy had to yield to the tempest he had aided to
        raise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a preparation for
        what was to follow, Congress passed an 'act regulating the pay of the
        Lieutenant- General in case of his resignation' or
        <i>'voluntary retirement.'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young America now became
        the theme of every tongue. The great battles of the world, both in
        ancient and modern times, were proved to have been fought by generals
        who were adolescent. Cæsar, Hannibal, and Napoleon were cited as
        examples, and even our own immortal Washington had many years deducted
        from his actual age when he fought the battles of the revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ears of the rabble
        were tickled by all this; justice was lost sight of; - and so a young
        chieftain was summoned to the field of intrigue. Nothing remarkable thus
        far had distinguished him above his compeers; but, touched by the magic
        wand of political expediency, he came forth full-fledged, with honours
        thick upon him. In a single day, from a subordinate position he became
        Major-General M'Clellan, the virtual head of the dictator's armies -
        whose policy of bestowing honours in advance differed widely from that
        of the greatest man of the present times, in the European world -
        Louis-Napoleon, - by whom grades were always conferred

        after the battle won, as witness Magenta, Solferino, &amp;c. Subsequent
        to the rout at Manassas, President Lincoln promoted all the officers,
        many of whom were proved to have fled from the field in advance of their
        regiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again comes into bold
        relief the sycophancy of President Lincoln's protégés. All the military
        qualities of any age were unscrupulously purloined, to deck the hero of
        the hour. By degrees they fixed upon the great Napoleon as his prototype
        - I suppose from the fact that he is short, and rather inclined to
        corpulency, as was latterly the 'Little Corporal;' and, besides,
        sycophants are ever ready to discern what pleases best.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the auspices of
        the 'Young General,' the military are put in motion; hither and thither
        they are marched, and counter-marched; mysterious movement being his
        forte. He, however, set himself energetically to the task of
        reorganising and disciplining the demoralised rabble he was called upon
        to command.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Scott, who at
        this time was still the nominal commander-in-chief, wrote a letter to
        the Honourable Henry Wilson, lauding his patriotic exertion, and urging
        him to accept military command, and commending his capacity for such
        position in very high terms. By a singular coincidence, M'Clellan
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green36"> Page 36</a>
      <p>
        urged the same gentleman,
        <i
          >'to do him the honour to accept the position of chief of his staff!' </i
        >This proposition was made by M'Clellan in the reception- room of
        President Lincoln. I mention these incidents, to show the political bias
        of all parties at the time; that the Abolition star was in the
        ascendant, and that everybody fawned upon its chosen apostles.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan also invited
        the Count de Paris and Duke d'Aumale to become members of his staff.
        Their acceptance was heralded with great circumstance, as this infusion
        of the aristocratic element into the Abolition ranks was regarded as a
        national triumph. Edifying accounts were given of their introduction to
        President Lincoln, and especially to Master Bob, the Abolition scion of
        royalty. They were amiable ladylike-looking young Frenchmen, better
        fitted from their appearance to assist in Mrs. Lincoln's educational
        scheme (thus treading in the footsteps of their royal ancestor Louis-
        Philippe, who taught French in Philadelphia) than to win laurels enough
        to disturb the equanimity of that wise and sagacious Prince whom
        Providence has appointed to rule over France.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A commission of
        Brigadier-General was also tendered to Garibaldi.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the panic at
        Washington, instead of subsiding,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green37"> Page 37</a>
      <p>
        received new impulse each day, from some extravagant rumours. A strong
        guard was stationed around all the public buildings. The redoubtable Jim
        Lane, of Kansas notoriety, and his band of ruffians, were quartered in
        the east room of the White House, for the protection of President
        Lincoln and his family. Sentinels paced to and fro in front of the
        house, and at six o'clock in the evening the gates were closed, and no
        one could enter without the countersign.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything about the
        national Capitol betokened the panic of the Administration. Preparations
        were made for the expected attack, and signals arranged to give the
        alarm. The signal was three guns from the Provost- Marshal's office,
        followed by the tolling of the church bells at intervals of fifteen
        minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a singular providence
        (for it would be wrong to ascribe these things to chance), I went round
        with the principal officer in charge of this duty, and took advantage of
        the situation. The alarm-guns of the Yankees were the rallying cry of a
        devoted band whose hearts beat high with hope. The task before them was
        worthy of all hazard, and our gallant Beauregard would have found
        himself right ably seconded by the rebels of Washington had he deemed it
        expedient to advance on that city.
      </p>

      <a name="green38"> Page 38</a>
      <p>
        A part of the plan was, to have cut the telegraph wires connecting the
        various military positions with the War Department, to take prisoners
        M'Clellan and several others, thereby creating still greater confusion
        in the first moments of panic. Measures had also been taken to spike the
        guns in Fort Corcoran, Fort Ellsworth, and other important points,
        accurate drawings of which had been furnished to our commanding officer
        at Manassas by me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite an ingenious plan
        was adopted at this time to discover if the 'rebel' communication was
        uninterrupted. Young Doolittle, the son of the senator of that name, and
        clerk of the military committee, who was an occasional and
        <i>useful</i> visitor at my house, brought me a letter for Colonel
        Corcoran at Richmond, with the modest request that I would send it. I
        told him that M'Clellan's excessive vigilance had rendered communication
        almost impossible, but that he might leave it and trust to the chance.
        He called repeatedly to ascertain whether the letter had been sent; but
        I understood the motive, and was always very sorry that no opportunity
        had occurred. I need hardly say that during this period I was in almost
        daily correspondence with Manassas.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Capitol, by this,
        had been made one of the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green39"> Page 39</a>
      <p>
        strongest fortified cities of the world - every avenue to it being
        guarded by works believed to be impregnable. Thirty-three fortifications
        surrounded it. But this alone was not deemed sufficient. Extraordinary
        vigilance was exercised; market-carts and news boys were overhauled, to
        look for treasonable correspondence - every box was either a masked
        battery, or infernal machine - but, alas! without success, until a
        sudden inspiration seized them. The Southern women of Washington are the
        cause of the defeat of the grand army! They are entitled to the laurels
        won by the brave defenders of our soil and institutions! They have told
        Beauregard when to strike! They, with their siren arts, have possessed
        themselves of the plans and schemes of the Lincoln Cabinet, and warned
        Jeff. Davis of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most skillful
        detectives were summoned from far and near, to trace the steps of maids
        and matrons. For several weeks I had been followed, and my house
        watched, by those emissaries of the State Department, the detective
        police. This was often a subject of amusement to me; and several times,
        when accompanied by my young friend Miss Mackall, we would turn and
        follow those who we fancied were giving us an undue share of attention.
        Still I believed it private enterprise, originating with some
        philanthropist
      </p>
      <hr />

        who had my well-being at heart; for I was slow to credit that even the
        fragment of a once glorious Government could give to the world such a
        proof of craven fear and weakness as to turn the arms, which the blind
        confidence of a deluded people had placed in their hands, for the
        achievement of other ends, against the breasts of helpless defenceless
        women and children. Nevertheless it is a fact, significant of events to
        follow. Lawless acts of violence seldom stand alone; and the careful
        readers of the history of the last two hundred years will find numerous
        parallel cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No nation on the face of
        the globe has made such rapid strides to despotism as the Federal
        Government. The first acts of the Republican President were to violate
        the express provisions of the Constitution: those safeguards provided by
        the wisdom of our fathers for the protection of the rights of the
        citizen have been suspended, under the plea of military necessity. The
        law of the land has given place to the law of the despot.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first act of the
        Republican Congress assembled in this city of Washington on the 4th day
        July, 1861, was to legalise the acts of their President, thereby
        admitting that he, the chief magistrate the nation, had been guilty of
        perjury and treason
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green41"> Page 41</a>
      <p>
        before God and man; for his oath of office had been, to support the
        Constitution of the United States, and to administer the laws in
        accordance with its provisions. But instead of being impeached for his
        crimes, he was eulogised, and unlimited powers were conferred upon him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few voices were raised
        in protest in both houses of Congress. Breckenridge made a speech on the
        occasion which must transmit his name with undying honour to posterity;
        for it was the last cry of freedom ever to be heard in those walls,
        until they shall have been purged by fire and blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No voice of inspiration
        is needed to point where this nation is drifting. The crimes which have
        disgraced other lands, from the contemplation of which humanity shrinks
        appalled, will yet be enacted here. A people do not sink at once from
        the height of prosperity, and power, and civilisation, to the lowest
        abyss of lawless despotism, without some spasmodic attempts at
        counteraction. But the systematic efforts at demoralisation will soon be
        apparent: the public taste will become vitiated; the voice of conscience
        will be smothered by the craving for excitement; fanaticism will assume
        the guise of patriotism, and under that sacred name the rights of
        civilisation will be trampled under foot.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guillotine was a
        most humane invention; but in the hands of a lawless mob became a
        fearful instrument of vengeance, and has damned to immortality its
        harmless inventor, who also perished by it. Mr. Lincoln and his Minister
        of State, Mr. Seward, have set at work the social guillotine; and I am
        but a poor prophet unless, in its evolutions, they also become the
        victims; for they have inaugurated a mighty revolution, the bitter
        fruits of which will be brought home to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the intention of
        the Abolitionists to arrest Breckenridge for treason immediately on the
        conclusion of his speech, had he afforded the slightest pretext for
        doing so. Several of the prominent leaders had told me, 'that they had
        committed a blunder in ever having allowed him to take his seat.' I
        warned Mr. Breckenridge of his danger, and gave him the names of the
        parties who had spoken thus to me. He at once recognised his peril, and
        re-worded his speech as to avoid the threatened danger, at which the
        Abolitionists were greatly chagrined.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Sumner was
        anxious that a test-oath should be applied to those senators who were
        considered of doubtful loyalty to the Lincolnites, as had be already
        done to officers of the army; Colonel John

        Lee having the unenviable notoriety of being the first Southern-born
        officer who subscribed to this oath of allegiance to the tyrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must not be supposed
        that the social element was neglected in these times of stern alarm. Mr.
        Seward was too new in his character of diplomatist to disregard so
        important a concomitant of success. He had recently returned from Europe
        - had basked in the smiles of Lord John Russell and the Exeter Hall
        clique - and had been taught by a charming diplomatic lady that a white
        neck-cloth was alone <i><em>comme il faut</em></i> at a dinner or
        evening party. So he took the Club House, made memorable in Washington
        on account of its proximity to the scene of that fearful Sickels
        tragedy, and commenced a series of entertainments, which were attended
        by a vast crowd of men in uniforms, and a sparse sprinkling of women,
        who, with few exceptions, were not of a class to shed much lustre on the
        Republican Court; for the refinement and grace which had once
        constituted the charm of Washington life had long since departed, and,
        like its former freedom, was now, alas! a tradition only.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find, by historical
        observation, that nations as they begin to decline in morality and
        civilisation have always a morbid passion for pastimes and amusements

      <hr />
      <a name="green44"> Page 44</a>

        which address themselves to the physical senses. France, in her days of
        revolution, had her saturnalia to the Goddess of Liberty - Mexico her
        bull-fights - the Yankee nation her colossal reviews and mimic battles,
        at which President Lincoln, surrounded by his satellites, complacently
        assisted, as if the salvoes of artillery which rent the air in his
        honour could shut out from the ears of Heaven, as well as from his own,
        the wail of the widow and the orphan.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to
        reconcile the frivolity of these people from the beginning with a sense
        of the perils which environed them. Mr. Seward, even after the direful
        rout at Manassas - when hecatombs of their dead lay manuring the sacred
        soil - persisted in saying,
        <i>'There is nothing the matter!'</i> President Lincoln still said,
        <i>'There is nobody hurt!'</i> even though he had reached the Capitol
        like an escaped convict, under the disguise of a 'Scotch cap and cloak,'
        and continued for days to edify his visitors with an account of his
        ingenuity in eluding the supposed murderous snare which had been set for
        him - leaving his wife and children, however, with true Yankee chivalry,
        to encounter the dreadful fate from which he so exultantly described
        himself as having escaped.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>'Nobody hurt!'</i>

        President pursues his evening drive under escort of an armed guard,
        which quite takes us back to the feudal ages. The sight pleased me, I
        confess, as a foreshadowing of the gathering tempest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I could present
        to the mind's eye a picture of Washington as it really appeared under
        the desecration of the Black Republican rule. Those of its former
        population who remained from necessity or other causes had disappeared
        entirely from the surface of society. A new people had taken their
        places, as distinct and marked in their characteristics as any barbarian
        race that ever overran Christendom, and who, in their insolent pride of
        conquest, speedily effaced every landmark of civilisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city was filled to
        overflowing with greedy adventurers seeking office. Day after day, and
        month after month, the resistless tide, with black glazed carpet-bag in
        hand, came rolling in. I sometimes thought them the lost tribes of
        Israel, who, sniffing from afar the golden harvest, had pierced the
        confines of eternity and found their way over. Every thoroughfare -
        every public building - doorway, and corridor, and steps - were blocked
        up by these sturdy beggars, who came to demand the spoils of victory;
        and who, disdaining the accommodation of hotel or lodging-house, ate
        their meals out of those same black
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green46"> Page 46</a>
      <p>
        glazed carpet-bags, on the highways or byways, and slept like dogs in a
        kennel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add to all this the
        thousands of drunken demoralised soldiers who filled the streets,
        crowding women into the gutters, with ribald and obscene observations,
        and sometimes with more personal insult. It was even difficult to look
        from the windows without the sense of decency being shocked; and the
        public squares, which were once such favourite resorts, had now become
        the chosen places of debauchery and crime. The schools throughout the
        city had been closed, as it was no longer safe for children to go into
        the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon no class of the
        community did this total abnegation of all the laws, both human and
        divine, tell with such saddening effect as upon the free coloured
        population, especially the women, whose sober industrious habits of
        former days had given place, under the influence of the new order of
        things, to the most unbridled licentiousness, and who were to be seen at
        all public places bedecked in gorgeous attire, sharing the smiles of the
        volunteer officers and soldiers with the republican dames and
        demoiselles.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have frequently
        received the answer, when I have sent to demand the services of a negro
        serving-woman, 'that she would not come, for the reason
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green47"> Page 47</a>
      <p>that she had an engagement to drive or walk with a Yankee officer.'</p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will gladly turn from
        the contemplation of this heart-sickening picture to the comedy of 'High
        Life below Stairs' being enacted at the White House. Mrs. Lincoln,
        disregarding, or more probably being ignorant of, the conventional
        usages which have from time immemorial regulated the etiquette at the
        Presidential mansion, created much amusement and ridiculous comment upon
        the first public occasion after the assumption of her new dignity in the
        reception of the ladies of the diplomatic corps.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The custom at Washington
        is precisely similar to that practiced at all other courts, that, as
        soon after the installation of a new chief as is practicable, the
        representatives of foreign nations accredited to the Government should
        be formally introduced by the Secretary of State, and a complimentary
        address delivered in their behalf by the <i>doyen,</i> or oldest member
        of the diplomatic body, which is answered by the President - all being
        arranged beforehand, even to the exchange of the addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In like manner the
        ladies of the diplomatic corps, after due notification, are presented to
        the feminine representative of the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ceremony is always
        regarded as one of
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green48"> Page 48</a>
      <p>
        importance, second only to a presentation at St James's or St. Cloud.
        The ladies in question, after due notification, presented themselves
        <i><em>en grande tenue</em></i> at the White House, where they were
        ushered very unceremoniously into one of the reception-rooms, and left
        in a most uncomfortable state of uncertainty as to the next step in the
        programme. After some time, and when speculation had well nigh exhausted
        itself, a young woman, dressed in a pink wrapper and tucked petticoat,
        came bounding in, not making, however, the slightest recognition of the
        presence of the distinguished visitors assembled, but stood balancing
        herself first on one foot and then the other, surveying them meanwhile
        with a most nonchalant air, and after having gratified her curiosity
        withdrew with as little ceremony as she had entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surprised enquiry of
        the stranger ladies, 'Is this Mrs. Lincoln?' had scarcely subsided, when
        a small dowdy-looking woman, with artificial flowers in her hair,
        appeared. The first idea was that she was a servant sent to make excuses
        for the singular delay of Mrs. Lincoln. But she approached and addressed
        herself in conversation to the wife of a secretary of legation, and it
        gradually dawned upon the part that this was the feminine representative
        of the Black Republican Royalty, and they made the best of the

        awkward situation. Mrs. Lincoln herself, however, not seeming to be
        aware that everything was not conducted in the most orthodox fashion,
        had instructed a little lady to inform Mme. Mercier that she was
        studying French, and would by winter be able to converse with her in
        that language. By this she has probably discovered that there is no
        'royal road to learning.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a most graphic
        description of this scene from more than one of the victims of this
        first Republican Court ceremony, and only wish that I could give the
        picture with all its nicer touches. The young lady in the tucked
        petticoat was a niece of Mrs. Lincoln.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the fact of Mr.
        Seward being master of the ceremonies, Mr. Lincoln was a little less
        <i>bizarre</i> in his ministerial reception. But at the dinner given in
        honour of the occasion, when the different wines were served, and he was
        asked which he would take, he turned to the servant with most touching
        simplicity and said: 'I don't know: which would you?'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anecdote is as well
        authenticated as the spilling of the cup of tea on Mrs. Masham's gown.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A distinguished
        diplomatist, in discussing the merits of the illustrious pair, said: 'He
        is better than

      <p>she, for he seems by his manner to apologise for being there.'</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Harrison is
        said on his death-bed to have instructed the barber who shaved him, to
        carry out the provisions of the Constitution; and President Lincoln,
        much to the chagrin of his constitutional advisers, was in the habit of
        discussing matters of equal importance with his servants, or 'helps,' as
        he termed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Lincoln asserted
        with great energy her right to a share of the distribution of the
        Executive patronage. She had received as a present, from a man named
        Lammon, a magnificent carriage and horses, promising him in return the
        marshalship of the district of Columbia, one of the most lucrative
        offices in the gift of the Executive.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Lincoln had,
        however, determined to bestow the office upon another applicant, who had
        also paid his <i><em>douceur,</em></i> and who was in attendance,
        waiting to receive the commission which was being made out. Mrs. Lincoln
        came into the President's office, asked what commission it was that he
        was signing; and on being told, seized it from his hands, tore it in
        pieces, saying that she had promised it to 'Lammon,' and he should have
        it, else her name was not 'Mary Lincoln.'
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green51"> Page 51</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lammon of course
        received the commission, and the discomfited applicant reported this
        conjugal scene; and from that hour commenced the system of votive
        offerings at the shrine of Mrs. Lincoln.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been a custom at
        Washington to distribute the hay and grass, cut from the public grounds,
        to the poor and meritorious population of the city. It was a cheap and
        graceful charity on the part of the Government, duly appreciated by the
        recipients; for, thus aided, many a poor widow was enabled to buy bread
        for her children, from the proceeds of milk from her cow. Mrs. Lincoln
        put a stop to this praiseworthy custom, and claimed it as one of her
        perquisites.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commonplace and vulgar
        as these incidents may seem, they are, however, useful illustrations of
        the practical application of William M. Marcy's famous aphorism,
        <i>'To the victors belong the spoils.'</i> The anecdotes of Queen
        Christina of Sweden present more clearly the character and degree of
        civilisation of the people over whom she reigned than any laboured
        historical effort could have done; and no one would dream of describing
        a royal banquet amongst the Fejee islanders and omit the cold bishop on
        the side-table.

        CHAPTER IV.
        <br />
        DAYS OF TRIAL.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE digression in the
        last chapter has drawn me from my purpose of telling how I became a
        prisoner of State.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September the 6th was
        the first time since that eventful period that I had had access to pen
        and paper - all writing-materials having been hitherto withheld from me
        by order of the heads of the War and State Departments; and, as I knew
        not at what hour the act of grace might be rescinded, I felt inclined to
        make the most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, on
        Friday, August 23, 1861, as I was entering my own door, on returning
        from a promenade, I was arrested by two men, one in citizen's dress, and
        the other in the fatigue dress of an officer
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green53"> Page 53</a>
      <p>
        of the United States Army. This latter was called Major Allen, and was
        the chief of the detective police of the city. They followed close upon
        my footsteps.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had stopped to enquire
        after the sick children of one of my neighbours, on the opposite side of
        the street. From several persons on the side-walk at the time,
        <i><em>en passant,</em></i> I derived some valuable information; amongst
        other things, it was told me that a guard had been stationed around my
        house throughout the night, and that I had been followed during my
        promenade, and had probably been allowed to pursue it unmolested, from
        the fact that a distinguished member of the diplomatic corps had joined
        me, and accompanied me to that point. This caused me to observe more
        closely the two men who had followed, and who walked with an air of
        conscious authority past my house to the end of the pavement, where they
        stood surveying me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continued my
        conversation apparently without noticing them, remarking rapidly to one
        of our humble agents who passed, 'Those men will probably arrest me.
        Wait at Corcoran's Corner, and see. If I raise my handkerchief to my
        face, give information of it.' The person to whom this order was given
        went whistling along. I then put a very important
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green54"> Page 54</a>
      <p>
        note into my mouth, which I destroyed; and turned, and walked leisurely
        across the street, and ascended my own steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few moments after, and
        before I could open the door, the two men above described rapidly
        ascended also, and asked, with some confusion of manner, 'Is this Mrs.
        Greenhow?' I answered, 'Yes.' They still hesitated; whereupon I said,
        'Who are you, and what do you want?' 'I come to arrest you.' 'By what
        authority?' The man Allen, or Pinkerton (for he had several aliases),
        said, 'By sufficient authority.' 'Let me see your warrant.' He mumbled
        something about verbal authority from the War and State Departments, and
        then both stationed themselves upon either side of me, and followed into
        the house. I rapidly glanced my eye to see that my signal had keen
        understood, and remarked quietly, 'I have no power to resist you; but,
        had I been inside of my house, I would have killed one of you before I
        had submitted to this illegal process.' They replied, with evident
        trepidation, 'That would have been wrong, as we only obey orders, and
        both have families.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene occurred in
        much less time than is requisite to describe it. I took a rapid survey
        of the two men, and in that instant decided upon my own line of conduct;
        for I knew that the fate of some
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green55"> Page 55</a>
      <p>
        of the best and bravest belonging to our cause hung upon my own coolness
        and courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this the house had
        become filled with men; who also surrounded it outside, like bees from a
        hive. The calmness of desperation was upon me, for I recognised this as
        the first step in that system of infamy which was yet to hold up this
        nation of isms to the scorn of the civilised world. This was the first
        act of the new copartnership of Seward, M'Clellan,&amp; Co., - the
        strategic step, on coming into power, of the young general so lauded -
        an attack upon women and children, and a brilliant earnest of the
        laurels to be won on his march to Richmond.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked, after a few
        moments' survey of the scene, 'What are you going to do?' 'To search,'
        Allen replied. 'I will facilitate your labours;' and, going to the
        mantel, I took from a vase a paper, dated Manassas, July 23, containing
        these words - 'Lt.-Col. Jordon's compliments to Mrs. R. Greenhow. Well,
        but hardworked' - the rest of the letter being torn off before it
        reached me, some ten days before, through the city post-office. I
        suspected its delicate mission, so kept it, from an instinct of caution,
        and had shown it to Major Bache, of U. S. A., Captain Richard Cutts,
        Wilson, of Massachusetts, and several others. I threw it to Allen,
        saying, 'You would like to finish
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green56"> Page 56</a>
      <p>
        this job, I suppose?' He took it, discarding, however, the city envelope
        in which I had received it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cool and indifferent
        evidently disconcerted the whole party. They had expected that, under
        the influence of the agitation and excitement of the trying position, I
        should have been guilty of some womanly indiscretion by which they could
        profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An indiscriminate search
        now commenced throughout my house. Men rushed with frantic haste into my
        chamber, into every sanctuary. My beds, drawers, and wardrobes were all
        upturned; soiled clothes were pounced upon with avidity, and mercilessly
        exposed; papers that had not seen the light for years were dragged
        forth. My library was taken possession of, and every scrap of paper,
        every idle line was seized; even the torn fragments in the grates or
        other receptacles were carefully gathered together by these latter-day
        Lincoln resurrectionists.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My library, be it
        remembered, was <i>my sanctum;</i> it was there also that I gave lessons
        to my children, many of whose unlettered scribblings were tortured into
        dangerous correspondence with the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a keen observer of
        their clumsy activity, and resolved to test the truth of the old saying
        that <i>'the devil is no match for a clever woman!'</i> I was
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green57"> Page 57</a>
      <p>
        fully advised that this extraordinary proceeding might take place, and
        was not to be caught at a disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had received a note a
        few days before, stating that one of M'Clellan's aides had informed a
        lady in George Town that I was to be arrested, also that the name of the
        Honourable William Preston, U. S. Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain, who
        was at that time in Washington, stood in the proscribed list. He was
        warned by me in time to effect his escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile I was a
        prisoner in one of my own parlours, not allowed to move, with stern eyes
        fixed upon my face, to read certainly what they did not find; for,
        although agonising anxieties filled my soul, I was apparently careless
        and sarcastic, and, I know, tantalising in the extreme. My servants were
        subjected to the same surveillance, and were not allowed to approach me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort was made to
        keep my arrest a secret. My house externally was quiet as usual; three
        sides of it, being surrounded by a high wall, screened the guard from
        observation. It was considered the headquarters of the Secessionists,
        and I being regarded as the head of the conspirators at Washington, a
        rich haul was anticipated. They reckoned without their host this time.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green58"> Page 58</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In despite of all their
        wisely taken precautions, the news of my arrest rapidly spread. At
        eleven o'clock I was taken prisoner - at about three o'clock my young
        friend Miss Mackall, and her sister, came to make enquiries; she had
        heard it in the city. As she entered she was rudely seized by the
        detective, who stood concealed behind the door, and pushed forward, as
        was also her sister. They were terrified at the sight of the rude
        lawless men who were in possession of my once peaceful quiet home. The
        dear, brave-hearted girl put her head on my shoulder and wept, for she
        said, 'I did not know what they had done with you.' I whispered, 'Oh, be
        courageous, for we must outwit these fiends.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I had
        succeeded in completely reassuring her, the detective called Captain
        Dennis approached, and in a loud authoritative voice demanded her name
        and residence, as well as that of her sister. We were all, after this,
        ordered to return to the back parlour, under escort of this Captain
        Dennis, whose duty for the time was to watch me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of examining my
        papers had already commenced. It was indeed a hard struggle to remain a
        quiet spectator of this proceeding, but I nevertheless nerved myself to
        the task, as my object was to throw the detectives off their guard. I
        had
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green59"> Page 59</a>
      <p>
        no fear of consequences from the papers which had as yet fallen into
        their hands. I had a right to my own political opinions, and to discuss
        the question at issue, and never shrank from the avowal of my
        sentiments. I am a Southern woman, born with revolutionary blood in my
        veins, and my first crude ideas on State and Federal matters received
        consistency and shape from the best and wisest man of this century, John
        C. Calhoun. These ideas have been strengthened and matured by reading
        and observation. Freedom of speech and of thought were my birthrights,
        guaranteed by our charter of liberty, the Constitution of the United
        States, and signed and sealed by the blood of our fathers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Calhoun had been the
        intimate friend of my husband, and often our guest, having remained
        several months at a time with us during his senatorial sojourn at
        Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, I had
        been honoured by a correspondence with him, and it was my privilege to
        sit by his bedside and minister to his wants during his last illness,
        and to treasure in my heart his words of wisdom; and when he died, I
        followed his remains, as one of his children, to his last resting-place
        - the Senatorial Committee of Arrangements, of which our honoured
        Commissioner to England, Mr. Mason,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green60"> Page 60</a>
      <p>
        was one, having assigned me that position in the solemn pageant. Mr.
        Webster walked by my side as we turned from the tomb, and, with tears
        trickling down his face, made use of these words: 'One of earth's
        princes hath departed - the purest, best, and greatest man I ever knew!
        He was a Roman senator when Rome was.' The same expression he had used
        in his eloquent oration of the morning. Mr. Clay, in his eulogy upon him
        in the Senate at the same time, said, 'He was my senior in everything
        but years.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the examination of
        my papers by Seymour, the most respectable and the only educated man
        amongst those detectives, he said, 'Well, madam, you have no reason to
        feel anything but pride and satisfaction at the ordeal you have gone
        through, for there is not a line amongst your papers that does not do
        you honour. It is the most extensive private correspondence that has
        ever fallen under my examination, and the most interesting and
        important; there is not a distinguished name in America that is not
        found here. There is nothing that can come under the charge of treason,
        but enough to make the Government dread and hold you as a most dangerous
        adversary.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to return to the sad
        relation of my wrongs.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green61"> Page 61</a>
      <p>
        The search still went on. I desired to go to my chamber, and was told
        that a woman was sent for to accompany me. It did not even then flash
        upon my mind that my person was to be searched. I was, however, all the
        more anxious to be free from the sight of my captors for a few moments;
        so, feigning the pretext of change of dress, &amp;c., as the day was
        intensely hot, after great difficulty, and thanks to the slow movements
        of these agents of evil, I was allowed to go to my chamber, and then
        resolved to accomplish the destruction of some important papers which I
        had in my pocket, even at the expense of life. (The papers were my
        cipher, with which I corresponded with my friends at Manassas, and
        others of equal importance.) Happily I succeeded without such a fearful
        sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective Dennis
        little dreamed that a few paces only stood between him and eternity. He
        rapped at my door, calling 'Madam! madam!' and afterwards opened it, but
        seeing me apparently legitimately employed, he withdrew. Had he advanced
        one step, I should have killed him, as I raised my revolver with that
        intent; and so steady were my nerves, that I could have balanced a glass
        of water on my finger without spilling a drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after the female
        detective arrived. I blush
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green62"> Page 62</a>
      <p>
        that the name and character of woman should be so prostituted. But she
        was certainly not above her honourable calling. Her image is
        daguerreotyped on my mind, and as it is an ugly picture, I would
        willingly obliterate it. As is usual with females employed in this way,
        she was decently arrayed, as if to impress me with her respectability.
        Her face reminded me of one of those india-rubber dolls, whose
        expression is made by squeezing it, with weak grey eyes which had a
        faculty of weeping. Like all the detectives, she had only a Christian
        name, Ellen. I began to think that the whole foundling hospital had been
        let loose for my benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was ushered into
        my chamber, a detective standing on guard outside of the door to receive
        the important documents believed to be secreted on my person - nothing
        less, I suppose, than a commission of Brigadier-General from President
        Davis, upon the principle that, whereas President Lincoln had conferred
        that distinguished grade upon many who deserved to be old women,
        President Davis had, with characteristic acuteness, discovered qualities
        in a woman equally entitled to reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was allowed the poor
        privilege of unfastening my own garments, which, one by one, were
        received
      </p>

      <p>
        by this pseudo-woman and carefully examined, until I stood in my linen.
        After this, I was permitted to resume them, with the detectress as my
        tire-woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During all this time, I
        was cool and self-possessed. I had resolved to go through the trying
        ordeal with as little triumph to my persecutors as possible. I had
        already taken the resolution to fire the house from garret to cellar, if
        I did not succeed in destroying certain papers in the course of the
        approaching night; for I had no hope that they would escape a second
        day's search. My manner was therefore assumed to cover my intentions. I
        was also sustained by the conscious rectitude of my purpose, and the
        high and holy cause to which I had devoted my life. I felt that a people
        struggling to maintain their rights and to transmit unimpaired to their
        children the glorious heritage of revolutionary fathers, was under the
        protection of that Divine overruling Providence, which could carry me
        unscathed across the burning plough-shares spread for my destruction.
        With this conviction in my soul, I resigned myself to the law of the
        strongest, for I knew not what further trials were in store for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orders were to
        entrap everybody who called at my house. Miss Mackall and her sister
        were
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green64"> Page 64</a>
      <p>
        already in durance. Mrs. Mackall, who came in pursuit of her children,
        was seized and detained, as also several other casual visitors. I know
        not, in fact, how many were taken into custody, for, as the evening
        advanced, I was ordered upstairs, accompanied by my friends, a heavy
        guard of detectives being stationed in the rooms with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little later I had
        reason to regard it as a signal act of Divine mercy that those friends
        were sent me. As I have said, it was believed that all the Secessionists
        in the city were in communication with me, so everyone who called, black
        or white, was viewed as an emissary; a former man-servant of mine, and
        his sister, in passing the house, were made prisoners. The man was
        confined below stairs, and the young girl taken into the parlour, with
        only those brutal men as her companions. I was not aware of her being in
        the house until startled by a smothered scream. My first idea was that
        some insult had been offered to my maid, but, being satisfied on that
        point, I tried to believe that my sense of hearing had deceived me.
        Still, I could not divest myself of the horrible fear, and after a while
        succeeded in sending some one down. The girl was found in a state of
        great alarm, from the rudeness to which she had been exposed, and was
        sent below to her brother; and I now began
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green65"> Page 65</a>
      <p>fully to realise the dark and gloomy perils which environed me.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chiefs of the
        detectives having gone out, several of the subordinates left in charge
        now possessed themselves of rum and brandy, which aided in developing
        their brutal instincts; and they even boasted, in my hearing, of the
        <i>'nice times'</i> they expected to have with the female prisoners.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As every evil is said to
        be checkmated by some corresponding good, I was enabled by this means to
        destroy every paper of consequence. I had placed them where they could
        be found by me at any hour of the day or night, and was not slow to
        avail myself of the state of inebriation in which the guards were
        plunged. Stealing noiselessly to the library in the dark, I mounted up
        to the topmost shelf, took from the leaves of a dusty folio papers of
        immense value to me at that moment, concealing them in the folds of my
        dress, and returned to my position on the bed without my gaolers having
        missed me. The papers were much more numerous than I imagined and the
        difficulty was how to dispose of them. The chance of my friends being
        searched on going out (as they were assured they should do) at three
        o'clock, made me hesitate as to that method. I remembered, however,
        that, in the search of my
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green66"> Page 66</a>
      <p>
        person in the morning, my boots and stockings had not been removed; so
        Miss Mackall concealed the papers in her stockings and boots. This
        proceeding of course occupied some time, but it was noiselessly
        accomplished in the presence of the guard. It was agreed between Miss
        Mackall and myself, that if, after leaving my room, she learned that her
        person would be searched, she should be seized with compunction at
        leaving me, and return to share the honours of the conflagration.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proper here to
        state that the mother of Miss Mackall was not cognisant of this, or any
        other circumstance calculated to have involved her in the difficulties
        surrounding me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard, meanwhile,
        all unconsciously continued their conversation, which, under the
        influence of the ardent spirits they had imbibed, became heated and
        angry. I exerted myself to promote the discussion, and arrayed their
        different nationalities one against the other - they were English,
        German, Irish, and Yankee.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reasoned that so
        unusual a circumstance as men
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green67"> Page 67</a>
      <p>
        wrangling in my house would warn my friends of the existence of an
        extraordinary state of things. It was a clear moonlight night, and fear,
        like death, had hushed every sound in that section of the city. It was a
        judicious conclusion, as I subsequently learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must here record a
        circumstance which will go far to prove that a certain
        <i>gentleman in black</i> does not always take care of his own. The
        chief detective, Allen, having gone out on some other errand of
        mischief, on returning about nine o'clock encountered a gentleman who
        was at that time Provost-Marshal of the city, and who was about to call
        to make a visit at my house. Allen, being ignorant of or disregarding
        his official position, attempted to arrest him. He ran, pursued by
        Allen, until he reached the Provost's quarters, when, ordering out his
        guard, he arrested Allen, and held him in close confinement until the
        next morning, regardless of his oaths, or his prayers to be allowed to
        send a message to Lincoln, or Seward, or M'Clellan. By these indirect
        means Providence seems to have watched over and averted destruction from
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the hours of
        three and four, on the morning of the 24th, my friends were permitted to
        depart, under escort of a detective guard, who were
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green68"> Page 68</a>
      <p>stationed around their houses for the following day.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this I was allowed
        to snatch a few hours of repose, much needed after the mental and bodily
        fatigue of that most trying day. But I must also state that the two
        doors leading into my chamber were kept open, with a guard stationed
        inside of each.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the
        24th, at about eleven o'clock, my friend Miss Mackall, much to the
        surprise of the Yankee detective police, returned, and for several weeks
        shared my imprisonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For seven days my house
        remained in charge of the detective police, the search continuing
        throughout all that time, as also the examination of my papers and
        correspondence. The books in the library were all taken down and
        examined leaf by leaf. There would have been some wisdom in this the
        first day. Several large boxes, containing books, china, and glass,
        which had been packed for several months, were subjected to the like
        ordeal. Finally, portions of the furniture were taken apart, and even
        the pictures on the walls received their share of attention also. My
        beds even were upturned many times, as some new idea would seize them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now watched their
        clumsy proceedings free
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green69"> Page 69</a>
      <p>
        from anxiety, as I had, under their own eyes, sent off or destroyed all
        my papers of value.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search still went
        on. My powers of observation became quickened to a degree which would
        have made me a valuable auxiliary to the honourable body, to whose care
        the Abolition Government had confided the lives and honour of helpless
        women and children.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemingly I was treated
        with deference. Once only were violent hands put upon my person - the
        detective, Captain Dennis, having rudely seized me to prevent my giving
        warning to a lady and gentleman, on the first evening of my arrest
        (which I, however, succeeded in doing), and as the birds escaped his
        snare, his rage grew beyond bounds, and he seized me with the spring of
        a tiger, and crushed my poor arm, which long bore the marks of the
        brutal outrage. The story of the hapless Queen of Scots was most
        feelingly called to my recollection. A strong effort was afterwards made
        to drive this from my mind, as if aught but the life's blood of the
        dastard could efface it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My orders were asked for
        my meals, which I humoured as one of the necessities of my situation.
        But Lily and I were like the Siamese twins, inseparable. My pistol had
        been taken from me, and I
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green70"> Page 70</a>
      <p>
        had no means of defence, and for the first time in my life I was exposed
        to the dread of personal violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had, however, the
        satisfaction, after a few days, of perceiving that even my lawless
        captors were rebuked into more quiet and reserve before me, although
        they still presumed to seat themselves at table with me, with unwashed
        hands, and shirt-sleeves.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactics of my
        gaolers changed many times. Occasionally, it seemed that my confinement
        was only nominal; all this, of course, was to throw me off my guard. The
        subordinates threw themselves in my way, as if disgusted with the task
        assigned them, and, with <i>hearts overflowing with kindness,</i> and
        <i>hands ready to be bribed,</i> discoursed most fluently upon the
        outrage committed in my arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two deserve especial
        notice. One was a burly Irishman, with smooth tongue, professing the
        religion of my ancestors, that of the Holy Catholic faith. He marvelled
        that so noble a lady should have been treated as a common malefactor;
        and, by way of still further showing his sympathy, he set himself to the
        task of making love to my maid, hoping by this means to possess himself
        of the important State secrets of which he believed her to be the
        repository. Sentimental walks, and treats at confectioneries at Uncle
        Sam's expense, were a part of the programme.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green71"> Page 71</a>
      <p>
        She, Lizzy Fitzgerald, a quick-witted Irish girl, warmly attached to me
        as a kind mistress, and knowing nothing which the severest scrutiny
        could elicit to my disadvantage, entered keenly into the sport, and, to
        use her own expressive words, <i>'led Pat a dance,' </i>and, under these
        new auspices, performed some very important missions for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other, a canny
        Scotchman, whom they called Robert, expatiated, with tears in his eyes,
        upon <i>'the sublime fortitude'</i> I had exhibited on this my moral
        gridiron; and, seeking still further to commemorate the meek and lowly
        grace with which I had borne myself, asked me to present him with
        M'Clellan's report on the Crimea, with my autograph, for, he said,
        'Madam,' choked with emotion,
        <i>'there is no telling what may happen;</i> and I would like to look at
        your name, and know that you had forgiven me.' His manner was touchingly
        pathetic, and very like what I should suppose Jack Ketch's to be, on
        asking for the <i>black cap after all was over.</i> These two men
        offered to take letters for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned, incidentally,
        that the Provost-Marshal's office was kept on the
        <i><em>qui vive</em></i> by the daily report of these proceedings, from
        which important results were expected to be derived.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During all this time I
        was never alone for a moment.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green72"> Page 72</a>
      <p>
        Wherever I went a detective followed me. If I wished to lie down, he was
        seated a few paces from my bed. If I desired to change my dress, or
        anything else, it was obliged to be done with open doors, and a man
        peering in at me. That every sense of delicacy recoiled from this
        indecent exposure may well be imagined. But, alas! I had no alternative
        but to submit, for, when I remonstrated with the detective, Captain
        Dennis, I was met by the answer that it was the order of the Provost-
        Marshal, and that I was indebted to him that more disgusting severity
        had not been enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Mansfield had
        been superseded in the position of Provost-Marshal of the district of
        Columbia by Brigadier Andrew J. Porter, who was far more congenial, in
        his character and acquirements, with the Satrap and his minions, and not
        likely to entertain any conscientious scruples in the performance of any
        duty which might be assigned to him; and who seemed to have been equally
        fortunate in the selection of his own principal police-officer, Captain
        Averil of the U.S.A., whose genius certainly lay in his new line of
        duty. He was ever on the alert to discover some new persecution for the
        unfortunates within his power, in order to testify his zeal and
        fidelity.

        CHAPTER V.
        <br />
        REIGN OF TERROR.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEANWHILE, my private
        papers and letters were still under the process of examination, and were
        divided off into parcels, marked 'highly important,' 'political,'
        'legal,' &amp;c. according to the perceptive faculty of the examining
        parties, and borne off to the War Department.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one paper
        amongst them which I venture to assert will never be brought to light.
        It was a full and detailed account, so far as could be collected, of the
        appalling attempt of the Abolition party to poison President Buchanan,
        and the chiefs
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green74"> Page 74</a>
      <p>
        of the Democratic party, in Washington, at the National Hotel, a few
        days prior to the inauguration of President Buchanan.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diabolical scheme
        was very near accomplishment, so far as regarded the life of President
        Buchanan, who was for a long time in a very critical condition, and it
        was only by the use of powerful stimulants that his constitution rallied
        from the effects of the poison. He told me that often during the day at
        this time he was obliged to drink several tumblers of unadulterated
        brandy, to keep himself from entire physical exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This created great
        commotion in Washington, and various efforts were made to account for it
        in a natural way. One story was, that the rats, which were very
        troublesome, had been poisoned, and that they had fallen into the tanks
        which supplied the hotel with water. But the corporate authorities took
        the matter in hand, and instituted a very thorough examination; the
        tanks were all emptied of water, and no rats could be found; the sewers
        under and leading through the town were also opened, to see if any
        poisonous exhalations could come from them; and the corporation reported
        that there was no local cause for the epidemic. Everybody fled from the
        plague-stricken spot; and the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green75"> Page 75</a>
      <p>hotel, which was one of the largest in the city, was closed.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time,
        information of a very important character came to the knowledge of the
        authorities. A druggist of Philadelphia wrote to the Attorney-General
        (Caleb Cushing), at Washington, that, in his absence, an order had been
        received and filled by one of his subordinates for thirty pounds of
        arsenic, to be sent to Washington; that so unusual a quantity had
        excited his alarm; that, upon further enquiry, he learned that the
        express charge had been prepaid at Philadelphia for its transportation,
        which was likewise unusual. It was also found that the package had
        reached Washington by Adams&amp; Co.'s Express, and had been called for
        and received by some unknown party. To show the pertinacity with which
        the plot was followed up, Congress had made an appropriation for a
        Major-Domo of the White House, with a salary of $1,200. The person who
        had charge of Mr. Buchanan's rooms at the National was the applicant for
        the post, and was on the eve of receiving the appointment, when a
        gentleman from New York, arrived in post haste, in the night, roused up
        the private secretary of the President, and gave him information of
        importance. The applicant for the place of Major-Domo of the White
        House,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green76"> Page 76</a>
      <p>
        after this, did not again present himself, but disappeared from the
        city.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Black, the
        Attorney-General of the United States, under Mr. Buchanan, whose
        statements corroborated the above information, told me also that he had
        obtained a clue to the whole plot, but that Mr. Buchanan would not allow
        the affair to be pursued, because of the startling facts it would lay
        open to the world, and that he shrank from the terrible exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I considered it a great
        weakness on his part to have forbidden the investigation, as it might
        have averted the John Brown raid, and many other acts of the
        <i>'Irrepressible Conflict'</i> party. Between fifty and sixty persons
        fell victims to this wholesale poisoning experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very large sum had
        been offered for my cipher. This extraordinary sum had stimulated the
        zeal of the
        <i><em>employés</em></i> of the Government to a very remarkable degree.
        I had, of course, too much control over myself to afford any indication
        of my knowledge of what they were seeking, but affected ignorance and
        unconcern.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables were filled
        with fragments of old letters, and scraps in cipher, in several
        languages, from early morn till late at night. For seven days

        they puzzled over them. I had no fear. One by one they had allowed the
        clue to escape them, and for what remained Champollion himself would
        have required a key. Only once was I frightened. Miss Mackall, who, like
        myself, was always on the alert, abstracted from a heap of papers a
        sheet of blotting- paper, upon which was the whole of my despatch to
        Manassas on July 16 - another evidence that Providence watched over me
        as an humble instrument in a glorious cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at this time kept
        perfectly well posted with regard to matters outside, and sometimes
        received valuable information through the inadvertent conversation of my
        gaolers. I had been already notified that several of my despatches had
        been betrayed into Seward's hands by a spy of the name of Applegate;
        that a Cabinet Council had been convened, assisted by Scott and
        M'Clellan; and that several Republican officials had been summoned,
        amongst the number Wilson of Massachusetts, as being implicated by my
        information. The despatches created consternation. The whole Abolition
        Government were at this time shaking with fear of the advance of our
        glorious army, and their children were even hushed to sleep with the
        cry, 'Jeff. Davis is coming.'

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had deemed it
        important that the political intrigues then going on at Washington
        should be clearly understood by the Confederate Government; and as I
        might almost be said to have assisted at Lincoln's Cabinet Councils,
        from the facilities I enjoyed, having
        <i><em>verbatim</em></i> reports of them as well as of the Republican
        caucus, I was thoroughly competent to the task of giving a faithful
        synopsis of their deliberations.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the despatches
        referred to was a long letter to President Davis, describing in detail
        the intrigues to get rid of Scott by the temporary elevation of
        M'Clellan, in which was repeated a conversation I had held with several
        members of the New York press, as an indication of the temper of the
        times, upon a proposition they had under discussion, of uniting to
        dethrone Seward and Cameron, and the reasons <i>pro</i> and
        <i>con.</i> for leaving Seward where he was; that his time-serving
        policy was less conducive to unity and strength; that he would never
        inaugurate any net measures; that if the faction which seemed strongest
        cried for the abolition of slavery, or renewed guarantees for its
        protection, he would lend himself to it, or to anything else which could
        tend to his advancement; that his genius lay in his faculty of
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green79"> Page 79</a>
      <p>
        drawing to himself all the advantages of any successful measure, and of
        shuffling out of the way of an unpopular one; that Bennett, of the 'New
        York Herald,' had understood him perfectly, and had said of him, in
        reply to my remark that 'Seward was the only statesman amongst the Black
        Republican party,'
        <i
          >'He has not the first principle of a statesman: he is a miserable
          political charlatan, and has been the advocate of every
          unconstitutional measure in this State from Anti-rentism down to
          Abolitionism. He has not blood enough in him to entertain an honest
          opinion on any subject, but wishes to be a great man, and will buckle
          to anything for power;'</i
        >
        that the Chevalier Wikoff had gone to Seward and repeated to him some
        portion of this conversation, and that he (Seward) had reddened to the
        roots of his hair, but had appointed an hour to receive him, for the
        discussing certain propositions he had to make on the part of the New
        York press, on the <i>peace question:</i> that the Chevalier, after this
        conversation, came to me and proposed that I should give him a
        safe-conduct to General Beauregard, with a recommendation that he would
        forward him to Richmond, from which city he could write a peace letter:
        that Mr. Seward favoured the idea. He then said,
        <i>'Suppose you go to Manassas, and let</i>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green80"> Page 80</a>
      <p>
        <i>me go under your protection.'</i>
        I said, 'That would be impossible.' He replied quickly,
        <i>'Oh! I have arranged all that with Seward.'</i> I said, 'You
        misunderstand me: your reputation is so bad, that no lady would travel
        in your company.' That, unabashed by this, he then said, 'But will you
        give me a letter which will take me through to Richmond?
        <i
          >I will be willing to go blindfold, and be put in a cage after I get
          there, so that I may write the letter.' </i
        >To which I replied, 'I have no authority to grant your request, and, so
        far from giving you facilities for carrying out your wishes, I should
        consider President Davis derelict in his duty if he did not cause any
        man to be hanged who would do what you propose;' that peace now, upon
        any other basis than separate independence, was out of the question; and
        that, if he had any desire to aid in the accomplishment of that
        desirable end, he had better, through the New York papers, endeavour to
        enlighten the minds of the people on the subject; that we of the South
        had been driven to draw the sword in self- defence, &amp;c. I told of
        Cameron's peculations, which were not then generally known - of
        M'Clellan's plans for reorganising the army - in short, of all that was
        proposed, or being done by the Yankees.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second despatch was
        entirely in cipher, but contained duplicate drawings of some
        fortifications and weak points, which they complimented as being equal
        to those of their best engineers - <i>as well they might;</i>
        besides information of importance, in case our army advanced on
        Washington. My letter was pronounced
        <i>'a very able production.'</i> I had at least the satisfaction of
        knowing that Lincoln and the assembled wisdom of Abolitionism did
        justice to the zeal with which a Southern woman executed her patriotic
        duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fears elevated me
        to a most dangerous eminence, and they deliberated whether I should not
        be publicly tried for treason, and made an example of. The effort to
        obtain my cipher was with the hope of establishing direct evidence
        against me, such as would be available in court upon a public trial, and
        as a justification to the world for their extraordinary proceedings, for
        which there had been no precedent, in a civilised age, save in France
        during the Revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My social position was
        such, that they did not dare follow the suggestions of their first
        excited consultations in disposing of me; for in their own ranks I had
        many devoted friends, who openly expressed their admiration of the
        position I took under the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green82"> Page 82</a>
      <p>circumstances of danger and difficulty which environed me.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Davis directed me,
        in a despatch received at this time, to give up the cipher, if I could
        thereby obtain any advantage. This discretionary instruction of the
        President left me free to follow my own judgment, and destroy it, for
        reasons vital to me, and fraught with hazard to others, actually engaged
        and still unsuspected.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My despatches were all
        written and received at this time under a
        <i><em>nom de plume,</em></i> and Yankee cunning and ingenuity had, even
        at this early day, exhausted itself in efforts to enveigle me into an
        admission or recognition which would compromise me or my friends. They
        had had the infamy to circulate a report that, for a large sum, I had
        engaged to desert my cause and betray my party. But I thank God that
        they did not succeed in shaking the confidence of my friends, which was
        an important object.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I could have made
        my own terms with them can easily be seen from the importance they
        attached to my capture. They had the effrontery to insinuate to me,
        through their subordinates, that a <i>'graceful concession'</i> on my
        part would be most cheerfully responded to by the Government. And when I
        replied that if this was in furtherance of the report
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green83"> Page 83</a>
      <p>
        they had set in circulation - an attempt to bribe me - my only response
        would be that, for weal or woe, I had cast my lot as God and nature
        directed, and that their whole bankrupt treasury could not tempt me to
        betray the meanest agent of our cause. I was asked if I knew that my
        life was in danger, and that probably, to
        <i>save my neck</i>, I might answer differently, to which I replied that
        the life of any one is in danger when in the power of lawless
        scoundrels. Beyond that I had no fears, for their own cowardice
        protected me, as they knew ample retaliation would follow an attempt on
        my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, the 29th,
        the Yankee Government went through the farce of offering to hire my
        house and furniture. I asked to be allowed to see a lawyer for
        consultation, and was told that they would not grant me that right. I
        then answered that, as a prisoner, I was not competent to any legal act,
        and that I declined all negotiations with them; that they had already
        ruined, and destroyed, and stolen all that I valued in the house, and
        that they might continue to hold it by the same lawless tenure - that of
        brute force - as I would not become a party to my own robbery. This I
        said to Quartermaster Howard, who came on the part of the Government,
        and, to
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green84"> Page 84</a>
      <p>do him justice, he appeared heartily ashamed of his mission.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Butler was with
        Cameron and other officials, in the Provost-Marshal's Office, when
        Captain Howard went to report the result of his mission, which he did in
        terms complimentary to me, coupled with the remark 'that he felt like
        tearing the straps from his shoulders, from a sense of mortification at
        the part he was forced to play as he stood before the noble woman.'
        Butler said, 'If the Government will take my advice, and consign that
        <i>haughty dame</i> to my care at Fortress Monroe, I warrant to put her
        through an ordeal which will no longer endanger the loyalty of our
        officers,' &amp;c. &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verily, a Roman tyrant
        made a consul of his horse, but Lincoln has exceeded him in enormity by
        making of Butler the beast a military governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My object in seeing a
        lawyer was of course not with the idle hope of protecting my property.
        But up to this time the
        <i><em>habeas corpus</em></i> had not been suspended, and I wished to
        force the issue between the civil and military authorities, as a means
        possibly of arresting the coming evils. I was informed by the man Allen
        that I knew my rights too well, and that the Government did not intend
        to afford me the means of asserting them.

      <a name="green85"> Page 85</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did, however, in spite
        of their vigilance, succeed in sending a message and note to Judge Black
        (late Attorney-General of the United States) and to the Honourable R. J.
        Walker, requesting them to call upon me. But those grave legal
        gentlemen, influenced by prudential considerations, or sympathy with the
        inquisitorial hierarchy, gave no heed to my request, and I was thus left
        in the hands of an unscrupulous cunning enemy, with only my own judgment
        to guide me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show the utter
        recklessness of the Abolition Government, and the extraordinary means
        they temporarily resorted to, to infuse velour into their demoralised
        ranks, it was now authoritatively published that our great and good
        President had died in Richmond a few weeks after the battle of Manassas.
        He was said to have died of a slow fever, brought on by great mental
        anxiety, and compunction at the share he was supposed to have had in
        bringing about the revolution; that he had breathed his last sigh at
        twenty minutes to six in the morning; that his attending physicians and
        family and friends were present; that his mind was clear, and that he
        solemnly exhorted his friends to renew their allegiance to the United
        States, and to do all in their power to put down the revolution. The
        fags were reported to
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green86"> Page 86</a>
      <p>
        be at half-mast at Arlington Heights, Manassas, and all other points in
        our possession, and that minute guns were fired during the day. This
        account went through the whole North, and was the cause of immense
        rejoicing, for our President had filled them with fear and dread, in
        proportion to the confidence and veneration with which he had inspired
        every Southerner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday morning, the
        30th of August, I was informed that other prisoners were to be brought
        in, and that my house was to be converted into a prison, and that Miss
        Mackall and myself, and little girl and servant, were to be confined in
        one room. After considerable difficulty and consultation with the
        Secretary of War, another small room was allowed for my child and maid,
        with the restriction, however, that I should not go into it, as it was a
        front room, with a window on the street. Subsequently my library was
        also allotted to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parlours were
        stripped of their furniture, which was conveyed into the chamber for the
        use of the prisoners. By this time I had become perfectly callous.
        Everything showed signs of the <font color="red">contaminanation</font>.
        Those unkempt, unwashed wretches - the detective police - had rolled
        themselves in my fine linen; their mark was visible upon every chair and
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green87"> Page 87</a>
      <p>
        sofa. Even the chamber in which one of my children had died only a few
        months before, and the bed on which she lay in her winding-sheet, had
        been desecrated by these emissaries of Lincoln, and the various articles
        of <i><em>bijouterie,</em></i> which lay on her toilet as she had left
        them, were borne off as rightful spoils. Every hallowed association with
        my home had been rudely blasted - my castle had become my prison. The
        law of the land had been supplanted by the higher law of the Abolition
        despot, and I could only say, 'O Lord, how long will this iniquity be
        permitted?'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I stray from my
        story. Soon armed men filled the house, the clank of whose muskets
        resounded through it like the voice of doom. I was confined to my
        chamber, at the door of which two soldiers stood, musket in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commotion below told
        me that other prisoners were arriving. They were the Philips family -
        Mrs. Philips, and her two oldest daughters, and her sister Miss Levi. A
        silent greeting, <i><em>en passant,</em></i> was all we were allowed to
        exchange. These ladies had been arrested the day after I was, and were
        subjected to the like, if not greater indignities, from which the
        presence of the husband and the father could not protect them; and now
        they were dragged from their own homes, the mother from her little
        children,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green88"> Page 88</a>
      <p>
        several of whom were infants of tender age; her house ransacked, her
        papers overhauled, without finding anything to base even a suspicion
        upon - the only circumstance against her really being, that she was a
        Southern woman, and a lady, scorning association with the
        <i>'mudsills'</i> whom the upheaving of the revolution had brought to
        the surface of society.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another prisoner was to
        be confined in the room adjoining mine. A heavy bar of wood had been
        nailed across the door between, so as to prevent all communication. She
        was brought in late at night; her deep and convulsed sobs broke on the
        stillness of the hour. I sat by the door, and heard the officer in
        charge call her name. It was Mrs. Hasler, of whom I had some previous
        knowledge; but, had she been a stranger, her hapless lot would have
        established a claim to my sympathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had sent to this
        person's house, the night of my arrest, to warn her, but found her house
        already in charge of soldiers, and my messenger barely escaped arrest. I
        was, of course, intensely anxious to let her know that she was in my
        house, and to communicate with her. She had been accredited to me as a
        reliable messenger by Colonel Jorden; had successfully served in that
        capacity several times; and it was
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green89"> Page 89</a>
      <p>
        through her means (most innocently, however) that my despatches had been
        betrayed into the hands of the Government. Special care was taken to
        prevent this prisoner and myself from communicating, as they hoped
        through her to establish direct evidence against me. The morning after
        her arrival I diverted the attention of the guard, whilst Miss Mackall
        slipped into her room, and warned her to deny all knowledge of me -
        which was, however, limited to the fact of her having been an agent of
        communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor woman! she had been
        most infamously used - dragged from her own lodgings to a station-house,
        where she had been kept for a whole week, lying on a dirty straw-bed,
        without sheets or pillow, amidst the lowest and most disgusting class of
        the community; and her nervous system had been completely shattered by
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All intercourse between
        the prisoners was interdicted. Had we been adjudged to the condemned
        cell more rigorous measures could not have been enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Mackall was allowed
        to see her mother and sisters only in the presence of an officer.
        Intercourse thus restricted afforded but little pleasure. Still, it was
        a link between us and the outer world, which
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green90"> Page 90</a>
      <p>
        had not been appreciated at its full value until we were deprived of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must not be supposed
        that I have related all the incidents which occurred in these first
        days. Under the eyes of the detective police I had received and answered
        despatches from my friends. Amongst them had been the order from my
        President to give up my cipher, upon specified contingencies. I am
        restrained, by prudential considerations, from mentioning many, and
        where the parties only escaped by the stupidity of my gaolers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts of the Black
        Republicans had been persistently to make the term
        <i>Secessionist</i> one of disgrace and reproach, and although they had
        with great assiduity courted the few Southern families who remained,
        there was no language too coarse for them to use in describing
        <i>Secessionists</i> - always, of course, assuming that the person
        addressed had too much self-respect to be thus classified. Every social
        element was brought to bear against the unhappy Southerner; ties of
        blood and kindred were arrayed in dread hostility, those who remained
        upon the Abolition side affecting to think that their family
        <i>escutcheons</i> had been tarnished by the misguided members who
        advocated the Southern cause, and constitutional liberty. No one
        suffered in this respect

        more than myself, for many members of my immediate family sided with the
        despot, and held high official position under him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective police,
        who had hitherto had charge of me, now gave place to the military guard
        selected from one of the volunteer companies - the Sturgis Rifles, who
        hitherto constituted M'Clellan's bodyguard. A lieutenant and twenty-one
        men were detailed for this valorous duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective police, on
        resigning their charge, were very anxious that I should not be apprised
        of their true characters. They had assumed to be officers of the United
        States regular army, and deluded themselves with the idea that I had not
        discovered 'the wolf under the sheep's clothing.' My wish had been to
        foster this delusion by every means in my power, as I thereby gained
        some advantages; and I very reluctantly allowed myself to be enlightened
        on the subject by some enthusiastic young officers, who cherished the
        hallucination that honour still lingered under the old livery of the
        United States. The officer in charge of my prison, Lieutenant Sheldon,
        was directed by Captain Averil, U.S.A., chief of the Provost-Marshal's
        corps, to encourage me to write letters, which were to be subjected to
        the inquisitorial examination. Of this
      </p>

        fact I was, however, to be kept in ignorance. To the honour of
        Lieutenant Sheldon, he did not lend himself to the plot. I availed
        myself, however, of the privilege of writing, and have certainly to
        thank this most sagacious captain for having afforded me the means of
        communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at this time
        seized with a taste for tapestry-work. The colours necessary for its
        prosecution came to me through the Provost-Marshal's Office, wound in
        balls, with simply a memorandum, by which I could always know the
        original arrangement of colours. I had made a vocabulary of colours,
        which, though not a very prolific language, served my purpose. My
        letters, above all things, puzzled these 'wise men of the East,' who
        finally came to the conclusion that, for a
        <i
          >'clever woman, Mrs. Greenhow wrote the greatest pack of trash that
          was ever read.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of justifying
        this opinion, I will submit a specimen of my epistolary efforts: ---
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course my versatility
        of mind was exercised to vary the style and character of these
        effusions, so as not to attract attention to them, and I am glad to
        state that in this effort I was eminently successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Mackall, although
        not a prisoner, was subjected to most of the restrictions in this house
        of bondage, the freedom originally allowed her being, as I rightly
        judged, for the purpose of ensnaring others. These clumsy tricksters
        could not comprehend the sacrifices which a woman will make in the
        performance of a duty which commends itself alike to her judgment and
        feelings. I could have escaped the snare set for me, but I should
        thereby have one great injury to our cause. Few would have ventured,
        after such an example of timidity, to furnish the necessary information,
        or encounter the odium of being supposed to sympathise with the
        <i>rebels.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt it to be my post
        of duty whatever danger threatened, and that I at least would cast no
        reproach upon my party in going through the trying ordeal; that every
        woman's heart throughout the South,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green94"> Page 94</a>
      <p>
        would make my cause their own; and that, so far from intimidating, the
        knowledge that one of their sex was suffering for the same faith, in the
        prisons of the tyrant, would nerve the most timid to deeds of daring.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of the Yankees
        at first was to hold me up conspicuously before the eyes of the public
        as a terrible example and a warning. In this they signally failed, for I
        became, even amongst their own people, an object of interest. And one of
        their own papers, the 'New York Times,' some months later, said, 'Had
        Madam Greenhow been sent South immediately after her arrest, as we
        recommended, we should have heard no more of the heroic deeds of Secesh
        women, which she has made the fashion.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 7th of September
        my child was taken very ill. In consequence I wrote to Provost-Marshal
        Porter, asking that my family physician might be allowed to visit her.
        With <i>characteristic humanity</i> he refused, and proposed to send me
        one of his own creatures, whom I declined to receive, preferring to
        trust her life to the care of the good Providence which had so often
        befriended me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after, a Dr.
        Steward was introduced. He was a vulgar, uneducated man, bedizened with
        enough gold-lace for three field-marshals; and
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green95"> Page 95</a>
      <p>
        endowed with a considerable degree of 'modest assurance.' He evidently
        expected, by affected <i>bonhomie,</i> to overcome my repugnance to his
        visits; but he reckoned without his host, for, if my confessor had come
        to me under such auspices, I should think that the devil had been
        tampering with him, and refuse to receive him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The routine of my
        prison-life was constantly varied by some new device, on the part of my
        captors, to obtain legal evidence against me. They had already subjected
        me to an ordeal little short of the <i>'celebrated question'</i>
        of the Spanish Inquisition, by a total disregard of all the laws of
        decency. Every feeling of the woman had been shocked and outraged, and
        they now sought to act upon my nervous system, by dark insinuations and
        threats against my life and reputation. My papers had been examined with
        a minuteness bordering upon the farcical. Letters were found from most
        of the gifted and great in our Southern land, whom they now branded as
        traitors; copies of some of my own letters, also, both before and after
        Lincoln's ill-fated elevation, expressing in earnest language my
        appreciation of the coming dangers, and, in some instances, warning my
        correspondents to 'take time by the forelock.' These, however, added no
        link in the chain of evidence, but
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green96"> Page 96</a>
      <p>
        only served to magnify in their eyes my mental I ability, and consequent
        capacity to injure them, and redouble their anxiety to convict me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The despatches already
        in their hands, and which had caused them to tremble even in the midst
        of their armed <i>Hessians,</i> at best would be but circumstantial
        evidence against me; and my connection with these even would have to be
        established upon the testimony of that double spy, Applegate, whom
        Cameron had sent in that capacity to Manassas, under the pretext of
        obtaining the body of his brother; and this man I could have proved to
        have been in the pay of our army, and had furnished some valuable
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Seward, in spite of
        the obfuscation of his perceptive faculties, retained enough of his
        legal acuteness to know that, in so grave a matter as trial for treason,
        the charge must be sustained by two respectable witnesses, and that any
        case made out against me, upon the evidence before them, would have been
        dismissed from every court in Christendom. I did not shrink from this
        trial; and when repeatedly warned that it might take place, said, 'Let
        it come. I will claim the right to defend myself, and there will be rich
        revelations.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government having
        come to the sage conclusion
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green97"> Page 97</a>
      <p>
        that Mrs. Hasler was one of my agents, hoped, through her credulity or
        fears, to obtain additional testimony against me. With this object, the
        spy Applegate was brought to see her. She received him with unsuspecting
        confidence, and drank in with greedy ears his marvellous tales. He
        complained bitterly of having been searched and badly treated, before he
        was allowed to see her, and exhibited his torn hat in evidence. His
        great object, he said, was to fall upon some plan of communicating with
        me, as he had information of importance for me, and asked her if she
        could communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This programme had been
        all arranged at the Provost- Marshal's by General Porter and his
        subordinate knaves; Captain Averil being entitled to the suggestion of
        <i>tearing the hat.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been warned of all
        this in advance, but had not thought it advisable to apprise Mrs. Hasler
        of it. She could not commit herself further to this man than she had
        already done; neither had I any apprehensions concerning myself, as she
        knew nothing, having simply acted as agent, on several occasions, for
        the transmission of despatches, of the purport of which she was as
        ignorant as the mail boy of the contents of his bag.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was proposed to
        confront this worthy agent

        with me, but his own fears rendered abortive every effort of this kind.
        He lived in mortal dread of his life, and when a
        <i>friend of mine</i> went to see him, in order to obtain for me some
        information, he found him double-locked in his room, with a pistol lying
        on either side of him. He soon after left the city, lest he should pay
        the penalty of his crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident, as well
        as others which had preceded it, will convince the Abolitionists that,
        although they held me in close confinement, my system of espionage was
        more perfect than their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Dr. Stewart was, I
        fancy, destined to be my
        <i><em>bête noire</em></i
        >. He said that he was ordered by Provost- Marshal Porter to make a
        daily inspection of my sanitary condition. His vanity was enlisted in
        this. He wished to be able to say, in the course of his morning rounds,
        'I have just been to see the rebel prisoner Mrs. Greenhow, and she says
        so and so.' I had no idea of permitting this, and therefore told him
        that I did not desire to receive his professional visits, as I was
        perfectly well, &amp;c. He wrote
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green99"> Page 99</a>
      <p>
        a prescription for Miss Mackall, in English, every word of which was
        misspelt, and signed himself <i>'Brigand Sargent.'</i> I laughingly
        mentioned the circumstance of a physician's writing a prescription in
        other than Latin. By some means my remarks reached him; so, on the
        repetition of his visit on the following day, he addressed me with 'Good
        morning, Mistress Greenhow; is there anything <i>Materia Medica</i> can
        do for you to-day?' Recalling forcibly to my mind the story of the
        Irishman: - <i><em>'Parlez-vous Français? - Oui.</em></i> - Then lend me
        the loan of a gridiron.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now told
        <i>Materia Medica</i> that his visits were intrusions on my privacy,
        offensive to me, and requested that they might be discontinued. It will
        hardly be credited that after this I should have been subject to the
        annoyance again. On the day succeeding he came in as usual, with
        unblushing effrontery, not even deigning to knock at my door. I took no
        notice of him, but sent for Lieutenant Sheldon to take charge of my
        formal protest against the continuance of the outrage. This he did,
        making also verbal representations which relieved me from further
        <i>sanitary inspection.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this time a stable
        in the rear of my <i>whilom home</i> - my prison - caught on fire,
        through the
      </p>
      <hr />

      <p>
        neglect of some drunken soldiers by whom it was occupied. It created the
        wildest alarm; the whole of the provost-guard, headed by Captain Averil,
        rushed to the scene of action, and surrounded the house. The following
        morning the Government organ contained an account of 'a very daring
        attempt at rescue of the rebel prisoners (with a diatribe against me
        personally), of so resolute and desperate a character that it had to be
        repulsed at the point of the bayonet.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This veracious statement
        was concluded by a high compliment to the intrepidity and courage of
        Captain Averil, for having defeated this <i>imaginary</i> effort to
        defraud justice, which was furnished, I was told, by himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere about the 8th
        of September, Honourable Edwin M. Stanton, accompanied by Judge-Advocate
        Colonel Key, came to see Mrs. Philips and family, to make arrangements
        for their being sent South on parole, which was effected a day or two
        afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Stanton came also to
        see me. I had, of course, no idea of the position he was subsequently to
        hold in the Abolition Cabinet; <i>neither had he at that time.</i> After
        some preliminary conversation, he asked me what I had done to bring down
        the wrath of the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green101"> Page 101</a>
      <p>
        Abolitionists upon my head. I answered, I had been guilty of
        <i><em>lèze-majesté,</em></i> and hence my incarceration; in fact, that
        I knew not the charge, and, for the purpose of ascertaining it, and
        forcing the Government to a consideration of my case, I now wished to
        employ him as my counsel, to obtain a writ of habeas corpus.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This he declined,
        accompanied by expressions of high appreciation and proffer of service
        in any other way - to which I of course attached no value. I had
        previously applied to Judge Black, Attorney-General under Mr. Buchanan,
        and to the Honourable R.J. Walker, both of whom I had known intimately;
        and this last effort convinced me that no Northern man had the courage
        or the desire to attempt to stem the tide of Northern usurpation, which
        was destined to sweep like an avalanche over the land, destroying civil
        liberty, and establishing in its stead an irresponsible military
        despotism.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt now that I was
        alone, and that the wall of separation from my friends was each hour
        growing more formidable
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new grievance was also
        put upon me. Miss Mackall, who up to this time had remained with me,
        was, on the 25th of September, abruptly taken away, and all intercourse
        or communication with me
      </p>

        interdicted. So rigid had become the rules that persons were warned,
        under penalty of arrest, from walking or driving by the prison. A
        police-officer dogged eternally poor Lily's footsteps, which so harassed
        and annoyed her, that she often prayed for the protection of her
        prison-life.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearily and heavily now
        passed the days and weeks. Another plan was also adopted to reduce me to
        submission. My food, which up to this time, though plain and often
        uneatable, had been sufficiently abundant, was now so reduced in
        quantity and quality, as to be inadequate often to satisfy the cravings
        of hunger. My child, as well as myself, suffered greatly under this new
        infliction. I wrote to Provost-Marshal Porter, protesting against this
        inhumanity, but he turned a deaf ear to my remonstrance; and my little
        Rose (who was allowed to play on the pavement, under escort of a guard)
        was often indebted to the kind friends who sent her food whilst there,
        that she should not cry herself to sleep from hunger.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those Yankee descendants
        of the Pilgrim Fathers had improved upon the ancestral practice of
        <i>burning and hanging and quartering</i> their enemies, by
        <i>quartering</i> and starving theirs.
      </p>
      <p>

        perpetrated, more foul, more

        galling to me as a woman, than any which had preceded it. A woman of bad
        repute, known and recognised by several of the guard as such, having
        been seen in the streets of Chicago in the exercise of her vocation,
        calling herself Mrs. Onderdunk, was brought to my house, and placed in
        the chamber of my deceased child adjoining mine. For what object I know
        not, but this woman was allowed unrestricted intercourse with me, the
        order being given that our meals should be served together. Here again
        my thanks are due to Lieutenant Sheldon; for so soon as the character of
        the woman became known to him, he restricted her to her apartment, in
        which she frequently received Mr. Frederick Seward, Under-Secretary of
        State; Mr. Webster, Private Secretary of the Secretary of State, and
        other persons officially connected with the Government.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been
        supposed that my former social position, and that which members of my
        immediate family still held in the Federal city, would have protected me
        from this attempt to degrade me. But surprise will cease when the
        character of this people has been exhibited more clearly, and the
        unscrupulous and demoralising influences, brought by them to bear amidst
        the social relations of life, exposed.

        as witness Mrs. --- and Mrs. --- of Baltimore, and Mme. --- and Mrs. ---
        of Washington City. By such means the sanctity of home was invaded;
        every unguarded expression uttered within its sacred precincts was sure
        to reach the ears of the secret police - those Thugs of America, who,
        less merciful than their Eastern prototypes (who warned their victims of
        their coming fate by a knife stuck in the wall), entered the houses and
        the chambers of women and children at the dead of night, dragging them
        from their beds, and, regardless alike of tears and prayers, forced them
        to assume their garments under the eye, and often amidst the scurrilous
        jests, of their rude and licentious agents. One young girl, to my
        knowledge, died from the shame and horror of this ordeal.

          'that he did not care a rush for the flag; that that was a claptrap
          for the ignorant;'</i
        >
        and that if
        <i
          >'he thought that by this war the old Union could be restored, with
          its constitutional guarantees for slavery, that he would not vote a
          dollar or a man.</i
        >
        <i>No,'</i> he said,
        <i
          >'it was for universal emancipation his party fought, and they were
          now strong enough to declare their true policy.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Honourable Henry
        Wilson said,
        <i
          >'The country had been ruled long enough by Southern aristocrats, and
          that his party would enforce their principles at the point of the
          bayonet;' and 'as to Maryland, they had put the iron heel upon her,
          and would crush out her boundary lines.'</i
        >

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baker, of Oregon, one of
        President Lincoln's most confidential advisers, and United States
        senator, said, in a conversation which I held with him at the time of
        the pretended attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter, in answer to a
        remonstrance of mine on the subject,
        <i
          >'It is true a great many lives may be lost, and we may not succeed in
          reinforcing Fort Sumter. But the President was elected by a Northern
          majority, and they are now becoming dissatisfied; and the President</i

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dickerson, of Rhode

        <i
          >'that if the rebellion could not be suppressed in any other way, he
          was for the abolition of slavery, as a certain means of reducing the

      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I state these
        conversations, and I might add many more to the list, in order to show
        that even at this early day, when the initiatory step in the revolution
        had scarcely been taken, all affectation was thrown aside as to the real
        object of the war - that of subjugation of the South by means of general
        emancipation of the slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Hasler was at this
        time released, upon taking the oath of allegiance, and making a full
        confession of all she had done or knew. I was heartily glad of it. She
        had paid dearly for a momentary impulse, her sympathy or connection with
        our cause being confined to the transmission of a few letters. For this
        she was imprisoned two months in solitary confinement, and it required
        the stern faith of the martyrs of old to withstand the ordeal of our
        Lord Abraham the First. But even this was not done as an act of justice
        to the victim, whose health had become seriously impaired, but by the
        kindly exertions of a lady who exercised as potential an influence
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green107"> Page 107</a>
      <p>
        over the wily Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, as the celebrated Madame
        du Barri did over the grandfather of Louis XVI.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be impossible
        to record the daily, hourly, petty annoyances to which I was exposed.
        Every article of clothing which went to the laundry had to be examined
        by the corporal of the guard, in presence of the officer of the guard.
        Upon one occasion the corporal of the guard, on sending out some article
        of clothing for one of the prisoners, neglected this duty, for which he
        was tried, degraded to the ranks, with imprisonment for thirty days, and
        loss of pay for three months.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it will be seen
        that, whatever repugnance may have been felt by an officer in the
        performance of this task, it was obligatory upon him by order of the
        Provost- Marshal, who seemed to have had some original ideas on the
        subject of the transmission of treasonable communications, although none
        on the subject of decency. The provost-guard was set in commotion one
        day, headed by Captain Averil, on account of a sprig of jessamine having
        reached me without going through the usual examination.

        CHAPTER VI.

        OLLA PODRIDA.
      </h3>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE Abolition Government
        had been for some time amusing the minds of its credulous subjects with
        a new scheme for the annihilation of the South. The greatest naval
        expedition since that of Philip II. for the subjugation of England,
        because good Queen Bess turned a dull ear to his matrimonial scheme, was
        being fitted out, and, regardless of lucky or unlucky synonymes, it was
        also called <i>'The Great Armada.'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every invention of
        modern science was employed in arming and equipping this vast fleet, so
        as to insure the greatest amount of death and devastation to our unhappy
        doomed Southern land. Twenty
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green109"> Page 109</a>
      <p>
        thousand picked troops were sent as a part of the expedition, and, most
        terrible of all, Burnside was to command it - going South to look for
        his hat and his boots which he had lost at Manassas.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be idle to
        record the anxieties which possessed me, as day by day I followed,
        through the 'New York Herald,' the progress of the preparation, and
        final equipment, and embarkation of the men.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destination of this
        formidable <i>armada</i> now became an affair of vast moment, and I
        revolved in my mind the various means by which this
        <i>essential</i> information could be obtained. Accident favoured this
        thirst for knowledge better than any plan, however well arranged, could
        have done.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that Jove
        nods sometimes; and Mr. Secretary Seward, who in the morning is the most
        reticent man in the world (admirably illustrating Talleyrand's famous
        axiom, that language is given to conceal thought), is, after supper, and
        under the influence of the generous gifts which the gods provide, the
        most genial and confidential. I have often had occasion to admire the
        confidingness of his nature on these occasions, and wondered if the
        judgment of the world was correct in ascribing to him the character of a
        subtle schemer and tortuous intriguer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was upon one of these
        festive occasions, when
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green110"> Page 110</a>
      <p>
        the mind of the great statesman had become properly attuned, and his
        thoughts soared above the sordid materialism which fettered his genius
        during the plodding methodical business hours, that he addressed himself
        to the task of indoctrinating a distinguished Foreign Representative,
        whose views, I am sorry to say, were not dissimilar to his own, as to
        the utter hopelessness of the Southern cause, and assuring him that in
        thirty days (a favourite period of his) the rebellion would be crushed
        out - demonstrating this melancholy fact by describing in detail this
        <i>'invincible armada,'</i> and the devastating course it was
        predestined to take.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important
        information was conveyed to me by
        <i>my little bird.</i> Mayhap it was the bird sent out from the ark, and
        did not return, and now came back to me with better than the
        olive-branch. I leave this as an antiquarian speculation. But being
        satisfied by other means of the accuracy of the intelligence, I lost no
        time in preparing one of those
        <i>peculiar square despatches,</i> written in <i>that cipher</i> for
        which a very large amount had been offered, and, with a prayer to
        Almighty God for its safe delivery, committed it to my faithful bird,
        and sent it across the waters to General Beauregard, to be forwarded to
        our great and good President at Richmond.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green111"> Page 111</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might describe, if I
        chose, the danger that my <i>poor bird</i> passed over, and how it at
        one time took refuge in the dovecot of the enemy, and other things of
        startling interest; but this would indicate the course of the
        heaven-sent messenger, and jeopardise the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned at this time
        that Dr. Gwin, formerly United States Senator for <i>California, </i>was
        in Washington, a prisoner, although at large, and I desired very much to
        communicate to him verbally some details which would have been useful to
        our Government, but which I did not dare write, as it would have
        compromised the safety of a friend whose position was one of prominence
        under the Yankee Government. I wrote a note to Dr. Gwin, stating this
        fact, and that I could arrange with perfect safety a personal interview.
        I laugh now at the description of the Doctor's terror on receiving my
        note, and his earnest appeal for God's sake not to attempt to
        communicate with him, for he was surrounded by the detective police,
        &amp;c. He had not learned that therein was his immunity to do seemingly
        impossible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equinoctial gales
        had now set in, and the wailing, shrieking, and howling of the tempest,
        as it
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green112"> Page 112</a>
      <p>swept along, fell on my ear like the soft cadences of sweet music.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abolition feet had
        been a little too tardy in its movements to reap the full benefit of the
        equinoctial blast; still it was considerably damaged, several vessels
        being stranded. A large number of horses, and quantities of ordnance
        stores also, were thrown overboard, thereby causing considerable delay
        before the <i>great armada</i> finally set forth upon its devastating
        errand. Meanwhile my despatch reached Richmond.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very much startled
        one day, somewhere about the 1st of October, at receiving a proposition
        from a Yankee officer to aid in effecting my escape. The first idea that
        flashed upon me was (for I confess that my bump of caution had been
        largely developed by the events of the last few months), that this was a
        trick to ensnare some of my friends, or for the purpose of affording a
        pretext for conveying me to a Northern prison. Whatever my suspicions
        were, I deemed it politic to give no indications of them, so I responded
        to the proposal as if I believed it made in good faith, and opened
        communication with a friend on the subject, warning my friend
        <i>secretly,</i> however, of my suspicions, and giving instructions as
        to the programme to be followed. All things worked
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green113"> Page 113</a>
      <p>
        admirably. The real objects which I had in view (and which I refrained
        from stating, for reason that it might afford an imprudent indication)
        having been effected, I threw grave obstacles in the way of the
        accomplishment of the heroic feat, and it was finally abandoned, from
        seeming want of resolution on my part to undertake it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hardly tell now
        how my time was passed. I had gone through the heat of midsummer into
        the autumn, the severity of my imprisonment increasing all the while -
        my food so uneatable, that for days I had lived upon crackers and
        cheese. I was not even allowed to take exercise in the yard; and was
        credibly informed that a proposition was discussed as to whether my
        windows should not be nailed up, so as to deprive me of light, as a
        means of forcing me into the terms of the Government.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During all this period I
        was shut out from all intercourse or communication with my friends. The
        interdict was absolute: no one was allowed to see me. Even the religious
        consolation which is accorded to the lowest criminal in the Christian
        countries of Europe was denied me. Several members of the Holy Catholic
        clergy applied to see me, and were repulsed with great rudeness at the
        Provost-Marshal's, as being <i>'emissaries of Satan and Secesh.'</i>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green114"> Page 114</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote to enquire
        whether the Provost-Marshal had made a wholesale compact with the Devil,
        by which my child and maid were to be given over to destruction, as well
        as myself - reminding him that there was <i>no monopoly</i> in contracts
        with the <i>Gentleman in Black</i> (the system of corrupt monopoly of
        Government contracts was at this time being loudly denounced), and
        asking that the privilege might be accorded them of going to church.
        This was granted for the ensuing Sunday, and occasionally afterwards,
        but always under escort of a guard, whose orders were to sit in the same
        pew and allow no communication with anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning, as I opened
        my chamber-door to pass to the library, I saw the detective, Allen,
        dragging an old lady up the stairs, who had great difficulty in
        ascending, even with his assistance. It was the venerable mother of the
        martyr Jackson; and I honoured her grey hairs as being his mother more
        than if a diadem had circled her brow. She was placed in the room
        adjoining mine, the bar of wood having been removed after the last
        occupant left. The guard, however, were not aware of this fact, and I
        was amused as I heard the detective double the guard, and order that no
        one was to communicate with the prisoner. I cautiously opened the door
        between our
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green115"> Page 115</a>
      <p>
        apartments, and mounted over a divan which stood across the entrance.
        She sprang forward at seeing one of her own sex. I rapidly cautioned
        her, by pointing to the door leading into the hall, placed my finger on
        my lips, and softly approached her, when the venerable lady folded me in
        her arms, and gave me the information which I have stated above as to
        who she was. I then knelt at her feet, and she rapidly poured into my
        ear tales of the outer world. She told me that she had been dragged from
        her bed at midnight; that she had been only allowed to throw a loose
        gown over her night-dress, and that even in the presence of her captors,
        and was thus brought forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart bled to see
        this noble woman of eighty years subjected to such an ordeal. But she
        proved herself worthy of being the mother of her brave son, She
        recounted to me the heart-rending history of his ruthless murder, and
        how his body had been pinned to the floor by the demons, and kept there
        for many hours for them to gloat over, until his heart-broken wife with
        her own feeble hands dragged it forth for Christian burial.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me also of the
        heroic deeds of our brave soldiers, which filled my heart with pride and
        thankfulness, and I bowed my head in her lap and said,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green116"> Page 116</a>
      <p>
        'Mother, give me your blessing!' And the old matron's words of 'God
        bless you and give you sustaining strength, my child!' seemed to inspire
        me with new courage for what was to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon the officer of the
        guard returned. The terrible
        <i>bar</i> was placed in the door, and I did not again enjoy the
        privilege of speaking with the mother of Jackson, neither was I allowed
        to minister to her comfort. She was kept in a room without fire or
        lights, the weather being very cold, until about twelve o'clock at
        night, when she was released.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson had been one of
        the first victims of this war of aggression. He was a resident of
        Alexandria, Va. Before the occupation of that city by the Yankee forces,
        a marauding party under Ellsworth, a New York fireman and desperado,
        strayed into Alexandria one morning, about daylight, when Ellsworth,
        seeing the Virginia State flag floating from Jackson's house, detached
        himself from his party, and rushed into the house to tear it down.
        Jackson was roused from sleep in time to kill the daring ruffian who had
        thus violated his rights, and was himself murdered a short time
        afterwards, under circumstances of great barbarity, by the remainder of
        the gang, who then spread themselves through the city, plundering and
        committing outrages upon women of respectability.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green117"> Page 117</a>
      <p>
        For this four of their number were condemned to be shot, but their
        escape was subsequently connived at by the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after this, a
        Miss Poole or Stewart was brought in.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 16th day of
        November I received a visit from my sister, Mrs. James Madison Cutts,
        and my niece, the Honourable Mrs. Stephen A. Douglass, accompanied by
        Colonel Ingolls, U.S.A. - the permit to see me making the presence of an
        officer during the interview obligatory, and limiting it to fifteen
        minutes. I had been so ruthlessly debarred communication with my kind,
        that I had long since arrived at the conclusion, that all human kindness
        had taken flight, along with my brethren of the South, and left this
        God-forsaken city of Washington, with its unfortunate
        <i><em>détenue,</em></i> at the mercy of the merciless Abolitionists.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonel Ingolls
        earnestly recommended my
        <i>'graceful submission'</i> to the Government, and kindly offered to
        mediate in my behalf with Secretary Seward.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declined this amiable
        counsel and proffer of aid as inconsistent with my own feelings and
        derogatory to my honour.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had now been three
        months a prisoner, with no
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green118"> Page 118</a>
      <p>
        charge preferred against me, or reason assigned for the illegal act; and
        I determined to address a respectful letter to Mr. Seward, the Secretary
        of State, on the subject, hoping to obtain some elucidation of a matter
        certainly of personal interest to me. This I did on the 17th of
        November. I also sent a copy of this letter to my friends at Manassas,
        with no idea or intention, however, of its ever being given to the
        public, and I confess that at first I was deeply chagrined at the
        circumstance. But when I afterwards knew the anger and annoyance of the
        Abolitionists at having the secrets of their prison-house laid bare, I
        became perfectly satisfied of the superior wisdom of my friends in
        giving it publicity. As a part of my story I subjoin the letter: -
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE contest between the
        different divisions of the Abolitionists for the spoils was now carried
        on with quite as much heat and bitterness as had ever characterised the
        discussions of the two great sectional parties upon the vital questions
        of constitutional rights.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan had been
        brought forward as a necessary expedient for the removal of Scott,
        without any idea, however, of foisting him permanently upon the party.
        But he had taken root amidst the less ultra portions of it, and, from
        having been a

        tool in the first place, now stood defiantly at the head of a party of
        his own, who clamorously supported his pretensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abolition Government
        did not, however, at this time desire to crush; they merely wished to
        clip the wings of the eaglet they had hatched, to prevent his soaring
        too high. His mission had been only half accomplished. General Scott,
        although virtually suspended from all power, still stood legally as
        Lieutenant-General of the Republic and Commander- in-Chief of its armies
        - their blandishments and slights had alike failed in inducing him to
        retire. He still held on, his vanity in some degree blinding him to the
        humiliation of his position.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominally
        commander-in-chief, he merely served to confuse the war councils by the
        exercise of hi undoubted prerogative - that of originating, or approving
        military measures; and he had the mortification of seeing his
        recommendations very generally disregarded, which was the more
        remarkable, from the fact of their being always of the most aggressive
        character towards the South; General Scott never having forgiven that
        section for rejecting him as their candidate for President in 1853.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of irritation
        in which he was kept at this time, brought on a prolonged attack of the
        gout, and the scenes which often took place were described as
        ludicrously tragical for the younger officers, who were obliged to
        approach him officially.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had in reality no
        friends. His arbitrary manner had chilled the growth of affection, even
        in his days of power, and those who had endured his arrogance for
        personal advantage, now that his star was set, addressed themselves to
        other patrons; and the old hero, who had borne himself loftily on a
        hundred battle-fields, but who had at last sullied the glory of his
        proud deeds by ranging himself under the Abolition banner, to trample
        under foot human rights, was now reaping the bitter fruits, in the
        contempt and indignity of the party for whom he had foresworn his
        birthright. Wolsey's celebrated monologue was doubtless often recalled
        to his memory, for truly in his
        <i>'extremity had he been left to the mercy of his enemies.'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political cauldron
        at Washington at this time presented a curious spectacle. Fremont had
        already been brought forward as a rival to M'Clellan. He was supported
        by the more violent of the Abolitionists, with Francis P. Blair as his
        sponsor, who, skilled in all the tortuosities of political intrigue, was
        admirably
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green128"> Page 128</a>
      <p>
        adapted to the position, and perhaps was the only living man who could
        have galvanised Fremont from the condition of obscurity into which he
        had collapsed, after his defeat as the Republican candidate for
        President in 1857.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the feud raged
        with all imaginable bitterness between the friends of the different
        partisan chiefs, M'Clellan was devoting himself, with a zeal worthy of a
        better cause, to the task of producing and organising an army out of the
        chaotic elements at his command; and I often looked on with sickening
        heart, at the energy and talent displayed by him, in surmounting the
        difficulties which beset him in the performance of his Herculean
        labours.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been long since
        determined as the first great rule for a commander, that he should
        acquaint himself thoroughly as to the capabilities of his army. It was
        this knowledge of his subordinates which distinguished Napoleon above
        all others. And M'Clellan seems, in this instance, to have been guided
        by the example of this illustrious man, and to have studied well the
        motley mass composing the grand army.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His conclusion was not
        very flattering - for he decided that their nervous organisation was
        incompatible
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green129"> Page 129</a>
      <p>
        with bayonet charges, and hand-to-hand encounters. Hence he decided to
        make the war hereafter an artillery duel, as the only chance of success
        against<i>
          'the dare-devil Southern chivalry, who were born to the use of
          arms.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end he devoted
        all his energy and influence. The workshops of the North were set in
        motion, and science and skill were employed, to construct the most
        terrible projectiles and guns of largest range; and all for the purpose
        of forcing upon the <i>unappreciative</i> rebels the blessings of
        fraternal intercourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps never before in
        the world was so large an amount of ammunition destroyed in reviews,
        sham battles, and royal salutes. It was, however, a military necessity
        to accustom the men, as well as the horses, to stand fire. Scarcely one
        of these martial games went off without some accident, resulting in the
        loss of life, from the unskilful use of the terrible playthings. Intense
        satisfaction was, however, felt that the rebels had not these scientific
        adjuncts, and, in the next engagement, would be
        <i><em>hors de combat.</em></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak
        <i><em>ex cathedrâ</em></i> on this head, as I had the good fortune of
        having had <i>minutes</i> of M'Clellan's private consultations, and
        often extracts from his notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Seward at this time
        certainly established his

      <a name="green130"> Page 130</a>

        claim to be considered the most adroit schemer of the day, and possessed
        in a rare degree the faculty of making the passions and prejudices of
        others subserve his own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was demonstrated
        his skilful management of the two great parties who were contending for
        military supremacy. His sliding scale was so admirably adjusted, that it
        was difficult to determine which party he favoured; and the truth was,
        he really attached himself to neither. No principle of his was involved
        in the fanatical crusade, only over-towering ambition; and, whichever
        party was likely to be the strongest, with that party will he ultimately
        throw himself. His bump of caution was also largely developed. He had
        raised the whirlwind, and he wished to shelter himself from the dangers
        of the <i>'irrepressible conflict'</i> until its fury had been spent.
        The State Department, with its myriads of secret police, was a safe
        anchorage for the time being, as from thence he could ply the trade of
        the assassin or highway robber without paying the penalty of his crimes;
        for, by the <i>tinkling of that little bell</i> at the State Department,
        the citizen, north, east, or west, was at his mercy. Who will question
        the wisdom of the South, if even at the price of blood she resisted this
        unholy usurpation? Besides, if these measures
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green131"> Page 131</a>
      <p>
        should afterwards prove to have been unwise, and likely to interfere
        with any ulterior policy, which the chapter of accidents might develope,
        or political expediency recommend, he had always the
        <i>rail-splitter</i> for a scapegoat, as he of course was only acting by
        poor Lincoln's orders, who, by the way, was still under the tutelage of
        this man of varied parts, learning the polite usages of society.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last vestige of
        civil and constitutional rights had been swept away. The
        <i><em>habeas corpus</em></i> was suspended throughout the dominions of
        Abraham the First; and the opinion of the venerable Chief Justice Taney,
        that eminent jurist and pure patriot, sustaining the legal tribunals,
        was set aside, and derided as an 'old woman's story.' The Legislature of
        Maryland, in the exercise of its sovereign prerogative, was prorogued,
        and the chief members of it conveyed to a Northern bastile; and the
        elections which subsequently came off were carried by driving from the
        polls, at the point of the bayonet, the legal voters, and substituting
        in their stead the hireling soldiers who infested every portion of the
        State: thus carrying out to the letter Senator Wilson's boast,<i>
          'We have set the iron heel on Maryland, and will crush out her
          boundary lines.'</i

      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Baltimore
        especially suffered in this

      <a name="green132"> Page 132</a>
      <p>
        onslaught against the laws of God and man. Her citizens were subject to
        the vilest indignities, the most prominent of whom were sent to some one
        of the strongholds of the tyrant, to be held, in many instances, as
        hostages for the good behaviour of their friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In despite of all this,
        with the city under the Federal guns, and the threat of being razed to
        the ground fulminated against her, and troops stationed throughout every
        portion of her - Baltimore has vindicated her claim to be called the
        unterrified, and, regardless alike of bribes or threats, her people have
        remained true to their instincts of honour and fealty to the South, and
        at peril of life, and liberty, and property, have ever extended their
        bountiful hand to shelter and assist their brethren in their hour of
        need. May Heaven cast its protecting shield over the noble generous city
        of Baltimore, and may she ere long be welcomed as one of the proudest
        gems of the Confederacy!
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own lot was now
        dismal enough. I felt almost as one who had passed the confines of
        eternity, and was looking on from another sphere upon the phantasmagoria
        in this. I seemed to hold no visible connection with the world. My
        friends and relatives were denied access to me, unless they
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green133"> Page 133</a>
      <p>
        belonged to the Black Republican ranks; and these were too prudent to
        risk their popularity by often availing themselves of the privilege, and
        only then under the pressure of that public opinion, which delighteth to
        decry their neighbours, for acting precisely as they would have done
        under similar circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every means was employed
        which petty malice could devise to annoy me. It had been argued at first
        that, accustomed as I had been to a great deal of society and a very
        active life, to immure me in solitary imprisonment, without air or
        exercise, would soon reduce even my rebellious nature to 'submission.'
        But, failing in this calculation, they now sought eternally some
        invasion of the few privileges left. For instance, in going from my
        chamber to the library, I would be often turned back until the officer
        in charge could go to the Provost- Marshal's, and my poor little girl
        was circumscribed to a few feet in front of the house, with an extra
        guard detached to watch her; and although I paid for my own laundry, it
        was often two or three weeks before I could send out my clothes. I was
        also obliged to buy my own lights, as the Government refused to allow me
        any.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Sheldon had
        been ordered under arrest,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green134"> Page 134</a>
      <p>
        upon the charge of taking out communications for me, but was released by
        order of Seward.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My poor friend, Miss
        Mackall, with whom I kept up uninterrupted communication, in spite of
        all the vigilance, was untiring in her efforts to see me. In turn she
        implored every member of the Cabinet, and finally went to Lincoln, whose
        reception of her was characteristic of the man. He told her
        <i
          >'that she had had too much of my teachings already - that I had done
          more to damage, and bring his Government into disrepute, than all the
          rest of the darned rebels together; and by G-d she should never see me
          again, if he could help it.' </i
        >This was fatally prophetic. I, however, sent him word that whilst he
        was engaged in the undignified task of reviling a prisoner, and that
        prisoner a woman, I was far more philanthropically occupied in making a
        new disguise for him to quit Washington in.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dear girl was,
        however, almost heartbroken, for she loved me well, and made a last
        appeal to Provost-Marshal Andrew J. Porter, who, improving upon his
        master's brutality, indulged in a philippic against me, and concluded by
        rudely saying
        <i>'that he wondered why he had not already arrested her.'</i> She left
        him in tears, sobbed bitterly the way home, retired to her bed, from
        which she never after rose.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily wrote me that same
        evening a full account of the above, which reached me through my
        <i>medium unsuspected.</i> She grew rapidly worse, and in little more
        than a week from the above period she was dying. Throughout her illness
        she prayed to see me, and, a few hours before the fatal event, was so
        earnest in her prayer - saying, that
        <i>'she could not die happily unless she was gratified'</i> - that,
        although late at night, her mother sent to the Provost-Marshal. His
        reply was that he had not the authority to grant the permission, and
        that it rested with the Secretary of State, Seward. Thereupon I wrote to
        Seward, asking the privilege of visiting my dying friend, subject to any
        restriction he might impose. His reply was forwarded to the Provost-
        Marshal, a copy of which was sent me:--
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so my darling
        faithful friend was laid in her

      <p>
        grave, and the cold earth shut out her beautiful loving face for ever
        from my eyes. I could not then weep; but I prayed that the God of
        Justice would, in his hour of need, deny the heartless
        <i>'charlatan'</i> that mercy which he, dressed in his 'brief
        authority,' had denied to me.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Averil's
        congenial services in the Police Department were at last rewarded by
        promotion, which transferred him to a new field of action, and he was
        succeeded by Captain M'Millen, whose gentlemanly conduct afforded a
        striking contrast. On assuming his position he wrote me a most
        respectful and kind letter, offering any service not inconsistent with
        his duty as an officer of the United States; and, although his acts were
        always guided by the most fastidious loyalty to his own Government, he
        was ever delicate and deferential in the performance of his disagreeable
        duty. He was severely reprimanded on more than one occasion for being
        too lenient - in other words, too gentlemanly - and finally my letters,
        received or written, which had been submitted to him for examination,
        were transferred to the detective Dennis, who, in order to seem vigilant
        in proportion to his former stolidity, returned me the simplest note, as
        being offensive to the <i><em>canaille</em></i> of the Provost-Marshal's
        Office.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was about this time,
        the last of November, quite ill, from the close confinement and
        insufficiency of food. Dr. M'Millen, a brother of Captain M'Millen, was
        allowed to attend me, and he ordered that more palatable and nutritious
        food should be supplied me, which was done for a few days; but on
        discovering that it was furnished at the cost of Lieutenant Sheldon, I
        refused to receive it, and got on as well as I could upon crackers and
        cheese, which my faithful maid would contrive to procure for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall ever retain the
        most grateful recollection of Dr. M'Millen's gentle humane kindness, as
        well as that of his brother Captain M'Millen. The conduct of these two
        formed a striking contrast to the bestial natures by whom I had been
        surrounded, and who had control of my liberty and life.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. M'Millen was never
        but once after this allowed to visit me, and then in the presence of an
        officer, and his conversation strictly limited to his medical enquiry
        and prescription. An idiosyncrasy common to the Abolition dynasty was,
        that I exercised some spell over all who approached me, whose natures
        were not brutalised.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peculations of Simon
        Cameron, the Secretary of War, had now assumed such colossal dimensions,
        and the onslaught against him by those who had not

        been so favoured by opportunity were so bitter, that the Government at
        Washington were seriously embarrassed. They had been, of course, aware
        of all this for months. Hence it was not peculation, but the
        inconvenience of the discovery and consequent publicity, which now
        disturbed Mr. Lincoln and his Ministry; and a reasonable doubt may here
        be expressed as to whether the whole Government were not committed to
        practices equally nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Seward had in the
        beginning, upon the formation of the Cabinet, made the appointment of
        Cameron a <i><em>sine quâ non;</em></i> so he still sustained him with
        great warmth. Cameron, although an uneducated man, of mediocrity of
        intellect, was gifted with wonderful accumulative faculties; but, unlike
        most men who are endowed with this peculiar talent, he dispensed his
        money with a princely hand for the attainment of his ends, and there is
        no doubt but that the astute Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, had often
        experienced the benefit of the financiering talent of his friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the charges made
        and substantiated against Cameron was, that he had drawn pay and rations
        and equipment for 86,000 men more than had ever been mustered into the
        service, and that in every contract made by the War Department, whether
        for
      </p>

        purchase of munitions of war or clothing for the soldiers, his profits
        had been upon a like gigantic scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameron's friends had
        claimed for him, in the original cast of the Cabinet, to be made
        Secretary of the Treasury, as affording the widest scope for the
        expansion of his genius. But the north-eastern wing of the
        Abolitionists, headed by Sumner and Wilson, opposed this with great
        vehemence, indulging in animadversions not very flattering, and brought
        forward Chase in opposition, when a very animated contest began between
        the partisans of each, the conclusion of which it was difficult to
        foresee.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an unexpected
        quarter of the House, however, a pacificator arose to 'pour oil upon the
        troubled waters' of Abolitiondom. Mr. Wigfall, of Texas, a United States
        senator, in his place said, addressing himself to Mr. Cameron - who was
        also a senator - 'Hearken unto the counsels of thine enemy. It is said
        that you are about to assume the portfolio of the Treasury Department.
        It is a mistake. With war comes the necessity for large supplies and big
        contracts. I would advise you to take the War Department, as best suited
        to you,' and fortified his advice by erudite and apt quotations.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Mr. Cameron was
        influenced by this
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green140"> Page 140</a>
      <p>
        well-timed advice I know not; but it is a remarkable coincidence that
        his claims to the first position were soon after withdrawn, and he
        subsided quietly into the War Department.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Congressional
        Committee was appointed to investigate these and other malpractices
        against the National Treasury. But long before they had fairly entered
        upon their labours, Cameron had been sent as Minister Plenipotentiary to
        the Court of Russia. The Government by this act showed as reckless a
        disregard for international courtesy, as for its own national dignity,
        and manifested, more clearly than volumes could have done, the character
        it was henceforward to maintain amongst the nations of the earth. For
        here was a man - driven ignominiously from the councils of the nation by
        the force of public opinion, for the meanest form of corruption - sent
        as a representative of that nation, at one of the haughtiest Courts of
        Europe. The Government itself entertained doubts of his reception; and
        Cameron did not set out on his mission until they had received
        satisfactory assurances on the subject.

        CHAPTER VIII.
        <br />
        FREMONT AND OTHER THINGS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FREMONT, in his
        administration of the department of the West, appears to have followed
        closely the precedent established by the Apostolic Simon in the War
        Department. Charges of an astounding nature were sent on to Washington
        against him of malfeasance in office - in short, the old California
        charges of peculation, favouritism in the giving of contracts, and
        general reckless extravagance. He had also proved himself to be utterly
        incompetent in a military point of view; and this even his most zealous
        partisans were obliged to admit. Consequently his removal was loudly
        demanded.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <a name="green142"> Page 142</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one who has followed
        the course of this adventurous aspirant for fame, will be surprised at
        any phase of his destiny. And as he has been brought forward
        conspicuously before the eyes of the world, it may not be amiss to give
        a slight sketch of his origin and antecedents.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of the
        soldiers of fortune whose names have been emblazoned on the scroll of
        fame in the Old World, he is entitled to the <i>bar sinister</i> on his
        shield. Fremont <i>Père</i> was a French dancing-master, and taught the
        graceful art in the city of Richmond, about the year 1812 or 1814, to
        most of the belles and beaux of that period. The celebrated Miss Maria
        Mayo - afterwards Mrs. General Scott - was one of his pupils, and my
        husband, as a little boy, had the benefit of his instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This worthy son of
        <i><em>la belle France</em></i> was not content with the golden harvest
        he could legitimately reap in the exercise of his professional skill,
        but essayed his talents in another field, and soon made himself master
        of the situation, and bore off in triumph a Mrs. Pryor, the wife of an
        old and respectable citizen of Richmond, who, by the way, took a most
        philosophical view of the domestic calamity, and, instead of pursuing
        with fire and sword the enterprising Frenchman, left him in peaceful
        possession
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green143"> Page 143</a>
      <p>
        of the truant fair, and took to himself a more congenial helpmate. The
        romantic pair had winged their flight to Charleston, in which city he
        resumed the practice of his profession; and our hero, John Charles
        Fremont, was the fruit of this auspicious conjunction.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the citizens of
        Charleston took great interest in young Fremont, who was educated at
        their expense and afterwards sent to West Point, where he graduated,
        without, however, giving any indications of extraordinary capabilities,
        and was, some years afterwards, appointed as assistant to Mr. Nicholet,
        in his scientific explorations and surveys; and here even he was
        regarded more for his methodical industry than for genius. He was a good
        draftsman, and, after Mr. Nicholet's death, was employed to work out the
        result of his labours, which he did with accuracy and skill. Fremont had
        meanwhile married the daughter of the Honourable Thomas Hart Benton, who
        after a few years assumed his guardianship, and launched him on his
        career.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Benton's influence he
        was sent to explore the route across the Rocky Mountains to California,
        arriving there as the war with Mexico broke out; and there is no doubt
        that in the illegal and high-handed
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green144"> Page 144</a>
      <p>
        measures of which he was guilty, and the extraordinary assumption of
        power by him, he but acted strictly under the instruction of Benton, who
        expected himself to be sent to Mexico with vice-regal powers, as he
        happily said in the Senate, with
        <i>'the sword in one hand, and the purse in the other.'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme was exploded
        too soon for success, and the bitter denunciation of it by all parties
        in the Senate convinced the Administration that it was useless to
        propose it for their ratification. But the failure, from whatever cause,
        drew upon the administration of Mr. Polk the antagonism of Benton from
        that period.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of Benton's
        scheme operated very injuriously upon Fremont. The commander of the
        department of California, General Kearney, who was a most generous and
        high-toned officer, at first remonstrated with him upon the illegality
        of his proceedings, but, failing to produce any effect, suspended and
        sent him to Washington under arrest for trial, where he arrived more
        with the air of a hero than one charged with high crime and
        misdemeanour.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green145"> Page 145</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court convened at
        Washington for the trial of Fremont was composed of officers of the
        highest grade, General Kearney being himself president of the court.
        Since the days of Warren Hastings, perhaps no court had ever been
        invested with so much interest. It was crowded each day by high officers
        of the Government and other friends of the accused. Colonel Benton was
        allowed extraordinary latitude in the defence, and at times browbeat or
        threatened the various members composing the court, or the witnesses. In
        short, the whole power of the Administration was employed to screen the
        criminal, and even private courtesies to the members of the court by
        those connected with the Government were discouraged. I was severely
        remonstrated with by a high official, upon the occasion of receiving
        General Kearney and the other members of the court at dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the
        extraneous pressure brought to bear upon it, the court maintained a
        dignified impartiality in the exercise of its judicial functions, giving
        the accused the benefit of all that could be adduced in his favour, and
        not deterred by the array of power and influence from pronouncing
        judgment according to the proofs before them. So, after an arduous and
        exciting trial, which lasted several
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green146"> Page 146</a>
      <p>
        weeks, the court found Fremont guilty upon every specification, and
        recommended that he should be severely reprimanded, and struck from the
        rolls of the army. The evidence, which is on file in the War Department
        at Washington, was so conclusive, and the charges of so flagrant a
        character, that the sentence was obliged to be confirmed. Mr. Polk
        subsequently, however, reappointed him: but Fremont refused to accept
        the executive clemency, knowing that he would be tabooed by the army.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after he
        returned to California, and on her admission as one of the States of the
        Federal Union, he was selected by the Governor as one of the persons to
        represent her in the United States Senate. He drew the short term:
        consequently his legislative functions were only exercised for the space
        of three or four months, and so little did he impress the people, as to
        his capacity for the political arena, that although he sought, with
        great pertinacity, the renewal of the honour, he was never after able to
        achieve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fremont had managed,
        during his first military sojourn in California, to
        <i>establish a claim</i> to the celebrated Marriposa Grant; and he now
        proposed to build an <i><em>adobe</em></i> house upon a portion of it,
        and to settle himself there as a <i><em>ranchero.</em></i> It was at
        this
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green147"> Page 147</a>
      <p>
        time that I saw him in San Francisco, and spoke with him upon the
        subject. He seemed really to long for the primitive life he had marked
        out, and confessed himself utterly unsuited for the part he had been
        appointed to play upon the world's great stage - in which opinion I
        heartily concurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not long,
        however, enjoy his Arcadian Existence, Messrs. Palmer, Cook,&amp; Co.
        being the evil spirits who tempted him from his retirement to the
        turmoils of life again.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above-mentioned firm
        of Palmer, Cook,&amp; Co. were bankers of San Francisco, and the
        <i><em>bonâ fide</em></i> proprietors of the Marriposa, owning
        three-fourths of it, whilst Fremont represented one-fourth, subject to
        heavy mortgages upon it, for moneys advanced by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marriposa was
        certainly a most royal demesne, of incalculable mineral wealth; but,
        like the treasures described in Aladdin, locked in the bowels of the
        earth, until the skill of the magician was employed to draw them forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was too vast and
        costly an undertaking for individual enterprise, and it was consequently
        resolved by the parties interested to enlist European capitalists in the
        plan for working the mines, and otherwise
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green148"> Page 148</a>
      <p>
        developing its resources. Companies were formed in England to that end,
        which were to be chartered, and stocks issued, &amp;c. It was scarcely
        secondary in magnitude to the famous Mississippi scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fremont was supplied
        with ample funds, and sent to Europe as the agent of the
        <i><em>projet;</em></i> and, in order to give <i><em>éclat</em></i> to
        his mission, these speculators resolved to nominate him as the
        Republican candidate for the Presidency, having no end in view but the
        inflation of their <i>bogus</i> stock, and ultimate pecuniary advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not content with the
        political <i>prestige</i> they had given him, those able financiers
        resolved to make him also appear as the richest man in the world.
        Circumstantial statements of his daily income, of an incalculable
        amount, were published simultaneously in New York, Paris, and London.
        Rare gems, of great size and value, were said to be found in the mineral
        regions of the Marriposa - amongst them, emeralds of such remarkable
        beauty, as to throw into the shade the crown jewels of Europe. These
        were advertised as having been set for Mrs. Fremont. In short, the Monte
        Christo of Dumas' creation was not the possessor of such countless
        riches as was this agent of a wholesale swindling firm.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the
        Abolitionists resolved to accept the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green149"> Page 149</a>
      <p>
        candidate which chance had furnished them, to try the strength of their
        party, of which they had no approximate idea. Charles Francis Adams (now
        United States Minister to England) had been nominated with that object
        some years before at Chicago, but the result had demonstrated such a
        lamentable minority, that no prominent man was willing to risk his
        prospects of future success, by allowing his name to be used.
        Consequently, the whole strength of the Abolition party, by way of
        experiment, was concentrated upon Fremont; and, although the
        constitutional party triumphed in the election of their candidate, they
        were filled with dismay and grave misgivings for the future, at the
        formidable front which the<i> higher law</i> party presented, who, in
        their turn, were surprised at their own strength. And from that hour the
        Federal Government was doomed, and James Buchanan destined to be the
        last President of the United States. It was after this defeat of the
        Abolitionists, that the terrible poisoning scheme was attempted.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marriposa humbug
        exploded, and Fremont was dropped by the party who had temporarily used
        him, and suffered to relapse into poverty and obscurity, until the
        revolution again brought him upon the surface.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green150"> Page 150</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current of my story
        has been somewhat impeded by this long narrative. Fremont's removal from
        the command of the department of the West had been determined on at
        Washington. Mrs. Fremont came on herself to take counsel of F. P. Blair,
        and, if possible, delay the execution of the sentence. But the exertions
        of that clever lady produced no visible effect in her husband's favour,
        although they fired the zeal of her ancient servitor and friend, who
        redoubled his exertions, but also fruitlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blair laboured under the
        hallucination, that his own posthumous fame was indissolubly connected
        with that of Thomas Hart Benton, and that this was in some way
        mysteriously associated with the fulfillment of Benton's prophecy as to
        Fremont's future greatness. Hence he laboured to bring about its
        accomplishment, even though he encountered the antagonism of his own
        sons, who violently opposed Fremont - regardless of the injunction, that
        a house divided against itself must fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blair had also a private
        score to settle with the Southern chivalry. It had been by the influence
        of the Southern members of the democratic party, that he had been
        deprived of his position as Government organ, and consequent loss of the
        splendid pickings from the national crib. So, in order that he might
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green151"> Page 151</a>
      <p>
        wreak his vengeance upon that section, he was willing to tear down the
        walls of the temple itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Fremont was treated
        with but scant ceremony by the authorities at Washington. After many
        days of delay, she addressed a short but haughty note to President
        Lincoln, demanding an answer to her communication, in order, as she
        stated, 'that she might return to her husband and children;' and the
        reply which this elicited from President Lincoln, was as curt as her
        own. So she returned West from her bootless mission at Washington, and
        was received at St. Louis with regal honours - a carriage and four
        awaited her, in which she was escorted by a troop of cavalry, with bands
        of music and bonfires, to her husband's quarters. So said the veracious
        chroniclers of the triumphal entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the fiat had
        gone forth, and Halleck was appointed to the management of the
        department of the West, which Fremont had so lately mismanaged, having,
        however, greatly the advantage over his predecessor, in being of the
        genuine Abolition party.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edwin M. Stanton had
        been appointed to succeed Cameron in the War Department. The Abolition
        Congress was again in session, and its work of
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green152"> Page 152</a>
      <p>
        proscription renewed. General Scott held on with a tenacity only
        equalled by that of Daniel Webster during President Tyler's
        administration. But he was just now the fifth wheel to the Abolition
        wagon, and seriously clogged their movements, and they resolved to adopt
        measures for the accomplishment of his removal, which even they had
        shrunk from save in the last extremity. So charges of treason were
        trumped up, and articles of indictment actually prepared. This last
        feather broke the camel's back, and he succumbed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step
        accomplished, it was determined to indulge the old man's avarice to the
        extent of their power. The public mind was prepared for what was to
        follow by daily statements of his sinking health, which alarmingly
        increased. 'His resignation was prepared. Lincoln and his Cabinet
        attended at his lodgings to hear it read, which being received, Lincoln,
        <i>"standing,"</i> read to him the gracious act, securing to him for
        life his pay, and all the perquisites he had hitherto enjoyed.' After
        this, General Scott took a solemn leave of Lincoln, and eulogised his
        patriotism <i>as second only to Washington's.</i> That same afternoon he
        departed for New York, and gave his parting benediction to 'the young
        General, who, with his staff,
        <i>in a pelting rain, accompanied him to</i>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Secretary Seward and
        Mr. Secretary Chase - with the mockery of honour - accompanied him to
        New York. Telegrams from each stopping-point gave desponding accounts of
        the health of the illustrious exile from power and place. At last he
        reached New York,
        <i>saw only Mr. John Van Buren,</i> and embarked, after a few days, for
        France. Arriving there in due course of time, he seized upon the pretext
        of the Mexican and French <i>imbroglio,</i> and returned, in the next
        steamer but one, to New York, where he lives in elegant state upon the
        price of his honor - <i><em>sic transit. </em></i>(This account has been
        almost entirely taken from the Government organ.)
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public were for a
        little while amused with the rumour that the defunct hero was to be sent
        as special ambassador to Mexico, but that, of course, was only a

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The espionage over me
        was now greater than at any previous period. Life was almost
        unendurable; an undefined nameless terror was stealing over me of
        something more dark and terrible than I had yet been exposed to. This
        feeling may be appreciated, when it is remembered that I was a
        defenceless woman, in the hands of a party which had shrunk

        from no crime to carry out its ends. I was constantly assailed in its
        papers; and some of my former friends and connections sought, instead of
        protecting me, to palliate and excuse the cowardly attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My anxiety was not
        allayed by receiving a secret communication to be on my guard,
        <i>'as an infernal plot was hatching against me;'</i> at the same time
        enclosing extracts from Abolition papers, stating that I had
        <i
          >'lost my mind, and that it was rumoured that the Government intended
          to remove me to a private lunatic asylum.'</i
        >
        My blood freezes even now, when I recall my feelings at the reception of
        this communication, and I wonder that I had not gone mad.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My equanimity was by no
        means restored at this time by the announcement that the Surgeon-General
        of Pennsylvania Volunteers, and several others, desired to pay their
        respects to me. I received him with smiles on my lips, and fear and hate
        in my heart. (I do not remember the name, as my journal was at a later
        period taken from me.) But he was very courteous, and apologised for
        intruding upon me, by saying that
        <i
          >'he had been most desirous of seeing a lady who had become so
          celebrated in the eyes of the world.'</i
        >
        Our conversation was spirited, and upon the all-exciting topics of the
        times, in which I bore my part as an uncompromising rebel; and, although

        the frightful idea was ever present, that this man had been probably
        sent for the purpose of dooming me to a madhouse, I jested lightly,
        defiantly, with him. Finally he said to me, 'Do you never find your mind
        giving way under this close solitary confinement?' I replied, 'Do you
        see any indications of aberration of mind?' He answered, 'Madam, you
        fill me with admiration and astonishment, not only by your cheerfulness,
        but from the wonderful knowledge you have of what is going on! I had
        never believed that any person could rise so superior to surrounding
        circumstances. For I know,' he continued, 'that the Government has
        placed such an estimate upon your capacity, as to resort to measures of
        unusual harshness in your imprisonment.' 'Well,' I said, 'Doctor, I defy
        their skill to thwart any purpose of mine; and so far from succumbing, I
        never felt my mind clearer or more capable of mischief against your
        Government than at this moment.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visit, after some
        further conversation, terminated; and I know not whether I was indebted
        to this gentleman, but I heard no more of the madhouse scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer of the
        guard, Lieutenant Sheldon, was not now allowed to hold personal
        communication with me. The guard were set as spies upon each other,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green156"> Page 156</a>
      <p>
        and upon him. They were ordered not to speak to me or answer questions,
        under penalty of severe punishment. One day a guard, by name Hebburn,
        gave me some ordinary information. Miss Poole, hearing him, sent for the
        corporal of the guard, and reported it. The poor man was dealt with very
        harshly in consequence. She also reported that my little child received
        some communication for me on the pavement, which was untrue, and the
        poor child was, from that time, doomed to as severe imprisonment as I
        now endured. This was, perhaps, my hardest trial - to see my little one
        pining and fading under my eyes for want of food and air, without the
        power to avert the terrible doom which seemed impending. The health and
        spirits of my faithful maid also began to fail, and I felt often tempted
        to exclaim, 'My God, let this bitter cup pass from me!'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter had set in
        with unusual severity, and the heavens seemed in accord with the gloom
        of my own destiny. By reason of the inclemency of the weather, I was now
        deprived of my only remaining pleasure - that of receiving from
        <i>afar</i> the stealthy greeting of friends - stealthy for the reason
        that if
      </p>

      <a name="green157"> Page 157</a>

        seen to wave a hand towards my prison, arrest was sure to follow; the
        reign of terror being now at its height. No one, unless under similar
        circumstances, can realise the extent of this deprivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, some years
        ago, when I was very young, being invited to meet the celebrated Italian
        exile Gonfallonièri, who had been a victim of Austrian despotism, and
        was for many years in solitary confinement as a state prisoner. No
        knowledge from the outer world ever reached his dungeon. Empires had
        changed their destiny, and kings had fallen. The great Napoleon had
        ended his mortal career at St. Helena. Charles X. had been hurled from
        the throne of France, and Louis Philippe reigned in his stead. Of this
        he knew nothing until he reached New York, a prisoner no longer, but
        exile from friends and fatherland.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wept as I listened to
        his sad recital, and thanked God that my destiny had been cast in a land
        where crimes like this could never be committed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not then foresee
        that the scourge of Black Republican rule was to come upon us, and sweep
        from the New World every vestige of civil rights and freedom, as had
        been often done in the Old.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan, from having
        been lulled into a false security by the flatteries lavished upon him to
        that
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green158"> Page 158</a>
      <p>
        end, began now to realise all the difficulties of his position. The
        insensate cry of 'On to Richmond!' was again raised, and his judgment
        sought to be overruled as to the means by which that <i>feat</i> was to
        be accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan had laboured
        hard to make his army the best appointed, and best disciplined, in the
        world; and, considering the heterogeneous materials he had to work upon,
        he certainly had effected marvels. The programme which he had marked out
        for himself was fully in accordance with the wisdom and foresight he had
        displayed in other respects. He understood thoroughly the
        <i>morale</i> of his army, and that his only hope of success in invading
        the South was by overwhelming numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Seward and the other
        Sachems of Abolitiondom did not intend that M'Clellan should reap the
        substantial fruits which the success of his plans would have placed
        within his grasp. The object for which he had been inflated to his
        present eminence, had been fully accomplished. General Scott had as
        completely passed away from the public mind, as if his funeral dirge had
        been already sung. So these <i>'carpet warriors,'</i> who had already
        slain their thousands by the stroke of their pens, addressed themselves
        seriously to the work of checkmating
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green159"> Page 159</a>
      <p>
        M'Clellan, and would, had they dared, have removed him from his
        ill-starred eminence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan had, however,
        succeeded in gaining the Confidence, as I have said before, of a large
        party. It is true that he had done nothing, so far, to establish a claim
        to high consideration, having as yet performed no deeds of velour to
        entitle him to his <i>laurel wreath,</i> although his achievements in
        Western Virginia, in the early part of the campaign, had been absurdly
        exaggerated, as an excuse for his undue elevation. The popular voice,
        nevertheless, was in his favour, and cried loudly that he should be
        retained to carry out his programme. His soldiers were attached to him,
        and any attempt to suspend him would have been attended with hazardous
        results, until that army had been again demoralised by the hardships and
        exposure of another unsuccessful campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had M'Clellan possessed
        the moral courage at this time to have boldly stated
        <i>his ultimatum,</i> and given in his resignation in case it was not
        complied with, he would have triumphed temporarily over his adversaries,
        who were not prepared to push things to this extremity. They still
        believed Washington to be threatened by Beauregard, and, amidst the
        feasting and revelry of the Capitol, they were tremblingly
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green160"> Page 160</a>
      <p>
        alive to the idlest rumour of an advance. The fortifications were being
        hourly strengthened and extended, and large quantities of provisions and
        other stores were distributed in the basement of the Capitol, and public
        buildings, and throughout other portions of the city, in preparation for
        a siege.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public archives had
        been removed to Philadelphia in the beginning of August, a short time
        after the battle of Manassas, when the panic was at its height, thereby
        creating great fright in the city of brotherly love, as the
        <i>sealed yellow cases,</i> in which those important State papers were
        conveyed, were supposed to be the Yankee dead from the disastrous plains
        of Manassas. So not only were the imaginations of the Philadelphians
        disturbed by the fear of the grim ghosts of the unassoilzied dead, but
        pestilence also; and, in order to allay the excitement consequent
        thereupon, it became necessary to make an official announcement of the
        character of the freight contained in the <i>yellow cases.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unimportant as this
        incident may seem, it is still a part of the record of the days of
        panic.

        CHAPTER IX.
        <br />
        DIABLERIE.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if for the purpose of
        annoying me at this time, the few short and unsatisfactory letters which
        I sent I through the Provost-Marshal's Office were, upon one pretext or
        another, objected to. Upon one occasion I wrote to a friend to<i>
          'tell Cousin Lucy that I had firm reliance upon Divine Providence.' </i
        >That was returned to me, with a note stating that
        <i
          >'all names must be written in full, and no ambiguous expressions
          used.'</i
        >
        I thereupon, by way of protest, wrote to suggest that the
        Provost-Marshal should issue a printed circular, prescribing the formula
        to be used prisoners, as I was gifted with no faculty to divine what he
        might consider <i>ambiguous;</i> that the only expression which could
        possibly be<i> incomprehensible</i>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green162"> Page 162</a>
      <p>
        to him was that wherein I had expressed my reliance on<i>
          Divine Providence;</i
        >
        and that he recalled to my mind a circumstance which had occurred in a
        much more civilised land than this. The British Parliament having, some
        years ago, instituted a commission to enquire into the moral condition
        of the colliers, a learned divine, who formed part of that commission,
        reported on his return, in evidence of their state of moral ignorance,
        that on going to one of the largest collieries he asked,
        <i>'Does anyone know Jesus Christ </i>HERE?' That the question
        reverberated through the pit, and the answer came thundering back -
        <i>'No; we do n't know him. He do n't work here.'</i> A similar response
        would probably be elicited from the Provost-Marshal's Office, as to a
        question of <i>'Divine Providence.'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An order was also issued
        from the State Department, prohibiting me the purchase of the
        newspapers, or my being informed of their contents. This was in
        consequence of the publication of my letter to Mr. Seward. The utmost
        consternation prevailed as to the means by which it had reached
        Richmond, as it was not intended that the secrets of the prison-house
        should be blazoned to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'New York Herald'
        published my letter, with the following editorial critique :---

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'MRS. GREENHOW'S
        INDIGNANT LETTER TO MR. SEWARD. - We are indebted to the Richmond "Whig"
        for the pungent letter which we publish to-day of Mrs. Rose Greenhow to
        Mr. Seward, touching her late imprisonment in her own house in
        Washington, as a Secession emissary. Having been released and sent over
        into Secessia, she doubtless furnished a copy of the letter in question
        to the journal from which it is extracted. It is just such a philippic
        as one would expect, under the circumstances, from a spirited, dashing,
        active, and fearless female politician of the South Carolina school of
        Secession malignants. She complains bitterly of the rude and offensive
        behaviour of her gaolers; but she forgets that men thus employed I are
        very seldom remarkable for the refinements and accomplishments, graces
        and gallantry of the fashionable circles of Washington. She discourses
        fluently but flippantly upon the freedom of speech, and upon her right
        to exercise it, and upon the cruel tyranny of her imprisonment; but she
        forgets that while at large in Washington she was a dangerous agent of a
        hostile army besieging our national capital. Grant all the personal
        rights of freedom of speech and action which Mrs. Greenhow demands, in
        the midst

      <a name="green164"> Page 164</a>
      <p>
        of this great rebellion, and we may as well abolish our armies, and turn
        over the country to unrestrained ruffianism; for under this system of
        liberty we should all be at the mercy of ruffians and robbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In those gay Secession
        circles which ruled the Court and Cabinet at our Federal city under the
        diluted rose-water administration of Mr. Buchanan, Mrs. Greenhow was a
        bright and shining light. She had no doubt shared with that brilliant
        and charming coterie, of which Mrs. Slidell and Mrs. Gwin were the
        ruling spirits, that splendid Secession idea of the easy occupation of
        Washington by Jeff. Davis, his camp, Cabinet, Congress, and Government,
        and that under this new
        <i><em>régime</em></i> the fascinating coterie aforesaid, including Mrs.
        Greenhow, would be exalted to a higher and an indefinite reign of beauty
        and glory. Mr. Seward, however, interposed like an evil magician, and
        with a wave of his powerful wand destroyed all these beautiful castles
        in the cloud. And so we can excuse this piquant and pungent letter of
        Mrs. Greenhow. Even the great Napoleon, philosopher as he was, when
        cooped up at St. Helena could not refrain from scolding.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 20th December,
        the Judge-Advocate, Colonel Key, came to call upon me. I had seen him
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green165"> Page 165</a>
      <p>
        several times before. There was a certain<i><em> laissez-aller</em></i>
        about this officer very offensive to me. He was, or affected to be, very
        deaf, as an excuse for approaching very near in conversation. The second
        time I saw him, he attempted to take my hand, as he said,<i>
          'to find out whether I had ever done any work.'</i
        >
        I withdrew it, saying that my head had laboured more than my hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this occasion,
        however, his manner was respectful and earnest. He expressed anxiety to
        serve me; said that he had thought my imprisonment
        <i>impolitic;</i> that he was opposed to the policy of imprisoning
        women; and that, although he came now without being officially empowered
        to speak with me on the subject of my release, he was free to tell me
        that he had held conversations with some of the heads of the Government
        on the subject, and that they were greatly embarrassed to know what to
        do with me. I answered, 'Oh, yes. They dare not hang me; are afraid to
        release me; and would like to encourage me to escape, in order that they
        might catch me and spirit me away' - having in mind the effort made a
        short time previous to induce me to attempt to escape. He smilingly
        continued: 'The Government have come to the conclusion that it is of no
        use to attempt to make terms with you; that
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green166"> Page 166</a>
      <p>
        between you and them it is,
        <i
          >Do your worst to the end of the war; and the only way left is to
          treat you as the British Government did Smith O'Brien - banish
          you.'</i
        >
        He then said quickly, 'What terms would you be willing to subscribe?' My
        heart beat wildly, for even that chance gleam of freedom agitated me. I,
        however, crushed down the impulse - for I saw that he was watching me
        very narrowly - and answered, 'None, sir. I demand my unconditional
        release, indemnity for my losses, and restoration of my papers and
        effects.' He said, 'These last I cannot undertake, for I know that your
        papers will not be given up; and all the effects of rebels will be
        confiscated. I may not,' he continued, 'be able to accomplish anything
        in regard to your personal freedom, as there is a very strong influence
        against you. But I thins you had better let me make the best terms I
        can.' I replied, 'Freedom is sweet; and, although I have suffered much,
        there are many things dearer to me, and I will not compromise a
        principle even though I am detained as a prisoner for the war - the
        sentence, I learn, already pronounced against me.' He inclined his head,
        and then spoke of still greater hardships to which I might be exposed,
        and professed himself greatly interested in my situation. I told him
        that I would require time to think over all he had said, and
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green167"> Page 167</a>
      <p>
        that I was at the present wholly unprepared to terminate a conference
        upon the subject, and that I would desire him to call again. He
        requested me to write to him through the Provost-Marshal's Office, as he
        could not venture to call otherwise, as it would subject him to the
        suspicion of Southern sympathies. This will serve as another
        illustration of that iron despotism which forbade even the exercise of
        ordinary humanity. This man was a native of Maryland, and paid the
        penalty of treason to his State by the suspicious vigilance of his new
        masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Christmas-day Mrs.
        Douglas sent, through the Provost-Marshal's Office, a large cake and
        other little tokens to my little girl, which made her very happy and
        bright. Lieutenant Sheldon also, by a stretch of authority, allowed her
        to go out and join in the festivities of the day at the houses of
        several of her young friends. Other tokens of respect and affection
        reached me through less <i>orthodox</i> channels; and so, if the day was
        not a happy one, it was at least marked by no disagreeable incident - as
        if to contrast it with the dark ones immediately to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 26th, I received
        a note by <i>my little bird,</i>
        warning me that an attempt would be made to remove me to a Northern
        prison - that a telegram had been sent to Fort Warren, to hold in
        readiness a
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green168"> Page 168</a>
      <p>
        room for me there. At the same time I was assured that I should be
        rescued in case this was done - that my friends only awaited my orders -
        that my prison was watched by them day and night, and signals agreed
        upon, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My house, which had been
        transformed into a Government prison, now became a sort of Mecca.
        Strangers visiting Washington thronged to see the residence of so 'noted
        a rebel,' and the newspapers pandered to the greedy curiosity to know
        something of my habits and tastes. The apartments of the unfortunate
        Marie Antoinette were not more thoroughly scrutinised, or her
        occupations for the weary hours given with more minute details, than
        were mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house was called
        Fort Greenhow. Photographs of it appeared in several of their
        illustrated papers, and their mimic 'Punch,' 'Vanity Fair,' devoted a
        number to me, wherein, with very heavy wit, it proved that I, a simple
        woman, had outwitted Seward, and discomposed the whole Yankee nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coarse abuse was
        ofttimes levelled against me, which they took care should reach my ear.
        These cowardly vituperations passed harmlessly by, as I had a proud
        consciousness of superiority, and regarded
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green169"> Page 169</a>
      <p>
        them as testimonials in favour of my devotion to the cause of my
        country's freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other prisoners were
        from time to time brought in, and generally of the lowest class, with
        the exception of Mrs. Eleanor Lowe, an English lady, whose son was in
        the Confederate Service, and the Posey family of Maryland, who were most
        estimable people. These were, however, only detained for a few days,
        upon suspicion of giving signals to the Confederate army across the
        Potomac.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 30th of December,
        a woman named Baxley was confined as a prisoner. She was arrested on the
        Truce boat, by reason of her garrulous boasting of having gone to
        Richmond to obtain a commission for her lover, one Dr. Septimus Brown,
        of having nuts from President Davis's table, and of instructions to open
        communication with my prison; being also, as she said, the bearer of a
        letter to me. All this, I need scarcely say, was the result of a
        disordered imagination, although it afforded a pretext for what was to
        follow. The conduct of this woman on arriving at the prison confirmed
        the impression entertained at the time of her arrest, of her being
        <i><em>non compos mentis.</em></i> She raved from early morn till late
        at night, in language more vehement than delicate. I was an involuntary
        listener to her cries and imprecations,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green170"> Page 170</a>
      <p>
        and pity and disgust were often strangely commingled. My chief care was
        to prevent my child from hearing much that was unfit for her ear. But I
        felt the horrors of my position hourly increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasional excitement
        was now produced in the prison by the real or affected faints of Miss
        Poole and this Mrs. Baxley - the premonitory symptoms being a loud cry,
        and heavy fall upon the floor of one or other, followed by the call of
        the sentinel on duty, of 'Corporal of the guard, No. 3!' This individual
        usually rushed to the rescue, accompanied by two or three of the
        stoutest sentinels, bayonet in hand - the officer of the guard bringing
        up the rear, with the judicial gravity of Sancho Panza, conspicuously
        flourishing a brandy bottle, that being the masculine panacea for all
        the ills of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 29th, I wrote
        again to the Honourable Wm. H. Seward, thinking that he had had time
        sufficient to digest the contents of my first letter, which, in
        consequence of its publication in the 'New York Herald,' and other
        papers, formed the subject of conversation in all circles in Washington.
        Friend and foe united in ascribing to it a degree of literary merit to
        which it had no claim. I was amused at the various criticisms passed
        upon it by
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green171"> Page 171</a>
      <p>
        the <i>refined ladies</i> of President Lincoln's Court. They were
        horrified that I should have spoken so plainly of the infamies to which
        I had been exposed, although their sensibilities were not shocked at the
        fact that, in a Christian age, a lady should have suffered these
        outrages - only that she should proclaim them. This is but a fair sample
        of the morality of the 'New Régime.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the
        5th of January, as I attempted to pass from my chamber to my library, I
        was startled, but not surprised, at finding a double guard stationed at
        my door, with instructions not to allow me to quit my chamber until
        Lieutenant Sheldon had returned from the Provost-Marshal's. Since the
        evening of the 26th, I had seen indications of some new tactics. The
        detective police had been in constant attendance for four or five days.
        Consequently I was prepared for any extraordinary display of their
        inventive genius.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Poole had been
        allowed unlimited range of the house at all hours of the day or night.
        This concession was purchased by surveillance over me. My child had been
        closely confined upon her representations, as was also my maid, and the
        attempt of several of the guard to communicate information to me had
        been likewise reported. All knowledge of
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green172"> Page 172</a>
      <p>
        the outer world which now reached me was in writing. Her room adjoining
        mine made it impossible for me to speak to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers reached
        me sometimes, in spite of the rigid prohibition. I, however, was obliged
        to destroy them as soon as read, for fear of their discovery bringing
        harm to those who furnished them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Government organ,'
        which I received at this time, contained an article headed 'Daring
        attempt to rescue the dangerous rebel, Mrs. Greenhow.' It went on to say
        that, on the 27th, a cake had been brought to my house by a suspected
        party; that on examining it, a large number of Treasury notes were found
        concealed in it, together with a note describing a plot for my escape
        and conveyance into Virginia, the money sent being to bribe the guards;
        that so dangerous a person as I was should be conveyed to a place of
        greater security, and that the Government had determined to remove me to
        some one of the Northern bastiles, out of reach of my sympathising
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was so absurd that,
        in spite of the danger it foreshadowed, I could not help being amused by
        it. I could now understand why double guards had been stationed all
        around the house, an additional force having been detailed for the
        purpose,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green173"> Page 173</a>
      <p>
        and for several nights they had been under arms, with double cartridges
        served out to them. It was, of course, all for the purpose of giving
        plausibility to the cake story, and justification for the acts of
        villany in contemplation. I had defied and exposed their infamous secret
        police system, every member of which hated me, and they now resorted to
        this clumsy device as a means of gratifying their malignant spite, as
        well as to inspire me with a wholesome dread for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to
        estimate properly the extent of the power and influence wielded by this
        corrupt organisation. It had so acted upon the nervous fears of Lincoln,
        Seward, M'Clellan,&amp; Co., by the discovery of murderous plots which
        existed by virtue of their inventive genius only, as to acquire complete
        ascendancy over them. A detective guard was appointed for the protection
        of each. The Chief of Police took precedence of everyone in obtaining
        audience, and had access to the representatives of the Government at any
        hour of the day or night. And there was no officer of the Government too
        high to dread their influence. General Stone, of the old United States
        army, owed his arrest and disgrace to these creatures. In fact, they now
        were the power behind the throne, and their very names inspired
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green174"> Page 174</a>
      <p>
        terror, and were whispered with livid lips by the trembling victims
        within reach of their power.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of my own
        voice now appeared strange to me, and I often read aloud, that I might
        not lose the power of modulating its tones.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt that a crisis in
        my destiny was rapidly approaching. On the evening of the 4th an order
        was given that the prisoners should not leave their quarters after six
        o'clock. This had clearly no reference to me, as I never went beyond my
        own apartments; but it confined Miss Poole to hers, whereupon she had
        one of those remarkable fainting fits which I have described before.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer of the guard
        now returned from the Provost-Marshal's, and the corporal came to
        announce to me that the prohibition had been removed, and I was at
        liberty to go to my library. I breakfasted with my child, and seated
        myself at my usual occupation for this hour - that of giving her
        lessons. By this time I learned that a guard had been stationed inside
        of Miss Poole's room. I was very much shocked, for I could not imagine
        what the unfortunate woman had been doing to have brought this severity
        upon herself. I attempted to enter my chamber, and was told that I could
        not go into it. Hearing the sound of men's voices within, I readily
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green175"> Page 175</a>
      <p>
        comprehended that Mr. Seward's secret police were at work, in order to
        obtain the copy of the second letter I had written to him a few days
        before. But, as in the first instance, my copy had gone out
        simultaneously with the original, which was held back until that object
        had been accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I returned to the
        library, and destroyed all the papers which I feared to fall into their
        hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In about two hours the
        officer of the guard came to the library, looking as pale as marble,
        followed by the corporal and two of the guard, all armed - the officer
        having on his belt and sword, and the others with musket and bayonet.
        Looming in the distance were the shadows of those evil spirits, the
        detective Allen or Pinkerton, with several of his satellites. The
        officer of the guard touched his hat and said, 'Mrs. Greenhow, will you
        please walk downstairs?' I arose, and, after glancing around without
        speaking, obeyed. I believed that the detectives thought that I would
        resist, and therefore came prepared with brute force to execute their
        will, and I was resolved to give them no advantage over me by losing my
        temper. But none can tell the effort it cost me to control myself. The
        most brutal of the guard had been selected for this morning's work. I
        was detained about an hour out of my apartments, when I
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green176"> Page 176</a>
      <p>
        was notified that I could return to them. I was fully prepared for what
        was to follow. The north window of the library had been sealed and
        nailed up, and my journal and every scrap of paper had been taken from
        my writing-desk and table; and, upon examining my wardrobe, I found that
        several valuable articles of clothing had been abstracted. Whether this
        had been done by the detectives or the guard, I am not prepared to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of the
        6th I sent to the officer of the guard to demand pen, ink, and paper;
        also that I might be allowed to purchase the newspaper. He returned for
        answer that General Porter had ordered that I should not be allowed to
        have either. I sent a second time, to say that I wished to write to the
        Judge-Advocate, Colonel Key. Thereupon he sent me a single sheet of
        paper, and pen and ink. I wrote that same day to Colonel Key, stating
        that I was now prepared to hear what he had to say to me further upon
        the subject of my release. With a courtesy very remarkable for an
        <i><em>employé</em></i> of the Abolition Government, he came immediately
        on the receipt of my note, but appeared embarrassed and ill at ease. He
        told me that circumstances had occurred since I last saw him which made
        him fear that he had lost all power to serve me. He asked
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green177"> Page 177</a>
      <p>
        me what proposition I had to make. I replied that in my last interview I
        had defined my position, and stated my
        <i>ultimatum.</i> He said it had been spoken of to send me North, but
        that it had been objected to on the ground that I might institute legal
        proceedings against the Government, which would give them some trouble.
        I replied, 'Which I should most unquestionably do.' He said,
        unfortunately the publication of my letter to Seward, and another
        couched in terms of still greater bitterness, had aroused great
        indignation against me, and he questioned whether the subject of my
        release would be now entertained. I replied that I did not question his
        sincerity, as he had given me a strong reason - in the fact that he was
        going with M'Clellan into Virginia - in support of it; but I very much
        doubted whether the parties who had authorised him to speak on the
        subject with me had been honest originally in their intentions, but had
        rather designed through that means to obtain some indications from me. I
        then related the late domiciliary visit to which I had been subjected.
        Upon this he made no comment, but alluded enigmatically to the power
        arrayed against me, and left me, saying that he would return in a short
        time, after consultation with parties whom he would not name. He did
        return
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green178"> Page 178</a>
      <p>
        in about two hours, and gave me the very consolatory information that,
        on account of the
        <i
          >'dangerous extent of the knowledge I possessed,' it was deemed
          inexpedient to release me.</i
        >
        He refused to tell me whose influence had been exerted against me; but I
        already knew that it was Seward and M'Clellan, 'instigated by the
        detective Allen.'

        CHAPTER X.
        <br />
        RECORD OF FACTS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM the rough notes in
        my possession, I am enabled to supply a copy of my letter to Seward of
        December 27th. By a fatality which it would not be safe to explain, the
        copy which I sent out never reached the hands for which it was
        designed:---
      </p>
      <p>
        <div3 type="subsection"
          >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was
          written prior to the surrender of our commissioners, Mason and
          Slidell, and I cannot be supposed to have been very solicitous that
          Mr. Seward should uphold the dignity of Yankeedom. Neither did I
          expect that he would; for I knew that his cowardice would shrink from
          assuming the responsibility of the acts of his agent, Wilkes, at the
          same time that his casuistry and cunning would afford a plausible mask
          for the real feelings which guided his decision.</div3
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contempt and defiance
        alone actuated me. I had known Seward intimately, and he had frequently
        enjoyed the hospitalities of my table, and at a time
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green190"> Page 190</a>
      <p>
        when few had the moral courage to countenance him. Upon his return from
        Europe, shortly after the miserable fanatic John Brown had paid the
        penalty of his crime, Mr. Seward was dining at my house with a large
        party, amongst whom were Mr. and Mrs. Charles Francis Adams. An
        unfortunate allusion was made to some circumstances connected with the
        affair at Harper's Ferry, when Mrs. Adams launched out into a panegyric
        on John Brown - calling him that <i>'holy saint and martyr,'</i> turning
        her glance full upon me at the time - to which I replied, in a clear and
        audible voice - for it may be supposed that this conversation silenced
        all other - 'I have no sympathy for John Brown: he was a traitor, and
        met a traitor's doom;' and, turning to Seward, I remarked, 'I think you
        evinced very good taste in repudiating all connection with John Brown in
        your speech a few days since in the Senate.' In reply, he said - 'I
        remember to have met him once, and but once only. He called on me about
        some matter of business, the nature of which I don't now recollect. He
        struck me as a wild and visionary man, erratic in his ways, and
        singularly striking in his appearance. But, at the same time, in our
        brief interview, he impressed me with the conviction that he was a bold,
        truthful, and honest man, but eccentric
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green191"> Page 191</a>
      <p>
        to a degree bordering on an unsettled state of mind. I was at this time
        busy with my preparations for going to Europe, and necessarily crowded
        with affairs, and the interview entirely passed from my mind until this
        unfortunate occurrence, in which I have been sought to be implicated,
        and which clearly proves the correctness of my original suspicion as to
        the unsettled state of his mind.' Colonel George Magruder remarked that
        his conduct at Harper's Ferry had not sustained Mr. Seward's impression
        of his character, as it proved that he was not free from fear, from the
        vice of lying, and of robbery, and of theft. Seward replied, in an
        indifferent tone, 'I knew nothing about him - only saw him once for a
        few moments - and the impression was very much weakened by the new
        scenes through which I have since passed.' The conversation at this
        point diverged, and Seward aided me with great skill in directing it
        into a new channel. Mr. Adams, who was sitting on the other side of me,
        remained perfectly silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have shrunk
        from the most distant allusion to these incidents, had they not become
        matters of public notoriety. President Buchanan spoke to me on the
        subject, to which I replied, 'Do you keep spies in my household?' I was
        very much vexed, for I had hoped that the social gatherings
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green192"> Page 192</a>
      <p>
        of so humble an individual as myself would have escaped observation. He
        said, 'How you talk! I have heard it spoken of by five or six persons,
        who all greatly commended your spirit and independence. And you have my
        most hearty approval.' Honourable Henry D. Wilson, of Massachusetts,
        told me also that the Black Republicans blamed Mrs. Adams very much, and
        thought the demonstration on her part <i>'very ill-timed.'</i> A few
        days after I encountered Mr. Seward, and he approached me, saying, 'I
        have just been writing to our friend Lady N---, and have told her that
        in all Washington you were the only person who had the independence to
        give a mixed dinner party' (alluding to the strong social lines of
        division which were then drawn between the Southern and Northern
        parties). I replied, 'And you may also add, that I am so well satisfied
        with the result of that experiment that I shall not try it again.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, had he fathomed
        my real object, he would not have been so grateful to me for the social
        countenance. At this early day I saw foreshadowed what was to follow,
        and I desired to obtain a thorough insight into the plans and schemes of
        those who were destined to become the prominent actors in the fearful
        drama, in order that I might turn it to
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green193"> Page 193</a>
      <p>
        the advantage of my country when the hour for action arrived. To this
        end I employed every capacity with which God has endowed me, and the
        result was far more successful than my hopes could have flattered me to
        expect. I had verbatim reports of every caucus, of every Cabinet
        Council, beginning with the hasty conclave convened on the morning of
        Lincoln's unexpected arrival in masquerade at Willard's Hotel; with
        piquant additions of private anecdotes of the distinguished pair, in
        which Mrs. Lincoln was described as boxing the ears of a buxom
        chamber-maid who inclined too amiably to receive the salute of her
        illustrious spouse.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seward, at this time,
        verily believed in the fulfilment of his own predictions, that all
        things would be restored to quiet in thirty days. Like the ostrich,
        which buries its head in the sand at the approach of danger, he had
        wrapped himself in his self-sufficient pride, which, aided by
        <i>his increased convivial habits,</i>
        made him see all things through the mirage of his own mind. His
        coadjutors entertained the same belief, although based upon different
        grounds. With the vast power of the Federal Government in their hands,
        and with no constitutional scruples as to its use, they believed that
        they had the means to corrupt so large a proportion of the prominent men

        of the South, that it only required them to use this
        <i>moral suasion</i> at will, to bring about the desired result. They
        had already employed it with such success as to make them confident of
        the future. Scott had been won to their support, through this nefarious
        influence; Crittenden and Holt had been successfully tampered with, each
        bribed by the same bait - a seat on the Supreme Bench - which was never
        designed to be given to either. Charles Sumner actually recorded his
        vote in caucus in favour of Crittenden. Crittenden told me that he
        expected to receive the appointment. I asked a member of that caucus,
        Wilson, 'Will they give it to him?' <i>'I rather think not,'</i> was the
        reply;
        <i>'but we will hold out the bait to them until they can't retreat.' </i
        >The recreant renegade Stanley, of North Carolina, who had some years
        before been defeated as the Abolition candidate for Governor of
        California, was bought to betray his native State by being made
        Provisional Governor thereof. Other conspicuous instances I might cite;
        but this record belongs to the historian, whose duty it is to brand
        those traitors for all time with the mark of Cain, rather than to this
        simple record of my own sufferings and personal experience.

        TRIALS AND DANGER.
      </h3>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STANTON was now in the
        full exercise of his prerogatives as Secretary of War. He had been
        introduced into the Abolition Cabinet solely to bring about the
        deposition of M'Clellan, whose elevation in the first instance had been
        for a similar end. It was supposed that Stanton, in his character of
        <i><em>quasi</em></i> democrat - based upon the fact that, as a<i
          ><em> dernier ressort,</em></i
        >
        he had been selected in the last days of Mr. Buchanan's Admininistration
        to fill a vacancy - would draw around him the Conservative party, which
        had hitherto constituted M'Clellan's strength. These political jugglers
        were not aware of the facts that Stanton had
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green196"> Page 196</a>
      <p>
        never enjoyed the confidence of any party; that he was viewed as an
        astute cunning lawyer, rather than a profound one; and that he had only
        received the appointment in Mr. Buchanan's Cabinet, after repeated
        failures to induce Southern men to take the position; and his
        appointment was regarded as an evidence of the weakness and unpopularity
        of the Administration, and entire loss of the confidence of the Southern
        party.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must take occasion
        here to disclaim all intention of casting an imputation upon Mr.
        Buchanan personally, for whose ability and high moral worth I have the
        most profound appreciation. He was full of honours as of years, and
        unfit to grapple with the terrible events which crowded upon the closing
        period of his Administration. He had grown old in the service of his
        country, and cherished a holy reverence for its institutions, and would,
        I believe, have sacrificed his own life to have averted the doom of
        disruption, and sought, at least by a negative policy, to stay its
        progress. By a fatality of birth, he was thrown on the wrong side when
        the sectional division came. But he nevertheless carries with him to the
        retirement of Wheatland - where I have spent many happy days - the
        affectionate remembrances of many of his old friends.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanton, however, had
        full confidence in his own ability to bring about these desirable
        results, and in his turn received the laudations of the venal hireling
        Northern press - which now invariably concluded its panegyrics by
        styling him the <i>'Great Secretary,'</i> endowing him for the time with
        all the attributes of Queen Elizabeth's celebrated Prime Minister
        Burleigh, who had for nearly three centuries enjoyed the title of the
        <i>'Great Secretary,'</i> until Mr. Attorney Stanton came to dispute it
        with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bennett, of the 'New
        York Herald,' being more honest or more astute than his contemporaries,
        was more stinted in his praise, and sometimes gave a caustic analysis of
        the ordinances of this new god of the Abolitionists.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the first of
        those ordinances which emanated from the pen of the
        <i>'Great Secretary'</i> was the one commanding all officers and
        departments to report to the President as the Commander-in-Chief of the
        Army and Navy, the responsibilities of which position, according to this
        royal <i>firman,</i> he had determined to assume; another assigning
        M'Clellan to the army of the Potomac, thereby deposing him from the
        position of Commander-in-Chief, which he had enjoyed since he had aided
        so materially in consigning General Scott to the shades of private
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green198"> Page 198</a>
      <p>
        life, and ordering him very significantly to expedite his preparations
        for the 'On to Richmond.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been
        supposed that M'Clellan - young, ambitious, and with an army to back his
        pretensions - would, if he had not absolutely rebelled against this
        summary ejectment, have at least shown himself restive in submitting to
        the fiat of the Pennsylvania lawyer, whose skill had hitherto been
        displayed in the ingenious use of legal technicalities of doubtful
        equity, and in making 'the worse appear the better cause,' according to
        the size of the retaining fee. But in verity our young Napoleon showed
        himself imbued with a most Christian spirit; for when smitten on one
        cheek he meekly turned the other - thereby rebuking the expectation of
        friend and foe - and set himself to the performance of the duty assigned
        him, hoping, like Mr. Micawber, 'that something would turn up.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Stanton belongs the
        credit of having perfected that mendacious system of official reports,
        which emanated from the Republican War Office. It had originated under
        his predecessor, Cameron, who was, however, not scholar enough always to
        observe geographical probabilities or grammatical accuracy in the
        exercise of his inventive genius. Those which Mr. Stanton promulgated,
        were liable to no fastidious
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green199"> Page 199</a>
      <p>
        criticism of that sort; for, though equally efforts of imagination, they
        were nevertheless masterpieces as to literary merit, as well as from the
        effect they produced upon the sympathetic pulse of the New York brokers
        and bankers. And it was a very usual circumstance, after one of those
        <i>vermillion edicts</i> from the 'Great Secretary,' to see published
        simultaneously, in the same paper,<i>
          'The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Chase, goes to New York this
          evening, on financial business connected with his department.'</i
        >
        A novel but very successful means of raising the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanton was peculiarly
        fitted for the post he held as minister of a despot. Soft and
        deferential in his manners, to the point of servility when it suited
        him, he was insolent and arrogant to those whom the chapter of accidents
        placed in his power, though even this was tempered by a certain degree
        of prudence - for, like Seward, he was physically a coward. He affected
        great brevity of style, and an inquisitorial severity of manner, more
        suited to a criminal lawyer before the Old Bailey, than a Cabinet
        Minister of the nineteenth century. The public were often treated to
        descriptions of those audiences, and of the trembling victims who stood
        awe-struck before the haughty minister.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have alluded to the
        adventitious means at this

        time resorted to, for filling the depleted Abolition coffers. It would
        be an erroneous idea to suppose for a moment that those able financiers,
        the moneyed men of New England, looked upon their transactions with Mr.
        Secretary Chase from any other than a business point of view, in which
        each party was to drive the most lucrative bargain possible. They at
        least did not attempt to assume the flimsy threadbare guise of
        patriotism. That was reserved for the people who were to be victimised,
        and led to the slaughter, in order that there might be a 'united
        Northern party.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old facilities and
        avenues of trade being closed by the war, the capital of these
        Wall-Street princes was lying idle, and they sought the only chance of
        profitable investment by playing broker to the Government, and, as the
        risk was great, the returns were necessarily commensurate; and Mr.
        Secretary Chase, in effecting his financial arrangements, did so at a
        cost that none but a gambler with a nation for a stake would have
        ventured. Enormous contracts for Government supplies also were given as
        additional bonus to those Wall-street Shylocks, whose interest it became
        to ferment and keep up the war fever by every means in their power.

        contract for furnishing jeans for the army, by which he made a million
        of dollars, and presented Mrs. Lincoln with a lace shawl, which was said
        to have cost three thousand dollars. The 'New York Herald' described her
        appearance upon some occasion, with this queenly fabric around her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw Mrs. Lincoln once
        only, and paid a sixpence for the gratification of my curiosity. I was
        returning from the market-place, where I had gone to purchase some
        flowers and shrubs, one hot summer morning at an early hour, and in
        passing a small shop in the avenue saw, standing before it, the imperial
        coach, with its purple hangings and tall footmen in white gloves; so,
        yielding to the instinct of Mother Eve, I went into the shop and there
        beheld a little woman bargaining for some black cotton lace, very much
        seemingly to the disgust of the shopwoman, who left her when I entered,
        and came to me. I enquired, 'Who is that?' for naturally I was curious
        to know which member of the family royal stood before me. 'Only Madam
        Licoln.' I asked for some trifle, deposited my sixpence, and, feeling
        now that I had a legitimate right to look, made the most of the
        opportunity. She is a short, broad, fiat figure, with a broad flat face,
        with sallow mottled complexion, light grey
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green202"> Page 202</a>
      <p>
        eyes, with scant light eyelashes, and exceedingly thin pinched lips;
        self-complacency, and a slightly scornful expression, characterise her
        bearing, as if to rebuke one for passing between the 'wind and her
        nobility.' Mrs. Lincoln, however, must be very tender-hearted, as she
        has been frequently known to express great compassion for the 'poor
        slaves whom God had made free, and the wicked Southerners had made this
        war to keep them in bondage.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dress, however, was
        very grand; yet I don't think that Eugenie or Mrs. Davis would have
        selected it for that hour and occasion. The gown was composed of a rich
        silk, of light ground, with gaudy flowers embroidered over it, lying in
        voluminous folds full half a yard on the ground. Point Venise collar and
        sleeves, elaborately made up with pink ribands; white hat, adorned with
        feathers and flowers interspersed with tinsel balls; white parasol,
        lined with pink; white gloves, and a superb mantle of black lace,
        completed her costume. These items were all very deliberately noted;
        and, although not a very artistic description, it is nevertheless a
        precise inventory of Mrs. Lincoln's shopping toilet.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, January 18,
        at two o'clock, I learned, incidentally, that I was to be removed from
        my own house to another prison. I was sitting in the library
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green203"> Page 203</a>
      <p>
        reading, with my little one at my feet playing with her dolls,
        prattling, and beguiling me almost into forgetfulness of the wickedness
        and persecutions which beset me, until recalled by this startling
        intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I immediately sent for
        the officer of the guard, and demanded to know the facts. He told me
        that he had orders not to communicate with me on the subject, or to
        speak with me at all, but would go to the Provost-Marshal, General
        Porter, and obtain further instructions. He returned, after a short
        time, with written orders from that functionary, fixing the hour for my
        removal. Detective Allen had the ordering and regulation of the
        necessary arrangements; the few articles of clothing for myself and
        child, which I was allowed to take, were gathered together and packed,
        with a sentinel standing over, and examining each piece separately. Less
        than two hours was allowed me, before I was dragged from my home for
        ever. A covered wagon, surrounded by a file of soldiers, was ordered by
        Allen to be my conveyance to my new prison. Believing that I should feel
        humiliated by this indignity, Lieutenant Sheldon, however, positively
        refused to obey this order.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detective Allen was a
        German Jew, and possessed
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green204"> Page 204</a>
      <p>
        all the national instincts of his race in an exaggerated degree, besides
        having these inherent characteristics sharpened by Yankee association.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Poole, at this
        time, took the oath of allegiance, and fifty dollars in gold from the
        Yankee Government, and went on her way rejoicing. The woman Baxley,
        also, applied to be released upon similar terms, which was refused, and
        she was sent to the Old Capitol Prison, upon which occasion I saw her
        for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about four o'clock I
        turned my back upon what had once been a happy home; and, what was to me
        an additional grief, parted from my faithful maid, who had thus far
        stayed with me through all my trials, and served me with a fidelity and
        devotion not often equalled in the higher walks of life. My child wept
        bitterly on parting from her, and I confess that the pathetic appeals of
        the faithful creature, to be allowed to follow my gloomy fortunes, quit
        unnerved me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the
        guard were drawn up in front of the house to witness my departure.
        Several them had been very kind, and, on taking leave, I said, 'I trust
        that your next duty will be a more honourable one than that of guarding
        helpless women and children.'
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green205"> Page 205</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cast my eye up, and
        saw that the windows were all crowded with men, amongst whom I
        recognised several correspondents of the New York and Philadelphia press
        eagerly watching my words and looks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reached the Old
        Capitol Prison just at dark; but, whether in anticipation of some
        demonstration on the part of my friends I know not, but the whole guard
        were under arms to receive me; a general commotion was visible in all
        directions, and it was evident that a great deal of interest and
        curiosity was felt as to the destination of
        <i>'so noted a rebel.'</i> The receiving-room or office was crowded with
        officers and others, all peering at me. It was with a strange feeling of
        indifference that I found myself in this prison. I had already gone
        through so many trials, that this crowning act of villany could only
        elicit a smile of scorn.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now parted from
        Lieutenant Sheldon, who had entitled himself to my most grateful
        remembrance. His kindness to me had exposed him to the suspicion of his
        own Government; and it was through his instrumentality that I was now
        enabled to rescue some few cherished memorials from the general wreck of
        my effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So soon as I left the
        house, the members of the press in waiting took advantage of the
        opportunity
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green206"> Page 206</a>
      <p>
        to examine my apartments, and for days after the principal Abolition
        journals throughout the whole country contained descriptions,
        speculations, &amp;c. As a sample of the unceremonious manner in which I
        was paraded before the public, I have thought fit to give a few extracts
        from some of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <div3 type="subsection"
          >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brought no
          response, but I was subsequently informed that Lieutenant Carlton was
          temporarily placed under arrest, although he was, in the order of
          rotation, again in command at the prison. I can give no idea of the
          petty annoyances to which I was constantly exposed. I was never
          allowed to cross my chamber door. If a servant now entered to perform
          the smallest duty, the door was immediately locked and bolted, so that
          it was necessary to rap or call some five or ten minutes before they
          could get out. And when it is remembered that these servants were
          often negro men, who claimed perfect equality, and would tauntingly
          tell me that
          <i
            >'Massa Lincoln had made them as good as me - that they would not be
            called negroes, but gem'men of colour,'</i
          >
          some idea may be felt of the vague, undefined feeling of uneasiness
          that was constantly upon me. It is but justice to the superintendent
          of the prison, Mr. Wood, to state that, whenever the insolence of the
          negroes came to his knowledge, that he invariably sent them away; and
          that, so far as he was able to do so, he
        </div3>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green221"> Page 221</a>
      <p>
        protected the prisoners from the insolence and outrage of the guard and
        officers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules with regard to
        my child were barbarously rigid. The act of commitment ran thus: - 'Miss
        Rose Greenhow, although not a prisoner, is subject to the same rules and
        regulations prescribed for a prisoner.' She was in fact as much a
        prisoner as I was. I had never been consulted on the subject. And when
        occasionally, from very shame, she was allowed to go down in the yard,
        the child often came up crying, from the effects of the brutality and
        indecency to which she was exposed. The superintendent was, as I have
        above said, disposed to be kind, but there was a constant struggle going
        on between him and the military authorities for supremacy, by which the
        comfort of the prisoner was sacrificed, and his liberty abridged. It
        would seem to have been purposely arranged that these respective
        jealousies, should result in stricter vigilance over the helpless
        victims.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can conceive no more
        horrible destiny than that which was now my lot. At nine o'clock the
        lights were put out, the roll was called every night and morning, and a
        man peered in to see that a prisoner had not escaped through the
        keyhole. The walls of my room swarmed with vermin and I was obliged
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green222"> Page 222</a>
      <p>
        to employ a portion of the precious hours of candlelight in burning them
        on the wall, in order that myself and child should not be devoured by
        them in the course of the night. The bed was so hard the I was obliged
        to fold up my clothing and place them under my child; in spite of this
        she would often cry out in the night, 'Oh, mamma, the bed hurts me so
        much.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portion of the
        prison in which I was confined was now almost entirely converted into
        negro quarters, hundreds of whom were daily brought in, the rooms above
        and below mine being appropriated to their use; and the tramping and
        screaming of negro children overhead was most dreadful. The prison-yard,
        which circumscribed my view, was-filled with them, shocking both sight
        and smell - for the air was rank and pestiferous with the exhalations
        from their bodies; and the language which fell upon the ear, and sights
        which met the eye, were too revolting to be depicted - for it must be
        remembered that these creatures were of both sexes, huddled together
        indiscriminately, as close as they could be packed. Emancipated from all
        control, and suddenly endowed with constitutional rights, they
        considered the exercise of their unbridled will as the only means of
        manifesting their equality.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to all other
        sufferings was the terrible dread of infectious diseases, several cases
        of small-pox occurring, and my child had already taken the camp-measles,
        which had broken out amongst them. My clothes, when brought out from the
        wash, were often filled with vermin; constantly articles were stolen.
        Complaint on this head, of course, was unheeded. Our free
        fellow-citizens of colour felt themselves entitled to whatever they
        liked. Several times during this period my child was reduced to a bare
        change of garments; and the supreme contempt with which they regarded a
        rebel was, of course, very edifying to the Yankees, who rubbed their
        hands in glee at the signs of the
        <i>'irrepressible conflict.'</i> One day I called for a servant from the
        window. A negro man, basking in the sun below, called out -
        <i> 'Is any of you ladies named Laura? dai woman up dare wants you.' </i
        >And, by way of still further increasing the satisfaction with this
        condition of things, Captain Gilbert, of the 91st Pennsylvania
        Volunteers, drilled these negroes just below my window.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I protested against
        these infamies, and threatened to make an appeal to the United States
        Senate to send a committee to enquire into our present hapless
        condition, as they had done in the case of the negro
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green224"> Page 224</a>
      <p>
        thieves and felons confined in the gaol, many of whom had been released
        by <i><em>habeas corpus,</em></i> and whose cases had been deemed worthy
        of a senatorial report. This threat procured the instant removal of the
        negroes to more comfortable quarters.

        CHAPTER XII.
        <br />
        PROGRESS OF EVENTS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE Congressional
        Committee of Investigation, instituted on account of Mr. Secretary
        Cameron's eccentric financial dalliances, was still labouring amidst the
        turbid pools of corruption, whose depth they were trying to fathom. Its
        researches had taken a far more extended range than was originally
        intended. The newspapers, in conjunction with Dame Rumour, sometimes
        lifted the screen, and gave the public a peep at the nature of the
        examinations with which the committee had charged themselves, and they
        were certainly of a very extraordinary
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green226"> Page 226</a>
      <p>
        character - the most remarkable being the charges against Mrs. Lincoln
        of corruption, &amp;c. Mrs. Lincoln was said to have purchased from a
        New York hardware establishment a dinner service of china for the White
        House, to be paid for by the Government, for which the dealer presented
        a bill to Mr. Lincoln for the sum of 2,500 dollars; that he refused to
        pay the exorbitant price, and sent for a hardware dealer of Washington
        to consult as to the real value, who estimated it at about 800 dollars;
        that the New York dealer still insisted on his original demand, telling
        Mr. Lincoln significantly that he had better pay it without further
        question; that Lincoln insisting to know what he meant, the dealer
        finally gave the history of the transaction, as follows: that the real
        price of the china had been 800 dollars, but Mrs. Lincoln had directed
        him to make out the bill for 2,500, and hand over the surplus to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of some of
        these charges can be better understood by the formal defence which the
        'New York Herald' thought fit to make of her character and domestic
        virtues. It deprecated the attempt of the committee to interfere with
        the <i>harmonious domestic relations</i> of President Lincoln and his
        wife - said that 'she should be, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion,'
        &amp;c. This was very noble and praiseworthy
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green227"> Page 227</a>
      <p>
        on the part of the 'Herald;' but the committee were dealing with things
        as they were, and not as they ought to be, although they afterwards came
        to the conclusion that it was incompatible with the good of
        <i>public morals</i> that their researches should be published. It will,
        however, at some future day form a curious appendage to the history of
        the times, in the hands of some chronicler of the rise and fall of the
        Model Republic, which has been more recently characterised as
        <i>'the best Government the sun ever shone upon.'</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movements of
        M'Clellan were now hurried, and he was forced to assume the defensive in
        the manner and place indicated by others. The second advance on Manassas
        was in accordance with this plan, and the result proved even more
        disastrous to the Abolition army than the first. They could no longer
        delude themselves as to the superiority of the fighting qualities of the
        enemy they had to contend with: it had been demonstrated at Manassas,
        and equally fatally at Ball's Bluff - where the fanatical demagogue
        Baker met his just doom. And they were now to learn that this hated
        Southern chivalry, whom they reported at Manassas to have laid<i>
          'down' behind their trenches, too enervated to load their own guns,
          which was done by their negroes for them,</i
        >
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green228"> Page 228</a>
      <p>
        exceeded them quite as much in hardy endurance as in strategy and skill
        - all qualities essential to success; and in this instance, as if to
        show their contempt for the foe who had required almost eight months to
        recover from the last shock of arms, added insult to injury by holding
        them in check with wooden guns; actually introducing with success the
        Chinese system of warfare against these puritan propagandists of the
        nineteenth century.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at this time that
        I replied to the boast made by some Yankee officers of the 'total
        annihilation of our army' -
        <i
          >'We will not fight you at Manassas, but will lead you on to the
          Chickahominy, where we will welcome you "to hospitable graves!"'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the actual
        occurrence, this chance prophecy was published in the 'New York Herald,'
        and other papers, as an evidence of my uninterrupted communication 'with
        the army at Manassas.' And the Prince de Joinville, in his apologetic
        letter for M'Clellan's defeat, says,
        <i
          >'He was forced to reveal his plans in Cabinet, and a female spy
          immediately sent information of them across to Beauregard, whose
          strategic movement was consequent upon it.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan did me the
        honour to say that I knew his plans better than President Lincoln or his
        Cabinet, and had caused him four times to change them -
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green229"> Page 229</a>
      <p>
        this was a matter of public notoriety amongst the Yankees, and fully
        believed. But he gave me credit sometimes for more information than I
        possessed. I was, of course, a close observer of the smallest
        indications, and often drew accurate conclusions without having any
        precise knowledge on the subject. I was in Washington, as the Indian
        savage in the trackless forest, with an enemy behind every bush. My
        perceptive faculties were under a painful tension, and every instinct
        was quickened to follow the doublings and windings of the ruthless foe
        who was hunting my race unto death; and, of course, no word or
        indication was lost upon me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very often at this
        period intruded upon by large parties of curious Yankees, who came with
        passes from the Provost-Marshal, or Governor of the district, to stare
        at me. Sometimes I was amused, and generally contrived to find out from
        these parties what was going on. One set of men came, introducing
        themselves as friends of Mrs. Timothy Child's - as if this would furnish
        a passport to a Southern woman's confidence. This party affected to be
        literary, one of whom was editor of a Rochester journal: informed me
        that I was detained on account of my talents 'as a writer,' and classed
        me with Mdme. de Sevigné. Another large party came a
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green230"> Page 230</a>
      <p>
        few days after this: the women, very smartly dressed, helped themselves
        very unceremoniously to cake which had been just sent to my little one.
        A woman of this party, who claimed Boston as her residence, made quite a
        furious onslaught upon me, and said to me, 'Confess that it was love of
        notoriety which caused you to adopt your course, and you have been
        certainly gratified, for there is no one whom everybody has such a
        curiosity to see' - became very much excited, and said a great deal
        more. I told her that I had not supposed her object in visiting my
        prison was for the purpose of making a personal attack upon me, but that
        she did not surprise me. And afterwards I requested the superintendent
        not to allow any more of these parties to have access to me; for the
        fishwomen of Paris in the French Revolution were before my mind, and I
        feared that the next party might come armed with sticks or knives. The
        superintendent told me that numbers daily came to the prison who would
        gladly give him ten dollars a-piece to be allowed to pass my open door,
        so as to obtain a view of the 'indomitable rebel,' as I was sometimes
        called in their papers. This was being 'damned to immortality.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disappointment of
        the Abolitionists at Manassas by no means diminished the zeal of the 'On
        to
      </p>

      <p>
        Richmond party,' although it must always be borne in mind that the most
        bloodthirsty and desperate of these mercenary <i>patriots</i> were, from
        the nature of their positions, never likely to encounter the foe whom
        they affected to despise. In the first battle of Manassas it was
        terrible to read the accounts of the masked batteries, and torpedoes,
        and infernal machines, described as buried by the rebels, who were held
        up to the execration of the civilised world for resorting to such unfair
        practices against a trusting foe, who disdained the use of any but the
        most orthodox means of destruction. Poor rebels, how bitterly they were
        denounced! Unblushingly now these same liberators avowed to the world
        that they had drawn on their imaginations - in plain English, had lied
        most egregiously: that instead of
        <i
          >'the country, for the space of twenty miles, being enfiladed with
          masked batteries, rifle-pits, &amp;c.'</i
        >
        - as they have since - only a few earthen defences, of but little
        strength, surmounted by wooden guns, were found; and by consequence
        forced to admit that the formidable defences and breastworks against
        which their mighty army had recoiled and fled like stricken hounds, had
        been formed of a small band of 'enervated Southerners,' whom they
        represented as an easy prey. And so they had been for long years, and
        the North
      </p>

        had grown rich and intolerant upon its monopoly of their material
        wealth; but now they were banded together in the cause of their rights,
        and spirited on by the Lord of Hosts to victory.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrewd calculations were
        now entered into as to the time when this
        <i>'invincible grand army'</i> (for they still adhered to the name),
        would make its triumphant entry into Richmond. Extracts were constantly
        published from the 'Richmond Examiner,' to prove the utter want of
        confidence of the populace in our President, representing him as ruling
        with despotic power, exposing every salient point - our exhausted
        resources and want of munitions of war, and other things which
        patriotism should have shrouded in silence, had it all been true.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Examiner' was also
        reported several times to have been suppressed by order of President
        Davis, on account, as they said,
        <i>'of its fearless exposure of his tyrannical government,'</i> and our
        helpless condition was bemoaned by the victims of a despotism more
        absolute than that which imagination inflicted upon the Confederacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So convinced was I of
        the injury which the 'Examiner' caused by exaggerating our internal
        differences and exposing our difficulties, that on arriving at Richmond
        I seriously asked the President,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green233"> Page 233</a>
      <p>
        why, in view of the mischievous effects of this paper in giving aid and
        comfort to the enemy, it had not been suppressed; for that during the
        period of my imprisonment, I had had ample opportunity to know the
        important information which they derived through its columns. The reply
        of the President was befitting the head of a great nation -
        <i
          >'Better suffer from that evil which is temporary, than arrest it by a
          still greater one. It is a dangerous thing to interfere with the
          liberty of the press, for what would it avail us if we gain our
          independence and lose our liberty?'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letters were also passed
        about purporting to come from the ladies of our high officers and
        officials, regretting the erroneous judgments of their 'bosom lords,'
        and all sighing after the flesh-pots of Egypt; and Mr. John Minor Botts
        quoted openly, as authority for our demoralised condition, and readiness
        to be taken into favour, if the conquering army could once get to
        Richmond. But there was the rub. The road to Richmond was studied on the
        maps, and it seemed very easy. I had the one used by the Military
        Committee of the Senate, with the red dotted lines which they made of
        the route; and thinking it might serve as a lesson to the Confederate
        engineers, sent it to Manassas - (I have often wondered if that might
        not be the identical map supposed to

        have been furnished by General Scott's coachman). To their judgment, the
        'On to Richmond' was <i><em>un fait accompli;</em></i> and our noble
        President already dragged at the wheels of the 'coach with purple
        hangings,' to grace the triumph of the immortal rail splitter. This
        programme was only delayed. Who could doubt its fulfillment? Mr.
        Secretary Chase borrowed money upon it. The bulls and bears of Wall
        Street kept the ball constantly in motion. Richmond was the Palestine of
        these modern Crusaders, and the freedom of the negro their sepulchre of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M`Clellan, by order of
        the <i>'Great Secretary,'</i> now made the third move in the programme
        of 'On to Richmond,' by way of Yorktown. This was against his judgment;
        but he, however, showed himself possessed of the first requisite of a
        soldier - obedience to his superior. He had an effective force of
        150,000 men, well appointed and disciplined - somewhat, it is true,
        relaxed by the <i>mistake</i> at Manassas - and eager, if we could judge
        from the boastful bragging tone, for the onslaught. The only opposing
        army at this time on the peninsula was the small but gallant band, under
        Magruder, of eight or ten thousand men, which he managed with such
        skill, by marching and countermarching, as to give the idea of fifty or
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green235"> Page 235</a>
      <p>
        sixty thousand: this estimate was constantly made by the Yankees. With
        this insignificant force he held M'Clellan's whole army in check for two
        months. Upon the principle that one Confederate was equal to five
        Yankees, I aided in the mystification by <i>inadvertently</i> supposing
        our force on the peninsula to be not less than 200,000 strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan was evidently
        under the impression that a formidable force confronted him, and set to
        work to entrench himself, at a cost of $3,000,000; and demanded that
        reinforcements, to the amount of 50,000 men, should be sent him from
        Washington. Stanton haughtily replied to this requisition, in the name
        of poor Lincoln, by enumerating the force under his command, and ordered
        him to fight the battle with the army he already had; and plainly
        insinuated that, if he asked for any more men, they would send him
        instead 'a commanding officer.' M'Clellan maintained the impossibility
        of his commencing offensive operations, unless reinforced. A
        correspondence between him and the <i>Great Secretary</i> ensued, which
        created an active partisan warfare. M'Clellan's friends warmly espoused
        his cause, and asserted boldly that it was Stanton's design to sacrifice
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this pressure of
        public feeling, which was
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green236"> Page 236</a>
      <p>
        aided by the 'New York Herald,' reinforcements were sent to M'Clellan;
        but the order was tardily given and tardily executed. It was determined,
        although there were over 75,000 men behind the fortifications of
        Washington, that none of these could be spared, as the gaieties of the
        Capitol might be suddenly interrupted by a foray of the 'rebel
        desperadoes.' How my blood tingled with satisfaction at the estimate
        they put upon the daring feats of our men. The gallant Ashby and his
        black horse cavalry were viewed with as much terror as the wild huntsman
        of the Black Forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty thousand men were
        at last grudgingly ordered to reinforce M'Clellan - 10,000 taken from
        each of the commands of Banks, M'Dowell, and Shields. Banks accounted
        for his subsequent defeat by Stonewall Jackson, from having had his
        command weakened by this reduction, and the movement of his remaining
        forces impeded by the wagons, &amp;c. consequent upon the transfer of so
        large a body of troops.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile these stern
        alarums did not interrupt the merrymaking at the National Capitol;
        perhaps, at no period of its history had there been such unrestrained
        indulgence of revelry and mirth. The court journals gave a daily account
        of balls, and dinners,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green237"> Page 237</a>
      <p>
        and routs, and exultingly proclaimed the fact that the Abolition ladies
        could 'dress and dance,' and 'give suppers,' 'brilliant suppers,' in
        spite of the withdrawal of those 'Secesh dames and demoiselles - the
        Greenhows, Slidells, and Clays' - and 'the foreign Ministers who were
        wont to sympathise with these fair traitors.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gay doings ought
        to have been proof conclusive that there was 'nobody hurt,' even though
        the city authorities of New York and Philadelphia found their resources
        strained to the utmost to give bread to the thousands of destitute and
        starving families in their midst, and their hospitals were crowded to
        overflowing with wounded and dying soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fashionable world of
        Abolitiondom was now put in a state of great excitement on account of
        the grand ball which Mrs. Lincoln had resolved to give at the White
        House, on February 9th. The invitations had been issued a month in
        advance, and the interest of the public kept alive by descriptions of
        the preparations as they progressed. It was got up truly upon a scale of
        royal magnificence. Maiard was brought on from New York to superintend
        the supper and its adornments; and the Chevalier Wikoff was grand master
        of ceremonies. And, in
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green238"> Page 238</a>
      <p>
        order that nothing connected with the august entertainment which could
        enhance the general interest should be lost, the 'New York Herald'
        published the card of invitation sent to 'Mr. and Mrs. James Gordon
        Bennett,' which they, however, had the good taste to decline, dreading,
        I suppose, the 'irrepressible conflict.' The description of the ball in
        its various phases, and the beautiful toilettes, filled many columns of
        the papers for days after, to the exclusion of the exciting news from
        the seat of war. Mrs. Lincoln's costume received a large share of
        attention. She was described as being dressed in Court mourning - that
        is, with white and black, rose and white, and black lace intertwined and
        commingled, 'as a delicate compliment to Queen Victoria upon the death
        of Prince Albert.' Her own son, during this heartless pageant, was lying
        at the point of death, and a few days after breathed his last upon which
        occasion, however, she put on no mourning. Neither did she for the
        brother who fell afterwards, fighting in defence of his home and
        fireside.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These festivities at the
        National Capitol were intended to divert the public mind from too close
        a scrutiny of the policy of the Government. The superficial observer
        supposed that all the energy of their rulers was directed to the
        reduction of

        Richmond. M'Clellan was unsophisticated enough to suppose that he had
        been sent to the peninsula for the accomplishment of that end, and he
        addressed himself to the task with great caution and not much relish for
        it. He would greatly have preferred to remain in Washington during its
        season of festivities, enjoying the
        <i><em>éclat</em></i> and hero-worship of the hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, however, proceeded
        to take the necessary measures for the advance of his army. He had the
        good sense never to have underrated the enemy he had to encounter; on
        the contrary, he magnified our force and capabilities beyond what our
        modesty would have allowed us to claim on our own behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M'Clellan rightly judged
        that the only chance of success was to overwhelm us by numbers. Hence
        his requisition on the War Department at Washington for reinforcements,
        which, when conceded, <i>under force of the outside pressure,</i> were
        several weeks before reaching him; thus forcing him, whilst waiting for
        them, to extend and strengthen his original line of intrenchments and
        fortifications, to protect his army from the attack momentarily expected
        to be made by General Johnson, who had been by this delay enabled to
        relieve Magruder and his gallant band from the critical position they
        were in, for there is no doubt that had M'Clellan advanced upon

        them they must have been cut to pieces. They represented themselves as
        being somewhat in the condition of
        <i>'Admiral Hosier's army,'</i> mere shadows, from the severe marching
        and flying about to which they were subjected by Magruder, in order to
        deceive the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of
        digging and trenching of the Grand Army, the 'Great Secretary ' issued
        one of those remarkable bulletins proclaiming a great battle and a great
        victory at Yorktown, and, as was usual, a map and description of the
        seat of war appeared in all the Yankee papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confess to some uneasy
        feeling on the subject until a friend in the War Department sent me copy
        of the genuine despatch from M'Clellan,
        <i>'imploring reinforcements.'</i> Mr. Stanton's was a financiering
        <i>ruse,</i> and proved very successful - for Mr. Chase was enabled
        thereby to effect another considerable loan. I wrote a letter describing
        this same operation, which was mailed in Baltimore, and captured in the
        Post-office of that city, and was afterwards shown me by General Dix at
        the time of my mock trial before him for treason.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government at
        Washington never intended that M'Clellan should advance beyond Yorktown;

        he had played the rôle designed for him, and they were now determined to
        rid themselves of him, even though they should also sacrifice the army
        under his command. In preparation for this defeat, the transports were
        kept in a convenient position, and the gun-boats lay ready to cover the
        retreat of his forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evacuation of
        Yorktown by Johnson was conducted in a masterly manner: the enemy were
        in complete ignorance of his design until it had been entirely
        accomplished - held in check again by a few wooden guns. General
        Johnson, however, had the magnanimity to leave for their enlightenment
        an intelligent contraband, well posted as to his future movements and
        the policy and views generally of the Confederate Government.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a very
        important character arrived at the metropolis, in the person of
        President Davis's negro coachman. I was not informed whether President
        Lincoln and his premier, Mr. Seward, invited him to dinner, but I do
        know that he had frequent interviews with them, the result of which was
        given to the curious public through the press, as conversations between
        the President and Mrs. Davis during their evening drives. He also said
        that Richmond would be evacuated on the first sign of the approach

      <p>
        of the Abolition army, and that President Davis had had a subterranean
        passage made, so as to secure his own escape. These ridiculous stories
        were greedily swallowed, and implicit credit given to them; in truth,
        there was nothing too wild or extravagant for these Northern fanatics to
        seize hold of - and the Government offered a premium for this species of
        romance, as a sort of safety-valve for their own ulterior policy.

        HOPES AND FEARS.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I BECAME now seriously
        alarmed about the health and life of my child. Day by day I saw her
        fading away - her round chubby face, radiant with health, had become
        pale as marble, the pupils of her eyes were unnaturally dilated, and
        finally a slow nervous fever seized upon her. I implored in vain, both
        verbally and in writing, that a physician might be sent, and finally
        wrote the following letter to the Provost-Marshal: -
      </p>
      <p>
        <div3 type="subsection"
          >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours after I
          had despatched this note, my door was rudely thrown open, and Dr.
          Stewart, the <i>'Brigand Sergeant,'</i> as he signed himself,
          unceremoniously entered, saying, 'Madam, I come to see you on official
          business.' I said, 'Sir, it ought to be of a very grave character to
          warrant this intrusion.' He seated himself, his hospital steward
          standing near the door. 'Madam, did you write a letter to the
          Provost-Marshal this day?' 'Yes, I wrote to the Provost-Marshal; but I
          have yet to learn how you, a subordinate, dare question me in regard
          to any correspondence I may hold with your superior.' 'Madam, I have
          every right: you have caused me to be rebuked by Major Allen and
          General Porter,
        </div3>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green245"> Page 245</a>
      <p>
        for neglect of duty,' &amp;c. I said, 'Sir, in my letter to General
        Porter there was not the most distant reference to you; I asked that Dr.
        M'Millen might visit my child, knowing him to be a man of science and a
        gentleman, and my note furnished no warrant for General Porter to rebuke
        you. As to Major Allen, his impertinence is only equalled by your own at
        this moment.' He replied, 'Madam, I will believe General Porter in
        preference to you.' I thereupon arose from my seat, and said, 'Sir, I
        have borne with you quite as long as is consistent with my self-respect,
        and I now desire you to quit my room, as it is no part of my plan to
        submit to personal insult.' He arose also, foaming with rage, and stood
        confronting me - almost a giant in size - and said, 'I will not quit
        your room; I am here by order of Brigadier-General Porter.' 'Sir, I
        command you to go out; if you do not, I will summon the officer of the
        guard and the superintendent to put you out.' With that he attempted to
        lay hands upon my child. I interposed my own person and said, 'At your
        peril but touch my child. You are a coward and no gentleman, thus to
        insult a woman.' 'I will not go out of your room, madam,' he said, this
        time livid and trembling with rage or fear, I don't know which. I then
        went to the door and rapped - for be it
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green246"> Page 246</a>
      <p>
        remembered that he was locked and bolted in my room, that being the
        humane and Christian order. 'Call the officer of the guard.' The
        sentinel on duty being a friendly one, no time was lost in summoning
        him. When the officer appeared and the door was opened, it happened to
        be that same Lieutenant Carlton, from Zanesville, Ohio. He was very much
        agitated, for this man was his superior officer. I said, 'Sir, I order
        you to put this man out of my room, for conduct unworthy of an officer
        and a gentleman, and I will report you for having allowed him to enter
        here.' He nervously rubbed his hands, and said, 'I am sure Dr. Stewart
        will come out if you wish it.' 'Sir,' I said, 'do your duty; order your
        guard to put him out.' The sergeant, corporal, and guard - who all hated
        Stewart for his arrogance - were eager to obey. Whereupon this valiant
        Dr. Stewart actually slunk out. Strange to say, this scene filled me
        with uncontrollable laughter. It was farcical in the extreme - this
        display of valour against a sick child and careworn woman prisoner. A
        few hours later the kind and good Dr. M'Millen came in, accompanied by
        an officer, but under orders not to hold any conversation with me save
        that which was professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt it incumbent upon
        me to report Dr. Stewart's
      </p>

      <p>visit to the Provost-Marshal. The following is a copy: -</p>

          >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Johnson's
          wise and judicious falling back from Yorktown completely upset the
          plans and purposes of the Abolition Directory at Washington, and
          forced upon them an entire change of policy to suit the new emergency.
          Their determination with

        regard to M'Clellan was necessarily suspended, although not weakened in
        the slightest degree. But their own political existence depended upon
        the employment or defeat of the vast army under M'Clellan, which was now
        180,000 strong. To recall him at that juncture was to have him
        proclaimed Military Dictator. To avoid this danger, a vigorous
        prosecution of the 'On to Richmond' was imperative.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homesteads in the South
        were offered to that horde of barbarians, who swarmed like locusts over
        the fairest fields of Virginia, desolating them as they advanced, and
        spurred on with the hope of possession, and visions of orange groves and
        fair Southern wives. This is no imaginary picture. Wilson, of
        Massachusetts, said, few of that army, 'our boys,' as he called them,
        will ever return to the North; that they would have homesteads given
        them in the conquered country; that Congress would apportion the land
        into quarter sections; that they would settle and marry Southern girls.
        To which I replied, 'Never, sir. But our negroes will go North and marry
        yours, as far more fitting helpmates.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson, in this
        instance, proved a true prophet; but not in the sense he intended. Few
        of that Vandal crew ever returned to the North; but instead of homes in
        the sunny south, under the vine and the

        fig-tree, they found bloody graves amid the swamps of the Chicahominy,
        where their bodies lie unassoilzied, unburied, their bones bleaching in
        the sun, and a nation's anathema as their funeral dirge.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Andrew Porter,
        the Provost-Marshal, who had distinguished himself by the most wanton
        invasion of the rights of the people of the district, accompanied
        M'Clellan to the field, followed by his bloodhounds, Allen and his gang
        of detectives. Porter was succeeded by a Mr. Biddle Roberts, who signed
        himself with as many titles as a Spanish grandee, and determined to
        convince me in the outset that I had gained nothing by the exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanton had the grace to
        give an order that members of my family should visit me, without the
        restrictions which had been hitherto imposed. This, however, displeased
        the Provost-Marshal and detective police, who determined to deprive me
        of the power of making known this concession, and took upon themselves
        still to refuse all passes to see me. The following is a copy of a
        letter which I wrote to Mrs. S. A. Douglas, which was returned to me: -
      </p>
      <p>
        <div3 type="subsection"
          >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the beginning
          of February, a woman named Ada Hewit, daughter of a mechanic of
          Alexandria, calling herself Mrs. Morris Mason, was brought to the
          prison. She had, however, never been married, although the mother of
          two children, one of whom died a few days prior to her arrest. The
          immediate cause which led to her arrest was a letter written by her to
          Seward, claiming his protection from the attentions of Colonel Marcy
          (the father-in-law of M'Clellan), with whom she assumed to have
          established previously very amicable relations. Seward, after
          consultation with M'Clellan, had her incarcerated, in order to avoid a
          <i>family</i> scandal.</div3

      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. William Henry
        Norris, of Baltimore, was also confined at the Old Capitol as a
        prisoner. She was a most excellent lady; was detained about two weeks,
        and was released upon parole through the influence of the Hon. Reverdy
        Johnson. The new

      <a name="green255"> Page 255</a>

        regulations allowing half an hour in the prison yard had only gone into
        operation a few days before Mrs. Norris left, so that it was but a brief
        pleasure that I enjoyed in her society.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 6th, General
        Wordsworth called to see me in his character of Governor of the
        District, the first appointment of the kind made by Abraham the First.
        Consequently, the Provost-Marshal became simply chief of police, without
        other authority. A subordinate officer, Major Doster, was appointed to
        the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Wordsworth was
        gentlemanly and kind, and seemingly recognised the right of a prisoner
        to be treated with humanity and respect. He appeared greatly surprised
        to hear of the system pursued towards myself and child, and ordered that
        I should enjoy, as a right, the usual exercise allotted to other
        prisoners; also, that my child should have the privilege of going
        outside the walls, accompanied by an officer. But it was one thing to
        make humane laws, and another to have them executed. The love of tyranny
        had become too strong a passion within those walls to be easily
        abolished; any appeal required two or three days to reach the proper
        quarter; each subordinate officer took upon himself to interpret the
        rules; and corporals and sergeants assumed
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green256"> Page 256</a>
      <p>
        the airs of their chiefs, and had to be daily instructed; for, alas! we
        were only rebels, and inhaled the air by sufferance. The vexations and
        annoyances on this head were unceasing. The most brutal of the officers
        with whom I was brought in contact was Captain Gilbert, of the 91st
        Pennsylvania Volunteers (the same who had drilled the negroes), and
        Lieutenant Carlton, of Zanesville, Ohio. The most humane and kind were
        Captain Higgins and Lieutenant Miller, of New Jersey. These gentlemen
        merit the consideration of every prisoner for the reluctance with which
        they obeyed the harsh orders of their superiors; and, if the chances of
        war ever throw them in our midst, I should deem it a privilege, by every
        means in my power, to ameliorate their condition. One day, on going down
        in the yard, the market cart of the superintendent had just come in. My
        friend Charlie, who drove it, said, 'Will you take a ride?' I
        immediately got in - the other female prisoners following my example -
        exclaiming, 'I am off for Dixie!' and Charlie drove rapidly around the
        yard. It is impossible to describe the panic and confusion which ensued.
        All the prisoners rushed to the windows to enjoy the scene. The officer
        of the guard, Captain Gilbert, also rushed out, crying with might and
        main, 'Stop that <i>wehickle</i>!' The

        guard were doubled all around the yard, and, I believe, were actually
        preparing to fire upon us. After driving around the enclosure two or
        three times, we drew up in front of our redoubtable captain, who verily
        believed that an escape had been meditated, and that his timely
        intervention had alone frustrated it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>March</i> 10. -The
        greatest dismay and anxiety was felt at Washington on account of the
        extraordinary prowess of the Merrimac, or the Virginia, as she had been
        newly christened. The War Department forbade the publication of her
        glorious achievements: one entire edition of a Baltimore paper was
        suppressed, from having contained a graphic account of the engagement.
        In spite of these vigilant efforts it became widely spread; and Mr.
        Seward even awoke to the conviction that there was
        <i>'something the matter,'</i> and recommended to the Governors of the
        north-eastern States the subject of their coast defences. The Chamber of
        Commerce of New York hastily convened to take into consideration the
        harbour defences of that city. Each night the Abolition Government at
        Washington retired with the dread anticipation of seeing in the morning
        <i>'the Norfolk Turtle'</i> lying off the Potomac, ready to shell the
        White House. The Abolitionists hastily sent off their

        258 families, and a special train waited several days, with steam up,
        ready to bear off Lincoln and his Cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite an excitement was
        created throughout the prison, about this time, by the arrest of a woman
        in male attire. She was apprehended at the hotel of a man named
        Donnelly, in Washington, who, unfortuantely for her, died a few days
        prior to her arrival. Her object had been to go to Richmond with the
        proffer of a projectile which her husband, who was in England, had
        invented, the model of which she had in her trunk. Donnelly was to have
        forwarded her over. She was very handsome, and was a woman of some
        cultivation and scientific attainments. She was a keen observer, and
        both spoke and wrote well. Her room was adjoining mine; and, although
        there was a double door between, I was enabled to converse and pass
        communications through the keyhole. This had been arranged by a skilful
        use of the penknife by the gentlemen who had been removed for this
        prisoner, in order that we might in turn avail ourselves of each other's
        facilities in sending communications out of the prison.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. M'Cartney was the
        name of this person, and, apart from her <i>costume,</i> there was
        nothing about her but was calculated to inspire respect, as her conduct
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green259"> Page 259</a>
      <p>
        was marked by great modesty and propriety. She was a monarchist in
        politics, had supreme contempt for the Abolition Government, and
        sneeringly enumerated its lawless acts in support of her thesis - that
        sooner or later all republican forms of government resolved themselves
        into unlimited despotisms. I was not tempted to controvert this
        position, being, as it was, entirely in accordance with my own
        experience of this<i>
          'most perfect Government the sun ever shone upon.'</i
        >
        She demanded her freedom, as there was no proof against her; and, for
        want of <i>proof,</i> she was, after a few weeks' imprisonment,
        discharged. I admired her spirit and independence, and wish her well
        wherever she may be.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady laid before
        the Government the most horrible outrage committed in that Old Capitol
        Prison - too dreadful, too revolting, to be mentioned here. She also
        wrote to Miss Dix, with whom she was well acquainted, describing the
        foul act, which caused Mr. Under-Secretary of War Watson to come to the
        prison under pretext of an investigation, which shifted the crime and
        responsibility from one set of officers and men to another, and was, in
        fact, a humbug, gotten up by the Superintendent Wood for the purpose of
        clearing himself, and allaying the excitement consequent upon the dark
        deed.

        FURTHER DEVELOPEMENT.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXTRACTS from my
        Journal: -
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>March</i> 18. - This
        day the United States Commissioners for the trial of State prisoners,
        General Dix and Governor Fairfield, called upon me, accompanied by their
        secretary and several subordinate officers, and were introduced most
        pompously by Dr. Stewart, or Cyclops, as he is now called in the prison.
        I had known General Dix formerly very well. He was one of the few
        Northern politicians in whose integrity I entertained any
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green261"> Page 261</a>
      <p>
        confidence, or for whom I felt any respect. He advanced most kindly and
        courteously towards me, introducing his colleague, and said that he had
        come in his capacity of United States Commissioner, to ascertain my
        wishes and offer his mediation and services, and would be heartily glad
        to be able to serve me as an old friend. I thanked him, and replied that
        he had always had my most profound respect, but in his capacity of
        minister of a tyrant, I could accept no service other than that he would
        present my simple demand for justice against his Government. He said
        that he regretted deeply to see my feelings so much embittered against
        the Government whose flag we had alike honoured in other days; that he
        had come here for the purpose of enquiring into the condition of State
        prisoners, would enter upon the examination of my case, and set all
        things right, and particularly desired to serve me. I said that I
        believed in the Mosaic law, which exacted an eye for an eye and a tooth
        for a tooth. 'I have been now nearly eight months a prisoner. I am not
        prepared to say whether I will appear before you in your capacity of
        commissioner. I deny the power of your Government lawfully to deprive me
        of my legal rights. And as to that old flag - there was a time when I
        looked upon it as
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green262"> Page 262</a>
      <p>
        the proudest emblem of human freedom on earth, and have in other lands
        bowed before it in holy reverence; but now there is no pirate flag that
        floats upon the sea which is not more honourable in my eye, for none
        covers such infamy.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Dix made some
        deprecatory reply, and turned to my child, who was lying flushed with
        fever on her bed of straw. I told him she was in need of food and air -
        for, in spite of General Wordsworth's order, the quarrels between the
        superintendent dent and the officer still kept her pent up in that foul
        atmosphere. He laid his hand softly upon her, and said, 'Why, she has
        fever.' I said, 'Yes, sir.' He said, 'Here is a physician.' I replied,
        'I have sent for one, and decline the services of that gentleman.' He
        looked pityingly upon her and upon me, and I thanked God that Lincoln
        had not often employed agents such as he. So soon as General Dix and
        party got outside of my door, the pent-up wrath of Dr. Stewart broke
        out, and he launched against me the most bitter vituperation. I
        approached General Dix, and said, 'Sir, I claim your protection against
        this indignity. I believed you ignorant of the conduct of this man, else
        you would never have allowed him to attach himself to your suite and
        enter my room, from which I was forced to call upon the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green263"> Page 263</a>
      <p>
        officer of the guard to expel him, for conduct unworthy of a man, upon a
        former occasion; and I now demand that you put an end to this scene. Dr.
        Stewart, with wonderful pertinacity, attempted to go on; but General Dix
        and Governor Fairfield each said, 'Stop, sir, and retire, if you
        please,' which he was accordingly obliged to do; and I confess I enjoyed
        his crest-fallen discomfited look more than any incident of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>March </i>19. - It
        may be supposed that visions of freedom mingled with my dreams that
        night - far otherwise was the case. I had an uneasy feeling that so far
        as I was concerned, it was only intended to gloss over their tyranny and
        afford a pretext for still greater oppression. I knew the chiefs of the
        Abolition Government too well to believe that humanity would guide their
        counsels. 'The consciences of these gentlemen never struggled with a
        maxim of State;' and I had unfortunately penetrated too deeply into
        their real plans and designs for the future to make them feel satisfied
        of the wisdom of releasing me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanton had avowed
        himself averse to the policy of the Government on the subject of
        arbitrary arrest. Yet he contented himself, and quieted his conscience
        by being a passive spectator of the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green264"> Page 264</a>
      <p>
        unlawful acts of his coadjutors. He was, in fact, too busy with his own
        schemes of personal aggrandisement and
        <i>safety,</i> for he was by no means blind to the frail tenure of his
        official dignity. He was a man, however, of inordinate vanity and great
        self-reliance - theoretically, he had been a democrat. On entering the
        Abolition Cabinet, he believed that he could shape its policy to suit
        his own ends. His first object had been to force M'Clellan to resign.
        His own appointment had been made as a conciliatory measure towards
        Pennsylvania with this contingency in view. That accomplished, Stanton's
        political programme was all mapped out, for his aspirations were
        directed towards being the candidate of the Conservative party for
        President in 1864. He had sagacity enough to see that the reckless
        course of the faction who now controlled the destinies of the nation,
        would either end in the entire overthrow of even the semblance of a
        constitutional form of government, and the establishment of an unlimited
        despotism; or a revolution, in which the conservative element would
        predominate. The discontent which very generally prevailed at this time,
        encouraged the belief that this latter was more than problematical,
        although the most rigid measures were taken by the Government to
        suppress every demonstration, by the establishment
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green265"> Page 265</a>
      <p>
        of the severest censorship of the press, and the imprisonment of
        everyone who dared to question its decrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanton had resolved
        that his resignation of his office should be consequent upon the signing
        of the Bill for the abolition of slavery in the district of Columbia, by
        Lincoln; calculating that this defiant act would rally around him at
        once a party strong enough to divert the current of events into the
        channel he desired. But 'the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft
        aglee.' M'Clellan still meekly held on to his place in spite of the
        continued humiliations put upon him, with a blind faith in the destiny
        which was to help him out of the slough, and lead him on to glory. The
        Conservative party still sustained him. In this dilemma Stanton had one
        of two alternatives before him - that of resigning his position and
        retiring from the political arena, content to believe that a righteous
        act would bring its own reward; or to plunge into the gulf of
        Abolitionism, upon whose poisonous and loathsome waters integrity, and
        honour, and honesty shrivelled and died.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Black was said to
        have been his steady counsellor and friend during this season of
        indecision, and to have spirited him on by apt quotations from
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green266"> Page 266</a>
      <p>
        his favourite author Shakspeare, to take the fatal leap. Hence his
        resignation, which had been written out, was thrown into the fire, and
        he immersed himself in that foul pool, and entered the list of the
        champions for honours, to be achieved by the sacrifice of the Government
        they affected to be waging war to uphold.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converts, whether in
        religion or politics, are universally acknowledged to exceed in zeal or
        fanaticism the original professors. In politics this is peculiarly the
        case, as the neophyte feels that, his antecedents being against him, he
        is specially called upon by some signal act of devotion to inspire
        confidence in his new associates.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence we see greater
        activity infused into the councils of the Abolition Government, and a
        more demoniac policy announced for the future prosecution of the war of
        subjugation. The flimsy mask which a wholesome dread of the world's
        opinion had forced them thus far to wear was thrown off, and the chances
        which a servile war would develope in their favour openly discussed; and
        Lincoln, Seward, Stanton, and their <em><i>confrères,</i></em> chuckled
        in cold blood over the horrors - from which, to their minds, there was
        no escape - for the women and children, at least, of the whole South.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln, to his credit
        be it said, was averse to this emancipation scheme in the manner
        proposed, for <i>he even</i> had heard of the horrors of St. Domingo;
        but they plied him with strong arguments and strong drinks, until his
        shallow reasoning faculties were confused, and he succumbed to the
        potent influences brought to bear upon him. Step by step it was resolved
        to develope this policy. The enormity of their wicked designs made them
        cautious; and they were not fully assured that some resistance might not
        be offered to this worse than savage warfare, against a people allied to
        them in many instances by consanguinity, and with whom they affected a
        desire to re-establish fraternal relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butler, Halleck, and
        Hunter were the appropriate agents selected at different times and
        places to raise the standard of insurrection amongst the slaves, and to
        send them, with all their evil passions excited, amidst the defenceless
        homes of the South, there to vent their fury upon the women and children
        - the whole male population being, as they well knew, in the service of
        their country. That this plan failed in its premeditated horrors, is due
        to that Divine mercy which has thus far thrown its protecting shield
        over our young nation.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracts from my
        Journal: -
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>March</i> 25. - This
        day I received a summons to appear before the United States
        Commissioners for the trial of State prisoners. I decided to obey the
        summons, as I felt some curiosity to know in what manner the trial would
        be conducted, what was the nature of the charges against me, and to what
        results it would be likely to lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one of those raw
        uncomfortable days in which the cold penetrated to the marrow. The sun
        was obscured by clouds as dark as Yankee deeds, and heavy flakes of snow
        were falling thick and fast. As I drove through the avenue from the
        prison to the Provost- Marshal's Office, which was at the other end of
        the city, the filth and desolation were appalling, for even in those
        first days of the occupation the effects had not been so visible.
        However, I had no time for reflection upon the contrast which the
        present and the past presented, as by this time the carriage drew near
        the Provost-Marshal's. But here truly was there room for comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This had been the house
        of Mrs. Gwin, one of the most elegant and agreeable in the city; and, as
        I passed up through the filthy halls and stairs, and the filthy crowd of
        soldiers and civilians who lined the way, my mind instinctively reverted
        to the gay and
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green269"> Page 269</a>
      <p>
        brilliant scenes in which I had mingled in that house, and the goodly
        company who had enjoyed its hospitality. I was conducted to the third
        story, and put in room without fire, and kept there until my hands and
        feet were completely benumbed with cold. A guard was stationed at the
        door, who rattled his musket in order that I should have a comfortable
        sense of his proximity. Numbers of officers in gay uniforms came in,
        upon one pretext or another, in order to stare at me. I was detained in
        this manner for nearly an hour, when the superintendent of the Old
        Capitol Prison, Mr. Wood, in whose custody I was still regarded as
        being, came to conduct me before the commissioners, whose presence I
        reached with difficulty - a passage being forced for me to pass through
        the soldiers who filled the ante-chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving before the door
        of the room in which the commissioners held their
        <i><em>séance,</em></i> it was thrown open, my name announced, and the
        commissioners advanced to receive me, with ill-concealed embarrassment.
        I bowed to them, saying, 'Gentlemen, resume your seats' (for they were
        still standing). 'I recognise the embarrassment of your positions; it
        was a mistake in your Government to have selected gentlemen for this
        mission. You have, however, shown me but scant courtesy in having kept
        me waiting
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green270"> Page 270</a>
      <p>
        your pleasure for nearly an hour in the cold.' They apologised,
        protesting their ignorance of my arrival, &amp;c. Some few complimentary
        remarks followed, and I now took a survey of the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large table was placed
        in the middle of the room, at the upper end of which sat General Dix,
        and at the other extremity Governor Fairfield. Mr. Webster, private
        secretary of Mr. Seward - as secretary of the commission - sat at a
        small table a little to the left of General Dix; and two other persons
        at a similar table to the rear of Governor Fairfield. My own seat was
        midway between the commissioners, in full view of the whole party. Large
        piles of papers lay before General Dix, which he fingered uneasily, and
        seemed uncertain what to do. Governor Fairfield made some unimportant
        remark; to which I replied, 'I suppose this is a mimic court, and I can
        answer or not, according to my own discretion.' One of the reporters now
        said, 'If you please to speak louder, madam.' I rose from my seat, and
        said to General Dix, 'If it is your object to make a <i>spectacle</i> of
        me, and furnish reports for the newspapers, I shall have the honour to
        withdraw from this presence.' Hereupon both of the commissioners arose,
        and protested that they had no such intention; but that it was necessary
        to take notes, in order to lay before the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green271"> Page 271</a>
      <p>
        President and Congress. I then resumed my seat; and Governor Fairfield
        continued in a strain in no respects different from that of an ordinary
        conversation held in a drawing-room; and to which I replied
        sarcastically, or caustically, as suited my purpose; and a careless
        listener would have imagined that the commissioner was endeavouring with
        plausible argument to defend the Government, rather than criminate me.
        Finally, and after it had continued some time, I said, 'But when is this
        dreadful ordeal - this trial for treason, which has been heralded to the
        world with so much circumstance - to commence? For I can scarcely
        believe that I have been brought from my prison on this inclement day
        for the purpose of this very facetious and irrelevant conversation, or
        be induced to regard it in the light of a formal trial for life,
        liberty, and estate, attainder of blood, and all the other ills of
        feudal times.' At this the subordinates laughed outright. Governor
        Fairfield coloured, attempted to speak several times, and changed his
        mind; and finally said, 'General Dix, you are so much better acquainted
        with Mrs. Greenhow, suppose you continue the examination?' I laughingly
        said, 'Commence it, for I hold that it has not begun.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Dix turned over
        and over again the papers before him, which were my letters seized by
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green272"> Page 272</a>
      <p>
        the detective police, and which, though relevant to the subject-matter,
        had no legal importance or bearing at this time. He selected one, laying
        his hand upon it, but still hesitated. I watched him keenly. At last he
        said, 'You are charged with treason.' 'I deny it, sir. During the eight
        months of my imprisonment I have had ample time to study the
        Constitution of the United States; and there is no act or provision in
        it which will justify a charge of that nature against me.' 'And so you
        deny the charge of treason?' 'I do, sir, most emphatically; and,
        moreover, retort the charge against yourself as being the minister of a
        President who has violated the Constitution, destroyed the personal
        rights of the citizen, and inaugurated revolution. At this moment, sir,
        you are presiding at, and conducting, a trial unlawful in every sense,
        and without even a presence of the legal form prescribed; for the
        Constitution of the United States is very precise and specific as to the
        mode in which a trial for treason shall be conducted. It requires that
        the charge for treason shall be sustained by two respectable witnesses,
        which you could not find in all Yankeedom.' He then held up the letter
        which he had selected. I immediately recognised it as the one I had
        caused to be mailed in Baltimore, and to which I have before alluded.

      <p>
        I held out my hand, saying, 'Let me see it.' After a moment of
        indecision he gave it to me. I glanced my eye over its contents and
        returned it to him, saying, 'It is rather a clever letter, is it not?'
        General Dix replied, 'Mrs. Greenhow requires no new testimony in favour
        of her ability in the use of her pen.' I bowed my head, and said, 'Well,
        General, what next have you to say?' 'You are charged, madam, with
        having caused a letter which you wrote to the Secretary of State to be
        published in Richmond.' 'That can scarcely be brought forward as one of
        the causes for my arrest, as I was some three months a prisoner when
        that letter was written; and I myself regarded its undue publicity
        (prior to its publication at Richmond) as a grave cause of complaint
        against the Secretary of State.' 'You are charged, madam, with holding
        communication with the enemy in the South.' 'If this were an established
        fact, you could not be surprised at it. I am a Southern woman, and I
        thank God that no drop of Yankee blood ever polluted my veins; and as
        all that I have ever honoured or respected have been driven by ruthless
        despotism to seek shelter there, it would seem the most natural thing in
        life that I should have done so.' 'How is it, madam, that you have
        managed to communicate, in spite of the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green274"> Page 274</a>
      <p>
        vigilance exercised over you?' 'That is my secret, sir; and, if it be
        any satisfaction to you to know it, I shall, in the next forty-eight
        hours, make a report to my Government at Richmond of this rather
        farcical trial for treason.' 'General M'Clellan, madam, charges you with
        having obtained a thorough knowledge of his plans, and of forcing him
        consequently four times to change them.' At this I smilingly shrugged my
        shoulders, without reply, saying, 'Well, what else?' After a few moments
        General Dix said, 'Governor, I think we have nothing else to say to
        Mrs.Greenhow?' To which Governor Fairfield replied, 'No, sir, I think
        not.' Of course I do not pretend to relate the entire conversation - for
        it could not be called an examination - but have gleaned the most
        important points. I now said, 'It seems to me a little extraordinary
        that, after such grave charges as that of penetrating Cabinet secrets
        and fathoming and thwarting the plans of commanding generals, no
        curiosity should have been felt to arrive at the source of my so-called
        treason, if only as a measure of prevention for the future - as it is
        but reasonable to suppose I must have had able coadjutors high in the
        national councils, and that this information must have sought me at my
        own house - as it can be clearly established
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green275"> Page 275</a>
      <p>
        that I have never crossed the threshold of a Lincolnite. 'Oh! that
        reminds me,' resumed General Dix. 'Did Lieutenant Sheldon ever take out
        communications for you?' 'Oh, certainly, by authority of the
        Provost-Marshal. But if you wish to criminate Lieutenant Sheldon, you
        had better send for him and question him on that subject, as I certainly
        should not betray him or anyone else who might have rendered me a
        service.' General Dix asked, 'Where is Lieutenant Sheldon?' Mr. Webster
        replied, 'With his regiment in Virginia.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Dix then said,
        'I shall be very glad to serve you, madam, and shall certainly advise
        the Government to allow you to go South, or consult your wishes in any
        other respects;' that he regretted deeply my extreme bitterness, for
        which he could see no reason, &amp;c. I replied, 'That is the difference
        between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum.</i> I have been now eight months a
        prisoner, subject during that period to every insult and outrage which
        capricious tyranny could invent; my property stolen and destroyed; shut
        up in close imprisonment, and actually suffering the torments of hunger.
        To this treatment has my child of eight years been also exposed, thereby
        seriously impairing her health. Not content with this, I have been daily
        assailed in the journals of the
      </p>

        Administration, and sought to be dragged down to the level of the
        inmates of your White House. Knowing me then as you do, it will not seem
        strange that, instead of crushing, this system should have excited my
        contemptuous defiance and undying hatred. On examining this evidence,
        you can but smile at the absurdity of the charges, and the extreme care
        not to extract any information from me. I have, however, sir, to return
        my most sincere thanks to you and your colleague for the delicacy and
        kind feeling which has characterised your bearing towards me, and to
        congratulate you upon the conclusion of a task which can be but little
        in unison with the feelings of gentlemen.' Thereupon both commissioners
        advanced and shook hands, and expressed an earnest hope that I would
        very soon be sent South.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>March</i> 26. - This
        evening Mr. Wood came to my room to announce that the reporter who took
        down the examination was below and requested to see me. I authorised him
        to bring him up. He came to ask my permission to furnish a report of the
        proceedings to the newspapers, saying that a New York and a Philadelphia
        paper had each offered him five hundred dollars for it, and as the
        curiosity was very great to see it, it would be impossible to prevent
      </p>

      <a name="green277"> Page 277</a>
      <p>
        accounts of some sort from getting out. I told him that I had no
        objection for anything I had said to be known, my only desire being to
        avoid newspaper notoriety - besides, verbatim reports very rarely did
        justice, &amp;c. He replied: 'On the contrary, madam, yours is
        calculated to make a great impression. It has been read before the
        commissioners and official authorities, and the highest commendations
        bestowed upon it.' He opened his papers and read some portions of it,
        which read smoothly enough, and were certainly sufficiently explicit, so
        I withdrew my objection as to its publication. That same night this
        person received a peremptory order from Secretary Seward, under penalty
        of imprisonment and heavy fine, not to furnish any article on the
        subject for the press. Authorised statements, however, came out in all
        of the papers that the arch-rebel, Mrs. Greenhow, had made a full
        confession of her <font color="red">acccomplices</font>, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30th March I received
        a letter from Mrs. S. A. Douglas, in which she said, 'I do believe you
        have a stern joy in your martyrdom, else you would embrace the
        opportunity to escape from it.' The following is a copy of my reply: -

          the commissioners; great excitement, of course, existed in the prison.
          The superintendent amused himself by practising upon the hopes and
          fears of the prisoners. He has persuaded Harry Stewart that he will be
          sentenced as a spy.</div3

            to obtain information valuable to the Confederacy.'</i

          Also, that he could not grant me the time or other facilities for

          and I could glean no satisfactory information from the subordinate
          officers who approached me; and rumours reached me from
          <i>outside</i> that they again contemplated sending me to Fort Warren.

        at his window, singing, and the sentinel, who was walking on his beat in
        the yard below, turned and deliberately shot him. It has been my fate,
        woman as I am, to have had a loaded musket pointed at my breast; and God
        alone knows what would have been my fate, had the superintendent of this
        prison not interposed. This appalling murder would be a reason, if no

        CHAPTER XV.

        RENEWED ANXIETIES.
      </h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ON the 22nd of April,
        the Honourable Mr. Ely came to call upon me, and seemed magnanimously
        bent on serving me in some way. He said that he had been well and kindly
        treated at Richmond (where he had been as a prisoner since the battle of
        Bull Run), and he had come to see what he could do for me. I told him
        that the only service I could receive from him was, to ascertain from
        his Government the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green289"> Page 289</a>
      <p>
        reasons for my detention, after the notification I had received, and
        what they intended to do. On the 26th he again called upon me. He told
        me that General Wordsworth informed him
        <i
          >'that the order for my detention had been given by M'Clellan, who
          objected to my release on the grounds that I knew his plans better
          than Lincoln, &amp;c. &amp;c., and that he did not wish me sent South
          at this time.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ely brought with him a
        New York paper, commenting harshly upon his visit to
        <i
          >'a lady who had done the national cause so much injury, and hoping
          that he would not repeat it, as his patriotism would be damaged by it
          in the public estimation,'</i
        >
        &amp;c. He told me that this paper was brought to his seat by a member
        of Congress, with a friendly admonition against the
        <i>'repetition of the imprudence.' </i>Ely said that he took out the
        pass he had, and said, 'I am going to see Mrs. Greenhow at this moment,
        and will do all I can to resist this fanatical persecution,
        <i>for they did not treat me so at Richmond.'</i> On taking leave he
        asked me for my <i>carte de visite</i> (which I gave him), and said,
        'Madam, I will call again to see if I can be of use,' &amp;c. &amp;c. I
        replied, 'No; you will be refused a pass. They are afraid lest my
        fearless denunciations of their infamies may open the eyes of their
        followers, and make them

      <a name="green290"> Page 290</a>
      <p>
        question the orthodoxy of Abolitionism.' I subsequently learned, through
        a message from Ely, that my prediction had been verified; for, on
        application again for a pass to visit me, it had been refused - and this
        was the last I heard of the Honourable Mr. Ely.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tedium of my prison
        life at this time was greater than I can depict, and I now also began to
        realise the fact that my physical health was being gradually undermined
        by want of exercise and want of proper food. A feeling of lassitude was
        stealing over me, and a nervous excitability which prevented me from
        sleeping. My child's health was failing alarmingly also. I had nothing
        to read, and even the newspapers were served or not, according to the
        caprice of my jailors, and were very sure to be withheld whenever they
        contained Southern news. My room swarmed with vermin, which the warm
        weather now caused to come out in myriads from their hiding-places; and,
        although at this time allowed the half-hour exercise in the prison yard,
        I could not regard it as relaxation, for the yard was filled with the
        stolen negroes, who lay about, obstructing the walk, or engaged in
        boisterous practical jokes during the while, in utter disregard of
        social distinction, and even ventured to seat themselves on the same
        bench. And I must also add that the association with the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green291"> Page 291</a>
      <p>
        women prisoners was but a shade less obnoxious than that of this
        degraded servile class. Each day brought some collision between them and
        the guard, which was mortifying to me in the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard were at this
        time often extremely insolent, and questioned the slightest rule of
        privilege, so that it was necessary to make constant appeals to the
        officer on duty. One day, on going down, the guard very rudely placed
        his musket before me, and said, 'You shall not go down that way,' and
        ordered me to go by a dirty back stair, which was not the usual route. I
        immediately sent for the officer of the guard, Lieutenant Miller, who
        passed me down. Some time after the woman Baxley, and the one
        <i>calling herself Mrs. Morris,</i> or <i>Mason,</i> attempted to go
        down, and were also stopped by the guard, with whom they entered into an
        angry contest, and resolved in defiance to force their way through them.
        Morris was pushed into a corner, and held there by a bayonet crossed
        before her, whilst the more daring of the two, Baxley, seized on the
        musket that obstructed her passage, and attempted to pass under it. The
        guard cursed her. She struck him in the face, which caused his nose to
        bleed, and he knocked her down and kicked her. Attracted by the
        commotion, I went up, under escort of Lieutenant Miller,
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green292"> Page 292</a>
      <p>
        when this statement was given to me and to the officer by the women,
        amidst sobs and cries - the guard, also, who witnessed it, giving
        substantially the same account. Thus it will be seen that I must have
        suffered much from this humiliating association. Captain Higgins came up
        to speak with me on the subject, greatly mortified at the occurrence,
        and said that he would punish the guard if he could have any
        justification in doing so. I told him that I thought it was a case which
        he could not take cognisance of, as he could only regard it as a fight
        between a prisoner and a guard, in which the prisoner was the aggressor.
        Captain Higgins then implored those prisoners to have no words with his
        guard, but to appeal to him in case of insolence or disrespect, and that
        they should be summarily punished.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time I
        occasionally saw members of my family, who were admitted to see me under
        the special order to that effect from Secretary Stanton, although the
        privilege was necessarily used with great caution, as all who were known
        to be my friends were in consequence put under the surveillance of the
        detective police. The health of my child troubled me greatly. All her
        buoyancy was gone, and she would now lie for hours upon my lap with -
        'Mamma, tell me a story;' and, with a heavy
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green293"> Page 293</a>
      <p>
        heart, I have often beguiled her with wild and
        <font color="red">mprobable </font>
        legends, until she would fall into feverish slumbers in my arms. Finally
        I resolved to make another appeal in behalf of my family physician being
        permitted to visit her, and wrote to General Wordsworth on the subject,
        stating her condition, &amp;c. General Wordsworth, upon the receipt of
        my note, and the endorsement by the Superintendent of the alarming
        condition of the child, gave orders that Dr. Miller (who was himself
        under surveillance) should have a special order to visit me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Miller, upon
        visiting me, found the condition of the child critical, and represented
        to the General the necessity of her having more nutritious food, also
        air and exercise; and thenceforward she was taken out very generally for
        a short time each day by one or other of the officers. Captain Higgins,
        Lieutenant Miller, and Lieutenant Holmes, were each very kind to Rose;
        they seemed to be ashamed of the persecution which could go so far as to
        threaten the life of a little child of eight years.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Federal officers
        were at this time confined as prisoners for various offences. One Dr.
        Cox, a surgeon in the regular United States Army, was arrested for
        disloyalty to the Government and sympathy with the rebels. I had a great
        deal of
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green294"> Page 294</a>
      <p>
        conversation with this officer through the keyhole of his door, the room
        being the same which had been occupied by Mrs. M'Cartney. He was the son
        of Dr. Cox, of Philadelphia, and a man of cultivation. After some weeks
        of imprisonment, his resignation, which had been previously tendered,
        was accepted, and he was liberated on parole. The others wore mostly
        German officers taken up for stealing (or peculation, the term brought
        in vogue by Cameron), one the chief of Carl Schutts' staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr. Morton,
        ex-Lieutenant-Governor of the State of New York, was a prisoner by order
        of Seward, whose deadly animosity he had excited. Poor man! he was most
        inhumanly treated, and was gradually dying from the effects of it. The
        keenest sympathy of all the prisoners was excited on his behalf. He was
        allowed communication with no one, not even his wife; and when his
        half-hour of exercise in the prison yard came round, everyone was driven
        in as if he had been stricken with the plague, and a solitary walk
        prescribed, in sight but out of reach of communion with the guards even.
        I frequently sent out letters for him; but as he was in solitary
        confinement it was very difficult, and required the cooperation of
        several persons. The process was this: when Morton went down in the

        yard he would watch his opportunity to bow to me - I having been
        previously notified that he was below. If I had an opportunity to
        communicate outside, I would hold up a letter - if not, would shake my
        head; and bitterly would my heart ache when I would see the desponding
        manner with which the poor fellow would let his head fall upon his
        breast when I would give the negative signal. By means of a string he
        would pass his letter to Captain Pliny Bryan, C.S.A., who would pass it
        by a similar process to Dr. Cox, U.S.A., from whom it would reach me.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My anxiety was at this
        time intense to receive correct information from the Confederacy. Things
        of vast importance were transpiring; and although I had long since
        discarded all faith in Yankee accounts of current events, being well
        satisfied of their mendacious character, I knew too well the power and
        malignity of the Government arrayed for the purpose of crushing us, to
        lull myself into a false security or even momentary forgetfulness of the
        perils which threatened us on all sides. In spite of our continued
        successes, gloom hangs over our devoted land. What matters it that we
        repulse the Vandals at every point? The battle of Shiloh, where the
        brave and accomplished Sidney Johnson fell, and which would

        have decided the fate of Europe, was scarcely felt by the invaders, who
        take no account of human life so long as their shattered ranks are
        filled up by the outcasts of civilised Europe, and so long as greedy
        speculators and contractors are reaping harvests in <i>greenbacks.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of New Orleans
        at this time made me weep tears of blood. Oh! better that she had buried
        her whole population under her smoking ruins, than to have been given
        over a bloodless victory to the invaders; and from my soul I pray that
        heavy retribution may fall upon the dastards in the dark tragedy!
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i> 1. - The
        Abolition General, Butler, is in command of New Orleans. This man is,
        perhaps, better fitted to execute the wholesale order of Messrs. Seward
        &amp;Co. - of devastation, rapine, and murder - than any other who could
        have been selected. He was a Northern democrat; had been a member of the
        Charleston Convention, where he exerted all his faculties in widening
        the breach and inflaming sectional animosities. He advocated the
        dissolution of the Union as one of the inevitable necessities of
        Lincoln's election, and no man hurled bolder defiance at the Abolition
        party, or denounced the unconstitutionality of their measures in more
        unequivocal terms. He proclaimed the doctrine of the inalienable
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green297"> Page 297</a>
      <p>
        rights of the South, and counselled resistance as the last measure of
        self-protection. This man remained in the councils of the Southern party
        up to a late hour, and heartily concurred in the justice of the doom of
        the miscreant John Brown.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first
        administrative acts which emanated from Brigadier-General Butler as
        military Commander of New Orleans was the Order No. 28, commanding that
        the whole female population of that city should be subjected to outrage
        and infamy, <i>as common women of the town.</i> Comment hereupon would
        be out of place. The shuddering abhorrence with which the whole
        civilised world received its annunciation is the best record of this
        man's crimes to nations yet unborn.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of those
        Northern democrats, Caleb Cushing, who had been President of the
        Charleston Convention, asked me, at the time that the Virginia
        Convention was in cession, 'if I thought that the ordinance of secession
        would be passed.' I said 'Yes,' as I knew that certain measures were in
        contemplation by the Abolition Government which would make it imperative
        - alluding to the call for 75,000 men then being urged upon Lincoln. He
        replied, 'I am very glad to hear it. I feared that Virginia would decide
        upon "armed neutrality;" and the

        South, in my opinion, has no other alternative in this crisis, in order
        to maintain her own dignity and independence, but to secede. Her
        Northern friends and supporters have a right to expect that she will not
        back down,' &amp;c. Further conversation on this head followed, and I
        was so much impressed with his strong Southern views and sympathies,
        that I almost forgot that this man had once written and printed puffs
        eulogistic of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months later, when
        the fanatical Abolition war fever was at its height, Caleb Cushing asked
        to be appointed Brigadier-General in the Abolition army, in order to aid
        in the subjugation of a people whom he had recommended
        <i
          >to resort to arms, as the only means left to them for the
          preservation of their rights, and to drive the invader from their
          soil. </i
        >O consistency! thou art a jewel unknown to Northern placemen. Lincoln
        refused him the appointment, not having confidence in the stability of
        this last <i>act of faith</i> - so I was informed by Senator Wilson, of
        Massachusetts.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the gloomiest
        period of my life. Time dragged most heavily. I had absolutely nothing
        to occupy myself with. I had no books, and often no paper to write on,
        and those who approached me appeared entirely oblivious of the mental as
        well as

        physical wants of a prisoner. My imprisonment seemed destined to be
        indefinitely prolonged. Hope even had fled, and left me chafing against
        my prison bars, with the iron of the despot eating into my soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contrived to elude the
        vigilance of my gaolers, which was now greater than ever, and send a
        note to the Honourable James M. Bayard, United States Senator from
        Delaware, with a request that he would ascertain what was to be my fate,
        for the doubt and uncertainty which hung over me was more trying to me
        than the darkest reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Bayard, in pursuance
        of my request, went to General Wordsworth, the military Governor of the
        district, and was told by him 'that M'Clellan had countermanded the
        order for sending me South, and protested against it on the ground that
        I knew his plans better than Lincoln, having caused him four times to
        change them, and demanded that I should be held a prisoner for the war'
        - thus repeating substantially the old story. Mr. Bayard also obtained a
        pass to visit me, by reason of his having been a class-mate of
        Wordsworth's.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, every species
        of annoyance was put upon me. My friends, on calling at the
        Provost-Marshal's, were often informed that <i>I had been gone</i>

        characteristic paragraphs about me: sometimes that I vehemently
        protested against leaving Washington; at others, that I had made a full
        confession of my treason. In answer to a paragraph that went the rounds
        on this head, and which was copied into the 'Baltimore News Sheet,' I
        wrote the following: -

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday,</i> May 10.
        - This day at five o'clock the Yankees formally took possession of
        Norfolk, our troops having evacuated it in the forenoon. Direful events
        seem rapidly chasing each other. At first I did not credit it, the
        Yankee papers having for the last ten days heralded the important event.
        The Virginia, the noble Virginia, also destroyed! I would rather have
        lost both of my hands than to be obliged to write this fact as
        <i><em>un fait accompli.</em></i> The exultation of the Yankees and
        their insolence are beyond all description. Strange, no feeling of
        despondency is in my heart. My confidence in the ultimate result - the
        achievement of our independence - is strong as the faith planted on the
        Rock of Ages; and even in this dark hour the star of hope rises steadily
        beyond the gloom, guiding us on to victory and to empire. These great
        calamities have been permitted in order to arouse our people to a full
        sense of their peril, and to corresponding measures of resistance
        against our ruthless invaders. Altogether this has been a dark day in
        the prison. It may perhaps be well to say that my notes are principally
        in cipher. Captain Bryan and Harry Stewart are going to escape to-night
        - the attempt to be made when the guard whom they have bribed

        comes on at midnight. I long for the morrow, and the 'All's well!' A
        presentiment of evil weighs me down. I have a raging nervous headache. I
        have just bidden them both good-bye, and given Bryan my pistol. This
        continued anxiety is killing me.

          >Sunday Morning, May</i
        >
        11. - I was aroused at a little after five by the report of a rifle, and
        a cry enough to startle the dead: Harry Stewart had been shot by the
        guard whom he had bribed. Being disappointed in the attempt at night,
        Bryan had given it up. But poor impetuous confiding Harry Stewart was
        induced by the guard, when he came on again at five, to renew the
        attempt. Dr. Cox and the other Yankee officers confined in the room
        above heard the plot between the guards to murder him; the man who was
        in his pay saying to the other, 'When he gets fairly out of the window I
        will cry "Halt!" and fire at the same time; you hold your fire until he
        is down, and then give it to him.' The agreement by Stewart had been to
        give the man fifty dollars after he got down. The supposition was that
        they thought to rob him as they carried him round to the prison
        entrance. His friends, however, defeated this by drawing him up into his
        room. His leg was dreadfully shattered, making amputation necessary; but
        he was so much prostrated by loss of blood
      </p>

        previous to the operation that he could not rally from the effects of
        the chloroform, but died between three and four o'clock.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of the
        12th an examination took place in the prison, ostensibly for the purpose
        of establishing the fact of the bribery, and Dr. Cox and the other
        Yankee officers made the statement above; and it is inexplicable why the
        victim had not been warned by them of the murderous plot.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own evidence was
        taken, having been cognisant of the whole affair, and hearing the
        agreement with the guard. I was asked if I would aid a prisoner in an
        attempt, &amp;c. I answered 'Yes.' I considered it a point of honour to
        render any aid in money or otherwise. The woman calling herself Morris
        certified that I had furnished the means, through my sister, Mrs.
        Leonard, for the escape, &amp;c., thereby causing the arrest and
        detention of my sister for several days. She demanded to be brought
        before the Secretary of War, when the Assistant-Secretary Watson
        informed her that the charge had been made against her by this woman; at
        the same time he released her from custody. I saw my sister but once
        afterwards, when she left the city as no longer a safe place for her.
      </p>

        dreadful scenes that she starts and cries out in her sleep. Horrors like
        this will shatter the nerves of the strongest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13<i>th</i>. - The
        murderer has been released from custody, promoted to a corporal, and put
        again on duty on this post. I sent for the officer of the guard, and
        remonstrated against it as an outrage and insult to every prisoner, and
        that, if allowed to remain, he would probably be killed before the day
        was over. He was in consequence sent away.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i> 14. - The sky
        of our destiny is brightening. The successes of the gallant Ashby and
        Jackson have inspired the Yankees with wholesome dread, and they again
        apprehend a descent on Washington. But they watch me more closely in
        consequence. When will this end? I am nearly starved. I had a fowl
        served up to me to-day (or rather a small piece of one), which must have
        been the cock which crowed thrice to wake Peter; we could not get our
        teeth through it. Rose cried heartily, for she was very hungry. Captain
        Bryan, and the other gentlemen below, have just smuggled me a supper. I
        should starve but for the considerate kindness of these gentlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i> 15. - Last
        night the wildest panic prevailed. The long roll was beat; the guard
        doubled round

      <a name="green305"> Page 305</a>
      <p>
        the prison; and the rumbling of artillery and tramp of men, yelling and
        cursing as they marched, kept us all on the <i>qui vive.</i> Yet even
        amidst our wild hopes mingled dread, for we believed that our brutal
        guard would endeavour to wreak their vengeance upon us in the event of
        an attempt at rescue: threats to that effect had often been vaguely
        uttered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panic was caused by
        a number of mules breaking their <i>coral,</i> and coming across the
        Long Bridge. The clatter of their hoofs alarmed the pickets, who fled in
        great terror, communicating the panic in their route, that Jackson,
        Ashby, and Stuart were in hot pursuit, with a mighty army.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that it had been
        true! that our hosts could sweep over their lands, and leave behind the
        desolating footprint of war! for as yet this people have known none of
        its horrors, but made mighty profit thereby. Their manufacturing
        interests are revived with renewed energy in the furnishing of
        implements of war, clothing, and other supplies for their vast armies in
        the field, whilst Mr. Chase complacently duplicates
        <i>greenbacks,</i> chuckling over the issue of each additional million
        as a step nearer to national bankruptcy, and the absolute despotism
        which is to rise out of the ruin of the old system.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How farcical now seem
        the boasted Government of our fathers, the Declaration of Independence,
        and the Constitution of the United States! - almost as much so as the
        Constitution of the kingdom of Lilliput, and which the first rude shock
        has scattered to the winds. That profound and thinking men should now
        believe in the permanence of a system based upon such feeble security as
        the integrity of the governing power is still the wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only hope that the
        experience of the past will guide our own people in the formation of a
        Government which will be eternal, with no element of disruption in it.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i> 17. - We are
        all in good spirits. Accounts are received daily of skirmishes, in which
        our people are always successful. The Yankees are in continual dread of
        Jackson's advance on Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i> 18. - A
        senatorial committee have just visited the prison. I cannot understand
        precisely the object of it, although certainly not meant for the benefit
        of the prisoners. Wood is very uneasy. Wilson, of Massachusetts, was
        brought by him to see me, and in the course of conversation told me that
        I was, up to that period, the most important prisoner taken;
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green307"> Page 307</a>
      <p>
        that he had, nevertheless, advised my being immediately sent South, but
        'that Seward, M'Clellan, and the <i>rest</i>' thought differently; that
        I would soon, however, be set free, as the rebellion would be crushed
        out in a little while, as Richmond had already fallen. I told him that,
        if Richmond fell, it would bury the Abolitionists under its ruins, and
        rise from its ashes the capital of a mighty empire. I do not venture to
        repeat the whole of my conversation with this Abolition leader, for all
        the bitterness and contempt which I felt for his race was thrown into
        it. In the course of the interview I had the satisfaction of seeing the
        jealousy and division amongst themselves, which I welcomed with joy, as
        the <i><em>avant-courier</em></i> of the bitter retribution - in the
        shape of civil war at the North - which is to terminate the national
        existence of that corrupt and debased people. The progress of events is
        slow but sure, for they now groan under the yoke of absolute despotism,
        although all outspoken expression of discontent is suppressed. The
        leaders are, however, aware of its existence, and hope to avert the
        catastrophe by a vigorous invasion of the South, and the employment of
        all the evil passions of their race in that unholy crusade.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i> 19. - There

        Stewart, all my friends are interdicted from visiting me; and as I will
        not associate with the women prisoners, I am in absolute solitude. The
        hope of being released has quite unsettled my prison routine, and I find
        it very difficult to fix my mind on any thing but the unutterable
        weariness of my lot. When will it end? I shrink with terror from the
        contemplation of the indefinite future, and try to fix my mind upon the
        heroic deeds of my countrymen - for in them indeed is my trust, my only
        hope.

        He also rejected the evidence of the Bible in support of Christianity,
        and denied its sacred character. His text-book was the writings of
        Paine; and if anyone asked him for a book to read, he was sure either to
        give them, as a great favour, a folio volume of his own writings,
        collected in the form of a scrap-book, with the ideas of Paine
        intensified or diluted, or else, as a special mark of grace, the works-
        of that infidel; for, apart from other peculiarities patent to every
        prisoner, his desire to make proselytes to his own
        <i>want of faith</i> was the ruling passion of his soul. Be was
        vindictive, cunning, and ambitious, repelled with warmth any claim to
        being considered a gentleman, and yet, strange to say, was by no means
        devoid of some generous inspirations; for I have known him to perform
        acts of great magnanimity and generosity. Stanton was his patron, to
        whom he seemed bound by strong ties. So it will be readily seen that he
        neither feared God nor man, and that William P. Wood, Abraham Lincoln,
        and the Emperor of Russia were the most irresponsible absolute despots
        on earth.

        of time, and hope paints no silver lining to the clouds which hang over
        me. Wood tantalises me each day with expectation of something which
        never happens. In a fit of vexation I ordered him not to address himself
        to me save in his official capacity. I almost wish I had not done it;
        for the chattering of a monkey would even break pleasantly on the
        monotony of my life.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>May</i> 25. - To-day,
        as I walked in the prison yard, a prisoner captured at Front Royal,
        Virginia, threw at my feet a small piece of paper containing
        intelligence which made my heart leap with joy. I eagerly devoured its
        contents, which were that a battle had been fought on the 23rd and 24th
        at Front Royal, in which we had gained a great victory, having driven
        the Yankees from the town, and taken 1,470 prisoners, besides a large
        quantity of stores, which we very much needed. All honour to the brave
        Jackson, who is now the special terror of the Yankees!
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26<i>th.</i> - Great
        excitement prevails here. The Abolitionists are again sending off their
        families. Last night I put my candle on the window, in order to get
        something out of my trunk, near which it stood, all unconscious of
        committing any offence against prison discipline, when the guard below
        called out, 'Put out that light.' I gave no heed, and only

        lighted another; whereupon several voices took up the cry, adding,
        'D---n you, I will fire into your room.' Rose was in a state of great
        delight, and collected all the ends of candle to add to the
        illumination. By this the clank of arms and clatter of feet, in
        conjunction with a furious rap at my door, and demand to open it,
        announced the advent of corporals and sergeants. My door was now secured
        inside by a bolt which had been allowed me. I asked their business.
        Answer - 'You are making signals, and must remove your lights from the
        window.' I said, 'But it suits my convenience to keep them there.' 'We
        will break open your door if you don't open it.' 'You will act as you
        see fit, but it will be at your peril.' They did not dare to carry out
        their threat, as they knew that I had a very admirable pistol on my
        mantel-piece, restored to me a short time since, although they did not
        know that I had no ammunition for it. The guard, meanwhile, were doubled
        around the prison on every post, and the 'All's well' cried throughout
        the night. I subsequently explained to the officer of the guard the
        absurdity of the whole proceeding, which he had the good sense to admit.
        An order, however, came from the Provost-Marshal to capture my pistol,
        which was accordingly done with reluctance

        by Lieutenant Miller. I relate this as one of the absurd events which
        were constantly occurring, sometimes in a far more offensive form.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27<i>th.</i> - Oh, how
        weary I am! I have not had even the newspapers for several days. An odd
        volume of 'Silvio Pellico' has helped me to beguile the heavy hours; but
        the similarity of my own fate with that of other victims of tyranny does
        not diminish my sense of suffering. The heat is intense, with the sun
        beating down upon the house-top and in the windows; the stench terrible;
        and hunger gnawing at one's vitals; for, alas! I cannot eat the food set
        before me. My child is looking pale and ill. 'He who entereth here
        leaves hope behind' is written in letters of blood over the portal of
        Lincoln's prison. But even in this bitter cup there is a sweet drop of
        consolation: it is that the gulf is widening between the two races; each
        victim immolated by the tyrant but makes the barrier more impassable.
        That thought sustains me in the dread ordeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28<i>th.</i> - The
        Yankee papers this morning are certainly trying to cover a defeat under
        extravagant boastings. Mr. Stanton is again exhibiting his skill in his
        peculiar line in aid of Mr. Chase's Wall-Street gambling. Have just had
        a telegram from below

        that a battle has been fought at Winchester, where the Yankees were
        defeated with great loss by Stonewall Jackson. This news was brought in
        by some prisoners just arrived; also, that our great and good President
        is in perfect health, the Yankees having reported him in a critical
        state. 'The wish was father to the thought.' May angels guard him, for
        his country's sake!

        Yankee sentinels very humble and conciliatory. Banks states that his

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30<i>th.</i> - A long
        dull day, with tantalising rumours of my being sent to Fort Warren. Wood

        readiness. Alas! my faith in Yankee human nature is long since gone.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, May</i> 31.
        - At two o'clock to-day Wood came in with the announcement that I was to
        start at three o'clock for Baltimore. It being impossible to be ready at
        that hour, the time was extended to five o'clock. There was a terrible
        scene between Wood and the woman Baxley last night; she raved and
        screamed throughout the night. I could not

        sleep, so have a dreadful nervous headache with which to begin my
        journey. I do not pretend to understand the merits of the case. In
        justice I must state how very kind Captain Higgins, Lieutenant Miller,
        and Mr. Wood have been to-day. Captain Higgins carried me throughout the
        prison, to say 'Good-bye' to my companions in captivity. I exhorted them
        all to bear up bravely under their misfortune - not that they needed it,
        for all burned to be free, to share in the glorious struggle now going
        on. God grant that they were, for many a stout arm would strike a blow
        for freedom!
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking leave of
        these kind friends, Captain Higgins introduced Lieutenant ---, who was,
        by order of the War Department, to be the chief of my escort. He had six
        men detailed to accompany him, making quite a military display, dressed
        in full uniform, with sword and carbine in hand. Outside of the prison
        the whole guard were drawn up under arms, besides a mounted guard of
        twelve men, also with swords and carbines. Before entering the carriage
        I turned to the officer and said, 'Sir, ere I advance further, I ask
        you, not as Lincoln's officer, but as a man of honour and a gentleman,
        are your orders from Baltimore to conduct me to a Northern prison, or to
        some point in the Confederacy?' He
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green316"> Page 316</a>
      <p>
        replied, with politeness and promptness, 'On my honour, madam, to
        conduct you to Fortress Monroe, and thence to the Southern Confederacy,
        in proof of which I show you my order for transportation, &amp;c.
        Satisfied on this head, I entered the carriage. The woman Baxley, and
        the one calling herself Mrs. Morris, Mason, &amp;c., were sent at the
        same time. The superintendent who accompanied, and the officer and
        guard, as also the mounted escort, followed the carriage, with carbines
        and drawn swords, to the depôt. Arrived there, a large force was in
        attendance to prevent communication with sympathising friends. These
        precautions, however, failed, for many a word was stealthily whispered,
        and many a hearty 'God bless you!' spoken. A separate car was taken for
        the prisoners and guard. Arriving at Baltimore, the car in which I was
        was kept back until all the passengers had left the depôt - a strong
        military guard being here also in attendance. I was put into a carriage
        with my child, the other prisoners in another, and was driven (with the
        officer inside of the carriage with me, and the guard on the box) to the
        Gilmer House, the officer and guard jealously watching to prevent
        communication. Apartments being prepared, I was taken to mine. Sentinels
        were stationed at the different
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green317"> Page 317</a>
      <p>
        doors to prevent communication, all intercourse being prohibited. My
        name had been put in the register. The detective Baker, by order of
        General Dix, had it erased, as they did not wish it known that I was in
        that rebel city.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Dix, being
        telegraphed to go to Washington, left early on Sunday morning;
        consequently Mr. Wood took upon himself to relax the rigorous
        'interdict,' and allowed me to see some kind and sympathising friends;
        and my soul expanded once more under the genial influences of a kindred
        race.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At five o'clock on the
        afternoon of Sunday, June 1, the officer of the guard announced that all
        was in readiness to depart for the boat, which had been detained for the
        purpose of conveying me to Fortress Monroe. A large number of persons
        had by this assembled to offer congratulations. The good news had
        reached <i>our friends</i> that a battle had been fought, and that
        skirmishing was still going on, at Seven Pines, near Richmond, in which
        we had defeated the Yankees with heavy loss. This, of course, was the
        brightest augury that could have greeted me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'good-bye' was
        spoken, and many friends followed to the boat. Upon reaching it a guard
        was stationed around, who, with bayonet in hand, repulsed
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green318"> Page 318</a>
      <p>
        every attempt of any but the prisoners to go on board, such being the
        orders. General Dix and suite being expected, the boat was detained for
        them several hours. During all that time, an eager crowd surrounded the
        approaches to the wharf, and, regardless of the angry and rude repulse
        of the military, continued to assemble. So far as the eye could reach
        handkerchiefs were waving, and the tearful eye and hearty 'God bless
        you!' which responded from all sides, regardless of the bayonets of the
        tyrant, told that the hearts of the people of Maryland, however
        repressed and down-trodden, beat in unison with their brethren of the
        South.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Dix arriving
        about eight o'clock, the signal was given to weigh anchor, and I was
        fairly en route for the capital of the Confederacy. General Dix, after a
        few moments, came to pay his respects to me, and in very kind terms
        expressed his congratulations, &amp;c. I was deeply chagrined at the
        rude conduct of the<i> two women</i> towards General Dix, and rebuked it
        by my manner as well as I could. The boat reached the wharf at Fortress
        Monroe at an early hour on the morning of June 2. General Dix and suite
        went ashore here for the purpose of relieving General Wool, who had made
        himself so obnoxious to the people of Norfolk and its
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green319"> Page 319</a>
      <p>
        vicinity, on account of his harshness and cruelty, that the Abolition
        Government deemed it politic to replace him by one whose kind and
        conciliatory conduct had been deeply appreciated by the people of
        Baltimore. I regretted the exchange, for I did not wish the bitter pill
        of national degradation to be sugar-coated. The fiercer the rule, the
        more certain the retribution to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No orders had been given
        to provide refreshments, but the captain of the boat, who was a most
        gentlemanly person, prepared at his own cost a most ample luncheon,
        together with some iced champagne; and I had the pleasure of proposing
        the health of President Davis and the success of the Confederate cause
        under the bristling guns of the enemy, and my toast drunk by all
        present, several visitors having been added to the number on board. The
        officer of the guard behaved very well, and discreetly got out of
        hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile an
        aide-de-camp of General Wool, accompanied by the Provost-Marshal,
        Colonel Jones, came on board to make arrangements for forwarding me on
        my journey. Colonel Jones asked me where I wished to go. I replied, 'To
        the capital of the Confederacy, wherever that might be.' He told me that
        it was still Richmond - asserting that that
      </p>

      <a name="green320"> Page 320</a>
      <p>
        city had not fallen, as had been published at the North, but that it
        would be in their hands before I got there. I said I would take the
        chances, and only asked that no time might be lost. Colonel Gay fell
        into conversation with me, and I gleaned some very interesting facts
        from him. He was in a short time summoned away, and, I was told, put
        under arrest, <i>for having been too communicative.</i> About four
        o'clock in the afternoon I was called upon to be in readiness to go on
        board of the boat which had been chartered to take me to City Point, and
        marched through the broiling sun to the place where she lay. Some time
        after the boat got under way, but made no great progress. Night coming
        on, and the river (the James River) being difficult of navigation, the
        buoys having all been taken up by our people, the captain was afraid of
        running aground, so lay to until daylight. On the morning of the 3rd,
        about seven o'clock, we came in sight of the glorious achievements of
        the Virginia, the wreck of the Congress and other vessels destroyed by
        her. The Monitor lay down the stream at a short distance, and I had a
        good view of the low black ugly thing. At this point the captain again
        anchored, and an officer went off in a small boat to get instructions
        from the commander of the Monitor for landing me.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green321"> Page 321</a>
      <p>
        After an absence which seemed endless, a large-sized boat put off from
        her, in which I, with the other prisoners, embarked, and were taken
        alongside of the Monitor, an officer from that boat coming on board, in
        command of the party to City Point. I was under intense excitement, for,
        after nearly ten weary months of imprisonment, I was in sight of the
        promised land. In a short time we reached the shore, and my foot pressed
        the sacred soil. I had worn on my shoulders from Fortress Monroe, in the
        folds of a shawl, a large battle-flag, which had been made by myself and
        other prisoners whilst in prison for General Beauregard. I felt strongly
        tempted to unfold it and cast it to the breeze, as a parting defiance to
        the Yankees; but I remembered that the same means might be useful again.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was received by
        Colonel Ash and other Confederate officers, whose bold and soldierly
        bearing contrasted most strikingly with the Vandal race whom I had seen,
        I hope, for the last time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was conducted under
        escort of those gentlemen to Petersburg, where I was received with every
        demonstration of kindness and respect. General Ransom, the Commander of
        the Department, came to call upon me, and took charge of the
        arrangements for my departure to Richmond, and sent
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green322"> Page 322</a>
      <p>
        Colonel Ash to escort me. I arrived in Richmond on the morning of the
        4th, and was taken to the best hotel in the place, the Ballard House,
        where rooms had been prepared for me. General Winder, the Commandant of
        Richmond, came immediately to call upon me, so as to dispense with the
        usual formality of my reporting to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening after my
        arrival our President did me the honour to call upon me, and his words
        of greeting, 'But for you there would have been no battle of Bull Run,'
        repaid me for all that I had endured, even though it had been magnified
        tenfold. And I shall ever remember that as the proudest moment of my
        whole life, to have received the tribute of praise from him who stands
        as the apostle of our country's liberty in the eyes of the civilised
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would swell these
        pages far beyond my prescribed limits if I were to enter upon a
        description of the exciting scenes which met my eye on my arrival at
        Richmond. All was warlike preparation and stern defiance and resistance
        to the invader. The result of the battles before Richmond is well known,
        and exhibits to the world the capabilities of a people in the defence of
        their rights.

        of numbers, &amp;c., in his favour, who flaunted his banner before our
        capital, threatening us with annihilation, was defeated and driven for
        shelter behind his gunboats. The scene of their insolent triumph was
        changed into a charnel-house, with the very air rank and pestiferous
        with the effluvia from their half-decomposed bodies, where they lay as a
        warning monument to tyrants for all future time. This is a fruitful
        theme for abler pens than mine.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My intention is, in the
        succeeding chapter, to touch upon the causes which have effected the
        disruption of the Federal compact between North and South, as an
        exemplification of the evil consequences which flow from usurpation.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place,
        slavery, although the occasion, was not the producing cause of the
        dissolution. The cord which bound the sections together was
      </p>

      <p>
        strained beyond its strength, and, of course, snapped at the point where
        the fretting of the strands was greatest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contest on the part
        of the North was for supreme control, especially in relation to the<i>
          fiscal action</i
        >
        of the Government. This object could not be fully attained by a mere<i>
          numerical majority. A majority of States was also necessary.</i
        >
        To secure <i>this majority,</i> and thus complete the
        <i>political <font color="red">ascendency</font></i> the North, the
        policy of <i>'no more Slave States'</i> was formally set forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A political party was
        formed, whose sole principle was the exclusion of slavery from the
        territories. There was no moral sentiment involved in this. It did not
        alter the
        <i>status</i> of slavery. It made not a human being free; nor did it
        propose to do so. 'Sir,' said Mr. Webster in the Senate, 'this is not a
        moral question: it is a question of political power.' Lord Russell has
        more recently corroborated this bold assertion, by saying, that
        <i
          >'this was a struggle on one side for supremacy, and on the other for
          independence.'</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the
        Southern States, struggling for equality, and seeking to maintain the
        equilibrium of the Government, insisted upon the rights of their
        citizens to enter and live in the new territories upon
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green326"> Page 326</a>
      <p>
        terms of equality with the men north of Mason and Dixon's line. They
        contended for the right of extending their social institutions, not to
        propagate slavery - not to make a single human being a slave that would
        otherwise be free - but simply to preserve the equilibrium of power
        between the two sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the
        anti-slavery fanaticism was brought to bear; and it is also true that
        there followed a rancorous agitation which divided churches, rent
        asunder political parties, diminished and embittered the intercourse of
        society, and unfitted Congress for the performance of its constitutional
        duties, and resulted in the estrangement of the Southern people from
        their Northern connection. But this estrangement was not an active or
        stimulating motive, and manifested itself rather in the want of any
        general anxiety to restrain the movement for disunion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally unfounded is the
        allegation that the secession of the South originated in the
        exasperation of a defeated party, and hostility to the successful
        candidate. The personal character of Mr. Lincoln, and his political
        opinions (except so far as they represented that 'armed doctrine' which
        menaced the equality of the Southern States, and was contrived
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green327"> Page 327</a>
      <p>
        for their oppression and degradation), had not formed with the Southern
        people the subject of either interest or enquiry. They knew that there
        were in the Constitution important checks which would furnish them with
        ample means of protecting themselves against the hostile purposes of the
        existing incumbent, and even of repairing such violations of the
        fundamental law as might during his term of service be beyond their
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stern protest of the
        Southern people, free from all party violence and recklessness,
        indicated a thorough knowledge of the extent and depth of the grievances
        inflicted upon them; and subsequent events have proved that they had
        both wisdom and heroism adequate to evolve the proper remedy, and firmly
        to apply it. They regarded it as the first step towards the overthrow of
        American representative liberty. Even considering the Northern theory of
        government to be true - viz. that the Union was one consolidated
        Republic - it is essential that the central authority derive its powers
        and draw its force from all the parts of the entire nation, so that by
        their reciprocal independence they can counteract the tendency of any
        one part to usurp the sovereignty of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the North assumed
        the government over the
      </p>
      <hr />
      <a name="green328"> Page 328</a>
      <p>
        South, as its own exclusive possession, it sought to establish an
        unmitigated tyranny. For liberty, true civil liberty, cannot exist where
        <i>rights</i> are on one side of a geographical line, and the
        <i>power</i> on the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southern people are
        law-abiding, long-suffering, tenacious in their attachments, and opposed
        even to a fault to innovations; but where the alternative was presented
        of an overthrow of their political liberty, or a change in their Federal
        relations, they did not hesitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove that they were
        fully justified, I will cite the testimony of ex-President Fillmore, a
        Northern statesman, never charged with Southern or proslavery
        sympathies: -
      </p>

      <a name="green329"> Page 329</a>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After inveighing with
        great earnestness against a course so monstrous, he adds: - 'These are
        serious but practical questions, and in order to appreciate them fully,
        it is only necessary to turn the tables upon ourselves. Suppose that the
        South, having a majority of the electoral votes, should declare that
        they would only have slaveholders for Presidents, and should elect such
        by their exclusive suffrages to rule over us at the North.
        <i>Do you think that we would submit to it? </i>(Cries of "No, never!")
        <i
          >No, not for a moment. And do you believe that our Southern brethren
          are less sensitive upon this subject than you, or less jealous of
          their rights? </i
        >If you do, let me tell you that you are mistaken. And, therefore, you
        must see that, if this sectional party succeeds, it leads inevitably to
        the destruction of this beautiful fabric reared by our forefathers,
        consolidated by their blood, and bequeathed to us as a priceless
        blessing.'
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call especial
        attention to the following views, not only on account of their intrinsic
        value, but from the notoriety which attaches to the author as the
        <i>interested advocate</i> of the Lincoln Government. I doubt if the
        annals of revolution furnish a more flagrant instance of political
        apostasy. But I will appeal from 'Philip drunk to Philip sober.'

          <div3 type="subsection"
            >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my object is to
            give a simple record of events, I do not propose to attempt the
            vindication of the Institution which has been the fruitful theme of
            reproach and denunciation amongst the opponents of Southern
            independence.</div3
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English writers
          who discuss this subject seem to confine themselves to the
          consideration of the abstract principle of slavery, and entirely
          overlook the facts and circumstances of the case. Few institutions of
          government or society could stand such a test.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the question were
          simply whether it would not be better for the South to have four
          millions of intelligent, industrious, and valiant freemen in the place
          of four millions of African slaves, it would be neither so delicate
          nor difficult of solution. But the question which taxes the practical
          statesmanship and philanthropy of the Southern people is of a far
          graver character. It is this. Two races - one civilised, the other
          barbarous - being locally intermingled, what does the good of society
          require - the
        </p>
        <hr />
        <a name="green349"> Page 349</a>
        <p>
          freedom or servitude of the barbarous race? The South believe that the
          freedom of the blacks, under such circumstances, would result
          certainly in their final extermination, and that servitude is best
          adapted to their intellectual and moral condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The antagonism of race
          is as fixed and immutable as any other law of nature, and has been
          exemplified in the history of the world wherever the opposing elements
          have come in conflict. The North American Indians were a race of
          warriors, with far higher intellectual capabilities than the negro,
          and not inheriting that
          <i>unutterable prejudice</i> against <i>amalgamation</i> which exists
          against the negro. But at the same time, there being no motive of
          interest in the superior race to protect them, they have been driven
          from their hunting-grounds, which at no distant period embraced half
          of the North American continent, to a few acres on the confines of
          civilisation, which they inhabit by the sufferance of the dominant
          race.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of the
          usages of civilisation in favour of this law of race, I can cite an
          example which comes within my own immediate knowledge, and which is
          uninfluenced by the fanaticism and demagogism which attach to the
          negro question. In California, there are between sixty and seventy
        </p>
        <hr />
        <a name="green350"> Page 350</a>
        <p>
          thousand Chinese, being about one-seventh of the whole population.
          They are a civilised, industrious, and most useful people. Yet they
          cannot be naturalised, cannot bear witness in court, cannot intermarry
          with the white race, or exercise a single right of citizenship, except
          <i>pay taxes.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wisdom of the
          policy of the South in regard to this<i> inherited responsibility</i>
          is abundantly vindicated by the very aspect which the Institution of
          Slavery now presents to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thirty years its
          enemies have unceasingly assailed it by every agency of mind and
          heart. The pulpit, the press, hostile legislation, secret societies,
          armed robbers, have all been employed to excite discontent and
          insurrection in the Southern States.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their agitations have
          split the aspiring structure of the American Government from 'turret
          to foundation-stone.' They have caused the most bloody and implacable
          war known to modern history; and yet the
          <i>Institution of Slavery</i> survives it all, firm and unimpaired.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere on earth, not
          even in happy England, rejoicing in peace, does there exist between
          the various classes of society such harmony, such sympathy, as the
          South exhibits in the midst of her trials. Surely the condition of
          such a social commonwealth
        </p>
        <hr />
        <a name="green351"> Page 351</a>
        <p>
          must rest upon the solid foundation which supports all civil
          institutions - the good of the whole State.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are asked, 'Do
          not your statutes withhold any legal enforcement to the marriage
          relations amongst slaves?' I beg my readers to have this objection
          properly stated. It should be borne in mind that we have not taken
          from them any rights which they had ever recognised or conferred among
          themselves. The race, as we found it, was destitute of any such
          institution, or even the knowledge of it. Nevertheless, it is true
          that our laws are justly chargeable with the reproach of not having
          secured to them this blessing of civilisation. But what the law has
          failed to do, religion and usage have effected. The institution of
          marriage does exist among slaves, and is encouraged and protected by
          their owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statesmen of the
          South, when free from the embarrassment of their fanatical enemies,
          should lose no time in protecting all the domestic ties by laws
          forbidding the separation of families. That such legislation is not
          inconsistent with the Institution is proved by the fact that some of
          the South-Western States have long since removed this evil by
          statutory enactments.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In point of fact,
          there is a greater amount of separation
        </p>
        <hr />
        <a name="green352"> Page 352</a>
        <p>
          in families and rending of domestic ties during one year in the United
          Kingdom of England, Scotland, and Ireland, than takes place in ten
          years among the negroes of the South.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South, however,
          does not feel herself called upon to vindicate this or any other of
          her institutions before the bar of the world; and, I think, English
          philanthropists may safely leave to Southern statesmen the removal of
          such abuses as cling to this in common with all other human
          institutions. Ameliorations will continue to be adopted as this class
          of Southern society increases in its fitness to receive and enjoy
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime I
          commend to the Abolition agitators of Great Britain the policy in
          which their puissant Government has taken refuge - Non-intervention.
