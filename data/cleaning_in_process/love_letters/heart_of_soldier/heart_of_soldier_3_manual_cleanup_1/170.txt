^T^HE long struggle between the states
J- laas noiv drawing to a close. The
South, depleted in men and resources,
awaited in grim despair the failure of its
hopes. Gloom and disappointment settled
down upon all, men and officers alike, but
to General Pickett there came a gleam of
happiness in the birth of his son. The
event was one that was hailed with re-
joicing on both sides of the battle lines â€”
for the contending armies luere but paces
apart. Grant and his staff sent a birth-
day greeting to the "Little General," as
the boy was dubbed immediately, and
though the armies met again in conflict
the incident served to lessen the feeling
that had existed between them. A brief
nine months later, Pickett wrote: "Peace
is born."
