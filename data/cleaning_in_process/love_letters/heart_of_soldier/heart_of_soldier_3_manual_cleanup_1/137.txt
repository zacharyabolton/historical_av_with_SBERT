The Potomac was so swollen by the rains
which began on the fourth and still continue,
that it was impossible to cross it at any of the
neighboring fords. A rope ferry, the only

centuries when I am on my way to you — to
you.
Jackerie has waited so long for my post-
script that he has gone to sleep and I have
now not time to write it, but you will know
that the most important thing is in the P. S.
and this is love, — the love of
Your adoring
Soldier.
