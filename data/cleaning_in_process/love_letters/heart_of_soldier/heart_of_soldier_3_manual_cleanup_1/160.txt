pleased Marse Robert that he yesterday had
published the inclosed notice, which I send
you that you may be reminded of my glorious,
fearless men who yet survived that awful third
of July where so many of their comrades were
left to sleep. The line of breastworks which
they took and to which Marse Robert refers in
the notice inclosed is most important, as the
main line of defense between Richmond and
Petersburg and opposing any advance of the
enemy upon the peninsula of Bermuda Hun-
dred.
Now my darling sees why I am thinking of
that 1 6th of May. It was because she, though
Marse Robert doesn't know it, comes in for
a share of his praise. I am thinking of you
every minute and wish that I could ride in, if
only for an hour between sundown and mid-
night, to see you; but, to use Mr. Lincoln's
expressive words, Grant is so "infernally
interruptious" that I am afraid to take the
risk.
Now, my strayed angel of the skies, don't
be disappointed. I love you. Good night.
May all blessings bless you, all sunshine shine
for you, all angels guard you, all that is good
