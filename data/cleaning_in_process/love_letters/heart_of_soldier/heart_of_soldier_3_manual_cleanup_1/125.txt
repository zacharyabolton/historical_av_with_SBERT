my own soldier boys. My first command to
them was to go and enjoy themselves the best
they could, and they have obeyed my order.
To-day a Dutchman and two of his comrades
came up and told me that they were lost and
besought me to help them find their comrades.
They had been with my men and were sepa-
rated from their own comrades. So I sent old
Floyd off on St. Paul to find out where they
belonged and deliver them.
This is too gloomy and too poor a letter for
so beautiful a sweetheart, but it seems sacri-
legious, almost, to say I love you, with the
hearts that are stilled to love on the field of
battle.
Your Soldier.
