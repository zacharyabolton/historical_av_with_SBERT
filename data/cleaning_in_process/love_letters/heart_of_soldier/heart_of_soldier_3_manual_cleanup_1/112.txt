All that makes life dear is the thought of
seeing you and being with you. And oh, what
an eternity it seems since I said good night!
Oh, my darling, love me, pray for me, hold
me in your thoughts, keep me in your heart!
Our whole army is now in Pennsylvania,
north of the river. There were rumors that
Richmond was threatened from all sides —
Dix from Old Point, Getty from Hanover,
Keyes from Bottom's Bridge, and so on — and
that we might be recalled. It turned out to
be Munchausen, and we are still to march for-
ward. Every tramp — tramp — tramp is a
thought — thought — thought of my darling,
every halt a blessing invoked, every command
a loving caress; and the thought of you and
prayer for you make me strong, make me bet-
ter, give me courage, give me faith. Now,
my dearest, let my soul speak to yours. Lis-
ten — listen — listen! You hear — I am an-
swered.
Forever and ever,
Your Soldier.
