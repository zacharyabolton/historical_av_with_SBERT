WAS my letter of yesterday strenuous?
Well, it was a strenuous day, full of
rumors and contradictions. And yet in spite
of it I managed to sandwich in between the
shelling and the movement of the fleet and
the distinguished visitors the ever new and
true story of my love. But I had only time
to make the bare announcement at the close of
that letter that Butler had burned our home
the day before. If it had been burned in line
of battle, it would have been all right; but it
was not. It was burned by Butler at a great
expense to the Government and in revenge
for having been outgeneraled by a little hand-
ful of my men at Petersburg and for Grant's
telegram to Mr. Lincoln, saying, "Pickett has
bottled up Butler at Petersburg."
Mr. Sims, who has been our overseer ever
since I can remember, came up from Turkey
