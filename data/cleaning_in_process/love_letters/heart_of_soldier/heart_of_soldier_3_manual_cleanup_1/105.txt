bowed to her, saluted her flag and then turned,
facing the men who felt and saw my unspoken
order. And don't you know that they were
all Virginians and didn't forget if, and that
almost every man lifted his cap and cheered
the little maiden who, though she kept on wav-
ing her flag, ceased calling us traitors, till
letting it drop in front of her she cried out:
"Oh, I wish — I wish I had a rebel flag; I'd
wave that, too."
The picture of that little girl in the vine-
covered porch, beneath the purple morning
glories with their closed lips and bowed heads
waiting and saving their prettiness and bloom
for the coming morn — of course, I thought of
you, my darling. For the time, that little
Greencastle Yankee girl with her beloved flag
was my own little promised-to-be-wife, receiv-
ing from her Soldier and her Soldier's soldiers
the reverence and homage due her.
We left the little girl standing there with the
flag gathered up in her arms, as if too sacred
to be waved now that even the enemy had done
it reverence. As ever,
Your Soldier.
