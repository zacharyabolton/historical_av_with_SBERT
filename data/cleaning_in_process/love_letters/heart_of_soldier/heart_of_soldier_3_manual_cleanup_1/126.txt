Containing Further Details of the Battle
I AM enclosing you a copy of General Lee's
official letter of July 9th, in answer to
mine of the 8th, the same day on which I
wrote you (who deserved something brighter)
that ghostly, woeful letter.
General Lee's letter has been published to
the division in general orders and received
with appreciative satisfaction. The soldiers,
one and all, love and honor Lee, and his sym-
pathy and praise are always very dear to them.
Just after the order was published I heard one
of the men, rather rough and uncouth and not,
as are most of the men, to the manner born,
say, as he wiped away the tears with the back
of his hand, "Dag-gone him, dag-gone him,
dag-gone his old soul, I'm blamed ef I
wouldn't be dag-gone willin' to go right
through it all and be killed again with them
others to hear Marse Robert, dag-gone him,
