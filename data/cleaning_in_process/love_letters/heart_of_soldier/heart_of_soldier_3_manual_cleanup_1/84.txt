From the Field of Fredericksburg
HERE we are, my darling, at Fredericks-
burg, on the south side of the Rappahan-
nock, half-way between Richmond and Wash-
ington, fortified for us by the hand of the
Great Father.
I penciled you a note by old Jackerie ^ on the
1 2th from the foot of the Hills between Hazel
Run and the Telegraph Road. In it I sent
a hyacinth — given me by a pretty lady who
came out with beaten biscuit — and some un-
written and written messages from Old Peter
and Old Jack, Hood, Ewell, Stuart, and your
"brothers," to the "someone" to whom I was
writing.
My division, nine thousand strong, is in fine
shape. It was on the field of battle, as a divi-
sion, for the first time yesterday, though only
one brigade, Kemper's, was actively engaged.
