disabilities he defines as inefficiency and in-
dications of a lack of patriotism. Suffering
from insomnia, he often uses his men as a seda-
tive, and when he can't sleep calls them out,
marches them out a few miles ; then marches

lantry, because it is their duty to be gallant
and they do not deserve credit for doing their
duty. Well, my own darling, I only pray that
God may spare him to us to see us through.
If General Lee had Grant's resources he would
soon end the war ; but Old Jack can do it with-
out resources.
Bless your heart, here I am talking of these
old war-horses to my flower queen. Well, she
knows how entirely I love her and how I have
left in her keeping my soul's all.
Lovingly and faithfully.
Your Soldier.
