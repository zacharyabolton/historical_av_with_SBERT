as you prettily put it, "We've had glory
enough, and war enough, with its hardships
and separations and dangers, and now we just
want each other forever and forevermore."
Yes, my darling, we want each other and a
home, with a spiked fence around it and a key;
to the road gate, for us alone, — just us, for-
ever and forevermore.
My friends all think that I am making a
great mistake in refusing this magnanimous
offer of the Khedive. They hold that I am
sacrificing my future and signing the death-
warrant to ambition and success. General
Alexander has accepted and will take com-
mand of the Egyptian armies ; Egypt could not
have a finer officer. Last night at the farewell
dinner the Khedive's last telegram was handed
to the Commissioner — "Forward Pickett at
any cost." It was a most flattering compli-
ment and I have asked permission to keep it
for our boy. "The boy might think you were
a brand of powder or a keg of nails," said
Ingalls, who, by the way, is disgusted at my
refusal. But, my beautiful wife, he has not
you; and love such as yours is worth all the
gold and glory of the universe.
