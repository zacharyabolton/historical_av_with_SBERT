men, checking them but for a moment. But
in that one moment we, by the speed of our
horses, made our escape. Ah, my darling, the
sacrifice of this little band of men is like unto
that which was made at Calvary.
It is finished! Ah, my beloved division!
Thousands of them have gone to their eternal
home, having given up their lives for the cause
they knew to be just. The others, alas, heart-
broken, crushed in spirit, are left to mourn its
loss. Well, it is practically all over now.
We have poured out our blood and suffered
untold hardships and privations all in vain.
And now, well, / must not forget, either, that
God reigns. Life is given us for the perform-
ance of duty, and duty performed is happi-
ness.
It is finished â€” the suffering, the horrors, the
anguish of these last hours of struggle. The
glorious gift of your love will help me to bear
the memory of them. In this midnight hour
I feel the caressing blessing of your pure
spirit as it mingles with mine. Peace is born.
From now forever only
Your Soldier.
