upon Returning from a Ride With Marse
Robert
I HAVE but a few moments since, my
pretty one, returned from a ride with the
Tyee up one hill and down the other. The
enemy occupied Dutch Gap last evening.
This is higher up the river than I am and I
had expected the Navy to take care of our rear
but they have allowed them to come in, and
now I have to stretch out my India rubber
division.
Well, my pet, I have to do it. The General
did not seem in a remarkably good humor —
with the news from Mobile and Bradley,
Johnson in the valley, and this impudence of
the Yankees in crawling up behind us.
I am so glad, my own, that you are better —
thank the good God for it. Blair says you
must not keep the baby in your arms so much,
that you are acting mother and nurse both.
