pronounced it, with his German accent,
"bray," and that reminded me of a story, and
instead of having my thoughts and my heart
set upon his beautiful prayer as I should have
— miserable sinner that I w^as — I began think-
ing of Tom August, v^^ho said that one Sunday
someone meeting him coming out of Old St.
Paul's asked him v^hat w^as the matter. He
replied, "Oh, nothing. I'm not a jackass and
I'm not going to bray, and old Doctor Minne-
gerode not only insists that I, but that his
v^^hole congregation, shall 'bray.' I, for one,
will not do it and I don't want to make a row
about it; so I came out. I wonder what the
efifect would be if we took him literally and
didairbray'?"
Now, my darling, forgive this foolish story.
I learned to like story-telling, listening as a
boy to the best story-teller in the .world, Mr.
Lincoln.
Even the bird knows you are not coming
to-day, for he doesn't sing. I shall hold you
to the last line of your sweet note, which says,
"I'll come to you, my Soldier, before the
flowers die." When Bob asked me, "Is Miss
Sallie comin' dis ebenin' er in de mornin'?"
