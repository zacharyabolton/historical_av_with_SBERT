all that is good come near to you. Heaven
will help me to be ever helpful to you and
will bless me to bless you. If you knew how
every hour I kneel at your altar, if you could
hear the prayers I offer to you and to our
Heavenly Father for you, if you knew the in-
cessant thought and longing and desire to
make you blessed, you would know how much
your answer will mean to me and how, while
I plead, I am held back by a reverence and a
sensitive adoration for you. For, my Sally,
you are my goddess and I am only
Your devoted.
Soldier.
