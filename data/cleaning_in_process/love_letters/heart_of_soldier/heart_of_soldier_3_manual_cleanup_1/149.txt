George, ef you cyan't eat dese hyacinfses ner

Mrs. Stratton and Mrs. Johnson sent out
large hampers, too, to us. They came just
after we had finished with your baskets, and
we passed them on to others.
And now, my darling, what on earth did you
mean by saying, ''Never mind," as you said
good-by and rode away yesterday. It troubled
me all night. I wanted to follow after you and
ask you what you meant, but couldn't. I
would have jumped on Lucy and ridden in to
Petersburg and found out if it had been pos-
sible for me to leave. I was so troubled about
it that I was almost tempted to come in any-
how. For the life of me, little one, I couldn't
think of any reason why you should say,
"Never mind," to me. Were you aggrieved
because your blundering old Soldier told you
there was no necessity for your coming out to
bring the dispatches, any longer; that, thank
heaven, the recruits and reenforcements were
coming in now, and that we could manage
all right? I did not mean to hurl you, dear.
