him. He was, he is and he will always be,
even were his pistol pointed at my heart, my
dear, loved friend. May God bless him and
spare his life. You, my darling, may not be
in sympathy with this feeling, for I know you
see "no good in Nazareth." Forgive me for
feeling differently from you, little one, and
please don't love me any the less. You cannot
understand the entente cordiale between us
"old fellows."
Faithfully,
Your Soldier.
