I answered, "She does not mention any set
time, Bob. She only says she'll come before
the flowers die." "De flowers ain't waxinated
flowers, is dey, Marse George?" he asked.
"Den if dey ain't waxinated 'twon't be long fo'
she is here."
When I asked him to hold the paper while
I wrote, he humbly, beseechingly asked,
"Please, Suh, Marse George, ef hit ain't axin'
too much, when you comes ter writin' er dem
dar words lak love en honey en darlin', er any
er dem poetry rhymes 'bout roses red en
violets blue, won't you please, Suh, show 'em
ter me?" I didn't promise him, my sweet-
heart. I only said, "Hold that paper steady,
Sir, and don't let it slip." But when I did
call you "darling" or tell you I loved you, I
felt so guilty that the rascal knew it and
grinned.
