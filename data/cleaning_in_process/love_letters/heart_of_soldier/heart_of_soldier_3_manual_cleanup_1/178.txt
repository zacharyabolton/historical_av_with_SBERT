Please listen to the doctor this time, and to
your husband's pleading. Blair says that his
indisposition is nothing but the colic, and that
you must not make yourself uneasy about the
little fellow. You must make Lucinda nurse
him more.
I send you a chicken, a cup of salt, likewise
an apple â€” one single one. Your friend, Miss
Gamble, radiant with a white frock and smiles,
sent it to me {didn't give it) with her compli-
ments last night.
Bye-bye, Sweet One.
Ever your own
Soldier.
