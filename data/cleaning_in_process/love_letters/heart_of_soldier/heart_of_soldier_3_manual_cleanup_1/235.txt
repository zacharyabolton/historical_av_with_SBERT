him to believe — to look up and trust. Come,
now — take your spelling book and let him
teach you the Word.
How tenderly, loyally, reverently I do love
you, my wife, and how I want to spare you
every hurt. I'll be starting back when you get
this. Love to our boy and tell him to look
after his "dear mother" for his "dear father,"
that he is our little man and has got double
duty to do from now on. Ask him to think
about what he wants for his birthday. Any-
thing but a gun he can have.
Think, my darling, nearly eleven years of
perfect bliss — such happiness as man never
had. God show me how to be worthy of such
a wife.
The horses are at the door, my little one —
I must say a Dios.
Lovingly and forever and ever,
Your Soldier.
