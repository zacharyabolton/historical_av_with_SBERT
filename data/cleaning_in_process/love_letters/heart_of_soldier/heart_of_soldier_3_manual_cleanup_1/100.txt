their names and are reported present, or for
those whose spirit voices, just born, have not
yet gained the power to reach the ear of the
orderly and who are reported dead, even
though they, too, answer, "Here"? For, my
darling, there is no death, and you must feel
— must know — now and always, that whether
here or there, at the roll-call your Soldier
answers, "Here."
Now, adieu, my beloved. Close your
brown eyes and feel my arms around you, for
I am holding you close — oh, so close!
Forever your
Soldier.
