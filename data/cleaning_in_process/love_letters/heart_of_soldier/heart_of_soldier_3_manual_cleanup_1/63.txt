So, my Sally, if you will forgive your
Soldier for telling this old-time story and let
him say that he does not approve of fighting
in the way in which fights, he will bid
you good-by and eat his breakfast, which the
cook says is getting cold. Will you come, my
darling, and have some coffee with your
Soldier? It is some we captured, and is real
coffee.
Come! The tin cup is clean and shining;
but the corn-bread is greasy and smoked.
And the bacon â€” that is greasy, too, but it is
good and tastes all right, if it will only hold
out till our Stars and Bars wave over the land
of the free and the home of the brave, and
we have our own home. Nevermore we'll
hear of wars, but only love and life with its
eternal joys.
Your Own Soldier.
