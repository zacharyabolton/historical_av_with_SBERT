''Miss Sallie, Marse George, de Mistis,
done en sont you all dese yer endoubled
hyacinfs. En I axed her huccome she sont
'em; but she didn't say. So ef you all don't
lak 'em you-all mus' 'scuse her fer it en put
all de blame 'pon me. En anyhow, Marse
George, ef you cyan't eat dese hyacinfses ner
w'ar 'em ner shoot de Yankees wid' em, dey
suttinly does smell good and dey she' is
pretty."

"Yes, Suh, Marse George, 'course de mistis
is done en writ a letter er a answer er sumpin' ;
but ef she did done it, den I mus' er forgot
ter fotch it, bein' ez I wuz in sich a hurry ter
git yere in time dis mornin' wid de baskets, en
startin' befo' daybre'k. En den dis ebenin' a
gettin' de basket en papers en milk en things
ready in sich a hurry agin, I mus' er forgot de
letter agin."

"You know, Marse George," he began, "po'
Robert, Marse Jefferson Davis' mos' betrusted
servant, is done en bruck out thick all ober wid
de smallpox, en dar ain' no tellin' how many
er de President's friends en 'quaintances po'
Robert is done en kernockulated wid it, kaze
po' Robert wuz moughty sociable and
familious wid all de President's friends. I
suttinly hopes dat you en Gen'l Lee en Gen'l
Heth is gwine ter 'scape. I wuz so upsot,
Marse George, by dis news 'bout po' Robert
dat I couldn't sleep, en I got out behime de
tent en listened ter de officers a talkin' wid
dar moufs en gesticulatin' 'bout de way t'ings
wuz gwine.
'^Some er 'em said how ef Marse Albert
Sydney Johnston hadn't been kilt at Shiloh,
en ef Marse Joe Johnston hadn't been
wounded at Seben Pines, en ef you had been
s'ported at Gettysburg, dat t'ings wouldn't be
lak dey wuz now. Den one er de officers say,
'Yes — yes, en ef all er dem folks down dar in
New 'Leans dat commit suicide wid darse'fs,
'count er ole Butler's pusecution en hangin's
en yuther devilments, had er kilt him fust fo'
dey kilt deyse'fs dey'd er had sumpin ter die
fer, en de ole rascal wouldn't be down here
now adiggin' dis Dutch-Gap-Canal en givin
ev'body ague en fever turnin' up de earfl'
Den one er de preacher officers say, Well, my
frien's, de trouble is, we all don' pray enough!'
Marse Charley spuck up en say, 'Didn't Gen'l
Jackson pray enough fer us all, Colonel?'
Nur one say, *Yes, Charley, but he didn't dust
his knees off when he wuz through. He for-
got dat bein' clean wuz nex' ter being Godli-
some.' Den a nur one say, 'Well, but dar's
ole Gen'l Pemberton en Gen'l Kershaw.
Dey wuz particular wid dar clothes en dey
prayed all right.' Den Gen'l Corse he spuck
up en say, 'Yes, but dey bofe think too much
'bout dar 'pearance. Dey'd begin to dus' en
dus' dar knees fo' dey said, "Amen." En dat
showed dar hearts wan't in dar prayers.'
"En gwine back, Marse George, ter dat
Dutch-Gap-Canal, you know Colonel Mayo's
nigger, Big Joe, en sebenteen mo' er de camp
niggers is done en gone 'cross de river ter
jine de Yankee Army en he'p de res' er dem
Yankee-nigger soldiers ter dig dat canal ditch
dey's diggin' er 'count er all dat extra
money en extra drams en coffee en yuther
extras Gen'l Butler promise ter give 'em.
Now, Marse George, you know dat dat's
projickin' wid de Lord's handy works, en
sumpin mousterious en terrible is gwine ter
happen ter dem niggers. Diggin' dat canal
sho'ly is gwine ag'inst de judgment er de
Lord, fer ef de Lord had er wanted de Jeemes
River ter a jined on ter itse'f He'd a jined it.
He wouldn't a put a little slice er land in be-
twixt. En sho's you're bawn projickin' wid
de Lord's work en unj'inin' whut He's j'ined
tergedder ain' a gwine ter bring dem niggers
no proskerity."

"Oh, Lordy," he howled, "ef you-all teks
my sores 'way fum me I won't hah nuttin' 'tall
ter show ter all de comp'ny, en I won't hab a
single thing ter mek 'em all sorry 'bout, en
nuttin' ter mek 'em gib me no mo' things.
Oh, Lordy, I'd ruther you'd all whop me dan
notter let me hab my sores no mo.' "

Wash in-
sists upon rubbing me with "turkentime en den
puttin' on a hot ingun poultice, en 'pon top er
dat drinkin' a good hot scotch," declaring
"dey'U sho' en mingulate up wid one-an-
nudder en do de business en bre'k up dis
'fluenza dat's got 'session er you, Marse
George. Don't you go projickin' wid doc-
tor's medicines; pills is dang'us en dey ain't
gwine ter oust no 'fluenzas, dey jes' gwine ter
upset en sturbulate de balance er yo' body dat
ain' got de 'fluenza in it en mek dat part sick,
too. Ef Miss Sally wuz here she'd say,
'Wash, you suttinly is right — g'long fetch up
a nice hot scotch en git one fer yo'se'f while
youse down dar gittin' yo Marse George's.
Lord, I knows Miss Sally."

"De Jedge, Marse
George? — De Jedge ain' 'bleeged ter know
nuttin' 't all bout it. Needer him ner needer
Miss Sally, nuther. Dem whar's robbed, en
don' know dey's robbed, ain' robbed, Marse
George, en ain' no wusser off ef dey had dan ef
dey hadn't," she argued — but I was adamant;
her arguments were of no avail. She
**curchied" her thanks for the silver piece I
gave her and left me with the compliment that
I "sho' was one bridegroom-husband — alius
honeymoonin' wid my own queen bee, wedder
wid her er widout her, en dat Miss Sally ought
ter be one proud white lady" — Is she? — bless
her!

Bob, to save me from
answering, said, "De same young lady sont deflowers, Marse Doctor, dat 'broidered dat cape
fer Marse George, en 'broidered dem dar
slippers he's got on, en sont him de 'broidered
stars dat he w'ars on his coat when he w'ars
it; but dat young lady ain't de only est young
lady dat sends Marse George flowers en
things. No, Suh."

Betty, she said, was superior
to her class, however, and showed her consideration by offering Miss Howell part of
the as yet unearned bribe, and assuring her
that '^Ef eber I did git a chance ter tell dem
dar Yankees 'bout dey-all I suttinly aren't
gwine tell 'em none er de awful scand'lus
things I en Mrs. Davis was all de time a doin'
en dat dey all does. No, I am gwine ter mek
de best er hit en leave outn de worse."
