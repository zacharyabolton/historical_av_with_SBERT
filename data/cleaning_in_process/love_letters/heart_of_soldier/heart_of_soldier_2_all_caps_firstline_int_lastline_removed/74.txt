beautiful darling, your soldier is impatient to
return.
Never, never did men, since the world be-
gan, fight like ours. The Duke of Somerset,
who sneeringly laughed when he saw our
ragged, dirty, barefooted soldiers — ^'Mostly
beardless boys," as he said — took off his hat in
reverence when he saw them fight.
Lovingly,
Your Soldier.
July 15, 1862.
