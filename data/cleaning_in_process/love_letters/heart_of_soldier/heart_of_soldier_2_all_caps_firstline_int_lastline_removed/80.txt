to Marse Robert, telling him of his success,
was characteristic in both brevity and diction.
He said, "Through God's mercy Harper's
Ferry and its garrison are to be surrendered."
The seventeenth following is recorded in let-
ters of blood for both armies, and in its wake
came Lincoln's great political victory, prov-
ing the might of the pen, in his Emancipation
Proclamation â€” winning with it the greatest
victory yet for the North. It will behoove us
now to heed well the old story of "The Lark
and the Husbandman," for it will be farewell
to all foreign intervention unless Greek meets
Greek and we fight fire with fire and we, too,
issue an Emancipation Proclamation. I pray
God that the powers that reign will have the
wisdom and foresight to see this in its true
and all-pervading light. It would end the
war, and I should assume as soon as practi-
cable the role of schoolmaster and husband to
the brightest little pupil and the sweetest little
wife in all the world.
Your Soldier.
