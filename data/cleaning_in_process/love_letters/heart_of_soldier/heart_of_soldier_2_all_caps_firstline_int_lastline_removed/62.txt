unusual thing was happening to him. The
next second his feet were bunched up together,
making forty revolutions a minute, the gun
threatening with instant destruction every-
thing within a radius of five miles. The cap-
tain climbed a tree, the sergeant and orderly
following suit. The fat major, too heavy to
climb, rolled over on the ground, alternately
praying to God and cursing the mule. When
the explosion came, the recoil of the gun and
the wild leap of the terrified mule carried
both over the bluff and to the bottom of
the river. The captain, the sergeant and the
poor, crestfallen, discomfited major, with the
mule and the gun to account for, returned to
the fort, soon to be waited on by the Indian
chiefs, who had held a hurried council. The
high chief, bowing his head up and down,
said:
"Injun go home. Injun ver' brave. Injun
love white man. Injun help white man. In-
jun heap use gun, use knife, heap use bow-
arrow; but when white man shoot off whole
jackass, Injun no think right â€” no can under-
stand. Injun no help white man fight that
way. Injun go home."
