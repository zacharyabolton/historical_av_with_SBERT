all that is good come near to you. Heaven
will help me to be ever helpful to you and
will bless me to bless you. If you knew how
every hour I kneel at your altar, if you could
hear the prayers I offer to you and to our
Heavenly Father for you, if you knew the in-
cessant thought and longing and desire to
make you blessed, you would know how much
your answer will mean to me and how, while
I plead, I am held back by a reverence and a
sensitive adoration for you. For, my Sally,
you are my goddess and I am only
Your devoted.
Soldier.
In Camp, April 15, 1863.
Note: To those who recall the rigid system of social
training in which a girl of that period was reared, it will
not seem strange that a maiden, even in war times, could
not seriously contemplate the possibility of leaving home
and being married by the wayside in that desultory and
unstudied fashion. So, though my heart responded to
the call, what could I do but adhere to the social laws,
more formidable than were ever the majestic canons of
the ecclesiasts? My Soldier admitted that I was right,
and we agreed to await a more favorable time. â€” La-
