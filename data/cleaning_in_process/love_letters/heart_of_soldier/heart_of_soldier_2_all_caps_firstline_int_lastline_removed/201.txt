We yielded to an overwhelming force, Sher-
idan's Cavalry alone numbering more than
double my whole command, with Warren's
Infantry Corps to back them.
Ah, my Sally, the triumphs of might are
transient; but the sufferings and crucifixions
for the right can never be forgotten. The
sorrow and song of my glory-crowned division
nears its doxology. May God pity those who
wait at home for the soldier who has reported
to the Great Commander! God pity them as
the days go by and the sad nights follow.
The birds were hushed in the woods when
I started to write, and now one calls to its
mate "Cheer up — cheer up." Let's listen and
obey the birds, my darling. Let's try to cheer
up — cheer up. I remember that Milton said :
"Those who best bear His mild yoke, they
serve Him best." Let's bear and serve Him
best, my darling wife.
Faithfully your
Soldier.
Exeter Mills, April 2, 1865.
