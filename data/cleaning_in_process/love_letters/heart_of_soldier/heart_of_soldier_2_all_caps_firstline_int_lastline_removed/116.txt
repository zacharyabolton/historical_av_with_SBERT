old man," a summons came from Old Peter,
and I immediately rode to the top of the ridge
where he and Marse Robert were making a
reconnaissance of Meade's position. "Great
God!" said Old Peter as I came up. "Look,
General Lee, at the insurmountable difficul-
ties between our line and that of the Yankees
— the steep hills, the tiers of artillery, the
fences, the heavy skirmish line — and then
we'll have to fight our infantry against their
batteries. Look at the ground we'll have to
charge over, nearly a mile of that open ground
there under the rain of their canister and
shrapnel."
"The enemy is there, General Longstreet,
and I am going to strike him," said Marse
Robert in his firm, quiet, determined voice.
About 8 o'clock I rode with them along
our line of prostrate infantry. They had
been told to lie down to prevent attracting
attention, and though they had been forbid-
den to cheer they voluntarily arose and lifted
in reverential adoration their caps to our be-
loved commander as we rode slowly along.
