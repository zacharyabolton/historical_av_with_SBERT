Expedition
TO-DAY I rode on ahead of my division,
stopped for a moment at our old home,
ran into the garden and gathered for my dar-

them one by one, I thought of the dear mother
who had planted them and the sweet bride-
to-be who would receive them, and my heart
went up in gratitude for the great love given
me by both.

the cook and the whole household, in fact,
are busy getting a lunch for me and preparing
to load up my courier and my boy. Bob, with
as many more lunches as they can carry, to be
distributed as far as they will go. My little
sister is making a paper box to hold my lilies
