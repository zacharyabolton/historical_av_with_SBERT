sion and drew off the enemy. Simultaneously
with our movements Colonel R. Taylor Wood
was to take a naval force in small boats, make
a night excursion down the Neuse and attack
the gunboats. The soldiers were all jubilant,
buoyant and hopeful. Everything was propi-
tious ; victory seemed sure. General Bearing's
feint was successful. Hoke and Corse and
Clingman crossed over, taking all the defenses
and outworks in front. Wood's attack was a
complete surprise, capturing a gunboat right
under the guns of the fort; but, alas, the real
attack by Barton was not made. We waited
in deathlike suspense. Hour after hour of
restless anxiety and impatience went by and
yet no sound of a gun — and no message came
to tell me why. The torture and suspense
were unbearable. Newbern was ours — ours
if — Well — hope died out and the dejection
and despair of the men with their hopes
dashed cannot be told.
As ever,
Your Soldier.
