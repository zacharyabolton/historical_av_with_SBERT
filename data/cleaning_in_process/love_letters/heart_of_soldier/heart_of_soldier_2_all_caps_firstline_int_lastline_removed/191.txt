In the Dark Days Before the End
THIS morning at breakfast, my darling
Sally, when you suggested having an
oyster roast for my officers after our confer-
ence to-night, I said that I feared we should
not have enough oysters. Our old hunter,
Gossett, has just brought in a fine large wild
turkey, and with that and the three bushels of
oysters which your uncle sent I think we can
get up a fine supper. Don't you, my marvel
of a housekeeper? I hope you can, and hope,
too, that the good cheer it will provide will
help us to new and encouraging suggestions,
for, as hopeful as I always am, even my heart
is in my boots.
On every side gloom, dissatisfaction and
disappointment seem to have settled over all,
men and officers alike, because of the unsuc-
cessful termination of the Peace Conference
on board the River Queen on the fatal third.
