IV
In Which Are Given Certain Important De-
tails of the Battle of Seven Pines
A VIOLENT storm was raging, flooding
the level ground, as I wrote you last,
followed the next day by one of fire and blood
— the Battle of Seven Pines.
I pray that you accepted the invitation of
your mountain chum, and that your beautiful
eyes and tender heart have been spared the
horrors of war which this battle must have
poured into sad Richmond. Three hundred
and fifty of your Soldier's brigade, 1,700
strong, were killed or wounded, and all fought
as Virginians should, fighting as they did for
the right, for love, honor, home and state —
principles which they had been taught from
the mothers' knees, the schoolroom and the
pulpit.
Under orders from Old Peter,* we marched
^ General Longstreet.
