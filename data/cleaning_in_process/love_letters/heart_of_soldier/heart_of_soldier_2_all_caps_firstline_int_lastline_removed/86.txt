suppose it is — it is a very cruel one. Your
Soldier's heart almost stood still as he watched
those sons of Erin fearlessly rush to their
death. The brilliant assault on Marye's
Heights of their Irish Brigade was beyond
description. Why, my darling, we forgot
they were fighting us, and cheer after cheer
at their fearlessness went up all along our
lines. About fifty of my division sleep their
last sleep at the foot of Marye's Heights.
I can't help feeling sorry for Old Burnside
■' — proud, plucky, hard-headed old dog. I al-
ways liked him, but I loved little Mac,* and it
was a godsend to the Confederacy that he was
relieved.
Oh, my darling, war and its results did not
seem so awful till the love for you came.
Now — now I want to love and bless and help
everything, and there are no foes — no enemies
— just love for you and longing for you.
Your Soldier.
Fredericksburg, Dec. 14, 1862.
1 General McCIellan.
