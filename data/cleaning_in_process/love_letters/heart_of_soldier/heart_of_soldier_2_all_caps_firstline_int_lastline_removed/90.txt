TOURING the period covered by the
jL-J letters in this part the burdens of
the ivar fell heavily upon the soul of
the General's little s'weetheart, as they
did upon the ivhole South. Lee's cam-
paign into Pennsylvania carried his army
for many months into the country of the
enemy. It was a land that ivas strange
to the men and stranger still to the im-
agination of the sorroi^ing ones ivho
stayed behind. And at the end of it came
Gettysburg, vuhere more than five thou-
sand sons and husbands and lovers laid
doivn their lives for the cause they thought
to be just.
Pickett's charge at Gettysburg is one
of those deeds of arms that are immortal.
When it <was over — ending in defeat as
it did, on account of the lack of promised
supports — tivo-thirds of his beloved di-
vision lay sleeping on the slope of Ceme-
tary Ridge and the heart of their fearless
commander ivas crushed by the thought of
their sacrifice and the suffering that it
meant to the Southland.
