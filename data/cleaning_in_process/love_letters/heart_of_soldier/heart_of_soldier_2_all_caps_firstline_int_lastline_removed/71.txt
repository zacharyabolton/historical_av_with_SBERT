I am blessing my spirit and refreshing my soul
by sending a message to my promised wife.
I am tired and sleepy, several times to-day
going to sleep on my horse.
This war was really never contemplated in
earnest. I believe if either the North or the
South had expected that their differences
would result in this obstinate struggle, the
cold-blooded Puritan and the cock hatted
Huguenot and Cavalier would have made a
compromise. Poor old Virginia came oftener
than Noah's dove with her olive branch.
Though she desired to be loyal to the Union
of States, she did not believe in the right of
coercion, and when called upon to furnish
troops to restrain her sister states she refused,
and would not even permit the passage of an
armed force through her domain for that pur-
pose. With no thought of cost, she rolled up
her sleeves, ready to risk all in defense of a
principle consecrated by the blood of her
fathers. And now, alas, it is too late. We
must carry through this bitter task unto the
end. May the end be soon!
Your Soldier.
