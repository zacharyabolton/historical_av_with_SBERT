THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
the attacking columns. My brave Virginians
are to attack in front. Oh, may God in mercy
help me as He never helped before!
I have ridden up to report to Old Peter.
I shall give him this letter to mail to you and
a package to give you if — Oh, my darling,
do you feel the love of my heart, the prayer,
as I write that fatal word?
Now, I go; but remember always that I
love you with all my heart and soul, with every
fiber of my being; that now and forever I am
yours — yours, my beloved. It is almost three
o'clock. My soul reaches out to yours — my
prayers. I'll keep up a skookum tumtum for
Virginia and for you, my darling.
Your Soldier.
Gettysburg, July 3, 1863.
