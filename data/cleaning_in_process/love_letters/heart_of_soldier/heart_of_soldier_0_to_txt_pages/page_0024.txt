THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
leading his brigade in a charge at Gaines's
Mill, he was severely wounded in the shoul-
der, but refused to leave the field, ordering
Dr. Chancellor to extract the bullet on the
field. The surgeon remonstrated, but he said :
''My men need me here, Doctor. Fix me
now."
He was finally carried off, but was back
with his brigade two months before he was
able to draw a sleeve over the wounded arm.
Time has not lessened the fame of Pickett's
Charge at Gettysburg, and it never will ; for
the changes that have taken place in the sci-
ence of war leave no possibility that future
history will produce its counterpart. Truly,
"the first day of the terrible three at Gettys-
burg was an accident, the second a blunder"
and the third the greatest tragedy that has
ever been played upon the stage of war.
With its imperishable glory — overshadowing
all other events in martial history, notwith-
standing its appalling disaster — is linked for-
ever the name of my Soldier.
