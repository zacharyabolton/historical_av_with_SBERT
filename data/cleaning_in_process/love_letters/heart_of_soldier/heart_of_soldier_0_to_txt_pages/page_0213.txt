THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
offer, but how much do you need?" "Not
any, old fellow, not a cent, thank you," I said.
"I have plenty." "But Rufus tells me that
you have begun to build a house to take the
place of the one old Butler burned and how
can you build it without money; you do need
some." "I have sold some timber to pay for
it," I told him, and to show my appreciation
and gratitude unobserved I affectionately
squeezed his leg, when he called out, "Rufus,
it's the same old George Pickett; instead of
pulling my leg he's squeezing it."
Grant is going to take Rufus, Suckley and
myself to ride this afternoon to show me the
changes since I was last here, years ago.
To-morrow, if all goes well, I'll start back
to what is worth more to me than all I've lost
â€” my precious wife, who was as queenly and
gracious and glorious as Mrs. Edwards in one
room in a boarding house In exile as she was
in Petersburg in a palatial home when her
husband was the Department Commander and
she had not only "vassals and slaves at her
side," but the General Commanding and all
his soldiers and our world at her feet.
Your Devoted Soldier.
