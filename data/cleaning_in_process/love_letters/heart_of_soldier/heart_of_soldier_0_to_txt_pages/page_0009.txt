FORE WORD
P*OR half a century these letters have lain
•*• locked away from the world, the lines
fading upon the yellowed pages, their every
•word enshrined in the heart of the noble
woman to whom they were written. To her
they came filled with the thunder of guns,
the lightning of unsheathed swords, the tu-
multuous rage in the heart of the storm; but
through them all the radiance of a pure de-
votion outshone the battle flash and the lyric
of a great love rose above the cannon's roar.
To their possessor, naturally, these letters
are sacred and they are given to the world
with great reluctance. It is only the thought
of the inspiration that they can bring to
lives less glorious than that of him who
penned them, of the courage they can instill
into hearts less brave, that has led their
owner to share them with the world.
Through the medium of this volume,
which is hereby dedicated to the Great Sol-
dier and True Man who supplied its con-
tents, these letters are given, out of the
hands of one who has cherished them ten-
derly for many years, into the keeping of all
those who honor courage, loyalty and the
love of man for woman.
