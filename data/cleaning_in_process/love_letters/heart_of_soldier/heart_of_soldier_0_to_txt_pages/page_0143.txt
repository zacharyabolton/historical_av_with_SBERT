THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
is for her Soldier to consult with her and
will forgive his bungling and awkwardness.
Never mind, after this she shall do all the
planning. Oh, what a heaven on earth is be-
fore us â€” if only this cruel war were over! A
Dios. Forgive this business letter. Courier
awaits. You will come; I have no fear.
Forever your
Soldier.
