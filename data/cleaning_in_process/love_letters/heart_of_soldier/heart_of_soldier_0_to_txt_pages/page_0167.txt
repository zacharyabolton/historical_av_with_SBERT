THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
Island, under those old trees, with the James
River always before us and love always with
us. As the sun in the firmament, so is love
in the world — love, the life of the spirit, the
root of every virtuous action. It enhanceth
prosperity, easeth adversity and maketh of
the slightest twist a Gordian knot. It gives
vigor to the atmosphere, fragrance to the
flower, color to the rainbow, zest to life, music
to laughter, and oh, such laughter as yours,
my own, my beautiful. I love you with all
my heart and soul and mind and being.
A Dios. Keep this love close.
Your Soldier.
Headquarters, June — , 1864.
