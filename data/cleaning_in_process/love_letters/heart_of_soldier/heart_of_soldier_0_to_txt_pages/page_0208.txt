A FTER the ivar had passed, and luith
-^^ It the necessity for separation from
his dear one, the General's letters greiu
less frequent. He ivas seldom far from
her side. A year they spent together in
Canada during the exile nvhich luas en-
forced upon many of the leaders of the
Lost Cause. Then, lohen the ban ivas
finally lifted, the General returned ivith
his pretty civife to face the problem that
pressed heamly upon all Southernersâ€”
the disheartening task of rearing a new
home on the ruins of the old. Their at-
tempt -was not altogether successful, but
amid the surroundings of peace they found
time to work out in practical form the
dream of happiness which had come to
them in darker days.
The letters in this part are written on
occasional absences. They cover a period
of ten years or more, extending almost to
the time of the General's death, and to
the end they breathe in every line his
loyalty and devotion to the noble woman
whose love had crowned his life.
