THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
a rest of only an hour or so, marched all
night. At nine o'clock the following morn-
ing we reached Hagerstown but hurried on
through to Williamsport. All along the road
from Hagerstown to Williamsport were grue-
some evidences of Kilpatrick's dash into
Hagerstown — here a dead cavalryman, there
a broken caisson, a dead horse. I ought not
to let your beautiful eyes see through mine all
these horrors, but some day, my darling, some
day we'll strew roses and violets and lilies
over them all, even over the memories of
them. We'll listen to the resurrection that
hope and faith and love voice in all the songs
of nature. It will not be long, darling, for
to-day the official news of the surrender of
Vicksburg reached us. The tidings brought
cheers from the prisoners and increased the
sullen gloom of their guard.
I am directed to turn the prisoners over to
General Imboden's command, who is to es-
cort them to Staunton. Their final destina-
tion will, I suppose, be the old nine-room
brick warehouse on Carey Street in Rich-
mond, **Libby & Sons — Ship Chandlers and
Grocers" — a sign which I remember as a boy
