THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
I hoped you'd send a line by Bob telling me
what you meant and why you had said it, but
when I asked him if you had written, he said:
"Yes, Suh, Marse George, 'course de mistis
is done en writ a letter er a answer er sumpin' ;
but ef she did done it, den I mus' er forgot
ter fotch it, bein' ez I wuz in sich a hurry ter
git yere in time dis mornin' wid de baskets, en
startin' befo' daybre'k. En den dis ebenin' a
gettin' de basket en papers en milk en things
ready in sich a hurry agin, I mus' er forgot de
letter agin."
Now, please, my darling, send Bob back
right away with a nice letter and tell your
Soldier that you did not mean anything by say-
ing, "Never mind," to him, for he loves you
with all his heart and would not wound or dis-
appoint or offend you for anything in the
world.
Your Soldier.
