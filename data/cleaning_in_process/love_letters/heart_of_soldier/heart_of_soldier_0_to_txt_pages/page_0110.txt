During a Halt in the Long March
1WISH, my darling, you could see this
wonderfully rich and prosperous country,
abounding in plenty, with its great, strong,
vigorous horses and oxen, its cows and crops
and verdantly thriving vegetation — none of
the ravages of war, no signs of devastation —
all in woeful contrast to the land where we lay
dreaming. All the time I break the law
"Thou shalt not covet," for every fine horse
or cow I see I want for my darling, and all
the pretty things I see besides. Never mind,
she shall have everything some day, and I
shall have the universe and heaven's choicest
gift when she is my wife — all my very own.
At Chambersburg, Marse Robert preached
us a sermon, first instructing us in the meaning
of "meum" and "teum," and then taking as his
text, "Vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord." I
observed that the mourners' bench was not
overcrowded with seekers for conversion.
