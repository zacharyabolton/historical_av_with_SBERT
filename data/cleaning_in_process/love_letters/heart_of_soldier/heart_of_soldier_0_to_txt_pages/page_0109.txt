THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
So the command was given and the band
played "Home Sweet Home," "Annie Laurie,"
"Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still," "Nellie
Gray" and "Hazel Dell." The young ladies
asked the next band that passed if they
wouldn't play "Dixie"; but the band instead
struck up "The Old Oaken Bucket," "The
Swanee River," "The Old Arm Chair," "The
Lone Rock by the Sea" and "Auld Lang
Syne."
"Thought you was rebels. Where'd you
come from anyhow? Can't play 'Dixie,' none
of you," they called out. We marched
straight on through the city and are camped
four miles beyond the town on the York River
road.
To-morrow, if you'll promise not to divulge
it to a human soul, I'll tell you a great secret.
No, my darling, I can't wait till to-morrow.
I'll tell you right now. So listen and cross
your heart that you won't tell. I love you — •
love you — love you, and oh, little one, I want
to see you so! That is the secret.
Lovingly and forever.
Your Soldier.
