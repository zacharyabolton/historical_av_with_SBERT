THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
Lee, however, requested him to withdraw this report.
His letter so doing is to be found in War Records (Vol-

General George E. Pickett, Commanding, &c. You
and youT men have crowned themselves with glory; but

that was binding upon him for all time and he has never
divulged the contents of this report, except in the letter
to his wife (written before Lee's request was made)
which appears in this volume on page 97. In view, how-
