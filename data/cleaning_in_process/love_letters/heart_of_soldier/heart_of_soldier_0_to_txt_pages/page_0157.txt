THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
Ace of Spades," because of his incessant activ-
ity in throwing up defenses, trenches, breast-
works, etc. This morning Grant made an as-
sault along the entire six miles of our line, and
our guns opened a counter attack, followed by
advance skirmishes of my division. The
whole Confederate line poured a stream of
fire, and thousands of Grant's soldiers have
gone to reenforce the army of the dead.
Oh, this is all a weary, long mistake. May
the merciful and true God wield power to end
it ere another day passes!
Your Soldier.
