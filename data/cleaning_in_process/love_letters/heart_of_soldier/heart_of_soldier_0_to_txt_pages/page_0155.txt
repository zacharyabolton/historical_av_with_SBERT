THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
it seem to you as long ago as two years, my
darling? To me, it seems but yesterday that
I lay in Richmond at my little sister's and you
came to see me, blessing and cheering me. I
can feel now the soft touch of your little white
hands, as you gently stroked and soothed my
wounded shoulder and swollen arm and hand.
Do you remember one afternoon while you
were reading from Moore's melodies (not that
I heard or took in the meaning of a single word
of them, for I only heard the music of your
wonderful voice and saw the long, dark lashes
caressing the words which those cupid-shaped
cherry lips were uttering) that our dear old
Stonewall was announced? Of course I knew
his calling was out of the usual, and I was
honored and gratified by his coming; but any
guest was unwelcome if I had to share with
him my darling. I remember that you
marked the place you were reading with your
dainty, scented handkerchief, which I stole
and still have. You and my sister were about
to withdraw; but both the General and I
urged you to remain. I shall always hold
sacred "Old Jack's" visit and remember its
every detail.
