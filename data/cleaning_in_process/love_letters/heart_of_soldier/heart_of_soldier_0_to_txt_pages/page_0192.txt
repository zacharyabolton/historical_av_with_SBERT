THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
The anxious, despairing faces I see every-
where bespeak heavy hearts. Our commis-
sioners knew that we were gasping our last
gasp and that the Peace Conference was a for-
lorn hope. Because of the informality of the
conference and my knowledge of Mr. Lincoln,
his humanity, his broad nature, his warm
heart, I did believe he would take advantage
of this very informality and spring some wise,
superhuman surprise vvhich would, somehow,
restore peace and in time insure unity. Now,
heaven help us, it will be war to the knife,
with a knife no longer keen, the thrust of an
arm no longer strong, the certainty that when
peace comes it will follow the tread of the
conqueror.
I fear that you may need more help ; so am
sending over Bob. The mess-cook will come
later.
Meantime, a Dios, and love,
Your Soldier.
