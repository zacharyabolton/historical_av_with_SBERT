THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
boys earlier in the action, hastily thrusting a
battle-flag into my hand. I took the flag,
stained with his blood, sacred to the cause for
which he fell, and, cheering as I waved it,
called on my men to get into line to meet the
next charge. Seeing this, a part of the famous
old Glee Club, our dear old Gentry leading,
began singing, ''Rally round the flag, boys;
rally once again." I rode straight up to
where they were and joined in singing, "Rally
Once Again," as I waved the blood-stained
flag. And, my darling, overpowered, de-
feated, cut to pieces, starving, captured, as we
were, those that were left of us formed front
and north and south and met with sullen des-
peration their double onset. With the mem-
bers of my own staff and the general officers
and their stafif officers we compelled a rally
and stand of Corse's Brigade and W. H. F.
Lee's Cavalry, who made one of the most bril-
liant cavalry fights of the war, enabling many
of us to escape capture. Our loss in killed and
wounded was heavy, and yet, my darling, with
all the odds against us we might possibly have
held out till night, which was fast approach-
ing, but that our ammunition was exhausted.
