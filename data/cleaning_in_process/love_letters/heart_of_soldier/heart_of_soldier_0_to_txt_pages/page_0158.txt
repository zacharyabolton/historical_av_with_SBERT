XXVIII
After General Lee Had Congratulated His
Division for Gallantry
OUTSIDE, my darling, the band has been
playing the songs that we love, and in-
side I have been softly singing them all to
you, to your spirit far away. Now they have
wound up with ''Alice, Where Art Thou?"
which might have set me wondering if it had
not been the hour we each seek to be alone that
we may bring our souls in touch. So I knew
that thou wert with me.
This morning Tom Friend brought me a
weesome package of tea, which he wishes sent
to you. ''One of the men," he said, "swapped
his tobacco for it." If the whole universe
were mine, I'd lay it at your feet, for love has
builded in my heart three altars for thy wor-
ship — one to Faith, one to Hope, one to Serv-
ice — and you, my Goddess whom I worship,
must feed my faith, illumine my hope and
command my service.
