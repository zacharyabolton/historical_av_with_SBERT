VIII
Written Upon His Return to His Old Com-
mand
DARLING, my heart turns to you with a
love so great that pain follows in its
wake. You cannot understand this, my beau-
tiful, bright-eyed, sunny-hearted princess.
Your face, is the sweetest face in all the world,
mirroring, as it does, all that is pure and un-
selfish, and I must not cast a shadow over it by
the fears that come to me, in spite of myself.
No, a soldier should not know fear of any
kind. I must fight and plan and hope, and
you must pray. Pray for a realization of all
our beautiful dreams, sitting beside our own
hearthstone in our own home â€” you and I, you
my goddess of devotion, and I your devoted
slave. May God in his mercy spare my life
and make it worthy of you !
My shoulder and arm are still quite stiff,
and I cannot yet put my sleeve on the wounded
arm. I have on one sleeve, and my coat is
thrown over my other shoulder and other arm.
