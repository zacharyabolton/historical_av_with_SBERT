THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
Over on Cemetery Ridge the Federals beheld
a scene never before witnessed on this conti-
nent, — a scene which has never previously been
enacted and can never take place again — an
army forming in line of battle in full view,
under their very eyes — charging across a
space nearly a mile in length over fields of
weaving grain and anon of stubble and then a
smooth expanse — moving with the steadiness
of a dress parade, the pride and glory soon to
be crushed by an overwhelming heartbreak/
Well, it is all over now. The battle is lost,
and many of us are prisoners, many are dead,
many wounded, bleeding and dying. Your
Soldier lives and mourns and but for you, my
darling, he would rather, a million times
rather, be back there with his dead, to sleep
for all time in an unknown grave.
Your sorrowing
Soldier.
In Camp, July 4, 1863.
