A T the time fwhen these letters begin,
•^ the General (then Captain Pickett,
U. S. A.) ivas stationed at Fori Belling-
ham in the north-west. Before leaving
Virginia, he had become engaged to
"Little Miss Sally" Corbell, ivho during
his absence ivas fitting herself at school
to be a soldier's -wife. The summons to
arms in the cause of the seceding states
fwas late in reaching the Captain at his
far-aivay post, and he, being in the dark
as to the course of events, ivas even more
tardy to respond; but ivhen the news came
telling of the luithdrawal of his native
state from the Union he resigned his com-
mission immediately and cast his lot with
that of the Confederacy.
The letters in this part give many vivid
glimpses of the armies in action, as they
do of the lighter side of a soldier's life,
during the first year and a half of the
War. There are lapses of weeks — even
months — between them, due to the fact
that some are missing; others, whose
pages time has stained, are undecipher-
able, and in still other instances the for-
tunes of war kept the General so near his
sweetheart that letters were not needed
to carry to her the tale of his love.
