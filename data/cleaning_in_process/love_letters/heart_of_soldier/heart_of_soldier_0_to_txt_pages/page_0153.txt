THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
haunts me. He is a boy with golden brown
curls â€” somebody's darling. To-night, we
made a capture of the Federal pickets, sweep-
ing their rifle-pits for more than a hundred
yards and taking a hundred and thirty-six
prisoners. You know our lines are so close
together in many places that we, the Yankees
and my men, can with voices raised carry on
a conversation.
War and its horrors, and yet I sing and
whistle. Oh, my sweetheart, if only this
wicked war were over so that we could in
peace and quiet tranquilly finish the book of
Love which we have but just begun.
Adios now. I see old Jackerie in the flap
with his pack and bag, his wonted grace and
patience, his dolce-far-niente eyes and soft,
southern Italian voice, saying, "No huUa-non-
enty." But I must hurry, for he starts at day-
break and it is now past midnight.
Lovingly now and forever,
Your Soldier.
In Camp, June, 1864.
