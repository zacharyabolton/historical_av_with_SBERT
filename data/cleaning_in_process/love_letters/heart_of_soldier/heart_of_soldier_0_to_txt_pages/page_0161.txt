Lieutenant-General R. H. Anderson,
Commanding Longstreet's Corps.
General :
I take great pleasure in presenting to you my congratu-
lations upon the conduct of the men of your corps. I be-
lieve they will carry anything they are put against. We
tried very hard to stop Pickett's men from capturing the
breastworks of the enemy, but could not do it. I hope
his loss has been small.
I am, with respect, your obedient servant,
R. E. Lee, General.
