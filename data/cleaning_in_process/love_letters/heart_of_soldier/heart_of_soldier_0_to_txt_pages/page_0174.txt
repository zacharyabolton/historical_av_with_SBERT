A Second Letter on His Son's Birthday.
GOD has heard our prayers, my beloved
wife. Oh, the ecstatic pleasure I felt
when Charles brought the Doctor's letter.
Precious one, you must obey every injunction
of our dear Aunt. Do not think of writing or
exerting yourself in any way. She knows all
about what should be done. I am coming to
you this evening, should General Lee say so,
and he will, for I have sent Bright post haste
to him, telling him of the glory of the Star in
the East.
Oh, my pretty wife! I long to see you and
your little son — Our son! Little new-born
mother, I have humbly thanked God for His
great and bounteous goodness ; every breath I
breathe is one of gratitude to Him for spar-
ing you to me and giving us a son — thou Life
of my soul. Ever and forever
Your Devoted Soldier.
Sunday, jyth July,
Blessed Day!
