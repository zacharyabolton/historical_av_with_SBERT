THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
like a thief to take a commission on what they
have worked for and earned.
Yesterday when I came through Petersburg
I went, as I told you, to our office. J. B. B.,
our company's agent, was sitting with his
chair tilted back — foot on the table, smoking
a bad smelling pipe and reading *'Macaria."
"Hello, General, hello," he said, not rising.
"Sent in six policies this week, old man."
"On your familiarity or courtly manners —
which?" "Neither, old man, on gall, gall,
old man, gall and grub. Come, have a drink
— ever read ^Macaria'?" With the most
studied politeness and coldness I declined his
offer and in my most dignified manner asked
permission to look over the company's books.
"Come, what's eating you, old man?" he
asked, bringing his chair down with a bang
and slapping me on the back. Then he pro-
fanely informed me that I'd have to unbuckle
a few holes and thaw out if I wanted to paint
the monkey's tail sky-blue.
Alas, little one, I am afraid your Soldier
isn't much of an artist. He longs to give his
precious wife all the luxuries and comforts
