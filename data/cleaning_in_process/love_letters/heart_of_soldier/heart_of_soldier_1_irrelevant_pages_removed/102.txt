THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
now, will cross that other river which lands
them at the Eternal Home.
Have faith, my little one; keep up a
"skookum tum-tum." ^ Your soldier feels that
he will return to claim his bride — his beauti-
ful, glorious bride. And then we shall be so
happy, my darling, that all our days to come,
we will show our loving gratitude to our
Father for His mercy in sparing us to each
other.
Now, my Sally, how I hate to say it —
adieu. Do you remember how many times
we said good-by that last evening? And then
as I heard the latch of the gate click and shut
me out, I was obliged to go back. I could not
stand the cruelty of the sound of that latch —
it seemed to knife my soul. I turned back and
said, "Good night!" The door was open; I
came in. You thought I had gone. I can't
just remember how many times I said good
night. I know I did not close the gate as I
went out again. Keep another gate open for
the good morning, my precious bride-to-be.
Oh, the bliss to be — the bliss to be then for
Your Soldier.
In Camp, June i8, i86j.
1 Chinook for strong heart.
