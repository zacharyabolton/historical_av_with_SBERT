THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
following day was commissioned Captain.
But so bitter is the feeling here that my being
unavoidably delayed so long in avowing my
allegiance to my state has been most cruelly
and severely criticized by friends â€” yes, and
even relatives, too.
Now, little one, if you had the very faintest
idea how happy a certain captain in the C. S.
A. (My, but that "C" looks queer!) would be
to look into your beautiful, soul-speaking eyes
and hear your wonderfully musical voice, I
think you would let him know by wire where
he could find you. I shall almost listen for
the electricity which says, "I am at .
Come." I know that you will have mercy on
your devoted
Soldier.
Richmond, September iT, l86l.
