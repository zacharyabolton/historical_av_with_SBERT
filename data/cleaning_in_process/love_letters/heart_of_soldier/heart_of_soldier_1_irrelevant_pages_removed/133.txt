On the Way to Richmond â€” Guarding
Prisoners
IT would be impossible, my darling, to de-
scribe to you even the half of the horrors
and hardships of these last days, from the first
night's long march to the present hour; not
only for ourselves but for the prisoners v^hom,
w^ith shattered hopes and heartbreak v\^e, the
little remnant of my division, have been as-
signed to guard. "One prisoner is too many
for us, who haven't a crust to go around
among ourselves," as Old Jack said.
Oh, the pity of it, guarding these prisoners
through their own country, depleted and suf-
fering mentally and physically as we are, and
being forced to march forward with a speed
beyond their own and our endurance. It may
be some consolation to both that we suffer
alike from fatigue, hunger, exhaustion and
wet, for the excessive rains which set in on the
fourth have continued unabated.
