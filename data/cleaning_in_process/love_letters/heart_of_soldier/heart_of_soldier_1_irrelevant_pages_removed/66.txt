the Chickahominy. But alas, Hill, as brave,
as great, as heroic a soldier as he is, has, since
the fall of Johnston, been so bothered and an-
noyed with countermanding orders that he
was, if I may say so, confused and failed to
respond. After this delay nothing was left for

and that the last shot that will ever be heard
was fired on June first, 1862. What a change

guard it well.
I have heard that my dear old friend, Mc-
Clellan, is lying ill about ten miles from here.
May some loving, soothing hand minister to
