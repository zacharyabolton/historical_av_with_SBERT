THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
speaking he bowed his head upon his breast.
I shall never forget the look in his face nor
the clasp of his hand when I said: — "Then,
General, I shall lead my Division on." I had
ridden only a few paces when I remembered
your letter and (forgive me) thoughtlessly
scribbled in a corner of the envelope, "If Old
Peter's nod means death then good-by and
God bless you, little one," turned back and
asked the dear old chief if he would be good
enough to mail it for me. As he took your let-
ter from me, my darling, I saw tears glisten-
ing on his cheeks and beard. The stern old
war-horse, God bless him, was weeping for his
men and, I know, praying too that this cup
might pass from them. I obeyed the silent as-
sent of his bowed head, an assent given against
his own convictions, — given in anguish and
with reluctance.
My brave boys were full of hope and con-
fident of victory as I led them forth, forming
them in column of attack, and though officers
and men alike knew what was before them, —
knew the odds against them, — they eagerly of-
fered up their lives on the altar of duty, hav-
ing absolute faith in their ultimate success.
