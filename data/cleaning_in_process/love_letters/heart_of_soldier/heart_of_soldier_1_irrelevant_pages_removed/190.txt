THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
Davis of that exceedingly good man, Mr.
Christ. You know Benjamin was born at St.
Croix in the West Indies, of Jewish parents.
What a gossip your husband is, my Sally,
but I promised to write my beautiful tyrant
every day, everything I said or did or that
anyone else said or did, and I have, haven't I?
Forever and ever and ever
Your Soldier.
