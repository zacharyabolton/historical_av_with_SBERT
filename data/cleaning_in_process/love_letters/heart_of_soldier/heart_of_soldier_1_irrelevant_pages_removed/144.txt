Written After Their Marriage, on an Expe-
dition Into North Carolina
IT seems an age, my darling, since we rode
away, leaving you and Mrs. Ransom ^
standing in that wonderful grove of maiden
trees. I veil the annoying, disappointing
scenes since then and see again the beautiful
picture of my own bride, clothed in white, in
the greenery with the "grandfather squirrels"
playing all around her, climbing over her and
eating from her dainty, graceful hands.
"Mine — mine — all my own!" I said, invoking
our Father's care of you. Oh, my love, all
my happiness is in your hands, and as you love
me, guard your precious self from all harm.
I have you on my heart all the day.
Ransom sent on our letters from Kingston,
yia the Ugr.^ I hope they reached you safely.
