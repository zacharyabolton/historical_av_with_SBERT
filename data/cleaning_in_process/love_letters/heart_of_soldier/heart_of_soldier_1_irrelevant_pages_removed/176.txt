THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
had come to pass — was true; when I looked
upon the sweet, shy face of my girl bride
and saw it transformed into the sacred tender-
ness of motherhood, saw the grace and charm,
the soul-born protecting look in the mother
eyes, the lilied sweetness of her face, the smile
of unlanguaged mystery, with a gentleness and
patience as sweet and meek as Mother Mary
wore. I knew it was the Alpha and Omega
of Heaven.
I see still the moss rose bud left by the
Blumen-Engel as a bescheidenen Schmuck of
his love nestling in your snow-white arms and
the long, dark lashes kissing your cheeks as
you look down upon it. I still feel the mystic
power of the grasp of its tiny rose leaf fingers
clutched around my own.
But I must not write another word — not
one. Lovingly,
Your Soldier.
