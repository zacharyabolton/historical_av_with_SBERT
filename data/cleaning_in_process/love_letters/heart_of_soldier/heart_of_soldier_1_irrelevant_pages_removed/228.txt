thaw out, my darling, and he can't paint that
monkey's tail sky-blue, and, sweetheart, it
makes me crawl and creep to be associated
with artists who can. I was wondering as I

Here comes the Colonel and "old Mistiss,"
and by the way, everybody sends love and
messages to you and our boy.

letter.
It's snowing hard — I mean, easy. The
snow is "beautiful" but I'm so homesick for
you.
Your loving, good-for-nothing
Soldier.
