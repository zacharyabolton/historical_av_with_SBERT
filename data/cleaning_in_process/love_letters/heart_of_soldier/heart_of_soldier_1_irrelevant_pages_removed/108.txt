THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
of suddenly turning down the Susquehanna,
cutting off all railroad connections, destroying
all bridges, throwing his army north of Balti-
more and cutting off Washington, and that
Beauregard is to follow on directly from Rich-
mond via Manassas to Washington, in rear
of Hooker, who of course will be in pursuit
of Marse Robert.
Nous verrons.
We reached here this morning, June 27th,
the anniversary of the battle of Gaines's Mill,
where your Soldier was wounded. We
marched straight through the town of Cham-
bersburg, which was more deserted than Gold-
smith's village. The stores and houses were
all closed, with here and there groups of un-
cheerful Boers of Deutschland descent, ear-
nestly talking, more sylvan shadows than smiles
wreathing their faces. I had given orders that
the bands were not to play; but as we were
marching through the northeastern part of
the city, some young ladies came out onto the
veranda of one of the prettiest homes in the
town and asked:
"Would you mind shooting off the bands a
bit?"
