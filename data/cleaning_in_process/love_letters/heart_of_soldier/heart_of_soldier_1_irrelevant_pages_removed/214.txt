From New York After Refusing the Com-
mand of the Egyptian Army
SO, you would "leave it all to my better
judgment," most wise Little One, and
would not advise me, but after I had decided
fully I was to read the mysterious sealed note
â€” "not to be opened till after you have de-
cided."
At the banquet last night I opened and read
the letter and then passed it over to General
E. P. Alexander, General Ingalls and Doctor
Suckley. They all shook their heads disap-
provingly. I pointed to the instructions,
"Not to be opened till after you have de-
cided," and said that I had already decided
and the note only showed that we are "two
souls with but a single thought."
Now, don't you know, my darling, that I
knew your opinion before just as well as after
I had read your sealed letter? Of course I
knew that you did not want me to go and that,
