THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
holiness, to be let alone and permitted to sit
under our own vine and fig tree and eat our
figs peeled and dried or fresh or pickled, just
as we choose. The enemy is our enemy be-
cause he neither knows nor understands us,
and yet will not let us part in peace and be
neighbors, but insists on fighting us to make
us one with him, forgetting that both slavery
and secession were his own institutions. The
North is fighting for the Union, and we — for
home and fireside. All the men I know and
love in the world — comrades and friends, both
North and South — are exposed to hardships
and dangers, and are fighting on one side or
the other, and each for that which he knows
to be right.
Speaking of fighting. Captain Peacock this
morning brings us the news that the daring,
fearless has again won — shall I say, a vic-
tory? No, not victory. Victory is such a
glorious, triumphant word. I cannot use it
in speaking of warfare that is illegal to many
of us. Marse Robert's ^ approval and com-
mendation of this illegitimate mode is a source
of surprise, for, like many of us, the dear old
1 General Lee.
