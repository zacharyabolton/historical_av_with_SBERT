THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
for a time in command of the famous old
^'Stonewall Brigade." You have not met him,
my sweetheart; but I want you to know him.
He is as sensitive and proud as he is fearless
and sweet-spirited, and has felt more keenly
than most men would Old Jack's censure of
him at the battle of Kernstown, when all his
ammunition gave out and he withdrew his
brigade from the field, for which Old Jack
had him arrested and relieved from duty.
Old Jack told Lawton that in arresting Gar-
nett he had no reference to his want of daring,
which was surprising for Old Jack to say, who
never explains anything.
Lawton, who is one of his generals, says Old
Jack holds himself as the god of war, giving
short, sharp commands, distinctly, rapidly and
decisively, without consultation or explanation
and disregarding suggestions and remon-
strances. Being himself absolutely fearless,
and having unusual mental and moral, as
well as physical, courage, he goes ahead on his
own hook, asking no advice and resenting in-
terference. He places no value on human
life, caring for nothing so much as fighting,
unless it be praying. Illness, wounds and all
