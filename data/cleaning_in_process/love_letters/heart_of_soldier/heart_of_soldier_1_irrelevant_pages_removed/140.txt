TJTITH the return of the army to Vir-
yy ginia, after the tragic defeat at
Gettysburg, began the slow ebb of the
tide that had carried the hopes of the
Confederacy so high. It was in this crisis
nvhen he ivas back in his ivar-ivasted
state, fighting despondency and needing,
as never before, the love and devotion of
a ivife that General Pickett determined to
ivait no longer but to marry his sweet-
heart at once. As he could not go to her
she crossed the enemy's lines and joined
him at Petersburg, where they were made
one.
Soon after their marriage came the in-
evitable orders to march and the General
and his bride were separated for wieeks
at a time. But his letters brought to her
constant cheer and the promise, oft re-
peated, to come back to her in spite of
the dangers besetting him. That he did
so, ivas due certainly to some kind for-
tune that guarded him, since the deeds of
daring which he performed at the head
of his division became a tradition in the
Army.
