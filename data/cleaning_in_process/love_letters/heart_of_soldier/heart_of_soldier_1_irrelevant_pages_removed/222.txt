THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
old stories over again and I shall listen and
laugh as though I heard them for the first
time — dear old Sims.
Good night — sweet dreams. Angels guard
you while I hear of Lafayette and Nelson and
Marshall, through the clouds of old Sims'
tobacco smoke for the hundredth, yes, thou-
sandth time.
Your lonesome
Soldier.
