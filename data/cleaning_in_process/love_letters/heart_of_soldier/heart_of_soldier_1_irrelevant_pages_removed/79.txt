THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
I can reach my mouth with my hand by bend-
ing my neck way over; so I am not helpless.
Bob still buttons my collar and does some
other little services. Until I have more con-
trol of my arm, however, I shall confine my-
self to riding old Black and not venture on
Lucy. Enough of so small a matter.
My boys are delighted to welcome me back,
showing their affection for me in many, many
ways. Garnett is still in command of my dear
old brigade, which was temporarily turned
over to him when I was wounded and which,
under his gallant leadership, has sustained its
old reputation for fearlessness and endurance.
I miss dear, familiar faces, for many of the
brave fellows have been killed and wounded.
You have heard me speak of Colonel Strange
â€” a gallant soldier. He was wounded and
left behind. After he was shot the plucky old
chap called out in a loud, clear voice, "Stand
firm, boys; stand firm."
Well, the Yankees won the battle, but Mc-
Clellan's delay in winning enabled Old Jack ^
to seize Harper's Ferry, so it was not so great
a victory for them after all. Old Jack's note
1 General Stonewall Jackson.
