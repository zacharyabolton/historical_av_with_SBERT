and would allow their gunboats to go up the
James without running the gauntlet of our
Howlett guns, our sunken torpedoes et cetera.
And as our left is all at the turn of the bend,
they would not have to traverse the open river
in search of an exposed water channel. It is
strange that some of our brilliant engineers
haven't made this near cut years ago. As for
me, I should encourage Butler and his River
Improvement Company, and cease throwing
these stealthy shells whose silent fall heralds a
sudden roar of explosion that strikes terror
to my soul. The canal will be an advantage
to us, and Butler, in digging it for us, may in
part atone for the many homes he has de-
stroyed, mine among them.
Well, my darling, if you were not the best
of all good women, as well as the most beauti-
ful of all beautiful women and the most pa-
tient of all patient ones, you would weary of
so tiresome a soldier, who takes away the
fragrance of flowers and the glory of love
and sends back the echo of war and its sorrows
and the babble of a loyal old cook who
wouldn't be sold and wouldn't run away and
whom I was obliged to permit to be credited
