THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
not falter. It was not until they came within striking
distance of the Union line, when a flame of musketry burst
forth before which nothing could live, that their ranks
broke and, although a handful of men led by Armistead
crossed the Union works, the remainder of the glory-
crowned division were forced to retire.
Some idea of the decimating character of this assault
may be gained from the fact that out of more than 5000
men in Pickett's division who started on the mile long
march across the field of death but 1500 returned. In
the two divisions that made up the attacking column over
5000 men were lost. Two of Pickett's brigadiers were
killed, the other wounded ; and but one field officer in
his command came out of the battle unhurt. In one of
his letters in this volume the general gives a more de-
tailed account of the losses among his officers.
The charge of Pickett and his men has been made the
basis of much unfavorable criticism, directed chiefly
against the commanding general of the Southern forces
and his chief lieutenants at Gettysburg. In this crit-
icism Pickett has taken no part, although he states re-
peatedly in the letters to his wife that if promised sup-
ports had materialized the attack would have been suc-
cessful. It is generally admitted that the brigades of
Wilcox and Perry which should have supported Pickett
were slow in starting and became separated from the main
attacking body, rendering it no assistance.
In his first official report to General Lee after the
battle, Pickett pointed out without reserve the circum-
stances that were responsible for the disastrous result.
