THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
turned — how hard it is for me to ask you to
overlook old-time customs, remembering only

comfort that if I should fall I shall fall as your
husband.
You know that I love you with a devotion
that absorbs all else — a devotion so divine that
when in dreams I see you it is as something
too pure and sacred for mortal touch. And if
you only knew the heavenly life which thrills
me through when I make it real to myself that
you love me, you would understand. Think,
my dear little one, of the uncertainty and dan-
gers of even a day of separation, and don't let
