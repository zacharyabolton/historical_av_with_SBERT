THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
The poor fellows were thinking of their own
despoiled homes, looted of everything, and
were not wildly enthusiastic as they acquiesced
obediently to our beloved Commander's or-
der. The Yanks have taken into the moun-
tains and across the Susquehanna all the sup-
plies they could, and we pay liberally for
those which we are compelled to take, pay-
ing for them in money which is paid to us,
our own Confederate script. Some of us
have a few pieces of gold with which to pur-
chase some keepsake or token for the dear
ones at home. Alas, my little one, how many
of us will be blessed with the giving of them?
God in His mercy be our Commander-in-
Chief!
We have not a wide field for selection here,
as we once had at Price's dry goods store or
John Tyler's jewelry establishment in Rich-
mond; but it seems quite magnificent to us
now, since the Richmond counters are so bare
as to offer not even a wedding ring or a yard
of calico. We are guying General who,
after long and grave deliberation, bought
three hoop skirts as a present for his be-
trothed.
