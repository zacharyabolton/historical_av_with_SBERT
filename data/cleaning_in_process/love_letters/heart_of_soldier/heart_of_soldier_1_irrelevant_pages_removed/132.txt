THE HEART OF A SOLDIER
bricks of happiness and the mortar of love
must lie untouched in this lowering gloom.
Pray, dear, for the sorrowing ones.
Your Soldier.

Headquarters, A. N. Va.,
July 9th, 1863.
General:
Your letter of the 8th has been received. It was with
reluctance that I imposed upon your gallant division the
duty of carrying prisoners to Staunton. I regretted to
assign them to such a service, as well as to separate them
from .the Army, though temporarily, with which they
have been so long and efficiently associated. Though
small in numbers, their worth is not diminished, and I
had supposed that the division itself would be loth to
part from its comrades, at a time when the presence of
every man is so essential.
No one grieves more than I do at the loss suffered by
your noble division in the recent conflict, or honors it
more for its bravery and gallantry. It will afford me
hereafter satisfaction, when an opportunity occurs, to do
all in my power to recruit its diminished ranks, and to
recognize it in the most efficient manner.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. E. Lee, General.
Major Gen. G. E. Pickett, commanding,
Forwarded through Lieut. Gen. Longstreet.
