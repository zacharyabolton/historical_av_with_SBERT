Concerning General Jackson and General Garnett
AY I hope, my precious, that when another
year rolls by we can celebrate the anniversary
of this day by announcing our marriage? Today I
was officially promoted to the rank of Major General
and permanently placed in command of a division.
My dear old brigade, which I love and which was
with me in the battles of Williamsburg, Seven Pines
and Gaines's Mill, was assigned to Dick Garnett and
there comes somehow, in spite of everything, a little
• kind of curious' feeling within when I hear it called
•Garnett's Brigade', even though he has been in
command of it almost ever since I was wounded and
has won for it distinction and from it love and respect.
Old Dick is a fine fellow, a brave, splendid soldier.
He was in the Mexican war and was wounded in the
battle of Mexico. He commanded a brigade under
Old Jack, and was for a time in command of the fa
mous old.Stonewall Brigade'. You have not met him,
my sweetheart; but I want you to know him. His
family are from Norfolk. He knows all your people,
and remembers you as a child, and sends you his love.
