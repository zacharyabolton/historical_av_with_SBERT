This war was really never contemplated in earnest.
I believe if either the North or the South had ex

hatted Huguenot and Cavalier would have made a
compromise. Poor old Virginia came oftener than
Noah's dove with her olive branch and though she der
sired to be loyal to the Union of States she did not be
lieve in the right of coercion, and when called upon
to furnish troops to restrain her sister states she re,
fused, and would not even permit the passage
armed force through her domain for that purpose.
With no thought of cost, no consideration of dispar,
ity of relative strength or conditions, she rolled up her
sleeves, ready to risk all in defense of a principle con
secrated by the blood of her fathers. And now, alas,
it is too late. We must carry through this bitter task
unto the end. May the end be soon!
