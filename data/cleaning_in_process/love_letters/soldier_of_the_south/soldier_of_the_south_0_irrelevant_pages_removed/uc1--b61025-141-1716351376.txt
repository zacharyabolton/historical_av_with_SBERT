Upon Returning from a Ride with General Lee
HAVE but a few moments since, my pretty one,
I on
down the other. The enemy occupied Dutch Gap last
evening. This is higher up the river than I am and I
had expected the Navy to take care of our rear but
they have allowed them to come in, and now I have
to stretch out my India rubber division.
Well, I have to do it. The General did not seem in
a remarkably good humor - with the news from Mo,
bile and Bradley, Johnson in the valley, and this im
pudence of the Yankees in crawling up behind us.
I am so glad, my own, that you are better - thank
the good God for it.
I send you a chicken, a cup of salt, likewise an
apple â€“ one single one. Your friend, Miss Gamble,
radiant with a white frock and smiles, sent it to me
(didn't give it) with her compliments last night.
Good-bye, sweet one.
Ever your own
Soldier
