the south side of the Rappahannock, half way
between Richmond and Washington, fortified for us
by the hand of the Great Father.
I penciled you a note by old Jackerie* on the 12th
from the foot of the Hills between Hazel Run and the
Telegraph Road. In it I sent a hyacinth, given me by
a pretty lady who came out with beaten biscuit, and
some unwritten and written messages from Old Peter
and Old Jack, Hood, Ewell, Stuart and your

it all
