IN THE BATTLE-LINE
Oh, my sweetheart, if only this wicked war were over
so that we could in peace and quiet tranquilly finish
the book of Love which we have but just begun.
Adios now. I see old Jackerie in the flap with his
pack and bag, his wonted grace and patience, his
dolce-far-niente eyes and soft, southern Italian voice,
saying, “No hulla-nonenty.” But I must hurry, for he
starts at daybreak and it is now past midnight.
Lovingly now and forever,
Your
Soldier
In Camp, May - 1864
