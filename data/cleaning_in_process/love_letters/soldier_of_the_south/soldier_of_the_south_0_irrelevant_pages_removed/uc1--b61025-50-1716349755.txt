GenerAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
nia, he often uses his men as a sedative, and when he
can't sleep calls them up, marches them out a few
miles; then marches them back. He never praises his
men for gallantry, because it is their duty to be gallant
and they do not deserve credit for doing their duty.
Well, my own darling, I only pray that God may spare
him to us to see us through. If General Lee had
Grant's resources he would soon end the war; but Old
Jack can do it without resources.
Bless your heart, here I am talking of these old war,
horses to my prettice. Well, she knows how entirely
I love her and how I have left in her keeping my soul's
all.
Lovingly and faithfully, my Sallie,
your own
Soldier
Headquarters, Oct. 11, 1862
