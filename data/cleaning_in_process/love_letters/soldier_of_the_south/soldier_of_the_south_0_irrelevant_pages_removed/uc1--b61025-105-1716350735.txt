URGES AN IMMEDIATE MARRIAGE

Manassas and Chester, where we had a brilliant skir,
a
mish with the enemy. For three days and nights I
have been almost constantly in the saddle. Last night,
the 22d, I had a tent pitched, and sat down to a meal
at a camp table, the first time since leaving Bunker
Hill. We had been going .al fresco'. When we did
sleep it was with the heavens for a canopy and a
fence rail for a pillow. We shall be here three or four
days, perhaps longer.
I thank the great and good God that he has spared
me to come back and claim your promise, and I pray
your womanly assistance in helping me to its immedi,
ate fulfilment. This is no time for ceremonies. The
future is all uncertain, and it is impossible for me to
call a moment my own. Again, with all the graves
I
have left behind me, and with all the wretchedness
and misery this fated campaign has made, we would
not wish anything but a very silent, very quiet wed,
ding, planning only the sacrament and blessing of the
church, and, after that, back to my division and to
the blessing of those few of them who, by God's mira.
cle, were left.

I
was a parting gift to me from the officers of the Pa.
cific, and told him to have it made into a wedding
