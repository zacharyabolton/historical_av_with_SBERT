GENERAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
>
-
will meet you
reason why', but to obey and come at once. We can
not brook
any delay, my sweetheart; so pack up your
knapsack — never mind the rations and the ammu
nition—come! My Aunt Olivia and Uncle Andrew,
Johnston and one of my staff and one of my couriers
and
your
dear
parents on this side of
the Black Water and will escort you to Petersburg,
where I shall be waiting at the train to meet you. I
shall see you all to the hotel, where you will wait while
your father, Bright and I get the license and make
other necessary arrangements for our immediate mar,
riage, which I have planned to take place at St. Paul's
Church. Our old friend, Doctor Platt, will pronounce
the words that make us one in the sight of the world.
From the church, we will go to the depot, where a
special train, having been arranged for us by our
friend, Mr. Reuben Raglan, God bless him, will take
us over to Richmond, where my little sister is wait,
ing longingly to love and welcome
my
wife - her
new sister.
My darling will realize how impossible it is for her
soldier to consult with her and will forgive his bun
gling and awkwardness. Never mind, after this she
shall do all the planning. Oh, what a heaven on earth
is before us — if only this cruel war were over! A
