GENERAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
getting a wagon load of things up from Chuckatuck
- but I am almost afraid to trust one through.
Oh, my Sallie, I do want to see you so much. I have
been right sick for a day or two past, but am better to
day. I had no business to be sick and low spirited,
when God has been so good to us. I fancy, could I only
have seen my own faithful loving wife, and told her
what was uppermost
in
my
mind that I would have
gotten well. Dearest, I will
try
and
get
in some time
this week. A Dios, my sweet. Kiss the little George
for me.
Ever, darling of my heart,
Your own
Soldier
In Camp, August â€”, 1864
