NEAR PETERSBURG
mean
soldier told you
And now, my darling, what on earth did
you
by saying, “Never mind,” as you said good-by and rode
away yesterday. It troubled me all night. I wanted to
follow after
you
and ask
you
what
you meant, but
,
couldn't. I would have jumped on Lucy and ridden
into Petersburg and found out if it had been possible
for me to leave. I was so troubled about it that I was
almost tempted to come in anyhow. But for the life
of me, little one, I couldn't think of any reason why
you
should
say,
“Never mind,” to me. Were you
aggrieved, my darling, because your blundering old
there was no necessity
for
your com
ing out to bring the dispatches, any longer; that,
thank heaven, the recruits and reënforcements were
coming in now, and that we could manage all right?
I did not mean to hurt you, dear. I hoped you'd send
a line by Bob telling me what you meant and why
you had said it, but when I asked him if you had
written, he said:
“Yas, Suh, Marse George, 'course de mistis is done
en writ a letter er answer er sumpin'; but ef she done
did it, den I mus’ er forgot ter fotch it, bein' ez I
wuz in sich a hurry ter git yere in time dis morn
in', a-startin' befo' daybre’k. En den dis ebenin'
argittin' de basket en papers en milk en things
