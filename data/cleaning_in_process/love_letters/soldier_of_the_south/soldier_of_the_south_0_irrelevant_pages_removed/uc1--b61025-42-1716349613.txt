Minnegerode asked me this morning when he called,
“Who sent the beautiful flowers?” Bob, to save me
from answering, said, “De same young lady sont de
flowers, Marse Doctor, dat 'broidered dat

fer
Marse George, en 'broidered dem dar slippers he's got
on, en sont him de 'broidered stars dat he w'ars on
his coat when he w'ars it; but dat young lady ain't
de onlyest young lady dat sends Marse George flowers
en things. Nor, Suh.”
The dear old doctor understood; he winked at me
and changed the subject. He is as loyal to the South,
dear old fellow, as if his ancestors had landed at
Jamestown. When he asked after my wound he said
he would like to pray with me, though the dear old
man pronounced it, with his German accent, 'bray.'
And that reminded me of a story, and instead of hav.
ing my thoughts and my heart set upon his beautiful
prayer as I should have --- miserable sinner that I was!
