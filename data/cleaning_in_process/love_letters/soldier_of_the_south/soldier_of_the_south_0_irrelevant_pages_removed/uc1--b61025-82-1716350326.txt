GENERAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
a
mine when a courier rode up and handed me a note
from Alexander.
Now, I go; but remember always that I love you
with all
my
heart and soul, with every
fiber of
my
being; that now and forever I am yours—yours, my
beloved. It is almost three o'clock. My soul reaches
out to yours—my prayers. I'll keep up a brave heart
for Virginia and for you, my darling.
Your
Soldier
Gettysburg, July 3, 1863
