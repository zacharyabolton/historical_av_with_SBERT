GENERAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
good as this ryersweet potato blend! And think of
your thoughtfulness in wrapping blankets around the
jugs to keep the coffee hot. Bless your thoughtful
heart! You are, without doubt, the dearest, most in
defatigable little piece of perfection that ever rode a
horse or buttered a biscuit or plucked a flower or ever
did anything else, as to that. Then those hyacinths and
geranium leaves. Who else in all this nerve-racking,
starving, perilous time would have thought of gather,
ing flowers? My boy Bob, the loyal but unapprecia,
tive scamp, apologetically took out the baskets, which
were apparently filled with the yet dew-kissed fra.
grant flowers, and said:
“Miss Sallie, Marse George, done en sont you all
dese yer endoubled hyacinfs. En I axed her huccome
she sont 'em; but she aint say. So ef you all don't lak
'em you all mus' 'scuse her fum it en put all de blame
’pon me. En anyhow, Marse George, ef you cyan't
eat dese hyacinfses ner w’ar 'em ner shoot de Yankees
wid 'em, dey suttinly does smell good and dey sho' is
pretty.”
Mrs. Stratton and Mrs. Johnson sent out large
hampers, too, to us. They came just after we had
gotten through with
your baskets, so we passed them
on to the others.
