VIOLENT storm was raging, flooding the level
ground, as I wrote you last, followed the next
day by one of fire and blood — the Battle of Seven
Pines.
I pray, my prettice, that you accepted theinvitation of your mountain chum, and that your
beautiful
eyes and tender heart have been spared the horrors of
war which this battle must have poured into sad Richmond. Three hundred and fifty of your soldier's bri
gade, 1700 strong, were killed or wounded, and all
fought as Virginians should, fighting as they did for
the right, for love, honor, home and state — principles which they had been taught from the mothers'
knees, the schoolroom and the pulpit.
Under orders from Old Peter,* we marched at
daylight and reported to D. H. Hill, near Seven Pines.
Hill directed me to ride over and communicate with
Hood. I started at once with Charlie and Archer, of
my staff, to obey this order, but had gone only a short
distance when we met a part of the Louisiana Zou.
aves, in panic. I managed to seize and detain one fellow, mounted on a mule that seemed to have imbibed
his rider's fear and haste. The man dropped his plunder and seizing his carbine threatened to kill me un
less I released him at once, saying that the Yankees
were upon his heels. We galloped back to Hill's headquarters — Archer bringing up the rear with the
Zouave, who explained that the enemy were advancing in force and were within a few hundred yards of
us. Hill ordered me to attack at once, which I did,
driving them through an abatis over a crossroad leading to the railroad.
As we were nearing the second abatis, I, on foot
at the time, noticed that Armistead's Brigade had
broken, and sent a courier back posthaste to Hill for
troops. A second and third message were sent and
then a fourth, telling him that if he would send
me more troops and ammunition we could drive the
enemy across the Chickahominy. But alas, Hill, as
brave, as great, as heroic a soldier as he is, has, since
the fall of Johnston, been so bothered and annoyed
with countermanding orders that he was, if I may
say so, addled, confused. After this delay nothing was
left for us but to withdraw. Hill sent two regiments
of Colston's Brigade, and ordered Mahone's Brigade
on my right, and at one o'clock at night, under his
orders, we withdrew in perfect form while the enemy
retreated to their bosky cover.
Thus, my darling, was ended the Battle of Seven
Pines. No shot was fired afterward. Oh, how I wish I
could say it ended all battles and that the last shot that
will ever be heard was fired on June first, 1862. What
a change love does make! How tender all things
become to a heart touched by love—how beautiful
the beautiful is and how abhorrent is evil! See, my
darling, see what power you have. Guard it well.
I have heard that
my
dear old friend, McClellan,
is lying ill about ten miles from here. May some loving, soothing hand minister to him. He was, he is and
he will always be, even were his pistol pointed at my
heart, my dear, loved friend. May God bless him and
spare his life. You, my darling, may not be in sympathy with this feeling, for I know you see ‘no good
in Nazareth.' Forgive me for feeling differently from
you, my Sallie, and please don't love me any the less.
You cannot understand the entente cordiale between
us old fellows.'
Faithfully,
Your
Soldier
LL last night, my darling Sallie, the spirit of my
dear mother seemed to hover over me. When
she was living, and I used to feel in that way, I always,
as sure as fate, received from her a letter written at
the very time that I had the sensation of her
presence.
I wonder if up there she is watching over me, trying
to send me some message — some warning. I wish I
knew.
This morning my brigade moved from its cantonments on the Williamsburg road and, by daybreak,
was marching along the Mechanicsville turnpike,
leading north of Richmond. The destination and character of the expedition is unknown; but the position
of other troops indicates a general movement. This
evening we crossed the Chickahominy and are bivouacked on our guns in the road in front of Mechan
icsville, from which point I am blessing my spirit and
refreshing my soul by sending a message to my promised wife. I am tired and sleepy, several times to
day going to sleep on my horse.
This war was really never contemplated in earnest.
I believe if either the North or the South had expected that their differences would result in this ob
stinate struggle, the cold blooded Puritan and the cock
hatted Huguenot and Cavalier would have made a
compromise. Poor old Virginia came oftener than
Noah's dove with her olive branch and though she der
sired to be loyal to the Union of States she did not believe in the right of coercion, and when called upon
to furnish troops to restrain her sister states she refused, and would not even permit the passage
armed force through her domain for that purpose.
With no thought of cost, no consideration of disparity of relative strength or conditions, she rolled up her
sleeves, ready to risk all in defense of a principle consecrated by the blood of her fathers. And now, alas,
it is too late. We must carry through this bitter task
unto the end. May the end be soon!
Your
Soldier
T is only when you are here with me, my darling,
that I am not chafing, fretting, under my enforced
absence from
my command. As poor a marksman as
the Yankee was who shot me, I wish he had been
poorer still, aiming, as he must have been, either at
my head or my heart and breaking my wing. He was
frightened, too, I suspect, and had, besides, too much
powder in his load. What did you want with that shot
smoked, burnt coat sleeve? The arm it held is yours,
to work for
you, my love, for always.
Impatient and restive as I am to get back to the
field, letters and reports just received show me that I
am not missed, and that my gallant old brigade is
proving its valor as loyally under its new leader as
when it so fearlessly followed your soldier. It held
Waterloo Bridge against Pope while Jackson crossed
the Rappahannock, and on the afternoon of the 30th
received and repelled the onset of Fitz John Porter,
magnificently clearing the field and winning a victory
for our arms.
The news came, too, this morning of the death of
you
and shield
Kearny, one of the most brilliant generals of the
Federal Army, a man whose fame as a soldier is worldwide. I knew him first in Mexico, where, as you
know, he lost an arm at the siege of Mexico City. In
Algeria he won the Cross of the Legion of Honor. He
fought with the French in the battles of Magenta and
Solferino and received also from Napoleon Third the
decoration of the Legion of Honor. I wish we had
taken him prisoner instead of shooting him. I hate to
have such a man as Kearny killed. Marse Robert, who
was his old friend, sent his body to Pope under a flag
of truce. I am glad he did that — poor old Kearny!
The same courier brought the sad news that our
Ewell had lost a leg and our Talliaferro had been
wounded. And these are the horrors to which, when

from
you, my beautiful darling, your soldier is
impatient to return.
Never, never did men, since the world began, fight
like ours! The Duke of Somerset, who sneeringly
laughed when he saw our ragged, dirty, barefooted
soldiers — “Mostly beardless boys," as he said — took
off his hat in reverence when he saw them fight.
Lovingly,

Minnegerode asked me this morning when he called,
“Who sent the beautiful flowers?” Bob, to save me
from answering, said, “De same young lady sont deflowers, Marse Doctor, dat 'broidered dat

Marse George, en 'broidered dem dar slippers he's got
on, en sont him de 'broidered stars dat he w'ars on
his coat when he w'ars it; but dat young lady ain't
de onlyest young lady dat sends Marse George flowers
en things. Nor, Suh.”
The dear old doctor understood; he winked at me
and changed the subject. He is as loyal to the South,
dear old fellow, as if his ancestors had landed at
Jamestown. When he asked after my wound he said
he would like to pray with me, though the dear old
man pronounced it, with his German accent, 'bray.'
And that reminded me of a story, and instead of having my thoughts and my heart set upon his beautiful
prayer as I should have --- miserable sinner that I was!
- I began thinking of Tom August, who said that
one Sunday someone meeting him coming out of Old
St. Paul's asked him what was the matter. He replied,
Oh, nothing. I'm not a jackass and I'm not going to
bray, and old Doctor Minnegerode not only insists
that I, but that his whole congregation, shall • bray.'
I, for one, will not do it and I don't want to make a
row about it; so I came out. I wonder what the effect
would be if we took him literally and did all • bray'?”
Now, my darling, forgive this foolish story. I
learned to like story telling, listening as a boy to the
best story-teller in the world, Mr. Lincoln.
Even the bird knows you are not coming to day,
for he doesn't sing. I shall hold you to the last line of
your sweet note, which says, “I'll come to you, my
soldier, before the flowers die.” When Bob asked me,
• Is Miss Sallie comin' dis ebenin' er in de mornin'?”
I answered, “She does not mention any set time, Bob.
She only says she'll come before the flowers die.”
“De flowers ain't waxinated flowers, is dey, Marse
George?” he asked. “Den if dey ain't waxinated
’twon't be long fo' she is here."
When I asked him to hold the paper while I wrote,
he humbly, beseechingly asked, “Please, Suh, Marse
George, ef hit ain't axin' too much, when

said, “Hold that paper steady, Sir, and don't you let it

grinned.

Your own
Soldier
DARLING, my heart turns to you with a love so
great that pain follows in its wake. You cannot
understand this, my beautiful, bright-eyed, sunny
hearted princess? Your face is the sweetest face in all
the world, mirroring, as it does, all that is pure and unselfish, and I must not cast a shadow over it by the
fears that come to me, in spite of myself. No, a soldier should not know fear of any kind. I must fight
and plan and hope, and you must pray; pray for a realization of all our beautiful dreams, sitting beside our
own hearthstone in our own home — you
my goddess of devotion, and I your devoted slave.
Words cannot express my devotion, though, my darling, nor any known language my admiration and
worship. At your feet your unworthy soldier bows in
homage. All his soul, all his heart, yours now and forever. May God in his mercy spare his life and make
it worthy of you!
and I, you
My shoulder and arm are still quite stiff, and I cannot yet put my sleeve on the wounded arm. I have on
one sleeve, and my coat is thrown over my other
shoulder and arm. I can reach my mouth with my
hand by bending my neck way over; so I am not helpless. Bob still buttons my collar, and does some other
little services. Until I have more control of my arm,
however, I shall confine myself to riding old Black, and
not venture on Lucy. Enough of so small a matter.
My boys are delighted to welcome me back, showing their affection for me in many, many ways. Gars
nett is still in command of my dear old brigade,
which was temporarily turned over to him when I was
wounded and which, under his gallant leadership, has
sustained its old reputation for fearlessness and endurance. I miss dear, familiar faces, for many of the brave
fellows have been killed and wounded. You have
heard me speak of Colonel Strange—a gallant soldier.
He was wounded and left behind. After he was shot,
the plucky old chap called out in a loud, clear voice,
“Stand firm, boys; stand firm."
Well, the Yankees won the battle, but McClellan's
delay in winning enabled Old Jack* to seize Harper's
Ferry, so it was not so great a victory for them after
all. Old Jack's note to Marse Robert, telling him of
his success, was characteristic in both brevity and dic,

tion. He said, “Through God's mercy Harper's Ferry
and its garrison are to be surrendered.”
The seventeenth following is recorded in letters of
blood for both armies, and in its wake came Lincoln's
great political victory, proving the might of the pen,
in his Emancipation Proclamation — winning with it
the greatest victory yet for the North. It will behoove
us now to heed well the old story of. The Lark and the
Husbandman', for it will be farewell to all foreign intervention unless Greek meets Greek and we fight fire
with fire and we, too, issue an Emancipation Proclamation. I pray God that the powers that reign will
have the wisdom and foresight to see this in its true
and all-pervading light. It would end the war, and I
should assume as soon as practicable the rôle of schoolmaster and husband to the brightest little pupil and
the sweetest little wife in all the world.
I'll write more later on. I've had many interruptions and now I must stop. I don't want to, though.
Oh, why do I love you so? Was ever sweetheart so
loved before as my Sallie is loved by her own devoted
Soldier
P.S. Have been placed temporarily in command
of a division.
MAY I hope, my precious, that when another
year rolls by we can celebrate the anniversary
of this day by announcing our marriage? Today I
was officially promoted to the rank of Major General
and permanently placed in command of a division.
My dear old brigade, which I love and which was
with me in the battles of Williamsburg, Seven Pines
and Gaines's Mill, was assigned to Dick Garnett and
there comes somehow, in spite of everything, a little
• kind of curious' feeling within when I hear it called
•Garnett's Brigade', even though he has been in
command of it almost ever since I was wounded and
has won for it distinction and from it love and respect.
Old Dick is a fine fellow, a brave, splendid soldier.
He was in the Mexican war and was wounded in the
battle of Mexico. He commanded a brigade under
Old Jack, and was for a time in command of the famous old.Stonewall Brigade'. You have not met him,
my sweetheart; but I want you to know him. His
family are from Norfolk. He knows all your people,
and remembers you as a child, and sends you his love.
He is an old bachelor, though, and I don't know about
sending this message it is rather dangerous. No,
no, my sweetheart, I am not afraid. I only wish, as I
told old Dick, that he had a sweetheart just like you.
He is as sensitive and proud as he is fearless and sweet-
spirited, and has felt more keenly than most men
would Old Jack's censure of him at the battle of
Kernstown, when all his ammunition gave out and he
withdrew his brigade from the field, for which he was
arrested and relieved from duty. Old Jack told Lawton that in arresting Garnett he had no reference to
his want of daring, which was surprising for Old Jack
to say, who never explains anything.
Lawton, who is one of his generals, says Old Jack
holds himself as the god of war, giving short, sharp
commands, distinctly, rapidly and decisively, without
consultation or explanation, and disregarding suggestions and remonstrances. Being himself absolutely
fearless, and having unusual mental and moral, as well
as physical, courage, he goes
ahead on his own hook,
asking no advice and resenting interference. He
places no value on human life, caring for nothing so
much as fighting, unless it be praying. Illness, wounds
and all disabilities he defines as inefficiency and indications of a lack of patriotism. Suffering from insom
nia, he often uses his men as a sedative, and when he
can't sleep calls them up, marches them out a few
miles; then marches them back. He never praises his
men for gallantry, because it is their duty to be gallant
and they do not deserve credit for doing their duty.
Well, my own darling, I only pray that God may spare
him to us to see us through. If General Lee had
Grant's resources he would soon end the war; but Old
Jack can do it without resources.
Bless your heart, here I am talking of these old warhorses to my prettice. Well, she knows how entirely
I love her and how I have left in her keeping my soul's
all.
Lovingly and faithfully, my Sallie,
your own
Soldier
HERE we are, my darling, at Fredericksburg, on
the south side of the Rappahannock, half way
between Richmond and Washington, fortified for us
by the hand of the Great Father.
I penciled you a note by old Jackerie* on the 12th
from the foot of the Hills between Hazel Run and the
Telegraph Road. In it I sent a hyacinth, given me by
a pretty lady who came out with beaten biscuit, and
some unwritten and written messages from Old Peter
and Old Jack, Hood, Ewell, Stuart and your
«brothers,' to the someone' to'whom I was writing.
It seems an eternity, my Chulita, since the first of
November when we moved on from Orange Court
House.
I sent you a short note last night after the
day's great battle, telling you that even in the midst of
it all
my
heart and thoughts.
My division, nine thousand strong, is in fine shape.
It was on the field of battle, as a division, for the first
time yesterday, though only one brigade, Kemper's,
was actively engaged. What a day it was, my darling
you were in
- this ever to be remembered by many of us thirteenth of December - dawning auspiciously upon
us, clad in deepest, darkest mourning. A fog such as
would shame London lay over the valley, and through
the dense mist distinctly came the uncanny commands
of the unseen opposing officers. My men were eager to
be in the midst of the fight, and if Hood had not been
so cautious they would probably have immortalized
themselves. Old Peter's orders were that Hood and
myself were to hold our ground of defense, unless we
should see an opportunity to attack the enemy
while
engaged with A. P. Hill on the right. A little after
ten, when the fog had lifted, and Stuart's cannon from
the plain of Massaponax were turned upon
Meade,
and when Franklin's advance left the enemy's flank
open, I went up to Hood and urged him to seize the
opportunity. But he was afraid to assume so great a
responsibility, and sent for permission to Old Peter,
who was with Marse Robert in a different part of the
field. Before his assent and approval were received,
the opportunity, alas, was lost.
If war, my own, is a necessity — and I suppose it
Ι
is— it is a very cruel one. Your soldier's heart almost
stood still as he watched those sons of Erin fearlessly
rush to their death. The brilliant assault on Marye’s
WE crossed the Potomac on the 24th at Williamsport and went into bivouac on the Mary
land side, from which place I sent my Lady, Love along letter and some flowers gathered on the way. We
then went on to Hagerstown, where we met A. P.
Hill's Corps, which had crossed the river farther
down. From Hagerstown I sent to the same and
only Lady Love another letter, which was not only
freighted with all the adoration and devotion of her
soldier's heart, but contained messages from the staff
and promises to take care of him and bring him safely
back to her.
We made no delay at Hagerstown but, passing
through in the rear of Hill's Corps, moved on up
the
Cumberland Valley and bivouacked at Greencastle,
where the most homesick letter of all yet written was
sent to — well, guess whom this time. Why, to the
same Lady, Love, the sweetest, loveliest flower that
ever blossomed to bless and make fairer a beautiful
world — for it is beautiful, betokening in its loveliness nothing of wickedness or woe - nothing of this
-
deadly strife between men who should be brethren of
a great and common cause, as they are the inheritors
of a great and common country.
The officers and men are all in excellent condition,
bright and cheerful, singing songs and telling stories,
full of hope and courage, inspired with absolute faith
and confidence in our success. There is no straggling, no disorder, no dissatisfaction, no plundering,
and there are no desertions. Think of it
-an army of
sixty thousand men marching through the enemy's
country without the least opposition. The object of
this
great movement is, of course, unknown to us. Its
purpose, and our destination, are known at present
only to the Commanding General and his Chief
Lieutenants. The officers and men generally believe
that the intention is entirely to surround the Army of
the Potomac and to place Washington and Baltimore
within our grasp. They think that Marse Robert is
merely threatening the Northern cities, with the
view of suddenly turning down the Susquehanna,
cutting off all railroad connections, destroying all
bridges, throwing his army north of Baltimore and
cutting off Washington, and that Beauregard is to follow on directly from Richmond via Manassas to Wash,
ington, in rear of Hooker, who of course will be in
pursuit of Marse Robert.
Nous verrons.
We reached here this morning, June 27th, the anniversary of the battle of Gaines's Mill, where
your
soldier was wounded. We marched straight through
the town of Chambersburg, which was more deserted
than Goldsmith's village. The stores and houses were
all closed, with here and there groups of uncheerful
Boers of Deutschland descent, earnestly talking, more
sylvan shadows than smiles wreathing their faces. I
had given orders that the bands were not to play; but
as we were marching through the northeastern part
of the city, some young ladies came out onto the veranda of one of the prettiest homes in the town and
asked:
“Would
“ you mind shooting off the bands a bit?”
So the command was given, and the band played
· Home Sweet Home', · Annie Laurie', 'Her Bright
Smile Haunts Me Still, *Nellie Gray', and · Hazel
Dell.' The
young
ladies asked the next band that
passed if they wouldn't play · Dixie'. But the band
instead struck
up
• The Old Oaken Bucket, “The
Swanee River', The Old Arm Chair', The Lone
Rock by the Sea', and · Auld Lang Syne'.
Thought you was rebels. Where'd you come
from anyhow? Can't play Dixie', none of you?" they
called out. We marched straight on through the city,
and are camped four miles beyond the town, on the
York River road.
Tomorrow, if you'll promise not to divulge it to a
human soul, I'll tell you a great secret. No, my Sallie,
I can't wait till to.morrow. I'll tell you right now. So
listen and cross your heart that you won't tell. I love
you
- love you— love you,
and oh, little one, I want
to see you so. That is the secret.
A Dios. With my heart at your feet, and my happiness in your hands, I am,
Lovingly and forever,
Your
Soldier
I WISH, my Sallie, you could see this wonderfully
rich and prosperous country, abounding in plenty,
with its great, strong, vigorous horses and oxen, its
cows and crops and verdantly thriving vegetation
none of the ravages of war, no signs of devastation -
all in woeful contrast to the land where we lay dreaming. All the time I break the law “Thou shalt not
covet, for every fine horse or cow I see I want for
my darling, and all the pretty things I see besides.
Never mind, she shall have everything some day,
and I shall have the universe and heaven's choicest
gift when she is my wife — all my very own.
At Chambersburg, Marse Robert preached us a
sermon, first instructing us in the meaning of meum'
and teum', and then taking as his text, “Vengeance
is Mine, saith the Lord'. I observed that the mourners' bench was not overcrowded with seekers for con
version. The poor fellows were thinking of their own
despoiled homes, looted of everything, and were not
wildly enthusiastic as they obediently acquiesced to
our beloved Commander's order. The Yanks have
taken into the mountains and across the Susquehanna
all the supplies they could, and we pay liberally for
those which we are compelled to take, giving them
money which is paid to us, our own Confederate
script. Some of us have a few pieces of gold with
which to purchase some keepsake or token for the
dear ones at home. Alas, my little one,
how
many
of
us will be blessed with the giving of them? God in
His mercy be our Commander-in-Chief. .
We have not a wide field for selection here, as we
once had at Price's dry goods store or John Tyler's
jewelry establishment in Richmond; but it seems
quite magnificent to us now, since the Richmond
counters are so bare as to offer not even a wedding ring
or a yard of calico. We are guying General C-
who, after long and grave deliberation, bought three
hoop skirts as a present for his betrothed.
All that makes life dear is the thought of seeing

Well, Sallie mine, the long, wearying march from
Chambersburg, through dust and heat beyond compare, brought us here yesterday (a few miles from
Gettysburg). Though my poor men were almost exhausted by the march in the intense heat, I felt that
the exigencies demanded my assuring Marse Robert
that we had arrived and that, with a few hours' rest,
my men would be equal to anything he might require
of them. I sent Walter with my message and rode on
myself to Little Round Top to see Old Peter, who, I
tell you, was mighty glad to see me. And now, just
think of it, though the old war horse was watching
A. P. Hill's attack upon the center and Hood and
McLaws of his own corps, who had struck Sickles, he
turned, and before referring to the fighting or asking
about the march, inquired after you, my darling.
While we were watching the fight, Walter came back
with Marse Robert's reply to my message,
which was
in part: “Tell Pickett I'm glad that he has come, that
I can always depend upon him and his men, but that
I shall not want him this evening."
my very soul that
We have been on the qui vive, my Sallie, since
midnight; and as early as three o'clock were on the
march. About half past three, Gary's pistol signaled
the Yankees' attack upon Culp's Hill, and with its
echo a wail of regret went up
from
the other two brigades of my old division had been left
behind. Oh, God! — if only I had them! — a surety
for the honor of Virginia, for I can depend upon them,
little one. They know your soldier and would follow
him into the very jaws of death, and he will need
them— right there, too, before he's through.
At early dawn, darkened by the threatening rain,
Armistead, Garnett, Kemper and your
soldier held a
heart to heart powwow.
All three sent regards to you, and Old Lewis pulled
a ring from his little finger and, making me take it,
said, “Give this little token, George, please, to her of
the sunset eyes, with my love, and tell her the old
since he could not be the lucky dog he's
mighty glad that
you
are.”

Dear old Lewis— dear old •Lo', as Magruder
always called him, being short for Lothario. Well,
my Sallie, I'll keep the ring for you, and some day I'll
take it to John Tyler and have it made into a breast
pin and set around with rubies and diamonds and
emeralds. You will be the pearl, the other jewel.
Dear old Lewis !
Just as we three separated to go our different ways
after silently clasping hands, our fears and prayers
voiced in the “Good luck, old man,” a summons
came from Old Peter, and I immediately rode to the
top of the ridge where he and Marse Robert were
making a reconnaissance of Meade's position. “Great
God!” said Old Peter as I came up. “Look, General
Lee, at the insurmountable difficulties between our
line and that of the Yankees - the
hills — the
tiers of artillery — the fences — the heavy skirmish
line — And then we'll have to fight our infantry
against their batteries. Look at the ground we'll
steep
have to charge over, nearly a mile of that open
ground there under the rain of their canister and
shrapnel.”
“The
enemy is there, General Longstreet, and I
am going to strike him," said Marse Robert in his
firm, quiet, determined voice.
About 8 o'clock I rode with them along our line of
prostrate infantry. They had been told to lie down to
prevent attracting attention, and though they had
been forbidden to cheer they voluntarily arose and
lifted in reverential adoration their caps to our beloved commander as we rode slowly along. Oh, the
responsibility for the lives of such men as these!
Well, my darling, their fate and that of our beloved
Southland will be settled ere your glorious brown
eyes rest on these scraps of penciled paper --your
—your
soldier's last letter, perhaps.
Our line of battle faces Cemetery Ridge. Our detachments have been thrown forward to support our
artillery which stretches over a mile along the crests
of Oak Ridge and Seminary Ridge. Themen are lying
in the rear, my darling, and the hot July sun poursits
scorching rays almost vertically down upon them. The
suffering and waiting are almost unbearable.
Well, my
sweetheart, at one o'clock the awful silence was broken by a cannon-shot, and then another,
and then more than a hundred guns shook the hills
from crest to base, answered by more than another
hundred- the whole world a blazing volcano— the
whole of heaven a thunderbolt - then darkness and
absolute silence—then the grim and gruesome, lowo
spoken commands — then the forming of the attacking columns. My brave Virginians are to attack in
front. Oh, God in mercy help me as He never helped
before!
I have ridden up to report to Old Peter. I shall
give him this letter to mail to you and a package to
give you if — Oh, my darling, do you feel the love of
my heart, the prayer, as I write that fatal word
if'?
Old Peter laid his hand over mine and said :-
“I know, George, I know — but I can't do it, boy.
Alexander has
my instructions. He will give you the
order." There was silence, and his hand still rested on
mine when a courier rode up and handed me a note
from Alexander.
Now, I go; but remember always that I love you
with all
my
heart and soul, with every
fiber of
my
being; that now and forever I am yours—yours, my
beloved. It is almost three o'clock. My soul reaches
out to yours—my prayers. I'll keep up a brave heart
for Virginia and for you, my darling.
Your
Soldier
MY letter of yesterday, my darling, written ber
fore the battle, was full of hope and cheer;
even though it told you of the long hours of waiting
from four in the morning, when Gary's pistol rang
out from the Federal lines signaling the attack upon
Culp's Hill, to the solemn eight o'clock review of my
men, who rose and stood silently lifting their hats in
loving reverence as Marse Robert, Old Peter and your
own soldier reviewed them— on then to the deadly
stillness of the five hours following, when the men lay
in the tall grass in the rear of the artillery line, the
July sun pouring its scorching rays almost vertically
down
upon
them, till one o'clock when the awful silence of the vast battlefield was broken by a cannon
shot which opened the greatest artillery duel of the
world. The firing lasted two hours. When it ceased
we took advantage of the blackened field and in the
glowering darkness formed our attacking column just
before the brow of Seminary Ridge.
I closed my letter to you a little before three
o'clock and rode up to Old Peter for orders. I found
fire upon
him like a great lion at bay. I have never seen him so
grave and troubled. For several minutes after I had
saluted him he looked at me without speaking. Then
in an agonized voice, the reserve all gone, he said:
Pickett, I am being crucified at the thought of
the sacrifice of life which this attack will make. I
have instructed Alexander to watch the effect of our
the
enemy, and when it begins to tell he
must take the responsibility and give you your orders,
for I can't.”
While he was yet speaking a note was brought tome from Alexander. After reading it I handed it to
him, asking if I should obey and go forward. He
looked at me for a moment, then held out his hand.
Presently, clasping his other hand over mine without
speaking he bowed his head upon his breast. I shall
never forget the look in his face nor the clasp of his
hand when I said: “Then, General, I shall lead my
Division on.” I had ridden only a few paces
when I
remembered
letter and (forgive me) thoughtlessly scribbled in a corner of the envelope, “If Old
Peter's nod means death then good-by and God bless
you, little one,” turned back and asked the dear old
chief if he would be good enough to mail it for me.
As he took your letter from me, my darling, I saw
your
tears glistening on his cheeks and beard. The stern
old warrhorse, God bless him, was weeping for his
men and, I know, praying too that this cup might pass
from them. I obeyed the silent assent of his bowed
head, an assent given against his own convictions, –
given in anguish and with reluctance.
My brave boys were full of hope and confident of
victory as I led them forth, forming them in column
of attack, and though officers and men alike knew
what was before them, — knew the odds against
them, — they eagerly offered up their lives on the
altar of duty, having absolute faith in their ultimate
success. Over on Cemetery Ridge the Federals beheld a scene never before witnessed on this conti,
nent, — a scene which has never previously been enacted and can never take place again — an army
forming in line of battle in full view, under their
very eyes — charging across a space nearly a mile in
length over fields of waving grain and anon of stubble
and then a smooth expanse - moving with thsteadiness of a dress parade, the pride and glory soon to be
crushed by an overwhelming heartbreak.*
Well, it is all over now. The battle is lost, and
many of us are prisoners, many are dead, many
wounded, bleeding and dying. Your soldier lives and
mourns and but for you, my darling, he would rather,
a million times rather, be back there with his dead,
to sleep for all time in an unknown grave.
Your sorrowing
Soldier
ON the Fourth — far from a glorious Fourth to
us or to any
with love for his fellow-men-I
wrote you just a line of heart-break. The sacrifice of
life on that blood-soaked field on the fatal third was
too awful for the heralding of victory, even for our
victorious foe, who, I think, believe as we do, that
it decided the fate of our cause. Nowords can picture
the anguish of that roll-call — the breathless waits between the responses. The “Here” of those who, by
God's mercy, had miraculously escaped the awful rain
of shot and shell was a sob—a gasp-a knell - for
the unanswered name of his comrade called before
his. There was no tone of thankfulness for having
been spared to answer to their names, but rather a toll,
and an unvoiced wish that they, too, had been among
the missing.
But for the blight to your sweet young life, but for
you, only you, my darling, your soldier would rather
by far be out there, too, with his brave Virginians —
dead
Even now I can hear them cheering as I gave the
Manassas and Chester, where we had a brilliant skirmish with the enemy. For three days and nights I
have been almost constantly in the saddle. Last night,
the 22d, I had a tent pitched, and sat down to a meal
at a camp table, the first time since leaving Bunker
Hill. We had been going .al fresco'. When we did
sleep it was with the heavens for a canopy and a
fence rail for a pillow. We shall be here three or four
days, perhaps longer.
I thank the great and good God that he has spared
me to come back and claim your promise, and I pray
your womanly assistance in helping me to its immediate fulfilment. This is no time for ceremonies. The
future is all uncertain, and it is impossible for me to
call a moment my own. Again, with all the graves
I
have left behind me, and with all the wretchedness
and misery this fated campaign has made, we would
not wish anything but a very silent, very quiet wedding, planning only the sacrament and blessing of the
church, and, after that, back to my division and to
the blessing of those few of them who, by God's miracle, were left.
I gave Colonel Harrison a gold luck piece which
I
was a parting gift to me from the officers of the Pacific, and told him to have it made into a wedding
ring at Tyler's. I asked him to have engraved within
“G. E. P. and S. C. Married —," and to leave
sufficient
space
for date and motto, which
you
would
direct.

Soldier
LD Peter is to go to Tennessee to reënforce
Bragg. He has placed his plans before the Secretary of War.
Now, my darling, I have just had a long powwow with him (Old Peter) who, 'old war horse'
as he is, has been in love himself, is still in love,
will always be in love, and knows of our love — of
our plighted troth — and knowing it, tells me it is
his purpose to take me with him on this proposed
expedition.
Now, my Sallie, your soldier is a soldier, and never,
even to himself, questions an order. "His not to reason
why.' Darling, do you know what this means? Why,
my little one, it means that you haven't one moment's
respite. It means that you are to be Mrs. General
George E. Pickett, my precious wife, right away. It
means that you are to fufill your promise to come tome at a moment's notice'. Yours, too, now, not to
will meet you
reason why', but to obey and come at once. We cannot brook
any delay, my sweetheart; so pack up your
knapsack — never mind the rations and the ammunition—come! My Aunt Olivia and Uncle Andrew,
Johnston and one of my staff and one of my couriers
and
your
dear
parents on this side of
the Black Water and will escort you to Petersburg,
where I shall be waiting at the train to meet you. I
shall see you all to the hotel, where you will wait while
your father, Bright and I get the license and make
other necessary arrangements for our immediate marriage, which I have planned to take place at St. Paul's
Church. Our old friend, Doctor Platt, will pronounce
the words that make us one in the sight of the world.
From the church, we will go to the depot, where a
special train, having been arranged for us by our
friend, Mr. Reuben Raglan, God bless him, will take
us over to Richmond, where my little sister is waiting longingly to love and welcome
my
wife - her
new sister.
My darling will realize how impossible it is for her
soldier to consult with her and will forgive his bungling and awkwardness. Never mind, after this she
shall do all the planning. Oh, what a heaven on earth
is before us — if only this cruel war were over! A
Dios. Forgive this business letter. Courier awaits.
You will come; I have no fear.
Forever, your
Soldier
I have intrusted my courier with some messages
and other instructions — the word key.

IT seems an age, my darling, since we rode away,

looking as a horse as St. Paul has been described as a
man, and while he has not had one, much less five,
shipwrecks, he has had all manner of hairbreadth escapes, hardships, indignities and a million times more
stripes, all of which he has borne with Christian resignation and endurance.
Well, dearest, my name is George and my patience
and temper accord with the name. Our well-formed
plans for the capture of Newbern miscarried. Hoke's,
Clingman's, and Corse's Brigades, and Reid's Artillery, under my command were to make a feint — to
threaten on the south side of the Neuse River. Dear
ing's Cavalry and three regiments of infantry under
Dearing were to make a demonstration on the north
side of the Neuse. Ransom, Barton, and Terry under
Barton were to make the real attack, while we created
a diversion and drew off the enemy. Simultaneously
with our movements Colonel R. Taylor Wood was to
take a naval force in small boats, make a night excursion down the Neuse and attack the gunboats. The
soldiers were all jubilant, buoyant and hopeful. Everything was propitious; victory seemed sure. General
Dearing's feint was successful — Hoke and Corse and
Clingman crossed over, taking all the defenses and
outworks in front - Wood's attack was a complete
surprise, capturing a gunboat right under the guns of
the fort - but, alas, the real attack by Barton was not
made! We waited in deathlike suspense. Hour after
hour of restless anxiety and impatience went by and
yet no sound of a gun and no message came to tell
me why. The torture and suspense were unbearable.
Newbern was ours —ours if — Well — hope died out
and the dejection and despair of the men with their
expectations dashed cannot be told. Barton's report
to me today, through Bright, was that the defenses
of the enemy were too formidable’. My orders to him
were that if he found it impracticable to perform his
part
he was to come at once to me and let me try a
coup de main.
As ever
Your
Soldier
YOUR soldier breathes easier this morning, my
darling. A great load is lifted. Haygood's brave
South Carolina Brigade came in yesterday, thank God,
and I stationed them at Port Walthall Junction. This
will keep the connection between Petersburg and
Richmond open. Wise's Brigade got in today and
was sent out toward City Point.
For nights I have not closed my eyes. How could
I, with a whole city full of helpless, defenseless women
and children at the mercy of an oncoming army?
Butler's whole force, in transports protected by his
gunboats, landed at City Point and Bermuda Hundred, and no army here to meet them! Not enough
soldiers, boys and old men all put together, even for
picket duty!
Come to think of it, my prettice, you must have
been
up all night to have gotten up and sent out such
a basket of goodies, and baked and buttered such a lot
of biscuit, and made so many jugs of coffee as came
this morning. My, I tell you it all tasted good, and the
coffee — well, no Mocha or Java ever tasted half so
good as this ryersweet potato blend! And think of
your thoughtfulness in wrapping blankets around the
jugs to keep the coffee hot. Bless your thoughtful
heart! You are, without doubt, the dearest, most indefatigable little piece of perfection that ever rode a
horse or buttered a biscuit or plucked a flower or ever
did anything else, as to that. Then those hyacinths and
geranium leaves. Who else in all this nerve-racking,
starving, perilous time would have thought of gathering flowers? My boy Bob, the loyal but unapprecia,
tive scamp, apologetically took out the baskets, which
were apparently filled with the yet dew-kissed fragrant flowers, and said:
“Miss Sallie, Marse George, done en sont you all
dese yer endoubled hyacinfs. En I axed her huccome
she sont 'em; but she aint say. So ef you all don't lak
'em you all mus' 'scuse her fum it en put all de blame
’pon me. En anyhow, Marse George, ef you cyan'teat dese hyacinfses ner w’ar 'em ner shoot de Yankees
wid 'em, dey suttinly does smell good and dey sho' is
pretty.”
Mrs. Stratton and Mrs. Johnson sent out large
hampers, too, to us. They came just after we had
gotten through with
your baskets, so we passed them
on to the others.

soldier told you
And now, my darling, what on earth did
you
by saying, “Never mind,” as you said good-by and rode
away yesterday. It troubled me all night. I wanted to
follow after
you
and ask
you
what
you meant, but
couldn't. I would have jumped on Lucy and ridden
into Petersburg and found out if it had been possible
for me to leave. I was so troubled about it that I was
almost tempted to come in anyhow. But for the life
of me, little one, I couldn't think of any reason why
you
should
say,
“Never mind,” to me. Were you
aggrieved, my darling, because your blundering old
there was no necessity
for
your coming out to bring the dispatches, any longer; that,
thank heaven, the recruits and reënforcements were
coming in now, and that we could manage all right?
I did not mean to hurt you, dear. I hoped you'd send
a line by Bob telling me what you meant and why
you had said it, but when I asked him if you had
written, he said:
“Yas, Suh, Marse George, 'course de mistis is done
en writ a letter er answer er sumpin'; but ef she done

Now, please, my darling, send Bob back right
away with a nice letter and tell
your
soldier that
you
did not mean anything by saying, “ Never mind,” to
him, for he loves you with all his heart and would not
wound or disappoint or offend you for anything in the
world.

AIRD has just come in from the lines, my darling wife, and reports that all is well. I came in
about eleven and was lying in my tent all alone, thinking of you, and while I builded wonderful castles I was
serenading you
with the
songs
I love.
I think I had finished all the songs I had ever sung
to you, and when Baird came in my thoughts had
wandered to the Salmon Illahie and I was singing
Anne Boleyn's song, 'Oh Death, Rock Me Asleep',
which was taught me by my friend, Captain G. P.
Hornby, of Her Majesty's ship Tribune, away out in
San Juan Island on the Pacific Coast in 1859. I do not
know why I was singing this song, except that it is
beautiful and one of the finest and sweetest of melodies. Both the air and words were written by poor,
unfortunate Anne Boleyn. I know but one verse—if
Hornby ever knew other verses he had forgotten
them - but the one I know is appealing. I will write
it for
you,
if I
may:
“Oh, Death, rock me asleep! Bring me to quiet and rest;
Let pass my weary, guiltless life out of my careful breast;
Toll on the passing bell, ring out my doleful knell;
Let thy sound my death tell. Death doth draw me,
Death doth draw me. There is no remedy."
Baird stopped outside and listened and then came
in, asking permission to order Bob to light the dips,
and saying, “Please, Sir, Marse George, when you
sing that song I haven't got a friend in the world. I'm
lonesome and feel creeps and see spooks and, what's
worse, I don't know whether I am Anne Boleyn herself, or am myself responsible for all poor Anne's
sorrows and death."
So I stopped singing and am writing to tell you a
great secret, which is - I love you. Some day when
we are happy—so happy that nothing could make
us any happier — I'll sing this
you.
Last night there was a night attack. Several of the
men were wounded slightly; but the face of one-
perhaps seriously wounded — haunts me. He is a boy
with golden brown curls—somebody's darling. Tonight, we made a capture of the Federal pickets,
sweeping their rifle pits for more than a hundred
yards and taking a hundred and thirty-six prisoners.
You know our lines are so close together in many
places that we, the Yankees and my men, can with
voices raised carry on a conversation.
War and its horrors, and yet I sing and whistle.
song to
Oh, my sweetheart, if only this wicked war were over
so that we could in peace and quiet tranquilly finish
the book of Love which we have but just begun.
Adios now. I see old Jackerie in the flap with his
pack and bag, his wonted grace and patience, his
dolce-far-niente eyes and soft, southern Italian voice,
saying, “No hulla-nonenty.” But I must hurry, for he
starts at daybreak and it is now past midnight.
Lovingly now and forever,
Your
Soldier
HAVE just this moment returned from a visit to
the lines, where I have been since early this morning. Today, my precious, has only been a duplicate
of yesterday. Thank God I have at last, if not too late,
gotten a line laid out on my right flank. The 'Ides of
March' are upon us! Grant says he intends taking his
4th of July dinner in Richmond. I have been hard at
work, my pet, trying in every way
with
my
limited
force to strengthen my front. This has been done by
my division, but on the right of my line, towards the
Appomattox, it has been impossible for me to accomplish anything, troops have been put in and re,
moved, so often. However, now I know what I have
to overcome, and will try and do it - I hate uncertainties.
Your sweet letter of this morning came as a true
messenger of love. I was so very, very anxious about
you. My own wife, keep up your heart bravely, and
think of your husband who lives but for
I
would, my prettice, give any thing in the world —
any thing — to see you
- to see you this evening. God knows, I do
want to kiss
you and call
you my own. Remember
how much I am longing for you. A Dios, my Sallie.
I send you by this mail a little butter. It is all I can
find. I had a pretty little flower, but it withered in the
intensely hot sun.
Your devoted
Soldier
HERE we are still, my Sallie. My division is
stationed with the rest of the First Corps between new and old Cold Harbor. Old Peter, having
been wounded in the Wilderness, Anderson has been
put in command of the First Corps. Grant has been
appointed Lieutenant General and has arrived at
nearly the same point in his march down the river
that McClellan reached in his upward progress in ’62.
Over a crimson road both armies, have returned to
Cold Harbor. The Wilderness, alas, is one vast graveyard where sleep thousands of Grant's soldiers; but
Grant, like our Stonewall, is . fighting not to save
lives, but country'.
For the second time now Cold Harbor has become
a battle ground. Two years ago
it furnished the field
for the battle of Gaines's Mill (which the Yankees
called Cold Harbor) where your soldier was wounded.
Does it seem to you as long ago as two years, my darling? To me, it seems but yesterday that I lay in Rich
mond at
my little sister's and you came to see me,
blessing and cheering me. I can feel now the soft
getting a wagon load of things up from Chuckatuck
- but I am almost afraid to trust one through.
Oh, my Sallie, I do want to see you so much. I have
been right sick for a day or two past, but am better today. I had no business to be sick and low spirited,
when God has been so good to us. I fancy, could I only
have seen my own faithful loving wife, and told her
what was uppermost
in
my
mind that I would have
gotten well. Dearest, I will
try
and
get
in some time
this week. A Dios, my sweet. Kiss the little George
for me.
Ever, darling of my heart,
Your own
Soldier
HAVE but a few moments since, my pretty one,
I on
down the other. The enemy occupied Dutch Gap last
evening. This is higher up the river than I am and I
had expected the Navy to take care of our rear but
they have allowed them to come in, and now I have
to stretch out my India rubber division.
Well, I have to do it. The General did not seem in
a remarkably good humor - with the news from Mobile and Bradley, Johnson in the valley, and this im
pudence of the Yankees in crawling up behind us.
I am so glad, my own, that you are better - thank
the good God for it.
I send you a chicken, a cup of salt, likewise an
apple – one single one. Your friend, Miss Gamble,
radiant with a white frock and smiles, sent it to me
(didn't give it) with her compliments last night.
Good-bye, sweet one.
Ever your own

LEFT
my Garden of Eden, my darling, with
many a pause and longing glance behind’; but out
in the midst of this terrible conflict to which I have
come, your love is with me, shielding and blessing me.
I reached camp just before daybreak. George hustled around and made me a pot of sho'nough coffee
a “
wid no bedultrement in it. And while I drank
my
coffee he kept off the flies — which, early as it was,
had begun to be very sociable — entertaining me the
while with news of the camp and his own views on
current events.
“You know, Marse George,” he began, “po' Robert, Marse Jefferson Davis' mos' betrusted servant, is
done en bruck out thick all ober wid de smallpox, en
dar ain' no tellin' how many er de President's frien'sen 'quaintances po' Robert is done en kernockulated

Having finished
my breakfast George went out to
get breakfast for the mess, and before they had assembled I had cleared off my desk and written several
letters. All made affectionate inquiries for you and our
little son, though some of them did not know that I
had ridden in last night until I told them.
I must go now, my Sallie, and ride around the lines
and make
my report,
but will add a few more words
later on. So a Dios till then.
Well, my darling, we have had a most exciting
day. Marse Robert came out. He was restive and
very, very silent. We had just paid our respects to
Butler's diggers when he arrived. The device we used
in so doing was a new one or rather a very old one
newly revived. It was a mortar battery hidden in the
bushes, invisible to the enemy, and easily shifted from
one hiding place to the other. It used to be the only
way
in which shells could be thrown. It throws these
shells high in the air, and they fall by their own
weight without the least warning of their coming.
There is no screaming or squealing sound like that
made by our modern shells. They fall almost as silently as a snowflake falls, and it seems to me almost
barbarous to drop these silent, ghostly missiles down
upon those light-hearted, happy-go-lucky negroes,
for I learn that it is they that are doing the digging.
Butler, with promise of extra pay for extra work and
extra danger, has induced four hundred of his colored
soldiers to volunteer to sheathe their swords and take
up the shovel and go to digging.
The bank to be cut through is only about five feet
at the highest point. The canal is to be where the
James makes a great bend just above Dutch Gap, in
closing a point is land perhaps half a mile wide and
about three miles in length and which at the neck is
only five hundred yards across from river to river.
Their canal would thus save them six miles and would
allow their gunboats to go up the James without running the gauntlet of our Howlett guns, our sunken
torpedoes et cetera. And as our left is all at the turn of
the bend, they would not have to traverse the open
river in search of an exposed water channel. It is
strange that some of our brilliant engineers haven't
made this near cut years ago. As for me, I should encourage Butler and his River Improvement Company,
and cease throwing these stealthy shells whose silent
fall heralds a sudden roar of explosion that strikes terror to my soul. The canal will be an advantage to us,
and Butler, in digging it for us, may in part atone for
the many homes he has destroyed, mine among them.
Well, my own, if you were not the best of all good
women, as well as the most beautiful of all beautiful
women and the most patient of all patient women, you
would weary of so tiresome a soldier, who takes
away
the fragrance of flowers and the glory of love and
sends back the echo of war and its sorrows and the

wouldn't run away and whom I was obliged to permit to be credited to me in order to save him the

After an Evening Spent at the White House'
of the Confederacy
YOU will be glad, my darling wife, that the
•powwow'with the Powers that be' was most
satisfactory.
After the evening consultation I called on the
ladies at the White House' and at the most earnest
entreaty
and solicitation of Mrs. Davis and her sister,
Miss Howell, dined with them. Poor Mr. Davis looks
tired and anxious, but he spoke so hopefully of our
success that, knowing, as he must know, our status,
the condition of our army, etc., I should have thought
that he was aware of something hopeful of which we
are ignorant if he had not said later, when foreign
intervention was being discussed, that he believed
that England and, in fact, all the foreign powers were
like the woman who saw her husband fighting a bear
— she didn't care a continental which was whipped,
but she'd be the best pleased if both were'.
The dinner, my Sallie, was beautiful, and so abundant were its luxuries that I marveled greatly, know
ing, as I do, how difficult it is with most of us to get
even a little tea or coffee or salt. As usual, Mrs. Davis
was vivacious and entertaining. She amusingly described her rescue of a little orphan negro from a
'great black brute' who had constituted himself the
boy's guardian. She told how she had him washed
and combed and dressed in a suit of little Joe's clothes,
and how, while he was proud of the clothes, he was
a thousand times prouder of, and more grateful for,
the cuts and bruises which his self-appointed guardian
had given him and which, upon all occasions, he triumphantly exhibited as medals of honor. She said
that the little rascal was greatly troubled when the
cuts were finally healed and tried to reopen them with
a dog knife which was taken away. He was thenreproved and forbidden to make over his wounds.
“Oh, Lordy,” he howled, “ef you all teks my
sores 'way fum me I won't hab nuttin' 'tall ter show
ter all de comp’ny, en I won't hab a single ting ter
mek 'em all sorry 'bout, en nuttin' ter mek ’ein gib
me no mo'tings. Oh, Lordy, I'd ruther you'd all
whop me dan notter let me hab my sores no mo?.”
With her keen sense of humor Mrs. Davis told us
how, when learning that one after another of her
maids was being bribed by the Yankees with money
and promises to betray the family and come over to
part of the
the other side, she would, pretending ignorance of
the intention, give them food for imagination, reciting for their repetition the most impossible, outland,
ish stories, some of which she told us. She said that
Betty, the last one of her maids to go, was such an excellent maid and so hard to replace that as soon as she
began to show her prosperity, appearing with silks and
jewels and then with gold and notes, she had tried,
without letting Betty suspect her intention, to offer
her inducements to remain, but had failed. Betty, she
said, was superior to her class, however, and showed
her consideration by offering Miss Howell
as yet unearned bribe, and assuring her that “ef eber
she did git de chance ter tell dem dar Yankees 'bout
dey all she suttinly wan't gwine tell 'em none er de
awful scand’lus tings she en Mis' Davis was all de
time ardoin' en dat dey all does. No, she was argwine
ter mek de best er hit en leave outn de worse.
Mrs. Davis said she was so depressed after Betty's
departure and in such dire need of mental soothing
syrup that she went into retirement with Adam
Bede', 'A Country Gentleman in Town'and. Elective
Affinities'. Did
you ever, my darling!
Mr. Judah P. Benjamin and Dr. Minnegerode
were the only other guests. Mr. Benjamin's usually
wonderful, judicial mind and depressing dignity were
not in evidence. He did rather reproachfully express
his astonishment that Mr. Davis should be bowed
down with grief by the adverse criticisms of those he
was trying to serve, and that he should care a bauble
for their accusations of nepotism and the more absurd
charge of leaving his cotton to be bought by the
Yankees. He ended by saying that he continually had
to remind Mr. Davis of that exceedingly good man,
Christ. You know, my own, Benjamin was born at St.
Croix in the West Indies, of Jewish parents.
What a gossip your husband is, my Sallie, but I
promised to write my beautiful tyrant every day,
everything I said or did or that anyone else said or did,
and I have.

In the Dark Days before the End
HIS morning at breakfast, my darling Sallie,
when you suggested having an oyster roast for
my officers after our conference to night, I said that
I feared we should not have enough oysters. Our old
hunter, Gossett, has just brought in a fine large wild
turkey, and with that and the three bushels of
oysters
which
your cle, Colonel Phillips, sent I think we
can get up a
fine
supper.
Don't
you, my marvel of a
housekeeper? I hope you can, and hope, too, that the
good cheer it will provide will help us to new and
encouraging suggestions, for, as hopeful as I always
am, even my heart is in
my
boots.
On every side gloom, dissatisfaction and disappointment seem to have settled over all, men and
officers alike, because of the unsuccessful termination
of the Peace Conference on board the River Queen
on the fatal third. The anxious, despairing faces I see
everywhere bespeak heavy hearts. Our commissioners knew that we were gasping our last
the Peace Conference was a forlorn hope. Because
of the informality of the conference and
my
know
gasp and that
ledge of Mr. Lincoln, his humanity, his broad nature,
his warm heart, I did believe he would take advantage of this very informality and spring some wise,
superhuman surprise which would, somehow, restore
peace and in time insure unity. Now, heaven help
us, it will be war to the knife, with the knife no longer
keen, the thrust of the arm no longer strong, the
certainty that when peace comes
comes it will follow the
tread of the conqueror —

Written in Defeat, after the Battle of Five Forks
T is long past the midnight hour and, like a boy,
I have been reading over your dear, cheery letter,
caressing the written page because it has been touched
hand.
All is quiet now, but soon all will be bustle, for we
march at daylight. Oh, my darling, were there ever
such men as those of my division? This morning after
the review I thanked them for their valiant services
yesterday on the first of April, never to be forgotten
of ,
us, when, to my mind, they fought one of
the most desperate battles of the whole war. Their
answer to me was cheer after cheer, one after another calling out, “That's all right, Marse George!”
and“We only followed you!” Then in the midst of
these calls, silencing them, rose loud and clear dear
old Gentry's voice, singing the old hymn which they
all knew I loved:
“Guide me, oh, thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land.”
Voice after voice joined in till from all along the

“Be my sword and shield and banner,
Be the Lord my righteousness.”

I do not think, my Sallie, the tears sounded in

voice as it mingled with theirs; but they were in my
eyes,
and there was something new in
When the last line had been sung, I gave the order
to march, proceeding to this point where I had expected to cross the Appomattox and rejoin the main
army.
While we were at a halt here orders came from
General R. H. Anderson to report to him at Sutherland's Tavern.
Just after mailing my letter to you at Five Forks,
telling you of our long, continuous march of eighteen
hours and of the strenuous hours following those,
where I had, because of exigent circumstances, been
induced to fall back at daylight, I received a dispatch
from the great Tyee telling me to "hold Five Forks
at all hazards to prevent the enemy from striking the
south side railroad.” This dispatch was in reply to
one I had sent to him reporting the state of affairs and
that the enemy were trying to get in between the
army and my command, and asking that diversion be
made at once or I should be isolated.
I had had all trains parked in the rear of Hatcher's
Run and much preferred that position, but, from the

your blessing
This morning I took my gun and Rufus and killed
five partridges and two rabbits. I gave one rabbit to
Mr. Sims, and one to Uncle Tom. The birds I sent to
Lizzie. As I was coming on home, I stopped and
rested in the cool and calm of the forest, beside the old
gray broken monument where we have so often made
love and told each other fairy tales and wondered about
and made thought pictures of our William and Mary
Randolph, who erected it away back in 1771. I wonder, little one, if from their celestial home they can see
the picturesque beauty which I see and which I wish
I could put into words. Do you remember the inscription on one of the sides of the monument? - " The
foundation of this pillar was laid in 1771, when all the
great rivers of this country were swept by inundations
never before experienced, which changed the face of
nature and left traces of their violence that will remain for ages!” As I read over this inscription I feel
sorry that the thought to erect a monument to commemorate any kind of disaster should ever have been
born. Time's soothing wings bless always, and not only
have the ravages of the flood which this monument
was erected to commemorate been long ago forgotten,
but the memories of ravages and horrors of a yesterday far, far more terrible are, thank God, being ef,
faced.
The birds are nesting, and songs are being born,
just where Butler's vandals mutilated and broke off
the top of this monument, hunting for hidden treasure. Some of the seeds which the mother birds carried
to their young have fallen by the wayside and taken
root, and now out of the jagged, broken top grows a
greenery of unknown vines and plants and flowers.
The old colonial home of my forefathers, with its rare
old mahoganies and paintings, which Butler sacked
and desecrated and then burned, has been replaced by
a sweet little cottage home built by ourselves, all our
very own, and consecrated to love and contentment,
with furnishings so simple and plain that we are not
afraid of using them.
No, my sweetheart, we don't want any monuments

of the woes and horrors of the

and joy, the foundation of which, love, is already laid

He will tell me the same old stories over again, and I
shall listen and laugh as though I heard them for the

Good night — sweet dreams. Angels guard you

through the clouds of old Sims' tobacco smoke, for the
hundredth, yes, for the thousandth, time.
Your lonesome
Soldier
YOU are always right, my darling Sallie, and your
husband is only right when he is guided by you.
Pretty generally he listens to his oracle, and when he
doesn't he wishes to the Lord he had. The morning
I left, when you urged that I wear the suit I had been
wearing and I claimed that I hadn't time to change-
“Then please take it with you and change on the
boat,” you plead. Well, dearest, I was stubborn. I
wouldn't, and I didn't, and
your
obstinate soldier was
not out of sight of the sweet lone figure standing on
the wharf waving to him the love signals and the Godspeed of our code before he was abusing himself as an
ingrate in refusing anything that the dearest, most
beautiful woman and the best wife in the world could
ask of him. Welldem dat dances is 'bleeged ter
pay
de fiddler', and
your husband is paying – he is
being punished, for he caught cold on the boat, had
a chill, followed by sore throat and pain in limbs and
back.
I stopped only a day in Petersburg to see our agent
there, then came over here. At the Exchange, I went
directly to bed and sent for Dr. Beal. He has been very
attentive, coming twice a day. Julia and Wash took
me in charge at once and, as usual, are as good as gold,
and so is everyone, as to that, for each and all in turn
prescribe a sure remedy and urge my taking it. Wash
insists upon rubbing me with “turkentime, en den
puttin' on a hot ingun poultice, en 'pon top er dat
drinkin' a good hot scotch,” declaring, “ dey'll sho'en
mingulate up wid one annudder en do de business en

George. Doan you go projickin' wid doctor's medicines ; pills is dang’us en dey ain' gwine ter oust no

say,
• Wash, you suttinly is right — gʻlong fetch
hot scotch, en git one fer yo’se'f while you's down dar

That settled it, and I compromised on the hot
scotch — but I was firm and would not yield to Julia's
entreaties to be permitted to bring me Mrs. Marshall's
flannel petticoat to wrap around my throat. “What
would the judge say?" I asked. “De Jedge, Marse
George?- De Jedge ain' 'bleeged ter know nuttin'
't all 'bout it. Needer him ner Miss Sallie, nuther.
up a nice
Dem whar's robbed, en doan know dey's robbed, ain'
robbed, Marse George, en ain' no wusser off,” she argued - but I was adamant; her arguments were of
no avail. She curchied' her thanks for the silver
piece I gave her and left me with the compliment that
I “sho' wuz one bridegroom husband—allus honey
moonin' wid my own queen bee, wedder wid her er
widout her, en dat Miss Sallie ought ter be one proud
white lady.” Is she?
Yesterday, when I wrote, I did not tell
you
how
sick I had been, or was; nor how lonesome; nor how
I longed for your soothing, gentle touch, your ministering care. I should only have made you anxious. You
could not have come to me. Oh, my sweetheart, I
think of
you
all the hours, and I swear every time I
leave you, that I'll never leave you again and, that if
business calls, I must take you with me. If I could only
lay the treasures of the universe at your tiny little
feet.
But this business, I'm afraid, will not earn my
cough drops, nor your violets and, oh, it is such a crucifixion! You don't know how abhorrent it is to me.
I
spur myself on all the time with this one thought
- that it is, my darling, for you.
The day I came upon the boat, I took out two policies, one for $7,000 and
one for $10,000. The men were both old soldiers, belonging to my dear old division. One of them said they
had to run me down and almost tie me to make me insure their lives. You know, dear, I can't do it. I'd
sooner face a cannon than ask a man to take out a
policy with me. Your soldier is nothing but a soldier;
the war is over and he is no more account. The company tells me that my agents must do the soliciting,
but I'll feel like a thief to take a commission on what
they have worked for and earned.
Yesterday when I came through Petersburg I
went, as I told you, to our office. J. B. B., our company's agent, was sitting with his chair tilted back
-foot on the table, smoking a bad smelling pipe and
reading “Macaria'. "Hello, General, hello,” he said,
not rising. “Sent in six policies this week, old man.
“On your familiarity or courtly manners—which?”
“Neither, old man, on gall, gall
, old man, gall and
grub. Come, have a drink —ever read. Macaria'?”
With the most studied politeness and coldness I declined his offer and in my most dignified manner
asked permission to look over the company's books.
“Come, what's eating you, old man?” he asked,
bringing his chair down with a bang and slapping me
on the back. Then he profanely informed me that I'd
“have to unbuckle a few holes and thaw out, if I
wanted to paint the monkey's tail sky-blue."
Alas, little one, I am afraid your soldier isn't much
of an artist. He longs to give his precious wife all the
luxuries and comforts and everything that is beautiful — but he can't thaw out, my darling, and he can't
paint that monkey's tail sky-blue; and, sweetheart, it
makes him crawl and creep to be associated with artists who can. I was wondering as I came over, whether
it would be better to send our boy to West Point —or
get him a paint brush. We have time to decide that,
however, for he is just a little over eleven.
Here comes the Colonel and old Mistis'; and by
the way, everybody sends love and messages to you
and our boy.
Now, my own beautiful wife, don't be anxious
about me, and forgive this long, rambling letter.
Your loving, good for nothing
Soldier
ALL the way to the station, my darling, I was
asking myself whether I was right in yielding
to your solicitations and leaving our sick child, with
all the resulting care and responsibility resting on your
ever-brave shoulders. And once, sweetheart, after
thinking very seriously over it I was almost tempted
to turn and go back, when the appealing words of
your voice echoed through my soul: “Even if I knew
our child would die while you were gone, I would not
have
you neglect this call to honor your boys whom
you led to their death!” So, instead of turning back
I said: “Drive faster, please, John David; I wouldn't
miss my train for anything!” – You blessed little
sermon!
Imade the train in plenty of time, and your mother,
to whom I had telegraphed at Ivor, came to the station, bringing the good tidings that your brother was
out of danger. I did not tell her that our little George
was ill, lest it might make her anxious, as I knew that
her duty was beside her sick boy.
I would have been so thankful if you, my sweet,
beautiful bride, and our precious little war child'
could have come with me. Everybody asks about
you and the boy and sends love, and expresses sorrow
that you could not come. A delegation of my old soldiers met me at the station and, though some of our
relatives had prepared to have us with them, I agreed
to the arrangement of the Committee and the demand
of the Governor and was taken to the Executive Mansion as the
guest of the State.
All the evening and the next morning until it was
time to form, old comrades came in, in groups and
in single file. They told of their experiences, officers and privates alike ; discussed the Pennsylvania
campaign and the three days' fight, their voices falling to a whisper as they spoke of those whose mem
ory we had come to honor —our gallant dead at Gettysburg - our brave boys who gave their last full
measure of devotion'to duty.
I had been made Chief Marshal — a sad, solemn,
sacred office for me of all the Army. Such love,
such reverence, was Christ born. You cannot conceive of it. From the old Market to the Cemetery
of Hollywood, the streets, sidewalks, windows and
housetops were crowded. There must have been
twelve thousand people at Hollywood. Such a demonstration of devotion and sympathy was, I think,
never before witnessed on earth. Think of it, my
darling, so penetrating, so universal a oneness of love
and
respect and reverence existed that there was a
stillness, an awesomeness, save for those necessary
sounds — the clanking of swords, the tramp of horses,
and the martial tread of men keeping time with funeral marches — the solemn requiem. No cheers,
no applause; only loving greetings from tear-stained
faces, heads bent in reverence, clasped hands held out
to us as we passed along. As I saw once more the courage-lit faces of my brave Virginians, again I heard
cry—“We'll follow you, Marse George!”
From their eternal silence, those who marched heroically to death looked down upon us yesterday. My
darling, you cannot know — no, you cannot know!
As I clasped the hand of one after another of those
who crowded around me, I was greeted with the
words “My husband was killed at Gettysburg'
“My son is lying there among the dead”—“My
“
brother was with you there" — so many crushed
hearts filling my heart with grief. Oh, my wife, my
their cry
Sallie, if the cry of my soul had been voiced it would
have been the echo of that at Gethsemane!
Your heart-sad
Soldier
