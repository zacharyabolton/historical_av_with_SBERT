Concerning the Battle of Cold Harbor
ERE we are still, my Sallie. My division is
stationed with the rest of the First Corps be
tween new and old Cold Harbor. Old Peter, having
been wounded in the Wilderness, Anderson has been
put in command of the First Corps. Grant has been
appointed Lieutenant General and has arrived at
nearly the same point in his march down the river
that McClellan reached in his upward progress in â€™62.
Over a crimson road both armies, have returned to
Cold Harbor. The Wilderness, alas, is one vast grave,
yard where sleep thousands of Grant's soldiers; but
Grant, like our Stonewall, is . fighting not to save
lives, but country'.
For the second time now Cold Harbor has become
a battle ground. Two years ago
it furnished the field
for the battle of Gaines's Mill (which the Yankees
called Cold Harbor) where your soldier was wounded.
Does it seem to you as long ago as two years, my dar
ling? To me, it seems but yesterday that I lay in Rich
mond at
my little sister's and you came to see me,
blessing and cheering me. I can feel now the soft
.
