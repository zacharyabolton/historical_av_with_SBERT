ON THE ROAD TO GETTYSBURG
a great and common cause, as they are the inheritors
of a great and common country.
The officers and men are all in excellent condition,
bright and cheerful, singing songs and telling stories,
full of hope and courage, inspired with absolute faith
and confidence in our success. There is no strag
gling, no disorder, no dissatisfaction, no plundering,
and there are no desertions. Think of it
-an army of
sixty thousand men marching through the enemy's
country without the least opposition. The object of
this
great movement is, of course, unknown to us. Its
purpose, and our destination, are known at present
only to the Commanding General and his Chief
Lieutenants. The officers and men generally believe
that the intention is entirely to surround the Army of
the Potomac and to place Washington and Baltimore
within our grasp. They think that Marse Robert is
merely threatening the Northern cities, with the
view of suddenly turning down the Susquehanna,
cutting off all railroad connections, destroying all
bridges, throwing his army north of Baltimore and
cutting off Washington, and that Beauregard is to fol.
low on directly from Richmond via Manassas to Wash,
ington, in rear of Hooker, who of course will be in
pursuit of Marse Robert.
