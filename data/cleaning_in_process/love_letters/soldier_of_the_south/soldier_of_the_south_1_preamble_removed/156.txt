Written in Defeat, after the Battle of Five Forks
T is long past the midnight hour and, like a boy,
I have been reading over your dear, cheery letter,
caressing the written page because it has been touched
hand.
All is quiet now, but soon all will be bustle, for we
march at daylight. Oh, my darling, were there ever
such men as those of my division? This morning after
the review I thanked them for their valiant services
yesterday on the first of April, never to be forgotten
of ,
us, when, to my mind, they fought one of
the most desperate battles of the whole war. Their
answer to me was cheer after cheer, one after an
other calling out, “That's all right, Marse George!”
and“We only followed you!” Then in the midst of
!
these calls, silencing them, rose loud and clear dear
old Gentry's voice, singing the old hymn which they
all knew I loved:
“Guide me, oh, thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land.”
Voice after voice joined in till from all along the
forth:
line the plea rang
