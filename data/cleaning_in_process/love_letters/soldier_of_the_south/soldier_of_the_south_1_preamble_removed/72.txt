GENERAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
Nous verrons.
We reached here this morning, June 27th, the an
niversary of the battle of Gaines's Mill, where
your
soldier was wounded. We marched straight through
the town of Chambersburg, which was more deserted
than Goldsmith's village. The stores and houses were
all closed, with here and there groups of uncheerful
Boers of Deutschland descent, earnestly talking, more
sylvan shadows than smiles wreathing their faces. I
had given orders that the bands were not to play; but
as we were marching through the northeastern part
of the city, some young ladies came out onto the ve,
randa of one of the prettiest homes in the town and
asked:
“Would
“ you mind shooting off the bands a bit?”
So the command was given, and the band played
· Home Sweet Home', · Annie Laurie', 'Her Bright
Smile Haunts Me Still, *Nellie Gray', and · Hazel
Dell.' The
young
ladies asked the next band that
passed if they wouldn't play · Dixie'. But the band
instead struck
up
• The Old Oaken Bucket, “The
Swanee River', The Old Arm Chair', The Lone
Rock by the Sea', and · Auld Lang Syne'.
Thought you was rebels. Where'd you come
from anyhow? Can't play Dixie', none of you?" they
