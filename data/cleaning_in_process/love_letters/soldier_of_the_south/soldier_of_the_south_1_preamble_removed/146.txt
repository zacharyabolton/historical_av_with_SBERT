GENERAL PICKETT'S LETTERS
a
,
soldiers to volunteer to sheathe their swords and take
up the shovel and go to digging.
The bank to be cut through is only about five feet
at the highest point. The canal is to be where the
James makes a great bend just above Dutch Gap, in
closing a point is land perhaps half a mile wide and
about three miles in length and which at the neck is
only five hundred yards across from river to river.
Their canal would thus save them six miles and would
allow their gunboats to go up the James without run
ning the gauntlet of our Howlett guns, our sunken
torpedoes et cetera. And as our left is all at the turn of
the bend, they would not have to traverse the open
river in search of an exposed water channel. It is
strange that some of our brilliant engineers haven't
made this near cut years ago. As for me, I should en
courage Butler and his River Improvement Company,
and cease throwing these stealthy shells whose silent
fall heralds a sudden roar of explosion that strikes ter
ror to my soul. The canal will be an advantage to us,
and Butler, in digging it for us, may in part atone for
the many homes he has destroyed, mine among them.
Well, my own, if you were not the best of all good
women, as well as the most beautiful of all beautiful
women and the most patient of all patient women, you
