wonderful, judicial mind and depressing dignity were
not in evidence. He did rather reproachfully express
his astonishment that Mr. Davis should be bowed
down with grief by the adverse criticisms of those he
was trying to serve, and that he should care a bauble
for their accusations of nepotism and the more absurd
charge of leaving his cotton to be bought by the
Yankees. He ended by saying that he continually had
to remind Mr. Davis of that exceedingly good man,
Christ. You know, my own, Benjamin was born at St.
Croix in the West Indies, of Jewish parents.
What a gossip your husband is, my Sallie, but I
promised to write my beautiful tyrant every day,
everything I said or did or that anyone else said or did,
and I have.
Forever and ever
Your
Soldier
