Toll on the passing bell, ring out my doleful knell;
Let thy sound my death tell. Death doth draw me,
Death doth draw me. There is no remedy."
Baird stopped outside and listened and then came
in, asking permission to order Bob to light the dips,
and saying, “Please, Sir, Marse George, when you
sing that song I haven't got a friend in the world. I'm
lonesome and feel creeps and see spooks and, what's
worse, I don't know whether I am Anne Boleyn her,
self, or am myself responsible for all poor Anne's
sorrows and death."
So I stopped singing and am writing to tell you a
great secret, which is - I love you. Some day when
we are happy—so happy that nothing could make
us any happier — I'll sing this
you.
Last night there was a night attack. Several of the
men were wounded slightly; but the face of one-
perhaps seriously wounded — haunts me. He is a boy
with golden brown curls—somebody's darling. To
night, we made a capture of the Federal pickets,
sweeping their rifle pits for more than a hundred
yards and taking a hundred and thirty-six prisoners.
You know our lines are so close together in many
places that we, the Yankees and my men, can with
voices raised carry on a conversation.
War and its horrors, and yet I sing and whistle.
