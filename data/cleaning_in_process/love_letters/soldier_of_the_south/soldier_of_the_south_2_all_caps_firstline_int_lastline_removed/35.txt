A
In which are Given Certain Important Details
of the Battle of Seven Pines
VIOLENT storm was raging, flooding the level
ground, as I wrote you last, followed the next
day by one of fire and blood — the Battle of Seven
Pines.
I pray, my prettice, that you accepted the invita .
tion of your mountain chum, and that your
beautiful
eyes and tender heart have been spared the horrors of
war which this battle must have poured into sad Rich
mond. Three hundred and fifty of your soldier's bri
gade, 1700 strong, were killed or wounded, and all
fought as Virginians should, fighting as they did for
the right, for love, honor, home and state — princi
ples which they had been taught from the mothers'
knees, the schoolroom and the pulpit.
Under orders from Old Peter,* we marched at
daylight and reported to D. H. Hill, near Seven Pines.
Hill directed me to ride over and communicate with
Hood. I started at once with Charlie and Archer, of
my staff, to obey this order, but had gone only a short
distance when we met a part of the Louisiana Zou.
* General Longstreet.
