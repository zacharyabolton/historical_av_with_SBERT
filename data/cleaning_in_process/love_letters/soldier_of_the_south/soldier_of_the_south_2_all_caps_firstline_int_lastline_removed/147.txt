would weary of so tiresome a soldier, who takes
away
the fragrance of flowers and the glory of love and
sends back the echo of war and its sorrows and the
babble of a loyal old cook who wouldn't be sold and
wouldn't run away and whom I was obliged to per
mit to be credited to me in order to save him the
only negro I own—but, come to think of it, he owns
me.
Forever and ever
Your
Soldier
In Camp, August —, 1864
