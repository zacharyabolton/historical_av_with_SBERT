From the field of Fredericksburg
ERE we are, my darling, at Fredericksburg, on
the south side of the Rappahannock, half way
between Richmond and Washington, fortified for us
by the hand of the Great Father.
I penciled you a note by old Jackerie* on the 12th
from the foot of the Hills between Hazel Run and the
Telegraph Road. In it I sent a hyacinth, given me by
a pretty lady who came out with beaten biscuit, and
some unwritten and written messages from Old Peter
and Old Jack, Hood, Ewell, Stuart and your
Â«bro

November when we moved on from Orange Court
House.
I sent you a short note last night after the
day's great battle, telling you that even in the midst of
it all

heart and thoughts.
My division, nine thousand strong, is in fine shape.
It was on the field of battle, as a division, for the first
time yesterday, though only one brigade, Kemper's,
was actively engaged. What a day it was, my darling
* Headquarters Postmaster.
