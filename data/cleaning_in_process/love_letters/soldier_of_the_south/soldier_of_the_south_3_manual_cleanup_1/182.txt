“have to unbuckle a few holes and thaw out, if I
wanted to paint the monkey's tail sky-blue."
Alas, little one, I am afraid your soldier isn't much
of an artist. He longs to give his precious wife all the
luxuries and comforts and everything that is beauti
ful — but he can't thaw out, my darling, and he can't
paint that monkey's tail sky-blue; and, sweetheart, it
makes him crawl and creep to be associated with art
ists who can. I was wondering as I came over, whether
it would be better to send our boy to West Point —or
get him a paint brush. We have time to decide that,
however, for he is just a little over eleven.
Here comes the Colonel and old Mistis'; and by
the way, everybody sends love and messages to you
and our boy.
Now, my own beautiful wife, don't be anxious
about me, and forgive this long, rambling letter.
Your loving, good for nothing
Soldier
