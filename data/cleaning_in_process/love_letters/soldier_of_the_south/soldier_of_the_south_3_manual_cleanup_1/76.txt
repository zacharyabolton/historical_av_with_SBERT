make me
Getty from Hanover, Keyes from Bottom's Bridge,
and so on—and that we might be recalled. It turned
out to be Munchausen, and we are still to march for
ward. Every tramp — tramp — tramp
- tramp is a thought
— thought — thought of my darling, every halt a
–
blessing invoked, every command a loving caress; and
the thought of you
and
prayer
for
you
strong, make me better, give me courage, give me
faith. Now, my dearest, let my soul speak to yours.
Listen listen - listen -- You hear -I am an
swered.
Forever and ever,
Your
Soldier
