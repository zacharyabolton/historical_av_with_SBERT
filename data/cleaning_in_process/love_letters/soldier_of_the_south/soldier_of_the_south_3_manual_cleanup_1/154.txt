In the Dark Days before the End
HIS morning at breakfast, my darling Sallie,
when you suggested having an oyster roast for
my officers after our conference to night, I said that
I feared we should not have enough oysters. Our old
hunter, Gossett, has just brought in a fine large wild

can get up a
fine
supper.
Don't
you, my marvel of a
housekeeper? I hope you can, and hope, too, that the
good cheer it will provide will help us to new and
encouraging suggestions, for, as hopeful as I always
am, even my heart is in
my
boots.
On every side gloom, dissatisfaction and disap,
pointment seem to have settled over all, men and
officers alike, because of the unsuccessful termination
of the Peace Conference on board the River Queen
on the fatal third. The anxious, despairing faces I see
everywhere bespeak heavy hearts. Our commission,
ers knew that we were gasping our last
the Peace Conference was a forlorn hope. Because
of the informality of the conference and
my
know
gasp and that
