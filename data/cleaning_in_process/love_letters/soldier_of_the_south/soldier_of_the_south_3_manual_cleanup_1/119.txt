Oh, my sweetheart, if only this wicked war were over
so that we could in peace and quiet tranquilly finish
the book of Love which we have but just begun.
Adios now. I see old Jackerie in the flap with his
pack and bag, his wonted grace and patience, his
dolce-far-niente eyes and soft, southern Italian voice,
saying, “No hulla-nonenty.” But I must hurry, for he
starts at daybreak and it is now past midnight.
Lovingly now and forever,
Your
Soldier
