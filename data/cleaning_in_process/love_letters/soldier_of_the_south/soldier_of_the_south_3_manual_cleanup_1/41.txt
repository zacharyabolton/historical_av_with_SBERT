Kearny, one of the most brilliant generals of the
Federal Army, a man whose fame as a soldier is world
wide. I knew him first in Mexico, where, as you
know, he lost an arm at the siege of Mexico City. In
Algeria he won the Cross of the Legion of Honor. He
fought with the French in the battles of Magenta and
Solferino and received also from Napoleon Third the
decoration of the Legion of Honor. I wish we had
taken him prisoner instead of shooting him. I hate to
have such a man as Kearny killed. Marse Robert, who
was his old friend, sent his body to Pope under a flag
of truce. I am glad he did that — poor old Kearny!

The same courier brought the sad news that our
Ewell had lost a leg and our Talliaferro had been
wounded. And these are the horrors to which, when
away
from
you, my beautiful darling, your soldier is
impatient to return.
Never, never did men, since the world began, fight
like ours! The Duke of Somerset, who sneeringly
laughed when he saw our ragged, dirty, barefooted
soldiers — “Mostly beardless boys," as he said — took
off his hat in reverence when he saw them fight.
Lovingly,
Your
Soldier
