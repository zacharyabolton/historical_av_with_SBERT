From the Lines, near Petersburg
UR soldier breathes easier this morning, my
darling. A great load is lifted. Haygood's brave
South Carolina Brigade came in yesterday, thank God,
and I stationed them at Port Walthall Junction. This
will keep the connection between Petersburg and
Richmond open. Wise's Brigade got in today and
was sent out toward City Point.
For nights I have not closed my eyes. How could
I, with a whole city full of helpless, defenseless women
and children at the mercy of an oncoming army?
Butler's whole force, in transports protected by his
gunboats, landed at City Point and Bermuda Hun
dred, and no army here to meet them! Not enough
soldiers, boys and old men all put together, even for
picket duty!
Come to think of it, my prettice, you must have
been
up all night to have gotten up and sent out such
a basket of goodies, and baked and buttered such a lot
of biscuit, and made so many jugs of coffee as came
this morning. My, I tell you it all tasted good, and the
coffee â€” well, no Mocha or Java ever tasted half so
