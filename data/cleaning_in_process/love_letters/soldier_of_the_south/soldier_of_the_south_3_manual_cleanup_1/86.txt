Well, it is all over now. The battle is lost, and
many of us are prisoners, many are dead, many
wounded, bleeding and dying. Your soldier lives and
mourns and but for you, my darling, he would rather,
a million times rather, be back there with his dead,
to sleep for all time in an unknown grave.
Your sorrowing
Soldier
