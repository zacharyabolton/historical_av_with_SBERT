Tomorrow, if you'll promise not to divulge it to a
human soul, I'll tell you a great secret. No, my Sallie,
I can't wait till to.morrow. I'll tell you right now. So
listen and cross your heart that you won't tell. I love
you
- love youâ€” love you,

to see you so. That is the secret.
A Dios. With my heart at your feet, and my hap
piness in your hands, I am,
Lovingly and forever,
Your
Soldier
