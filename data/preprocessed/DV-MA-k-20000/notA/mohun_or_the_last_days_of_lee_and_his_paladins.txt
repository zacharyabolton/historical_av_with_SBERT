on the wall over the mantelpiece here in my quiet study at ********** are two crossed swords one is a battered old sabre worn at gettysburg and appomattox the other a federal officers dress sword captured in 1863 it was a mere fancy to place them there as it was a whim to hang upon that nail yonder the uniform coat with its stars and braid which stuart wore on his famous ride around mcclellan in 1862 under the swords hang portraits of lee jackson and stuart jackson wears his old coat and his brow is raised as though he were looking out from beneath his yellow old cadet cap stuart is seated grasping his sabre with his plumed hat resting on his knee his huge beard flows on his breast his eyes are clear and penetrating and beneath the picture i have placed a slip cut from one of his letters to me and containing the words yours to count on jeb stuart lastly the gray commanderinchief looks with a grave smile over his shoulder the eyes fixed upon that excellent engraving of the good old rebel a private of the army of northern virginia seated on a log after the war and reflecting with knit brows on the past and the present from this sketch of my surroundings worthy reader you will perceive that i amuse myself by recalling the old times when the grays and blues were opposed to each other those two swords ************ pictures of lee jackson stuart and the old ******** are certain to think that the possessor of them is *************** terrible word and still a rebel but is it wrong to remember the past i think of it without bitterness god decreed ***** the allwise the

that tremendous drama of ##### i can find something besides blood and tears even here and there some sunshine in this last series of my memoirs i shall deal chiefly with that immense campaign in the first series which i trust the reader of these pages will have perused i followed jackson through his hard battles to the fatal field of chancellorsville in this volume i shall beg the reader first to go with stuart from the great review of his cavalry in june 1863 to the dark morning of may 11 1864 at yellow tavern then the last days will follow i open the drama with that fine cavalry review in june 1863 on the plains of culpeper it is a pleasure to return to itfor gettysburg blackened the sunshine soon the column thundered by the gay bugles rang the great banner floated where is that pageant today where the old moons of ****** alas the strong hours work their will june 1863 is long dead the cavalry horses if they came back from the wars are ploughing the rusty sabres stick fast in the battered old ********* the old saddles are ********* our friends take them away from us the old buttons are tarnished and an order forbids our wearing them the brass bands clash no more and the bugles are silent where are the drums and the bugles do they beat the long roll at the approach of phantom foes or sound the cavalry charge in another world they are silent today and have long disappeared but i think i hear them still in my dreams it is in june 1863 therefore worthy reader that i open my volume up to that time i had gone with jacksons foot cavalry marching slowly and steadily to battle now i was to follow the gay and adventurous career of the virginia ************ the knight of the black plume if you are willing to accompany me i promise to show you some animated scenes you will hear stuart laugh as he leads the charge or jest with his staff or sing his gay cavalry songs but alas we shall not go far with him and when he leaves us a sort of shadow will fall upon the landscape from that may 1864 laughter will seldom be heard the light which shines on the great picture will be red and baleful blood will gush on desperate ********* will fall like dry leaves in the winds of autumn the crimson torrent will sweep away a whole generation ********* the red cross flag will go down in blood the current of events will drag us to petersburg and those last months which witnessed the final wrestle in this war of the giants let us **** in the sunshine before breasting the storm the pages of blood and mourning will soon be *************** we will laugh in this june 1863 faces smile still and cheers resound bugles are ringing swords clashing cannon thundering lees old army is full of ardor and seventy thousand men shout pennsylvania pennsylvania on a beautiful day of june 1863 the plains of culpeper in virginia were the scene of an imposing pageant stuarts cavalry was passing in review before lee who was about to commence his march toward gettysburg those of my readers who were fortunate enough to be present will not forget that scene they will remember the martial form of stuart at the head of his sabreurs how the columns of horsemen thundered by the great flag how the multitude cheered brightest eyes shone the merry bands clashed the gay bugles rang how the horse artillery roared as it was charged in mimic *********** lee the gray old soldier with serene carriage sat his horse and looked on never had the fields of culpeper witnessed a spectacle more magnificent the sunshine darted in lightnings from the long line of sabres lit up beautiful faces and flashed from scarfs and waving handkerchiefs rosy cheeks and glossy ringlets all was life and joy and splendor for once war seemed turned to carnival and flowers wreathed the keen edge of the sword among the illustrious figures gazed at by the crowd two were the observed of all the ************** of lee and stuart lee sat his powerful horse with its plain soldierly equipments beneath the large flag he was clad in a gray uniform almost without mark of rank cavalry boots reached nearly to his knees as usual he wore no sword over his broad brow drooped a plain brown felt hat without tassel or decoration beneath you saw a pair of frank and benignant but penetrating eyes ruddy cheeks and an iron gray mustache and beard both cut close in the poise of the stately head as in the whole carriage of his person there was something calm august and imposing this man it was plain was not only great but ******* true type of the race of gentlemen of other times stuart the chief of cavalry of the army was altogether different in appearance young ardent full of life and abandon he was the true reproduction of rupert said to be his ancestor the dark cavalry feather the lofty forehead and dazzling blue eyes his little fighting jacket as he called it bright with braid and buttons made a picture his boots reached to the knee a yellow silk sash was about his waist his spurs of solid gold were the present of some ladies of maryland and with saber at ****** point extended over his horses head he led the charge with his staff in front of the column and laughing as though the notes of the bugle drove him forward in every movement of that stalwart figure as in the glance of the blue eyes and the laughter curling the huge mustache could be read youth and joy and a courage which nothing could bend he was called a boy by some as coriolanus was before him but his federal adversaries did not laugh at him they had felt his blows too often nor did the soldiers of the army he had ******** bullets in front of infantry as well as the sabre in front of cavalry the civilians might laugh at himthe old soldiers found no fault in him for humming his songs in battle they knew the man and felt that he was a good soldier as well as a great general he would have made an excellent private and did not feel above being one never was human being braver if he did laugh and sing was he not brave answer old sabreurs whom he led in a hundred charges old followers of jackson with whom he went over the breastworks at chancellorsville some readers may regard this picture of stuart as overdrawn but it is the simple truth of that brave soul he had his faults he loved praise even flattery and was sometimes ************ i have never known a human being more pure generous and brave at sunset the review was over the long columns of cavalry moved slowly back to their camps the horse artillery followed the infantry who had witnessed the ceremony sought their bivouacs in the woods and the crowd on foot on horseback or in carriages returned toward the courthouse whose spires were visible across the fields stuart had approached the flagstaff and ******* his plumed hat had saluted lee who saluted in return and complimented the review after a few moments conversation they had then saluted a second time lee followed by his staff rode toward his quarters and stuart set out to return to his own we had ridden about half a mile when stuart turned his head and called me i rode to his side i wish you would ride down toward beverlys ford surry he said and tell mordaunt to keep a bright lookout tonight they must have heard our artillery on the other side of the river and may want to find out what it means i saluted and turned my horse stuart cantered on singing in a few minutes he was out of sight and i was riding toward the rappahannock if the reader has done me the honor to peruse the first volume of my memoirs i indulge the vanity of supposing that he will like to be informed how i became a member of general stuarts staff when oaks crash down they are apt to prostrate the ******** growing around them jackson was a very tall oak and i a very humble ******* when the great trunk fell the mere twig disappeared i had served with jackson from the beginning of the war that king of battle dead at chancellorsville i had found myself without a commander and without a home i was not only called upon in that may of 1863 to mourn the illustrious soldier who had done me the honor to call me his friend i had also to look around me for some other general some other position in the army i was revolving this important subject in my mind when i received a note from general jeb stuart jacksons friend and brother in arms come and see me said this note fortyeight hours afterward i was at stuarts headquarters near culpeper courthouse when i entered his tent or rather breadth of canvas stretched beneath a great oak stuart rose from the red blanket upon which he was lying and held out his hand as he gazed at me in silence i could see his face flush you remind me of jackson he said retaining my hand and gazing fixedly at me i bowed my head making no other reply for the sight of stuart brought back to me also many memories the scouting of the valley the hard combats of the lowland cold harbor manassas sharpsburg fredericksburg and that last greeting between jackson and the great commander of the cavalry on the weird moonlight night at chancellorsville stuart continued to gaze at me and i could see his eyes slowly fill with tears it is a national calamity he murmured jacksons loss is irreparable he remained for a moment gazing into my face then passing his hand over his forehead he banished by a great effort these depressing memories his bold features resumed their habitual cheerfulness our dialogue was brief and came rapidly to the point have you been assigned to duty yet my dear surry i have not general would you like to come with me more than with any general in the army since jacksons death you know i am sincere in saying that ********** the matter can be very soon arranged i think i want another inspectorgeneral and want you with these words stuart seated himself at his desk wrote a note which he dispatched by a courier to army headquarters and then throwing aside business he began laughing and talking for once the supply of red tape in richmond seemed temporarily exhausted stuart was lees right hand and when he made a request the war office deigned to listen four days afterward i was seated under the canvas of a staff tent when stuart hastened up with boyish ardor holding a paper here you are old ********* he used the ****** old to any ones name he was always excellently well disposed toward ******* richmond people are prompt this time here is your ************** for sweeney and his banjo he shall play jine the cavalry in honor of the occasion surry you see now my dear reader how it happened that in june 1863 stuart beckoned to me and gave me an order to transmit to general mordaunt as i rode toward the rappahannock to deliver stuarts order to general mordaunt the wide landscape was suddenly lit up by a crimson glare i looked over my shoulder the sun was poised upon the western woods and resembled a huge bloodshot eye above it extended a long black cloud like an ********** from the cloud issued low thunder when a storm is coming the civilian seeks shelter but the soldier carrying an order wraps his cape around him and rides on i went on past brandy and fleetwood hill descended toward the river entered a great belt of ********* night and storm descended simultaneously an artillery duel seemed going on in the clouds the flickering lightnings amid the branches resembled serpents of fire the wind rolled through the black wood tearing off boughs in its passage i pushed my horse to full speed to emerge from this scene of crashing limbs and tottering trunks i had just passed a little stream when from a byroad on my left came the trample of hoofs it is good to be on the watch in the cavalry and i wheeled to the right ************* all at once a brilliant flash of lightning showed me within fifty paces a column of blue cavalry halt rang out from the column and a ********** followed i did not halt capture was becoming a hideous affair in june 1863 i passed across the head of the column at full speed followed by bullets struck into a bridlepath on the right and pushed ahead hotly pursued they had followed me nearly half a mile firing on me and ordering me to halt when suddenly a sonorous halt resounded fifty yards in front of me and a moment afterward a carbine ball passed through my riding cape i drove on at full speed convinced that these in front were friends and the chest of my horse struck violently against that of another in the darkness halt or you are dead came in the same commanding voice another flash of lightning showed me a squadron of gray cavalry at their head rode a cavalier well mounted it was his horse against which i had struck and he held a cocked pistol to my breast the lightning left nothing in doubt gray and blue quickly recognized each other the blue cavalry had drawn rein and at that moment the leader of the grays ************* a rush of hoofs and then a quick clash of sabres followed the adversaries had hurled together the wood suddenly became the scene of a violent combat it was a rough affair for ten minutes the result was doubtful the federal cavalry were apparently commanded by an officer of excellent nerve and he fought his men obstinately for nearly a quarter of an hour the wood was full of ************ ************ and yells which mingled with the roll of the storm then the fight ended my friend of the cocked pistol threw himself sabre in hand upon the federal front and it shook and gave back and retreated the weight of the onset seemed to sweep it inch by inch away the blue squadron finally broke and scattered in every direction the grays pressed on with loud cheers firing as they did ****** minutes afterward the *********** wood had swallowed pursuers and pursued the whole had disappeared like phantom horsemen in the direction of the rappahannock half an hour afterward the storm had spent its fury and i was standing by a bivouac fire on the banks of the rappahannock conversing with the officer against whom i had driven my horse in the darkness mounted upon a powerful gray he had led the attack with a sort of fury and i now looked at him with some curiosity he was a man of about thirty of gaunt face and figure wearing a hat with a black feather and the uniform of a colonel of cavalry the features were regular and might have been called handsome the eyes hair mustache and ********** wore no ********* black the complexion so pale that the effect was startling more curious than all else however was the officers expression in the lips and eyes could be read something bitterly cynical mingled with a profound and apparently ************ melancholy after looking at my new acquaintance for an instant i said to myself this man has either suffered some great grief or committed some great crime his bearing was cold but courteous i recognized you as soon as i saw you colonel he said in response to my salute you probably do not know me however as i have just been transferred from the army of the west colonel mohun at your service i exchanged a pressure of the hand with colonel mohun or speaking more correctly i grasped his it did not return the pressure i then thanked him for his timely appearance and he bowed coldly it was lucky that my scout led me in this direction he said that party is whipped back over the river and will give us no more trouble ********** woods are full of their dead and wounded as he spoke he took a cigar case from his pocket and presented it will you smoke sir he said i bowed and selected a cigar colonel mohun imitated me and was about to commence smoking when two or three cavalry men were seen approaching through the gloom apparently escorting some one as they drew nearer the figures became plainer in the firelight the cavalry men had in charge a female prisoner she was a woman of petite figure clad in a handsome gray ridinghabit and mounted upon a superb horse with rich equipments apparently belonging to a federal officer of high rank from the horse i glanced at the prisoners face it was a strange countenance she was about ************* complexion was dead white except the lips which were as red as carnations her eyes were large and brilliant her hair dark and worn plain under a small ********* in one delicately ********** hand she held the rein of her ********* the other which was ******** she raised a lace handkerchief to her lips on the finger sparkled a diamond there was something strange in the expression of this woman she looked dangerous in spite of her calmness she sat gazing at some one behind me with the handkerchief still raised to her lips then she took it away and i could see a smile upon them what was the origin of that smile and at whom was she looking i turned and found myself face to face with colonel mohun his appearance almost frightened me his countenance wore the hue of a corpse his whole frame shook with quick ******** and his eyes were distended until the black pupils shone in the centres of two white circles suddenly his teeth clinched audibly he passed his hand over his forehead streaming with cold sweat and said in a low voice then you are not dead madam no sir the prisoner replied tranquilly mohun gazed at her with a long fixed look as he did so his features gradually resumed the cold and cynical expression which i had first observed in them this meeting is singular he said a satirical smile passed over the lips of the prisoner our last interview was very different was it not sir she said the nottoway was higher than the rappahannock is tonight and you did not expect to meet me ******* soon mohun continued to gaze at her with the same fixed look no madam he said you recall that agreeable evening do you not sir mohun coolly inclined his head and you have not seen me since never madam you are mistaken is it possible that i could have forgotten so pleasing a circumstance madam yes where and when have i seen you since that time everywhere and at all ********** and asleep day and night mohun shuddered true he said with a bitter smile you remember then i am not wrong exclaimed the prisoner gazing intently at him mohun raised his head and i could see the old cynical expression upon his lips certainly i remember madam he said do you think it possible for any one to forget your charming ******** and could any thing be more delightful than this interview between two old friends but let us reserve these sweet confidences these gushing emotions one thing only is wanting to perfect the happiness of this moment the presence this evening of your dear ********** he is doubtless detained elsewhere mohuns expression was singular as he uttered these words the prisoner looked at him as he was speaking with an indescribable smile i can only compare it to that of the ********* about to deliver a mortal lunge my brother she said in accents as soft as a flute detained elsewhere do you say sir you are mistaken in supposing so he commanded the cavalry with which you were fighting tonight at these words uttered in a strange mocking voice i saw mohun start as if a rattlesnake had bitten his heel with all his selfpossession he could not restrain this exhibition of emotion impossible you are deceiving me the prisoner interrupted him with a gay laugh so you do not believe me she said you think my dear sir that everybody is dead but yourself dismiss that idea from your mind i am not dead since we have the pleasure of again meeting in the flesh he is not dead no it was colonel mortimer darke whom you fought tonight this is his horse which i borrowed to take a short ride i have been captured but he is neither dead nor captured and you will doubtless receive some friendly message from him soon under the mocking accents and the satirical glance it was easy to read profound hatred the speaker could not hide that at that moment she resembled a tigress about to spring mohun had listened with absorbing attention as his companion spoke but as on the first occasion he speedily suppressed his agitation his face was now as cold and unmoved as though moulded of bronze so be it madam he said i will respond as i best can to such message as he may send me for yourself you know me well and i am glad to see indulge no apprehensions the past is dead let it sleep you think this interview is painful to me you deceive yourself madam i would not exchange it for all the wealth of two *********** and calling an officer he said you will conduct this lady to general stuart reporting the circumstances attending her capture mohun made a *********** bow to the prisoner as he spoke saluted me in the same manner and mounting his horse rode back at the head of his column the prisoner escorted by the young officer and still riding her fine horse had already disappeared in the darkness an hour afterward i had delivered my message to mordaunt and was returning by the road over fleetwood hill thinking of the singular dialogue between mohun and the gray woman what had these ******** meant by their mysterious allusions how had mohun found himself face to face on this stormy night with two human beings whom he thought dead these questions puzzled me for half an hour then i gave up the mystery laughing an hour afterward i had passed through culpeper courthouse crossed the fields and had reached general stuarts headquarters stuarts tent or rather the strip of canvas which he called one was pitched beneath a great oak on a wooded knoll about a mile south of the little village above it drooped the masses of fresh june foliage around were grouped the white canvas flies of the staff in a glade close by gleamed the tents ***** of the couriers horses tethered to the trees ******* their corn in the shadow in the calm summer night the battleflag drooped and clung to its staff before the tent of stuart a man on guard with drawn sabre paced to and fro with measured steps a glance told me that mohuns singular prisoner had arrived a courier was holding her fine animal near the generals tent and as i dismounted three figures appeared in the illuminated doorway these were the figures of stuart the gray woman and a young aiddecamp farewell madam said stuart bowing and laughing i am sorry to have made your acquaintance under circumstances so disagreeable to you but i trust you will appreciate the situation and not blame me blame you not in the least general you are a very gallant man and the gay words were accompanied by a musical laugh you will have an opportunity of seeing the confederate capital said stuart smiling the lady made a humorous grimace and of abusing me upon the way thither and afterward on the route to port monroe and washington as you will not be detained i am sure i shall not abuse you sir you are the noblest gentleman i have ever known and with mutual salutes they ********* young aiddecamp accompanying the lady to her horse and aiding her to mount they then set forward toward the courthouse stuart had ordered the prisoner to be conducted thither and detained at the village tavern under guard until morning when she would be sent to richmond as they disappeared i entered the generals tent and found him laughing leaning one hand upon his desk covered with papers upon which rested his **************** hat he carelessly played with the tassel of his yellow sash with the other hand his blue eyes sparkled and his mustache curled with humor that is really a beauty surry he said and i have laughed heartily he threw himself on his red blanket as he spoke and began playing with his two ****** **** whose names were *** and tuck he had brought them out of the lines on his saddle well you are really a magician i said you charm the evil spirit and make prisoners laugh stuart laughed in reply that is a curious person that mohun sent me he said at first she was disdainful enough but i paid her a few compliments and now she is in an excellent humor as you saw yes but what about the fight i made my report of the events of the evening well mohun is a trump said stuart a new man but seems made of the right ********* steel what does mordaunt say of the attack only a scout right and this lady is our spoil she is handsome is she not but a more curious face i have never seen white cheeks and red ***** sort of devil and angel mixed who is she i wonder and what was her errand something is under it she gave her name as mrs ******** her horse made me break the tenth *********** surry lady and ******* are splendid she is certainly a beauty and what eyes dangerous stuart remained silent for some moments and then i heard him sigh do you know my dear surry he said that if people heard us talk in this way they would call us ******************** thing there are two things that people will not ********** about methat i am ****** and a drunkard do you know what a good man was heard to say of me the other day stuart would be one of the greatest soldiers in the army if he did not drink so hard and others add if he were not a ********* well need i defend myself to you from these charges i promised my mother in my childhood never to touch ardent spirits and a drop has never passed my lips except the wine of the communion i know i need not tell you that i am equally guiltless of the other imputation that person does not live who can say that i ever did any thing improper of that description and yet i am a ********* ********** who never touched drink and love but one person in this world stuarts head sank and he uttered a weary sigh they will not let me alone he muttered and yet i am here fighting for my country but i defy them to take my good name away from me surry and he rose to his feet general lee knows me jackson knew me i have the regard of the one and i had the love of the other what do i care if my children only will not hear these ignoble charges one can never hear them ******* beloved little flora she died while i was fighting near middleburg in the fall of ##**** nearly broke me down and stuart paused and covered his eyes with his hand between the fingers i saw a tear for a moment his breast *************** like a sob issued from the brave lip whereon the heavy mustache trembled i think of her ****** shall never get over her death surry he murmured they think me hard and cold and bad ********* is nothing since she died i care less for mens opinion and only try to do my duty till the ball comes that will end me and dashing a tear from his eyes stuart walked to the door of his tent from which he gazed forth upon the stars five minutes passed thus and i did not speak then all at once i heard stuart call out orderly yes sir came from the man on post near the tent tell sweeney to come and bring his banjo and walking fifty steps stuart caressed the glossy neck of his mare lady margaret who was tethered to a bough and looked around affectionately at her master when he returned he was humming the dew lay on the blossom and following him was ********** same old *********** mild courteous almost sad ******* his cap saluting with simple grace and ****** his banjo in a moment the tent the wooded knoll the whole vicinity was ringing with the uproarious notes of the ************** banjo and sweeney was chanting as only that great master could chant the mighty epic of the sabreurs of stuart if you want to have a good time jine the cavalry bully boys *** the staff and couriers quickly assembled the servants were grouped in the starlight the horses beneath the boughs turned their intelligent ******** leading in the uproarious chorus might have been heard the sonorous and laughing voice of stuart the festivities were kept up until nearly midnight then stuart yawned said with a laugh good morning gentlemen as was his habit when he wished to work and the tent was soon deserted i retired to rest but at three in the morning felt a hand upon my shoulder the general is going to move colonel and wishes to see you said the orderly i rose made my brief toilet and went toward stuarts tent where a light was shining he was writing busily at his desk as fresh and gay as on the preceding evening his enormous constitution defied fatigue all at once i saw that there was another personage in the tent he was a young man of about twenty of slight figure beardless face and an expression so shy and retiring that he seemed ready to blush if you spoke to him he wore nevertheless the uniform of a captain of artillery and i remember wondering how this girlish and shrinking personage with the large sad eyes had come to hold a commission captain davenant of my horse artillery colonel surry said stuart the youth colored and then with an air of painful embarrassment took a step forward and pressed my hand the grasp of the slender fingers was like the grip of a steel vice davenant has been on a scout across the rappahannock to keep his hand in said stuart busily writing my horse artillery boys do a little of every thingand davenant is a wildcat surry with a touch of the bull dog in spite of his looks the young officer drew back blushing more than ever at these words his confusion seemed to deprive him of the power of utterance ill bet hes blushing now said stuart laughing and continuing to write with his back turned as he spoke he is blushing or ********** the poor yankees he has killed doubtless you are laughing at me general said the young man timidly well my laughter wont hurt you davenant i never joke with people i dont like but to business the enemy are going to attack me surry get ready i am going to move ready general all ********** general the voice came like an echo then at the door appeared the gigantic ************ lieutenant hagan chief of the generals escort have you forgotten him my dear ********* huge figure his mighty beard the deep thunder of his tones i showed you the brave soldier in 1861 and 62 in 1863 his beard was heavier his voice more like *********** the giant walked along he seemed to shake the ground i am going to move in half an hour hagan said stuart still writing busily headquarters will be established on fleetwood hill beyond brandy my horse hagan saluted and vanished without uttering a word in five minutes the camp was buzzing and lady margaret was led up come on surry come on davenant i will beat you to the courthouse and stuart buckled on his sword drew on his gauntlets and mounted his horse i was beside him not to be ready when stuart ****** to be left behind he waited for nobody his staff soon learned that as davenants horse was awaiting him he was as prompt as stuart desired in a minute we were all three riding at full speed toward the village stuart was playing with his glove which he had taken off and ******* to and fro his brows were knit and he was reflecting we did not interrupt him and in ten minutes we were all clattering over the main street of the hamlet stuart pushed on by the tavern without pausing in the direction of fleetwood when just as he reached the eastern suburbs of the town a small ******** wagon leaving the place attracted his attention there was just sufficient light to make out the figures in the wagon there were two one was a portly and plainly clad old countryman with a prominent nose a double chin and fat hands decorated with ********* rings beside him sat an old woman as fat as himself wearing a faded calico gown a *********** bonnet and a huge ruffled cap beneath stuart looked keenly at the wagon called to the driver to halt and demanded whither he was going and on what business the old countryman smiled the question seemed to strike him as absurd and his explanation was simple and calculated to remove all suspicion he stated that his name was ********* he lived near the village had brought in a load of vegetables to sell on the preceding *********** friends had persuaded him and his old woman to spend the night and they were now going home stuart peered under the *********** bonnet and this is your old woman my friend he said with a laugh jest so sir was the ****** reply of the fat old countryman smiling sweetly you see she would come along sir ********* is mighty contrary a profound sentiment laughed stuart and riding on without further words he left the countryman free to proceed on his way we crossed a little stream rode on toward fleetwood and had nearly reached brandy when stuart suddenly reined in his horse do you know what i think he said that i have done a foolish thing what general to let that old fellow go on i dont like his looks the old countryman yes i wish i had arrested ****** and his wife arrested them stuart nodded i have an instinct about rascals surry and something tells me that i have been guilty of an imprudence was not his explanation satisfactory no what could be wrong everything and his old woman i said laughing think of that highly respectable dame i like her least of all from instinct if you choose i think your instinct ******** you this time general i think not well we will see and we did see in two hours the headquarters tents were pitched upon fleetwood hill beyond brandy and stuart sent his provost marshal to culpeper courthouse with orders to conduct the prisoner taken by mohun on the preceding night to general lee for examination an hour afterward the worthy provost returned in hot haste with the astounding information that the fair lady was nowhere to be found she had disappeared from her chamber none knew how before daylight and as a *********** suspected individual who had lately been hanging round the tavern had disappeared too it was probable that they had gone off together upon this point a note left by the lady directed to general stuart would probably give information this had been found upon her table and the provost wound up by handing the note to stuart he read it with an air of decided ******** then throwing it upon his desk burst into a laugh well surry he said who is right and who is wrong now read that and he pointed to the note which i opened and read it was in a delicate female hand and ran as follows general stuart will pardon the attempt his captive is about to make to effect her escape he made himself quite charming in their brief interview but liberty is sweet finding a friend unexpectedly in this quarter of the world i have made every arrangement with him he is a great master of ********* and though the travelling costume which i shall adopt will make me look hideous i hope it will enable me before sunrise to pass a private ford known to my friend alone and reach the opposite bank of the rappahannock farewell my dear general if all the rebels were like yourself i might change my politics i have but one other friend in your *********** mohun of the cavalry present my regards to him and say that we will meet again that was all i raised my eyes from the paper and looked at the general with ************ then that old woman was the lady precisely and we are fooled completely they are by this time on the other side of the rappahannock with these words stuart dismissed the whole subject turned to his desk and in a moment was busy at his official writing on the same evening i was riding with stuart toward culpeper courthouse do you know where we are going surry he said with a laugh i can guess i think try to the ball given by the young officers to the charlottesville belles tonight you are wrong old fellow i dont dare to go there dont dare well that is the word he replied i am not afraid of the yankees but i am of ************ all of the valorous correspondents of the newspapers i begin to understand now they are dangerous yes stuart cantered on playing with his glove as usual think of messieurs the bombproof critics he laughed they already say i reviewed the cavalry with a wreath of flowers around my horses neck is it possible they say so everywhere and i will tell you the foundation for the charge in passing through the courthouse on the morning of the review a young lady friend of mine ran out from her house and threw a wreath over the neck of my horse well i think it is something to be courteous in this world i did not throw it off i thanked her rode on and only removed it when i got out of sight meeting general lee i told him of it laughing and he said with a smile why did you not wear it i might as well have done so surry for you see i have the credit of it why try to be temperate and pure and soldierly i am a drunkard a ********* and a ******** but i care nothing i intend to do my duty old fellow and the next few days will probably show if i can fight with which words stuart broke into a song cantered on more rapidly and passing without drawing rein through the courthouse soon reached general lees headquarters on an eminence beyond here he remained for an hour in private interview with the commanderinchief finally they came out together general lee in his plain uniform with that sedate dignity of bearing which made the gray old cavalier so superb i had the honor to receive his salute and to press his hand and then i set out with general stuart for fleetwood in passing through the courthouse we observed the windows of a large building all ablaze with lights and heard the merry notes of music stuart drew rein i think i will drop in for a few minutes in spite of every thing he said see the end of all my excellent resolutions surry and rapidly dismounting stuart entered the ballroom i followed if the review was imposing the ball was charming youths and maidens had assembled promptly at the sound of music and if i were a poet or a *********** my dear reader i would compose a fine description of the merry spectacle but alas i am neither and feel unequal to the ****** style of writing i am only a battered old ********* with a number of great events to speak of look in the newspapers of that period for an account of the assembly let me say however in passing that there was something sad as well as joyful gloomy as well as brilliant in all that echoing laughter and the movements of these gay figures on the eve of the bloody battle of fleetwood girls were smiling upon youths who in twelve hours would be dead lips were shaping gallant *************** they were going to utter the ********** all went merry as a ************ and they danced to the joyous music soon the cannon would begin to roll and the youths would charge to that stormy music as they danced to this i was gazing at the lively ************ the undulating forms moving to and fro the gay uniforms the fluttering scarfs the snowy arms the rosy cheeks when my attention was attracted by a figure which made me lose sight of all else it was that of a young girl about twenty tall stately and beautiful her dark hair was carried back in glossy waves and ended in profuse curls her cheeks resembled blush roses the eyes were large brilliant and full of laughing hauteur the lips red and wreathed into a dazzling smile which was the perfection of satirical mirth i grow extravagant but this young girl was superb there was something queen like and imposing in her movements and whole appearance she seemed to look down on the crowd with satirical disdain and the gay youths who surrounded her were every instant struck by the bright shafts of a wit which spared nothing who was this dangerous beauty who received the attentions of the young officers with so much careless disdain i asked that question of a friend and he replied miss georgia conway a daughter of judge william conway ah i said the ************ successor of randolph in bitter oratory yes and yonder he is i looked in the direction indicated and saw an elderly gentleman of small stature with long gray hair and lips full of benignant smiles he wore a suit of black and there was something courtly and attractive in every movement of the slender figure his low bow and sweet smile were the perfection of oldtime courtesy i was still looking at this gentleman whose fame had extended throughout virginia and the whole south when a familiar voice near me attracted my attention it was that of captain davenant the young officer of the horse artillery and glancing in the direction of the voice i saw him bending over a young lady who was seated and conversing with him she was a girl of seventeen with blue eyes auburn hair and a complexion as fair as a lily as davenant addressed her in low tones she gazed up into his face with an expression of confiding affection in the eyes of the young officer i could read a profound and ardent love turning to my friend i inquired the name of the young lady in turn miss virginia conway he replied the only sister of miss georgia he had scarcely uttered the words when davenants interview with the young lady terminated in a very singular manner suddenly judge conway passed through the crowd reached the spot where the young people were conversing and darting a glance of positive fury at the ****** glance which made his eyes resemble coals of *********** his arm to his daughter and abruptly bore her away davenants face flushed crimson and his eyes darted flame he took a step as though about to ********* all at once he stopped then from red his face became pale the old expression of sadness returned to his lips with head bent down and a faint color stealing over his cheeks he went toward the door and passed though it and disappeared before i had time to reflect upon this singular incident i heard the voice of stuart come surry to horse unless you wish to remain he said ready general i replied and in five minutes we were galloping toward fleetwood a gay ball said stuart as we rode along but do you remember my instinct surry perfectly general has it told you something on the present occasion yes what you have heard of the famous ball at ********* broken up by the guns of waterloo certainly well i think that this one will prove *********** cannon are going to thunder before the music stops stuart had scarcely spoken when rapid hoofstrokes were heard in front and a horseman shot by have you seen general stuart said a voice in the darkness here i ****** news ************ the horseman drew rein so suddenly that his horse was thrown upon his haunches you will be attacked at daylight general ******** force the whole yankee cavalry with infantry and artillery supports all right ride back with me and tell me every thing ************ in half an hour we were at headquarters stuart dismounted and entered his tent you see i was right surry he said turning toward me and there is something in my instinct after all at daylight a long thunder came up from the woods of the rappahannock the greatest cavalry combat of the war had begun at that sound stuart leaped to the saddle and rode rapidly toward the front fifteen minutes afterward his headquarters had vanished on the green slope of fleetwood not a tent was visible is the reader familiar with the country along the upper rappahannock if so he will remember that the river is crossed in culpeper by numerous fords the ****************** on the left that is to say up the ******** ******** beverlys the railroad bridge and kellys fords stuarts left under william hf lee was opposite ******** his centre under jones opposite beverlys his right under hampton toward kellys and a force under robertson was posted in the direction of *********** to guard the right flank the whole amounted to about seven or eight thousand cavalry the federal column which now advanced to attack it is said to have embraced all the cavalry of general hookers army and must have numbered more than twelve thousand sabres stuart rode on rapidly down fleetwood hill and was soon opposite beverlys ford where the enemy had crossed in force general jones was heavily engaged and the napoleons of the horse artillery were roaring steadily every moment the round shot crashed or the shell tore through the woods about three hundred yards in front of the pieces where the dismounted cavalry of the enemy had effected a ******** they kept up a hot fire at the cannoneers and the steady rattle of carbines further up the river told that lee was also engaged in face of the bursting shell the blue *********** could not advance and stuart sent an order to hampton to move in and attack on the right the troopers of the gulf states advanced at the word their dense column was seen slowly moving with drawn sabre across the plain the moment of decisive struggle seemed rapidly approaching when suddenly a heavy blow was struck at stuarts rear i had been directed by him to ascertain if every thing had been sent off from fleetwood and to see that no papers had been dropped there in the hurry of departure going back at a gallop i soon reached the hill and rode over the ground recently occupied by the headquarters the spot seemed swept not a paper was visible all that i could see was a withered bouquet dropped by some young officer of the ****** relic no doubt of the last nights ball at the village i had already turned to ride back to stuart when my attention was attracted by a column of cavalry advancing straight on ********** is upon stuarts rear what force was that could it be the enemy it was coming from the direction of *********** but how could it have passed our force there look i said to an officer of the horse artillery one battery of which was left in reserve on the hill look what column is that it must be wickhams was his reply i am sure they are yankees impossible he exclaimed but our doubts were soon terminated from the rapidly advancing column two guns shot out and unlimbered then two white puffs of smoke spouted from their muzzles and the enemys shell burst directly in our faces the horse artillery returned the fire and i hastened back with the intelligence to stuart it is only a squadron i suppose he replied with great coolness go back and get all the cavalry you can and charge the guns and bag them it is impossible to imagine any thing calmer than the speakers voice i knew however that the attack was more critical than he supposed hastened back came up with two regiments and they ascended the hill at full gallop leaping the ravines and darting toward the crest suddenly it blazed with staggering volleys the federal cavalry had rushed straight across the fields toward the ************ its western slope as we ascended the eastern and met ******** on in squadron front they struck the confederates advancing in column of fours and in confusion from the rough ********** ************ thrown into disorder and with loud cheers the enemy swarmed all over fleetwood hill the battle seemed lost stuart was cut off and hemmed in between two powerful bodies of federal cavalry supported by infantry and artillery all that saved us at that moment was the do or die fighting of the cavalry and horse artillery on the crest of fleetwood took place a bitter and obstinate struggle it was one of those fights of the giants which once witnessed is never forgotten the cannoneers of the horse artillery fought as savagely hand to hand as the regular cavalry and the crest became the scene of a mad wrestle rather of wild beasts than men all at once the form of davenant appeared amid the smoke he had come rapidly from the front and now threw himself into the combat like the ********** to which stuart had compared him his sad smile had disappeared his cheeks were flushed his eyes ************ from his horse he seized the spongestaff of a gun from which all the cannoneers had been driven and ******* home a charge of canister directed the gun upon a column of the enemy before he could fire a federal cavalryman rode at him and cut furiously at his bare head with the full weight of his sabre davenant did not try to draw his ******** attempt would have been useless in his hand he had a weapon and with a swing of the ****** he swept the cavalryman from the saddle he fell headlong covered with blood and davenant aimed and fired the charge of ************** upon his ******** drawing his sword plunged into the ***** his head bare his eyes flaming his voice rising loud and inspiring above the combat it was a stubborn a superb struggle three times the enemys guns were charged and captured three times the confederates were furiously charged in turn and the pieces recaptured by the enemy a final charge of the gray cavalry carried all before it the federal artillery was seized upon and their cavalry driven ******* at that moment a heavier force still was seen advancing upon stuart from the direction of kellys ford it was a splendid spectacle they came on in solid column and rapidly formed line of battle on the slope of fleetwood with drawn sabres and flags floating as they moved they seemed to shake the very ground i had never before seen so great a force of cavalry drawn ***** the critical moment of the battle had plainly come at that instant the great field presented a remarkable appearance cavalry were charging in every direction and it was hard to tell friend from foe stuart was fighting so to say from the centre ******** the enemy were in his front in his rear and on both his flanks if they closed in apparently he would be crushed as in a vice the iron hand would strangle him that moment tested the nerves stuarts heart of oak bore the strain he was aroused stung his cheeks burned his eyes ********* the man was sufficient for the work i looked closely at him do or die was plain on his face from that instant i never had any doubts about stuart he rushed two pieces of artillery to a knoll in front of the line of federal horsemen a moment afterward two reports were heard and two shell burst precisely in the middle of the line making a wide gap in it and checking the charge which had begun all at once i saw a column of cavalry coming up from the river and turning to stuart said general what cavalry is that hamptons stuart exclaimed bring it up like lightning i set out at full gallop and soon reached the column at the head of it rode young the beau sabreur of georgia erect gallant with his brave eye and smile i pointed out the enemy and gave the order all right exclaimed young and turning to his men he whirled his sabre around his head and shouted forward the column thundered on and as it passed i recognized mohun his flashing eye and burnished sabre gleaming from the ********* in five minutes they were in front of the ******** men wheeled and faced the federal line charge rose from a hundred lips spurs were buried in the hot flanks the mass was hurled at the enemy and clashing like thunder sword against sword swept every thing before it not a single shot was ******** sabre only was used the enemy were broken to ********** i saw was a wild mle of whirling swords flying horses men ****** to the chin while others were seen throwing themselves from the saddle and raising their hands to escape the keen ********* slashing at them the great force of the enemy sweeping down on stuarts flank was thus routed the spectacle which followed was ludicrous as well as exciting the enemy fled in disorder never before had i seen the nails in the hind shoes of hundreds of ************* of horses tails streaming like meteors as they ran the force disappeared in the woods hotly pursued by their foes the dust followed them in a great ********* that cloud arose yells and ************ thundered carbines ********** that sound receded more and more rapidly toward the river on our left the brave william hf lee had been as successful he had charged and repulsed the enemy falling wounded at the head of his men they had not again advanced upon him near the barbour house he presented an unbroken front to them stuart held with his cavalry indeed the whole fleetwood range the long thunder of his artillery said to the enemy come on they did not come they went back their cavalry had crossed the river to ascertain the meaning of the great review they had discovered nothing after heavy loss the ground was strewed with their dead and ********* retired shattered and bleeding stuarts loss was also ********* his staff was not spared one of my brother staff officers was killed another wounded a third captured but stuart had won the greatest cavalry fight of the war in a room of the barbour house on fleetwood hill stuart was writing a dispatch to general lee it was nearly sunset and the red light was streaming through the windows on the floor lay a number of wounded men groaning piteously busily attending to their wants were two young ******** daughters of judge conway whom i had seen on the night of the ball the young ladies i afterward discovered had been on a visit to the family occupying the barbour house had courageously remained during the whole of the battleand they were now busily attending to the wants of the wounded i was gazing at the ********* superb beauty with the disdainful eyes who had held that ********* with her circle of ************ stuart finished his dispatches and turned around any reports he said briefly to a member of his staff none ************* that colonel mohun is reported killed mohun it is impossible he drove the enemy and was unhurt i would not **** him for a hundred nor a thousand of the enemy thank you general said a sonorous voice behind us and mohun entered making the military salute as he did so in his bearing i could discern the same cool pride mingled with satire there was only one change in him he was paler than ever and i could see that his right shoulder was bloody as he entered miss georgia conway who was bending over a wounded soldier raised her head and looked at him mohuns eye met her own and he bowed ************* taking no further notice of her at this exhibition of careless indifference i could see miss conways face flush an expression of freezing hauteur came to the beautiful lips and the disdainful glance indicated that her amour ****** was deeply wounded she turned her back upon him *********** as mohun had already turned his the movement failed in its object the officer was looking at stuart who had grasped his hand he winced as the general pressed it and turned paler but said nothing then you are not dead mohun exclaimed stuart laughing not in the least general i am happy to inform you replied mohun i am truly glad to hear it what news our party is all over we followed them up until they recrossed the ******** i owed them this little piece of politeness for i recognized an old acquaintance in the commander of the squadron an acquaintance a certain colonel ****** charming person general and mohun laughed i recognized him yonder when we charged on the hill and at first he followed his men when they broke as i got close to him however in the woods he recognized me in turn and we crossed swords he is ******* man braver and he did his utmost to put an end to me i had somewhat similar views myself in reference to my friend the colonel but his men interposed and prevented my carrying them out they were all around me slashing away i was nearly cut out of the ******* was carried away from my friend in the ****** the ********* cut of all was his parting compliment as he retreated through the river what was that mohun a bullet from his pistol which grazed my shoulder a mere scratch but provoking i saw him grin as he fired an old friend on the yankee side well that happens said stuart frequently general said mohun and this one was very dear ********** tenderly attached to me i assure you my affection for him is of the same endearing nature and we only crossed sabres in ***** mere ******* bout for amusement we would not hurt each other for worlds and mohuns mustache curled with laughter there was something restless and sinister in it suddenly his face grew paler and his eyes were half closed well mohun said stuart who was not looking at him i am going to send you across the river on a reconnaissance tonight all right general and the officer made the military salute as he did so he staggered and stuart raised his eyes you are wounded he exclaimed a trifle laughed mohun but as he spoke his frame tottered his face assumed the hue of a corpse and he would have fallen had not miss georgia conway started up unconsciously from the wounded man whom she was attending to and supported the officer in her arms mohun opened his eyes and a grim smile came to his pale face a pretty tableau i heard him murmur it would do to put in a romance a cup of ***** a ********** would finish as he uttered these singular words the blood gushed from his wounded shoulder his eyes closed and his head falling on the bosom of the young girl he fainted fleetwood was the first gun of the great campaign which culminated on the heights of gettysburg a week afterward lees columns were in motion toward pennsylvania was that invasion the dictate of his own judgment history will answer what is certain is that the country like the army shouted forward the people were ablaze with wild enthusiasm the soldiers flushed with the pride of their great victories of fredericksburg and chancellorsville the authorities at richmond shared the excitement and the commissarygeneral with unwonted humor or in sober earnest ******** it is said upon a requisition for supplies if general lee wishes rations let him seek them in pennsylvania i doubt if the great commander shared the general agitation i think he aimed to draw hooker out of virginia leaving the rest to providence so he moved toward the potomac the world had called lee cautious after this invasion that charge was not repeated from first to last audacity seemed the sentiment inspiring him with hooker on the rappahannock threatening richmond lee thrust his advance force under ewell through the blue ridge toward maryland pushed longstreet up to culpeper to support him and kept only ap hill at fredericksburg to bar the road to the confederate capital hooker wished to advance upon it but president lincoln forbade him the dispatch was a queer official document in case you find lee coming to the north of the rappahannock lincoln wrote i would by no means cross to the south of it i would not take any risk of being entangled upon the river like an ox jumped half over a fence and liable to be torn by dogs front and rear without a fair chance to gore one way or kick the other ludicrous perhaps but to the point the ************ was not always dignified but often judicious chancellorsville had been ********** assault foreboded thus by lincoln

terrific cry arose among the welltodo farmers of pennsylvania the wolf had appeared in the fold ewell was rapidly advancing upon harrisburg behind came the veteran corps of hill and longstreet the gorges of the blue ridge were alive with bristling bayonets then the waters of the potomac splashed around the waists of the infantry and the wheels of the artillery carriages soon the fields of

coming to return to the cavalry the horsemen of stuart were going to move in an eccentric ***** these are my memoirs reader not a history of the war i describe only what i saw and am going to ask you now to follow the feather of stuart stuart was promptly in the saddle and when lee began to move advanced north of the rappahannock drawing a cordon of cavalry across the roads above middleburg to guard the approaches to the mountain the result was that the infantry defiled through the blue ridge without hookers knowledge he knew that something was going on but there his information terminated the troopers of stuart kept watch over fifteen miles of front and through this wall of sabres the federal eye could not pierce stuart is regarded by many as only a brave ****** it was on occasions like this however that he performed his greatest services everywhere he confronted the enemy in stubborn battle and the work was hard it was fighting fighting *********** as in 1862 when he covered lees retreat after sharpsburg day and night the cavalry had no rest the crack of carbines the clash of sabres and the roar of cannon were incessant it was a war of giants which fauquier and loudoun saw in those ******* not until the rear of lees column had nearly reached the potomac did general hooker by a desperate effort succeed in driving stuart back in these pages i must leave that obstinate struggle *********** it was full of romantic scenes and illustrated by daring courage but all is lost to view in the lurid smoke of gettysburg with one scene in the hurrying drama i shall pass to greater events but first i beg to introduce to the reader a very singular personage who is destined to play an important part in the history i am writing it was the night of the 20th of june 1863 stuarts headquarters had been established in a house on the roadside above middleburg we had been fighting all day had returned only at nightfall and i was exchanging a few words with stuart before following the staff to rest when all at once a third personage who seemed to have arisen from the floor stood before us his presence was so sudden and unexpected that i started then i looked at him curiously he was a man of about forty thin wiry and with a nose resembling the beak of a bird of prey his eyes half buried under bushy eyebrows twinkled like two stars his mouth was large and smiling his expression exceedingly benignant from the face i passed to the costume the worthy was clad in severe black with a clerical white cravat wore a black beaver hat of the ********* order and presented the appearance of a pious and peaceable ************** that of a clergyman smiling benignantly upon all around him stuart uttered an exclamation of satisfaction ah nighthawk here you are he said and turning to me he introduced the new ***** as mr nighthawk one of my private friends and true as steel mr nighthawk bowed with an air of smiling ********* benignant sweetness i am glad to know you colonel and hope i may have an opportunity of being of service to you some day he said the voice was low soft and accorded with the mild expression of the countenance well what news nighthawk asked stuart experience tells me that you have something of importance to communicate ah general yes you pass in the cavalry by the name of the man before the battle for you always turn up then mr nighthawk smiled i try to give you information general and perhaps i have some news but first of my visits to boston new york philadelphia and washington where i saw many of our friends and in his low quiet voice mr nighthawk who had taken a seat and smoothed down his white cravat proceeded to speak of his travels and what he had seen the narrative astounded me he spoke without reserve for general stuart had informed him that he might do so before me and i was startled to find the number of private friends the south had in the north mr nighthawk was evidently au fait at his trade he had a perfect understanding plainly with persons of the highest political position and stuart listened with the greatest interest to the speaker whose low voice never rose above the *********** by which i had been impressed on his first opening his lips so the summing up of all this said stuart that our friends are not too hopeful they are not general they say lee must win a great victory on the soil of pennsylvania yes general without it there is no hope of peace they declare well i think they are right and that we shall gain the victory mr nighthawk made no reply and stuart reflected for some moments without speaking then rousing himself i forgot he said you have not given me your special information nighthawk the worthy smiled you know i am the man before the battle general yes go on nighthawk i have just left general hookers headquarters where are they beyond centreville you saw him i conversed with him ah an hour general as the rev mr ward from ************ of the grand union sanitary commission and mr nighthawk smiled of course i urged active movements and general hooker became quite animated he agreed with your views then said stuart laughing perfectly general and he intends there is the important thing while we were conversing general hooker was called for a moment out of his tent and by accident my eyes fell upon an order which lay upon his desk an order for two divisions of cavalry one of infantry and a full complement of artillery to advance and drive you back to the mountain ah you saw that order i did general it was just ready to be sent what day did it fix tomorrow general ah indeed two divisions of infantry and one of cavalry mr nighthawk inclined in assent when did you leave hookers headquarters this afternoon and you came through the lines tonight yes general in the usual way by passing through the pickets i was on foot and nothing was easier stuart knit his brows and reflected then he called to the orderly wake the adjutantgeneral and have three couriers ready at once mr nighthawk arose ******* general he said i saw swartz whom i have mentioned to you yes the best spy you say in the federal army i think he is general he is a wonderful man he recently played a trick upon you upon me at least he bore off a prisoner from you it was a lady captured by colonel mohun one night on the rappahannock ah is it possible so swartz was the old countryman driving the wagon that morning so he informed me general you are friends then close friends and mr nighthawk smiled we have an ************ that would not interest you general that was really swartz and the old woman was the prisoner well said stuart that was a bold stroke but the lady was handsome enough to make friends there is something between herself and colonel mohun is there not mr nighthawk glanced quickly at the face of the general his eyes resembled steel points but the piercing glance at once sank something between them general what could have made you think that but here is major mcclellan i will not detain you general i will come back at daylight to receive your orders with these words mr nighthawk distributed a benignant smile bowed in a friendly manner and disappeared it was difficult to say how from the apartment i had turned my eyes from him but an instant when i again looked he was gone and now to work exclaimed stuart we are going to fight tomorrow surry since the man before the battle has made his appearance at daybreak stuart was going at full gallop to the front a rapid fire of skirmishers mingled with the dull roar of cannon indicated that nighthawk had not been deceived all at once the sharpshooters were seen falling back from the woods bring me a piece of artillery exclaimed stuart darting to the front but the attack of the enemy swept all before it stuart was driven back and was returning doggedly when the gun for which he had sent galloped up and unlimbered in the road it was too late suddenly a solid shot screamed above us the gun was hurled from its carriage and rolled shattered and useless in the wood the horses were seen rearing wild with terror and trying to kick out of the harness suddenly one of them leaped into the air and fell torn in two by a second round shot quick work said stuart grimly and turning round to me he said pointing to a hill in rear post three pieces on that hill to rake all the roads the order like the former came too late however the enemy advanced in overpowering ********** stuart back beyond his headquarters where they captured the military satchel of the present ********* still rushing forward like a hurricane compelled the confederate cavalry to retire behind goose creek on the high ground there stuart posted his artillery opened a rapid fire and before this storm of shell the federal forces paused the spectacle at that moment was picturesque and imposing the enemys force was evidently large long columns of cavalry heavy masses of infantry and artillery at every opening right left and centre showed that the task of driving back stuart was not regarded as very easy the sunshine darted from bayonet and sabre all along the great line of battleand from the heavy smoke tinged with flame came the federal shell with their infantry cavalry and artillery they seemed determined to put an end to us stuart galloped to his guns pouring a steady fire from the lofty hill captain davenant directed it in person and he was evidently in his right element all his sadness had disappeared a cool and resolute smile lit up his features all right davenant hold your ground exclaimed stuart i will do so general can you keep them from crossing i can try general a whirlwind of shell screamed around the two speakers for the hundredth time i witnessed that entire indifference to danger which was a trait of stuart the fire at this moment was so terrible that i heard an officer say general stuart seems trying to get himself and everybody killed nothing more inspiring however can be imagined than his appearance at that moment his horse wild with terror reared darted and attempted to ****** his rider stuart paid no attention to him he had no eyes or thought for any thing but the enemy his cheeks were flushed his eyes ******** resembled a veritable king of battle from stuart my glances passed to davenant his coolness impressed me deeply while giving an order a shell burst right in his face enveloping horse and rider in a cloud of ******** when the smoke drifted away he was sitting his horse unmoved and giving the order as quietly as before i have not invented this picture reader or fancied this character i had the honor to enjoy the friendship of the brave boy i describe he was remarkable in an epoch crowded with remarkable characters stuart held his ground for an hour on the high hills of goose creek but it then became plain that he was going to be driven back the enemy had felt him and discovered that the game was in their own hands now they rushed on his right left and centre at the same ************* infantry and artillery rolling on like a ************** the stream charged the ****** a moment a bitter and savage combat commenced for the possession of the crest stuart rushed toward the guns as he reached them a cannon ball carried off the head of a ********* and his horse reared with fright nearly trampling on the headless trunk which spouted blood davenant had coolly drawn his sabre but had given no order to retire move back the guns exclaimed stuart is it necessary general asked davenant yes they will be captured in five minutes it is a pity we can not remain general this is an excellent position and he gave the order to ****** up the operation was performed amid a hurricane of bullets striking down the cannoneers suddenly a column of federal cavalry charged straight at the guns davenant met them with his mounted men armed with sabres and a stubborn combat followed it was a hilt to hilt affair and davenant was in the midst of it shouting you are fighting for your guns boys you promised to die by your guns the men answered with fierce shouts and met the enemy with savage resolution meanwhile the guns had rushed at a gallop down the western slope a regiment came to davenants assistance the fight grew desperate but was of no avail in fifteen minutes we were driven driven do you know what that means reader ask old soldiers if it is pleasant they will growl in reply we were forced back step by step with the enemy at our very heels at our backs came on the huge column yelling and firing mad with triumph stuart the valiant the obstinate the unshrinking was driven we were forced back to upperville and there things looked stormy on the other roads stuarts right and left were rapidly retiring his centre at upperville seemed devoted to destruction the enemy came on like a whirlwind with a roaring shout as far as the eye could see the great fields were dark with them their horse artillery advanced at a gallop unlimbered and tore the retreating columns with shot and shell i was ten yards from stuart just at the edge of the town when a picked body of federal horsemen darted straight upon him they had evidently recognized him by his majorgenerals uniform and splendid feather bullets hissed around him blows were struck at him and for an instant i saw him in the midst of a wild ****** of enemies defending himself with his revolver only in an instant he would have been killed or captured with his staff and bodyguard when a resounding shout was heard i glanced over my shoulder and saw the cavaliers of hampton coming on with drawn sabre then a splendid spectacle was ************* of wade hampton in one of his great moments this stalwart cavalier was leading his men and in an instant they had struck the enemy with a noise like thunder suddenly a cavalier on a black horse rushed by like the wild huntsman and i recognized mohun who spurring his animal to headlong speed drove straight at the leader of the federal cavalry almost in contact with us through a rift in the smoke i caught a glimpse of mohuns opponent he was a man of low stature but broad heavy and powerful he came to meet his adversary with the bridle of his horse resting on the animals neck while both hands clutched a heavy ********** raised over his right shoulder i could only see that the two opponents hurled together like knights ******* their swords gleamed they closed in body to body then the smoke wrapped them it was impossible to see more sore and restive at the reverse which had come to balance his victory of fleetwood stuart bivouacked near paris that night and made every preparation to attack at dawn at daylight he was in the saddle and spurred to the high ground commanding upperville all at once he checked his horse the enemy had disappeared stuarts blue eye flashed and half an hour afterward he was advancing at the head of his cavalry not a foe was visible pressing on through upperville and over the trampled fields beyond he continued to advance upon middleburg and near that place came up with the rear of the enemy they showed little fight however and were driven beyond the place the gray troopers pursued them with shouts and ********** which were mingled cries of rejoicing from the people of middleburg an hour afterward the lines were reestablished in triumph stuart returned to his former headquarters amid a drenching rain and this recalls an incident very honorable to the brave soldier as night descended dark and stormy stuart gazed gloomily at the torrents of rain falling my poor fellows he said with a sigh they will have a hard time tonight then suddenly turning to his servant he added spread my ******** and blankets under that apple tree yonder i will keep them dry enough when i once get into them you are not going to sleep out on such a night general exclaimed a staff officer certainly i am was his reply i dont intend to fare better

walking uneasily to and fro as the day wore on he exhibited more and more impatience all at once at the appearance of an officer approaching rapidly from the front he uttered an exclamation of pleasure here is mosby at last he said and he went to meet the newcomer it was the famous chief of partisans whose name by this time had become a terror to the enemy he wore a plain gray uniform a brace of revolvers in a swaying belt rode a spirited gray mare and i recognized at once the roving glance and satirical smile which had struck me on that night when he rescued ****** and myself in fauquier stuart rapidly drew him into a private apartment remained in consultation with him for half an hour and then came forth with a smile of evident satisfaction ****** intelligence must have pleased him it at least dispelled his gloom an hour afterward his headquarters had **************** thing was sent toward the mountains stuart set out apparently to follow thembut that was only a ruse to blind busybodies a quarter of a mile from headquarters he leaped a fence and doubled back going in the direction now of manassas at daylight on the next morning he had forced his way through the bull run mountain two hours afterward he had made a sudden attack on the enemys infantry it was the rear of hancocks corps which was the rear of hookers army then retiring toward the potomac stuarts

an excellent supper was plainly in preparation for the bold stuart and his military family and that gay and gallant cavalier general fitz lee having also been invited the joy of the occasion was complete the house rang with clashing heels rattling sabres and clanking spurs a more charming sound still however was that made by jingling keys and rattling china and knives and forks all was joy and uproar jests compliments and laughter young ladies went and came the odors grew more inviting in ten minutes the door of a large apartment opposite the drawingroom was thrown open and a

heavy beard and mustache and brilliant fighting jacket he looked round with a gay smile was any one absent asked the kind lady of the house as she saw the glance stuart made a low bow and said all are here madam all at once however a voice at the door responded i think you are mistaken general and he who had uttered these words advanced into the apartment he was a young man about twentythree of medium height graceful and with a smile of charming good humor upon the lips his hair was light and curling his eyes blue his lips shaded by a slender mustache his uniform was brand new and decorated with the braid of a lieutenant yellow gauntlets reached his elbow he wore a shiny new satchel and in his hand carried a brown felt hat caught up with a golden star stuart grasped his hand warmly here

supper near buckland when we wrapped our ***** around us and fell asleep on the floor the little maidens still laughed in our dreams stuart moved again at dawn the scene of the preceding evening had passed away like a dream we were in the saddle and advancing riding beside lieutenant tom herbert i conversed with that worthy and found the tedious march beguiled by his gay and ********** talk his

my life was grand ********** of your low military exposure like that borne by the miserable privates and officers in the field i slept in town lived at a hotel mounted my horse after breakfast at the

of his column through the immense deserted camps around wolf run shoals attended only by two or three staff officers as i now raised my head quickly i saw him coming back at headlong speed directing his horse by means of the halter only and hotly pursued by a detachment of federal cavalry firing on him as they pressed with loud shouts upon his very heels halt shouted the enemy and this order was followed by bang bang bang stuart did not obey the order halt halt and a storm of bullets whistled around our heads i had drawn my sword but before i could go to stuarts assistance tom shot ahead of me he came just in time two of the enemy had caught up with stuart and were making furious cuts at him he ******* the blow of one of the federal ************* the other fell from the saddle throwing up his hands as he did so tom herbert had placed his pistol on his breast and shot him through the heart but by this time the rest had reached us a sabre flashed above toms head fell cutting him out of the saddle nearly and he would have dropped from it had i not passed my arm around him in another instant all three would have been killed or captured but the firing had given the alarm a thunder of hoofs was heard a squadron of our cavalry dashed over the hill in three minutes the enemy were flying to escape the edge of the sabre stuart led the charge and seemed to enjoy it with the zest of a ********* he had indeed escaped from a critical danger he had pushed on with a few of his staff as i have said to fairfax station had then stopped and slipped his bridle to allow his horse to eat some yankee oats and while standing beside the animal had been suddenly charged by the party of federal cavalry coming down on a reconnaissance from the direction of the courthouse so sudden was their

in the generals mirth he was examining the satchel which a sabre stroke had nearly cut in two what are you looking at asked stuart this hole general replied tom uttering a piteous sigh well it is a trifle it is a serious matter general you have lost something yes what a joint of my new flute and tom herberts expression was so melancholy that stuart burst into laughter you may have lost your flute tom he said leaning on his shoulder but you have won your spurs at least in the cavalry at daylight on the next morning stuart had crossed the potomac into maryland he had advanced from wolf run shoals to fairfax court house where the men rifled the sutlers shops of tobacco figs white gloves straw hats and every ****** and ************ the column pushed on toward ****** falls where the long wavering line of horsemen might have been seen hour after hour crossing the moonlit river each man to prevent ******* holding above his head a shot or shell taken from the caissons then the artillery was dragged through the panting horses trotted on and the first beams of day saw the long column of stuart ready to advance on its perilous pathway to the susquehanna by the route between the federal army and washington the word was given and with the red flags fluttering stuart moved toward ********* ********* save by a picket which was driven off by the advance guard without further incident he then pushed on and entered the town in triumph a charming reception awaited him the place was thoroughly southern and the passage of the cavalry was greeted with loud cheers unbounded was the delight above all of a seminary of young girls doors and windows were crowded bright eyes shone red lips laughed waving handkerchiefs were seen everywhere and when stuart appeared in person he was received with wild rejoicing he bowed low removing his plumed hat but suddenly intelligence came which forced him to push on a long train of government wagons had come up from washington and on discovering our presence returned toward the city at a gallop but the ferocious rebels were after them stuart led the charging ********* warlike teamsters were soon ********* trains became our ******** with countless kicking mules driven onward in ****** before them the cavalry escorting the captured wagons continued their way toward pennsylvania moving all that night stuart came to westminster where fitz lee the gallant drove the enemys cavalry from their camp and the town fell into the hands of stuart here ****** instead of smiles greeted us every face was glum and forbidding with a few exceptions so we hastened to depart from that loyal town and were soon on the soil of pennsylvania approaching hanover we suddenly waked up the hornets chambliss leading stuarts advance pushed ahead and drove in a picket then that brave soldier rushed on and seemed intent on taking the place when i was sent by stuart to order him not to go too far i came up with chambliss as he was charging but had scarcely given him the order when he was charged in turn by a heavy force and driven back the enemy rushed on firing volleys and the road was full of tramping horsemen to avoid being carried away with them i diverged into a field when all at once stuart appeared retreating at full gallop before a party who were chasing him it was a serious matter then but i laugh now remembering that good run stuart and myself retreated at a gallop boot to boot leaped ditches and fences and got off in safety a few moments afterward his artillery opened its thunders from the lofty hill that hardy captain of the horse artillery breathed roared obstinately driving them back hamptons guns on the right had opened ****** until night we held the heights repulsing every advance of the enemy it was truly a fine spectacle that handsome town of hanover as i looked at it on the afternoon of the fair june day in front extended green fields then the church spires rose above the roofs of the town behind a range of mountains formed a picturesque background it is true the adjuncts of the scene were far from peaceful the green fields were full of blue sharpshooters in the suburbs were posted batteries down the mountain road behind wound a long compact column of cavalry breathed fought hard that day from the waving field of rye on the upland his guns thundered **** the face of that fire the enemy could not or would not advance so the night came on and stuarts great train moved those wagons were a terrible *********** to us on the march but stuart determined not to abandon them and they were dragged *** line stretched to ******** thenceforth dear reader the march was a sort of dream to me how can i relate my ************* numerous spectacles and events of the time i know not even now if they were events

********** the red barns the ******** voices the strange ********* these actual things or the mere fancies of a ************ was i an officer of real cavalry making a real march or a fanciful being one of a long column of phantoms i seem dimly to remember a pretty face whose owner smiled on meand a faint memory remains of a supper which she gave me if i am not mistaken i was left alone in the town of ************ faces were around meand i was falling asleep when hamptons cavalry came up i think then i rode on with ********* been left to direct him that we talked about horses and the superiority of blood in animals that at dawn hampton said i am ********* for sleep and that we lay down side by side near a ******** all that is a sort of phantasmagoria and others were no better than myself whole columns went to sleep in the saddle as they rode along and general stuart told me afterward that he saw a man attempt to climb over a fence half succeed only and go to sleep on the top rail some day i promise myself the pleasure of travelling in pennsylvania it possesses all the attractions to me of a world seen in a dream but after that good sleep side by side with the great carolinian things looked far more real and pushing on i again caught up with stuart he advanced steadily on carlisle and in the afternoon we heard artillery from the south i looked at my military map and calculated the distance the result was that i said general those guns are at a place called gettysburg on this map impossible was his reply they can not be fighting there you are certainly wrong but i was right those guns were the signal of the first days fight at gettysburg it can not be said that we accomplished very enormous results at carlisle the enemy defended it bravely stuart sent in a flag demanding a surrender this proposition was politely declined and for fear that there might possibly remain some doubts on the subject the federal commander of the post opened with artillery upon the gray cavalry that was the signal for a brisk fight and a magnificent spectacle also as soon as the enemys response to the flag of truce had been received stuart advanced his sharpshooters replied with his artillery to their own and dispatched a party to destroy the extensive united states barracks formerly used as cantonments for recruits to the army in ten minutes the buildings were wrapped in flames and the city of carlisle was illumined magnificently the crimson light of the conflagration revealed every house the long lines of trees and made the delicate church spires rising calmly aloft resemble shafts of ********** marble i recall but one scene which was equally ************** doomed city of fredericksburg on the night of december 11 1862 when the church spires were illumined by the burning houses as those of carlisle were in june 1863 so much for this new siege of carlisle here my description ends it was ******** mere picture an hour afterward stuart ceased firing the conflagration died down back into the black night sank the fair town of carlisle seen then for the first and the last time by this historian the guns were silent the cavalry retired and stuart accompanied by his staff galloped back to a great deserted house where he established his temporary headquarters on the bold face there was an expression of decided ******** he had just received a dispatch by courier from general lee that dispatch said come i need you urgently here and the here in question was gettysburg at least twenty miles distant now with wornout men and horses twenty miles was a serious matter stuarts brows were knit and he mused gloomily suddenly he turned and addressed me you were right surry he said those guns were at gettysburg this dispatch sent this morning reports the enemy near there i bowed stuart reflected for some moments without speaking then he suddenly said i wish you would go to general lee and say i am coming surry how is your horse wornout general but i can get another good tell general lee that i will move at once to gettysburg with all my force and as rapidly as possible i will lose no time general and saluting i went out from the captured horses i selected the best one i could find and burying the spurs in his sides set out through the black night you know when you set out the proverb says but you know not when you will arrive i left carlisle breasting the night on the road to gettysburg little thinking that a curious incident was to occur to me upon the ***** incident closely connected with the destinies of some personages who play prominent parts in this history i had ridden on for more than an hour through the darkness keeping a good lookout for the enemy whose scouting parties of cavalry were known to be prowling around when all at once my horse who was going at full speed struck his foot against a sharp point of rock cropping out from the surface the animal stumbled recovered himself and went on as rapidly as before a hundred yards further his speed relaxed then he began to limp painfully then in spite of every application of the spur i could not force him out of a slow limping trot it was truly unfortunate i was the bearer of an important message and was surrounded by enemies the only chance was to pass through them under shadow of the darkness with light they would perceive me and my capture be certain a hundred yards further and i found i must decide at once upon the course to pursue my horse seemed about to fall at every stroke of the spur he groaned piteously and his limp had become a stagger i looked around through the trees and at the distance of a quarter of a mile i saw the glimmer of a light to obtain another horse was indispensable under the circumstances and looking to see that my revolver was loaded and ****** i forced my tottering animal toward the mansion in which the light glimmered my design was simply to proceed thither impress a fresh horse at the pistols muzzle throw my saddle upon him leave my own animal and proceed on my way pushing across the fields and dismounting to let down the fences which my limping animal could not leap i soon approached the light it shone through the window of a house of some size with ornamental grounds around it and apparently the abode of a man of means at fifty paces from it i dismounted and tethered my horse in the shadow of some trees a brief reconnaissance under the circumstances was advisable and approaching the mansion silently without allowing my sabre to make any clatter i gained the long portico in front and went to a window reaching down to the flooring of the ******** through the halfclosed ********* i could see into a large apartment half library half sittingroom as the easy chairs mantel ornaments ***** and bookcases showed on the centretable burned a brilliant ******* by its light i witnessed a spectacle which made me draw back in the shadow of the shutter and ***** my eyes on the interior before me in the illuminated apartment i saw the woman whom mohun had captured on the rappahannock and beside her the personage with whom she had escaped that morning in the wagon from culpeper courthouse i could not mistake him the large prominent nose the cunning eyes the double chin the fat person and the chubby hands covered with ********* rings were still fresh in my memory the name of this personage had been revealed by nighthawk swartz the secret agent blockaderunner and best spy in the federal army was before me a glance at the woman revealed no change in her appearance before me was the same ***** and graceful figure clad as before in a gray dress i saw the same snowwhite cheeks red lips and large eyes burning with a latent fire the two were busily engaged and it was not difficult to understand their occupation the ***** drawers and chests of the apartment were all open and the female with rapid hands was transferring papers from them to swartz who ************ packed them in a leathern valise these papers were no doubt important and the aim to remove them to some place of safety beyond the reach of the confederates i gazed for some moments without moving upon the spectacle of these two nightbirds at their work the countenance of the lady was animated her motions rapid and from time to time she stopped to listen swartz on the contrary was the incarnation of phlegmatic coolness his face wore an expression of entire equanimity and he seemed to indulge no fears whatever of intruders all at once however i saw his eyes glitter as they fell upon a paper which she handed him to pack away with the rest it was carefully folded but one of the folds flew open as he received it and his eyes were suddenly fixed intently upon the sheet then his head turned quickly and he looked at his companion she was bending over a drawer and did not observe that glance thereupon swartz folded up the paper quietly put it in his pocket and went on packing the valise with his former coolness only a slight color in his face seemed to indicate concealed emotion as he ******** the paper his companion turned round it was plain that she had not perceived the manoeuvre at the same moment i heard the sound of hoofs in rear of the house and the clatter of a sabre as a cavalier dismounted a few indistinct words apparently addressed to a servant or orderly followed then the door of the apartment opposite the front window was thrown open and a man entered in the newcomer i recognized mohuns adversary at ***************** darke of the united states cavalry darke entered the apartment abruptly but his appearance seemed to occasion no surprise the spy retained his coolness the lady went on with her work you would have said that they had expected the officer and recognized his step their greeting was brief darke nodded in apparent approbation of the task in which the man and woman were engaged and folding his arms in front of the marble mantel looked on in silence i gazed at him with interest and more carefully than i had been able to do during the fight at upperville when the smoke soon concealed him let me draw his outline of all the human beings whom i encountered in the war this ones character and career were perhaps the most remarkable were i writing a romance i should be tempted to call him the real hero of this volume he was a man approaching middle age low in stature but broad muscular and powerful he was clad in the ********* uniform of a colonel of the united states cavalry wore boots reaching to the knee and decorated with large spurs and his arms were an immense sabre and a brace of revolvers in black leather ******** attached to his belt his face was swarthy swollen by excess in drink apparently and half covered by a shaggy beard and mustache as black as night the eyes were deepset and wary the poise of the head upon the shoulders haughty the expression of the entire countenance cold phlegmatic grim such was this man upon the surface but there was something more about him which irresistibly attracted attention and aroused speculation at the first glance you set him down as a commonplace ruffian the prey of every brutal passion at the second glance you began to doubt whether he was a mere vulgar ************* could see at least that this man was not of low birth there was in his bearing an indefinable something which indicated that he had seen better days the surface of the fabric was foul and defiled but the texture beneath was of velvet not ****** gray that brute i thought was once a gentleman and crime or drink has destroyed him darke continued to gaze at swartz and the gray woman as they plied their busy work and once or twice be pointed to drawers which they had failed to open these directions were promptly obeyed and the work went on the few words which the parties uttered came in an indistinct murmur only through the window at which i was stationed such was the scene within the mansion upon which i gazed with strong curiosity suddenly the neigh of a horse was heard in a clump of woods beyond the front gate and darke quickly raised his head and then came out to the portico he passed within three feet of me but did not perceive me as i was concealed by one of the open ********* then he paused and listened the wind sighed in the foliage and a distant ******** was *********** was all no other noise disturbed the silence of the july night darke remained upon the portico for some moments listening attentively then turned and reentered the house through the window i could see him make his appearance again in the illuminated apartment in response to the glances of inquiry from his companions he made a gesture only but that said plainly nothing is stirring you can go on with your work in this however he was mistaken darke had scarcely reentered the apartment when i discerned the hoofstrokes of horses beyond the front ******** the animals were heard leaping the low ****** moment afterward two figures came on at full gallop threw themselves from the saddle and rapidly approached the house the rattle of a sabre which one of them wore attracted darkes attention he reached the door of the room at a single ******** at the same instant the new comers rushed by me and burst in as they passed i recognized them one was mohun the other nighthawk what followed was instantaneous the adversaries were face to face and each drew his pistol and fired at the same moment neither was struck they drew their swords and through the cloud of smoke filling the apartment i could see darke and mohun close in in a hand to hand encounter they were both excellent ********* and the struggle was passionate and terrible mohuns movements were those of the tiger springing upon his prey but darke met the attack with a coolness and ****** which indicated unshrinking nerve his expression seemed even to indicate that crossing swords with his adversary gave the swarthy giant extreme pleasure his face glowed and a flash darted from beneath the shaggy eyebrows i could see him smile but the smile was strange from the adversaries my glance passed quickly to the gray woman she was leaning against the wall and exhibited no emotion whatever but the lurid blaze in the great dark eyes as she looked at mohun clearly indicated that a storm was raging in her bosom opposite the woman stood ******************* but grasping a pistol as to swartz that worthy had profited by an open window near and had glided through it and disappeared to return to the combatants the passionate encounter absorbed all my attention mohun and darke were cutting at each other furiously they seemed equally matched and the result was doubtful one thing only seemed *********** in a few minutes one of the adversaries would be dead such was the situation of affairs when shots were heard without the clash of sabres followed and the door behind darke was burst open violently by his orderly who rushed in exclaiming look out colonel the enemy are on you as he uttered these words the man drew a revolver and aimed at mohuns breast before he could fire however an explosion was heard and i saw the man suddenly drop his weapon which went off as it escaped from his nerveless grasp then he threw up his hands reeled took two uncertain steps backward and fell at full length on the floor nighthawk had shot him through the heart all this had taken place in far less time than it has taken to write it i had made violent efforts to break through the window and finding this impossible now ran to the door and burst into the apartment the singular scene was to have as singular a ********** darke evidently realized the great danger which he ran for the house was now surrounded nearly and his capture was imminent from the black eyes shot a glare of defiance and advancing upon mohun he delivered a blow at him which nearly shattered his opponents sword mohun struck in turn aiming a furious cut at darke but as he did so he stumbled over the dead orderly and nearly fell for the moment he was at darkes mercy i rushed forward sword in hand to ward off the mortal stroke which i was certain his adversary would deliver but my intervention was useless darke recoiled from his stumbling adversary instead of striking at him i could scarcely believe my own eyes but the fact was unmistakable then the federal colonel looked around and his eye fell upon the woman kill him she said coldly do not mind ****** kill him no growled darke and seizing the woman in his arms they shall not take you prisoner he said and the swarthy hercules passed through the door in rear at a single bound bearing off the woman like a feather a moment afterward the hoofstrokes of a horse were heard darke had disappeared with the gray woman i turned to look at mohun he was standing perfectly motionless and looking after darke with a strange expression of gloom and astonishment you are unhurt i said he turned quickly and held out his hand slightly ********** i am not thinking of that of what then i remember only one ********* this man might have buried his sword in my heart and did not an hour afterward the skirmish was over i had explained my presence at the house to mohun parted with him promising to see him soon again and mounted upon a fresh animal which mohun presented to me from among those captured was once more on my way to gettysburg it was hard to realize that the scenes of the night were actual occurrences they were more like dreams than realities i came in sight of gettysburg at sunrise ************** instinct with so many tears with so much mourning with those sobs which tear their way from the human heart as the lava makes its way from the **** of the volcano

instinct with a more nameless horror than the once insignificant village of gettysburg i reached it on the morning of july 2 1863 the immense drama was in full progress the adversaries had clashed together riding across the extensive fields north of the town i saw the traces of the combat of the preceding dayand among the dying i remember still a poor federal soldier who looked at me with his stony and ********** eye as i passed he was an enemy but he was dying and i pitied him a few words will describe the situation of affairs at that moment lee had pressed on northward through the valley of the cumberland when news came that general meade who had succeeded hooker was advancing to deliver battle to the invaders at that intelligence lee arrested his march meade menaced his communications and it was necessary to check him hills corps was therefore sent across the south mountain toward gettysburg ewell who had reached york was ordered back and lee made his preparations to fight his adversary as soon as he appeared the columns encountered each other in the neighborhood of *********** great centre toward which a number of roads converge like the spokes of a wheel toward

became a rabble they retreated pellmell through gettysburg toward cemetery hill leaving their battleflags and five thousand prisoners in our hands such was the first days fight at gettysburg lees head of column had struck meades each had rapidly been reinforced the affair became a battle and the federal forces were completely defeated that was the turning point of the campaign if this success had only been followed **** we could only have seized upon and occupied cemetery hill then general meade would have been compelled to retire upon westminster and washington he would doubtless have fought somewhere but it is a terrible thing to have an army flushed with victory after you cemetery range was not seized that night when the sun rose the next morning the golden moment had passed general meade was ready from right to left as far as the eye could reach the heights bristled with blue infantry and artillery from every point on the ridge waved the enemys battle flags from the muzzles of his bronze wardogs meade sent his defiant challenge to his adversary to attack him come on the federal artillery seemed to mutter fiercely and lees guns from the ridge opposite thundered grimly in reply we are coming alas that is the word which rises to the lips of every southerner above all to every virginian who attempts to describe this terrible battle of gettysburg the cheeks flush the voice ******* and something like a fiery mist blinds the eyes what comes back to the memory of the old soldiers who saw that fight is a great picture of heroic assaults ending in frightful carnage ****** charges such as the world has rarely seen made in ****** furious ********** the only result of which was to strew those fatal fields with the dead bodies of the flower of the southern race and

line victory seemed within our very ******** we could not snatch it the enemy acknowledge that and it is one of their own poets who declares that the century reeled when longstreet paused on the slope of the hill pickett stormed cemetery heights and wanted only support five thousand men at his back would have given him victory there is a name for the battle of gettysburg which exactly suits itthe great ***** you must go to the histories reader for a detailed account of this battle i have not the heart to write it and aim to give you a few scenes only in my hasty memoirs i can touch only upon the salient points and make the general picture the ground on which the battle was fought is familiar to many thousands a few words will describe it cemetery ridge where general meade had taken up his position is a range of hills running northward toward gettysburg within a mile of which place it bends off to the right terminating in a lofty and ********* crest this crest was meades right his line stretched away southward then and ended at round top hill the southern extremity of the range about four miles distant from one end to the other of the extensive range bayonets glistened and the muzzles of cannon grinned defiance opposite the cemetery range was a lower line of hills called seminary range upon this lee was posted ewell holding his left a p hill his centre and longstreet his right between the two armies stretched a valley waving with grain and dotted with ********** through which ran the *********** road on the western side of a small stream the golden grain waved gently the limpid water lapsed away beneath grass and flowers the birds were singing the sun was ********* was the strangest of all scenes for a bloody conflict i rode along the line of battle and curiously scanned the features of the landscape there is a frightful interest connected with ground which is soon going to become the arena of a great combat a glance told me that the enemys position was much the stronger of the two would lee attack it from the landscape i turned to look at the army never had i seen them so joyous it would be impossible to convey any idea of the ******** which ****** them up every mans veins seemed to run with *********** instead of blood every cheek was glowing every eye flashed with superb joy and defiance you would have supposed indeed that the troops were under the effect of champagne or laughing gas i never even imagined such courage said a federal officer afterward your men seemed to be drunk with victory when they charged us that was scarce an exaggeration already on the morning of battle they presented this appearance lying down in line of battle they laughed jested sang and resembled children enjoying a holiday on the faces of bearded veterans and *********** alike was a splendid pride the victories of fredericksburg and chancellorsville had electrified the troops they thought little of a foe who could be so easily driven they looked forward to victory as a ******** ************** they did not remember that they held the heights at fredericksburg and that meade on cemetery hill was an adversary very different from hooker in the spottsylvania wilderness such was the spectacle which i witnessed when after delivering my message to general lee i rode along the southern line i think the great commander shared in some measure the sentiment of his troops his bearing was collected in his eye you could read no trace of excitement the lips covered by the gray mustache were firm and composed and he greeted me with quiet *********** in the cheeks of the great soldier a ruddy glow seemed to betray anticipated victory i confess i shared the general sentiment that strange intoxication was contagious and i was drunk like the rest with the thought of triumph that triumph would open to us the gates of washington and bring peace the north scarcely denied that ********** they may deny it today the whole country was completely weary of the war there seemed to be no hope of compelling the south to return to the union a victory over meade opening the whole north to lee promised a treaty of peace the day had arrived apparently when the army of northern virginia musket in hand was about to dictate the terms of that document lee has only to slip the leash i thought as i gazed at the army and these wardogs will tear down their prey alas they tore it but were torn too they did all at gettysburg that any troops could do what was impossible was beyond even their strength from the morning of the second of july to the evening of the third the fields south of gettysburg were one great scene of smoke dust uproar blood of columns advancing and returning cannon thundering men shouting yelling cheering and dying blue mingled with gray in savage and *********** battle in that ********** with the ears ******** you saw or heard little distinctly but above the confused struggle rose two great incidents which on successive days decided every thing the first of them was longstreets assault on the enemys left wing in front of round top hill lee had displayed excellent soldiership in determining upon this movement and it will be seen that it came within an inch of success standing upon seminary range near his centre he had ************* general meades position through his fieldglass with great attention and this examination revealed the fact that the federal line was projected forward in a salient in front of round top hill a jagged and almost inaccessible peak near which rested general meades extreme left if this weak point could be carried it appeared said lee that its possession would give facilities for assailing and carrying the more elevated ground and crest beyond as to the importance of that *********** round top ******** general meade if they had succeeded in occupying that it would have prevented me from holding any of the ground which i subsequently held to the last lee determined to attack the salient making at the same time a heavy *************** a real *********** the federal right opposite ewell all his preparations were not made until the afternoon then suddenly longstreets artillery opened its thunders at that moment the spectacle was grand the heights the slopes the fields and the rugged crest opposite were enveloped in smoke and fire from the bursting shell the sombre roar ascended like the bellowing of a thousand bulls leaped back from the rocks and rolled away in wild echoes through the hills all the furies seemed let loose and yet this was only the preface at four in the evening the thunder dropped to silence and along the lines of hood and mclaws which formed the charging column ran a wild cheer which must have reached the ears of the enemy opposite that cheer told both sides that the moment had come the word was given and longstreet hurled his column at the blue line occupying a peachorchard in his front the blow was aimed straight at the salient in the federal line and in spite of a brave resistance it was swept away mclaws advancing rapidly toward the high ground in its rear at one blow the whole left wing of general meades army seemed thrown into ************* confusion and hood pressing forward on mclawss right hastened to seize upon the famous round top from which he would be able to hurl his thunder upon the flank and rear of the federal line of battle the scene like the conflict which now took place was wild and singular the crest of round top hill was a mass of rock which rose abruptly from the rough and jagged slope it was ************* the sudden overthrow of the force in front of it had not been ************** one headlong rush on the part of hood alone seemed necessary to give him possession of the real key of the whole position hood saw that at a glance and dashed up the slope at the head of his men it was scarcely an order of battle which his troops presented at this moment but one thought burned in every

spot this force it is said was hurried up by general warren who finding the federal signalofficers about to retire ordered them to remain and continue waving their flags to the last and then seizing on the first brigade he could find rushed them up the slope to the crest they arrived just in time hoods men were swarming on the crest a loud cheer arose but all at once they found themselves face to face with a line of bayonets while beyond were seen confused and struggling masses dragging up cannon what followed was a savage grapple rather than an ordinary conflict only a small part of hoods force had reached the summit and this was assailed by a whole brigade the fight was indescribable all that the eye could make out for some moments in the dust and smoke was a confused mass of men clutching each other dealing blows with the ******** of muskets or ******* with *********** in blue and gray wrestling cursing falling and dying in the midst of the crash of smallarms and the thunder

after nearly seizing upon the crest in his front the enemy had quickly reenforced their left with brigades divisions and corps and the confederates had been hotly assailed in their turn as night descended the whole southern line fell back the pallid moonlight shone on the upturned faces of the innumerable dead longstreet sat on a fence cutting a stick with his penknife when an english officer near him exclaimed i would not have missed this for any thing longstreet laughed grimly i would like to have missed it very much he said lees great blow at the enemys left had failed he had thrown his

his resolution if the writer of the south shrinks from describing the bloody repulse of longstreet much more gloomy is the task of painting that last charge at gettysburg it is one of those scenes

said could he have gone into the charge i could not prevent him came in a groan almost from the old cavalier i forbade him but he got a musket somewhere and went over the breastworks with the rest i

never have i seen a human being more composed general davenant wheeled and saluted we are cut to pieces general he said with something like a fiery tear in his eye we did our best and we drove thembut were not supported my ********* brave old brigade is gone this is my **** brought him ****** he is dying too the hoarse tones and fiery tears of the old cavalier made my heart beat i could see a quick

pressed the hand of general davenant and said in his deep grave voice this has been a sad day for us ******** sad day but we cannot expect always to gain victories never ******* this has been my fault it is i who have lost this fight and you must help me out of it in the best way you can as he uttered these measured words general lee saluted and disappeared in the smoke general davenant followed bearing the wounded boy still upon his saddle ten minutes afterward i was riding to find general stuart who had sent me with a message just before the charge i had gloomy news for him the battle of gettysburg was lost the sun was sinking red and baleful when i reached stuart beyond the left wing of the army from the afternoon of the second to this night of the third of july the cavalry had met that of the enemy in stubborn conflict the columns had hurled together general hampton had been severely wounded in a handtohand encounter with sabres while leading his men stuart had narrowly escaped death or capture in the mle and fitz lee had fought hilt to hilt with the federal horsemen repulsing them and coming back laughing as was his wont all these scenes i have passed over however the greater drama absorbed me the gray horsemen were fighting heroically but what was that encounter of sabres when the fate of gettysburg was being decided at cemetery hill so i pass over all that and hasten on now to the sequel memory finds few scenes to attract it in the days that followed gettysburg but i beg the reader to observe that i should have no scenes of a humiliating character to draw never was army less whipped than that of lee after this fight do you doubt that statement reader do you think that the southerners were a disordered rabble flying before the federal bayonets a flock of panicstricken sheep hurrying back to the potomac with the bay of the federal wardogs in their ears that *************** by a number of our northern ********* entirely fanciful lees army was not even shaken it was fagged hungry out of ammunition and it ********** not until it had remained for twentyfour hours in line of battle in front of the enemy perfectly careless of even inviting attack i should have liked nothing better than to have been attacked said longstreet and have no doubt i should have given those who tried as bad a reception as pickett received it may be said that this is the boast of the defeated side but general meade when interrogated before the war committee stated the exact facts my opinion is now said meade that general lee evacuated that position not from the fear that he would be dislodged from it by any active operations on my part but that he was fearful a force would be sent to harpers ferry to cut off his communications that was what caused him to retire did you discover asked one of the committee after the battle of gettysburg any symptoms of demoralization in lees army no sir was general meades reply i saw nothing of that kind that statement was just and general meade was too much of a gentleman and soldier to withhold it he knew that his great adversary was still unshaken and ************* the laurels snatched on round top and cemetery heights might turn to cypress if the wounded lion were assailed in his own position after the repulse of picketts column on the third of july lee had the choice of two ********* either attack again or

exhausted the communications with the potomac were ************* lee determined to retire that is the true history of the matter the force which fell back before meade was an army of veterans with unshaken nerves it required only a glance to see that these men were still dangerous they were ready to fight again and many raged at the retreat like lees old war horse they were anxious to try another struggle to have the enemy return the compliment and come over to charge them then commenced that singular retreat the trains retired in a long line stretching over many miles by the chambersburg road while the army marched by the shorter route between the trains and the enemy ready to turn and tear the blue ******** if they attempted to pursue so the famous army of northern ************* in defeat as in *********** its slow way back toward the soil of virginia never was spectacle stranger than that retreat from gettysburg the badly wounded had been sent with the army

this could be seen in the face and form of stuart as he advanced to take command of his column that day on the next morning at daylight he had struck the enemy their outposts of cavalry supported by

young georgian broke the column on the hill stuart explained his design in three words are you ready all ready general and youngs sabre flashed from the scabbard at the same instant the crash of carbines in front indicated gordons charge young darted to the head of his column charge he shouted and leading the column he descended like a thunderbolt on the enemys flank as he did so gordons men rushed with wild cheers into the gorge shouts ************ *********** yells resounded in five minutes the federal infantry some three hundred in number were scattered in headlong flight leaving the

said gordon come and i will show you and riding to an eminence he pointed out across the fields in the gathering gloom long lines of infantry and artillery moving toward manassas stuart gazed at them keenly as he sat looking toward them a staff officer from the front came up rapidly well captain the enemy are in front general infantry yes with artillery stuart looked at gordon a real trap he said coolly knitting his brows have they seen you gordon he asked i think not general well so far all is well there is nothing to do but to lay low and take the chances of getting out stuarts voice was never cooler he looked quietly at the huge column cutting off his retreat a splendid chance to attack them he all at once exclaimed and tearing a leaf out of his ************ he wrote a hasty note to general lee i afterward knew what it contained stuart described his situation and proposed that rodes then near warrenton should attack at ******** he would open with his artillery charge with his horsemen and cut his way out a good man in blue uniform now gordon gordon sent off an aid and the man soon appeared from top to *** he was of irreproachable blue and he listened keenly to his instructions five minutes afterward he had dismounted given his horse to a comrade and was stealing on foot through the thicket toward the federal column a moment afterward he had mingled with their column and disappeared other messengers also in federal uniform were dispatched the whole force of cavalry was massed and concealed in the woods then darkness descended and the long night of anxiety began the situation was not agreeable stuart was caught in a veritable trap on both ******* his rear and his ********* passing heavy corps of federal infantry their numerous artillery and their longdrawn columns of cavalry discovery was destruction the only hope was that the enemy would not suspect our proximity if we were once known to be lurking there goodbye to stuart and his men so the long night commenced the hours passed on and still we were not discovered it seemed miraculous that some noise did not betray stuarts hidingplace but an unseen eye seemed to watch over him and an unseen hand to guard him more than once the neigh of a horse rang out on the air of night and two or three times the discordant bray of a mule attached to the artillery startled the silence of the woods but these sounds were unheeded they evidently attracted no attention from the enemy leaning down in their saddles the men half overcome by sleep but afraid of a rough waking passed sleepless hours looking for the dawn stuart was never cooler on his horse at the head of his men he betrayed no emotion you would not have known except for his subdued tones when speaking to some one that he and his command were in a veritable tight place cool and resolute he was equal to any event certain capture or destruction of his whole force was imminent thus the night glided away we had not been discovered over the trees was seen the yellow streak of dawn i looked round the mens faces were haggard from want of sleep but they evidently felt perfect confidence in stuart he hastened to justify it no sooner had light come than he placed his artillery in position as it grew and broadened the enemy were seen just on a hill in front of us busily cooking their breakfasts suddenly a single cannon sent its long thunder dull and reverberating through the woods from the direction of warrenton stuart rose erect in his saddle and looked in the direction of the sound his eyes glowing another

woman wore an elegant gray riding ********* seemed a favorite with her her cheeks were as white as ever and her lips as red her bearing was perfectly composed and she advanced with the long riding skirt thrown over her arm walking with exquisite grace all this i could easily see the glass door of the conservatory had been left ajar in the hurry of our retreat and from behind the ********** and ************ we could see into the apartment without difficulty there was evidently little danger of our discovery the newcomers had plainly entered the house with no design to search it darke advanced into the apartment made the ladies a bow which more than ever convinced me that he had been familiar with good society and requested food for the lady she had tasted none for many hours and was faint he would not ask it for himself inasmuch as he was an enemy he bowed again as he spoke and was silent the young ladies had listened coldly as he finished they pointed to the waiter and without speaking they left the apartment darke was left alone with the woman in gray she seemed to have regarded ceremony as unnecessary going to the table she had already helped herself and for some moments devoured rather than ate the food before her then she rose and went and took her seat in a rockingchair near the fire darke remained erect gazing at her in silence the lady rocked to and fro pushed back her dark hair with the snowy hand and looking at her companion began to laugh you are not hungry she said no was his reply and to think that a romantic young creature like myself should be it was natural i hoped that you would have given up this fancy of accompanying me you can not stand the fatigue i can stand it easily she said when we have a cherished object weariness does not count a cherished object what is yours sit down and i will tell you i am tired you can rejoin the column in ten minutes so be it said darke gloomily and he sat down near her you wish to be informed of my

against cemetery heights i was there by accident they were repulsed when he rode back he was carrying a bleeding boy in his arms through the smoke i recognized his tall form and gray hair and heard his voice in the midst of the cannon as he cheered on his men the speakers face had flushed his breast rose and fell that was the first time he said the second was the other day when he was riding among the enemys guns near ******** made him out with my glasses darke bent down and gazed at the floor in silence the fire in the dark eyes had deepened his heavy under lip was caught in the large

at the mocking speaker ******** who is general davenant he said is it necessary that i enlighten you madam he is my ********* deaths head the sight of him ******* my life and something ***** at me driving me nearly mad to see that man chills me like the hand of death the woman looked at him and then began to laugh you do ****** your noble strength my lord she said to think so *********** of

there is the curious part of the affair madam returned darke and in a low tone he added the name of the young lady ********* conway the woman half rose from her chair with flashing eyes and said who told you that darke smiled there was something lugubrious in that chilly mirth an emissary on whom i can rely brought me the intelligence he said colonel mohun was wounded in the battle of fleetwood and entering a house where she was nursing the wounded fainted and was caught in her arms from that moment the affair began she nursed him and he was soon healed i had myself inflicted the wound with a pistol ******* the hurt was trifling he got well in a few ******* was ready to meet me again at ************* in those few days the young lady and himself became ******** of each other she is proud they say and had always laughed at ****** too is a ************ doubt from some old affair ******** both the young people suddenly changed their views colonel mohun became devoted the young woman

she too has a love affair with a young officer of the artillery his name is william davenant and the speaker clutched the arm of a chair so violently that the wood cracked in his powerful grasp that

darke stopped uttering a sound between a curse and a groan the woman had listened with a bitter smile as he finished she rose and approached him her eyes burned in the pale face like coals of fire there is a better thing than despair she said what vengeance and grasping his arm almost violently that man is yonder she said pointing with the other hand toward warrenton go and meet him and kill

that in an hour one of us will be dead i care not ********* ******** you must not expose yourself what am i all i have left he said and with a gloomy look he rushed from the house followed by the gray woman in a moment the voice of darke was heard ordering to horse a clatter of sabres followed and the company of cavalry sat out at full gallop toward the firing at their head i saw darkes burly figure the woman escorted by an orderly rode toward the rear in a few minutes the company of cavalry had entered a belt of woods and disappeared we had hastened into the ************ and myself and looked now toward the highway it was dark with a long column of federal cavalry which seemed to be in great agitation the column as well as i could make out numbered at least a division neither the head nor the tail of the blue serpent was *********** the main body with its drawn sabres glittering like silver scales in the sun i hesitated not many seconds something was evidently going on and our present whereabouts dangerous with a hasty salute to the young ladies who had hurried in i made a sign to tom and ran to my horse my companion did not join me for at least five minutes impatience began to master me when he appeared laughing and flourishing a knot of red ribbon which i had observed in miss katys hair with a bound he was in the ******* saw him turn and make a gay salute toward the ladies on the steps and then we set out at full speed across the fields to rejoin stuart he was evidently engaged with the enemy from the front came quick carbine shots and shouts from the woods on the left flank and in rear of the enemy was heard the rapid thunder of cannon suddenly every thing flashed upon me i remembered stuarts significant smile the absence of fitz lee a trap had evidently been laid and general kilpatrick had fallen into it i was not deceived the gallant fitz lee had suggested the ruse he was to move toward auburn while stuart retreated upon warrenton pursued by kilpatrick then fitz lee was to attack the enemy in flank and rear from the direction of ********* cannon would be the signal for stuart to turn general kilpatrick thus assailed in front flank and rear ***** qui pent would probably be the order of the day with him every thing turned out exactly as it had been arranged stuart retired steadily on warrenton when the federal rear approached buckland fitz lee came in on their left flank and then stuart turned like a tiger and bore down on the head of their column that gun we had heard was the signal of fitz lees attack those carbine shots came from stuart as his men charged we had set out at full speed to rejoin stuart as i have said but he saved tom and myself the trouble of riding very far he came to meet us at full gallop with drawn sabre driving the federal troopers in disorder before him the affair that succeeded was one of the most animated of the war the enemy were completely ************* but a part of kilpatricks force made a hard fight sabres clashed carbines cracked fitz lees artillery ********* fields and woods around buckland were full of tumult and conflict in ten minutes we had caught up with stuart he was leading his column in person at the head of the front regiment rode mohun with drawn sabre and pressing his magnificent gray to headlong speed in his eye was the splendid joy of combat his cheeks glowed his laughing lips revealed the white teeth under the black mustache it was difficult to recognize in this gay cavalier the pale bitter and melancholy cynic of the previous june look surry exclaimed mohun we are driving our friend kilpatrick stuart is down on him like a lion you are driving a personal friend of yours besides i said yonder he ********* darke mohuns smile disappeared suddenly he looked at darke whose burly figure was seen at the head of the charging column and that glance was troubled and doubtful i am sorry to meet him he said in a low tone why he would not strike me yonder in pennsylvania when i was in his power but he has sworn to kill you today i exclaimed i have just heard him swear that look out mohun here they are in an instant the two columns had clashed together like thunder what followed was a fierce and confused ************** clashing carbines banging men shouting groaning and falling from their horses which trampled over the dead and wounded alike i was close beside mohun as he closed in with darke the latter had plainly resolved on his enemys destruction and in an instant the two men were cutting furiously at each other with their sabres they were body to ********* faces ******** was rather a wrestle on horseback than a sword fight suddenly mohun delivered a blow which fell upon his opponents sword hand nearly cutting through the fingers darkes arm instinctively fell and he was at his adversarys mercy instead of plunging his sword into darkes breast however as he might have done mohun let its point fall and said take your life now i am even with you sir darke recoiled and a furious flash darted from his eyes then his left hand went to his hilt he drew a pistol and spurring close up to mohun placed the weapon on his enemys breast and fired the bullet passed through mohuns breast but at the same instant darke uttered a fierce cry mohun had driven his swords point through the federal officers ********* blood spouted around the ****** moment afterward the two adversaries had clutched dragged each other from their rearing horses and were tearing each other with hands and teeth on the ground wet with their blood one of mohuns men leaped from horseback and tore them apart a sword give me a sword exclaimed mohun hoarsely and rising to his feet he clutched at an imaginary ********* lips ****** with ******** reeling he fell at full length on the body of his adversary who was bathed in blood and seemed to be dying what is here described all took place in a few minutes in that time the enemys column had been broken and hurled back suddenly the wild southern cheer rang above the woods stuart and fitz lee had united their forces in one solid column they pressed the flying enemy banging and thundering on their rear with carbines and cannon kilpatrick was defeated his column in hopeless rout stuart boasts of having driven me from culpeper he is reported to have said just before the fight and now i am going to drive him but stuart was not driven on the contrary he drove kilpatrick some of the enemys column did not stop it is said before they reached the banks of the potomac such was the dramatic termination of the last great cavalry campaign of stuart the affair came to be known as the buckland races and stuarts old sabreurs still laugh as they recall the comedy the campaign of october 1863 was over lee was behind the rapidan in december general meade struck a blow in turn at his adversary shall we glance in passing at that affair of mine run i saw a spectacle ******** a sad one ******** i am tempted to describe though aware it has little to do with my narrative i have left colonels mohun and darke in a bloody embrace yonder near buckland i ought to relate at length how they were not dead and how they in due time recovered but for the moment i think of a fine sight and a weeping face which i saw in the woods below verdiersville let us ride thither reader it will not take long in december then general meade crossed the lower rapidan and advanced to assail general lee in his works above a fiasco followed meade marched toward verdiersville found his adversary behind earthworks near that place ************* them felt them moved backward and forward before themand then one morning before general lee was aware of the fact quietly disappeared returning to the north bank of the rapidan you see

carpet of dry leaves great circles of flame were seen everywhere in the woods and these dazzling ************* grew larger and larger twined together became entangled twisted about sparkled ********** all the sights i ever saw i think this was the most curious from time to time the flames crawled along and reached the foot of some tall tree festooned with dry vines then the vine would catch the

menacing it was a new torch of war invented by general meade such was the picturesque spectacle which rose a moment ago to my memory now for the sad scene which i witnessed as i rode back with stuart passing a small house a poor woman came out and with eyes full of tears exclaimed addressing stuart oh child stop a minute are they coming back they have took every thing i ******* are not coming back stuart stopped he was riding at the head of his staff preceded by his battleflag not a trace of amusement was seen on his features as he heard himself addressed in that phrase oh child have they treated you so badly he said in his grave kind voice oh yes exclaimed the poor woman weeping bitterly they have took every *** cow and ear of corn i have and every thing from my daughter she is a widow and lives near us these are her children my grandchildren come to get out of the way and she pointed to two or three little girls with frightened faces and eyes wet with tears stuart seemed deeply affected under that stout heart which never shrunk was a wealth of sweetness and kindness well they are not coming back my good woman he said in a voice of deep feeling you need not be ********** are gone now the poor woman clasped her hands oh do you believe that child she said do you believe theyll never come back i hope not at least stuart replied in a low tone she clasped her hands and for the third time addressing him as child sobbed oh if they will only never come back that scene affected me deeply the poor womans tears brought something into my throat which seemed to choke me this time the northern soldiers had been impartial in their marauding they had not only destroyed the property and carried off the slaves of the wealthy proprietors the ******* aristocrats they had taken the bread out of the mouths of the widow and the ***************** them bare and starving in that bleak december of 63 war conducted in that manner is *********** it not reader the cry of that widow and her children must have gone up to heaven stuart returned to his bivouac in the pine wood near verdiersville where he had slept without tents by his campfire all these freezing nights then the army began to move soon it resumed its former position the cavalry was sent to watch the fords of the rapidan and stuart returned to his own headquarters near orange courthouse gayly singing as he had left them to advance and meet the enemy what gay memories are evoked by that familiar name how we laughed and sang in that hollow in the hills near orange in the cold winter of 1863 stuart called his headquarters wigwam independence but the officers of his staff gave them the sobriquet of coon hollow and i adopt in my memoirs the old familiar designation never were soldiers more comfortable than the inhabitants of coon ********* stuarts tent was the most comfortable of all he had stretched a large canvas beneath some sheltering trees and filling up the opening at each end with a picturesque ********** of evergreens ensconced himself there in his sylvan lodge like some robin hood or ****** of the greenwood in old times the woodland haunt and open air life seemed at first to charm the bold cavalier nothing seemed wanting to his happiness lost here in the forest but soon the freezing airs demoralized even the stout cavalryman and he exchanged his canvas for a regular tent of the largest description with a plank floor a ********* and a mighty chimney wherein sparkled ere long a cheerful fire of hickory driving away the blasts of the cold winter nights which

such was good old coon hollow i recall it with delight the chill airs cut you to the bone when you ventured out on horseback from the sheltered nook but in coon hollow all was warm and bright in the

must be crushed the ************ must strike until lees keen rapier was shattered hammer and rapier were matched against each ******** combat was ************ hammer must beat down the rapier or fall from the grasp of him who wielded it such was the programme of general grant it was not war exactly in the old acceptation of the term it was not taught by ****** or practised by napoleon you would have said indeed at the first glance that it rejected the idea of generalship in **** let us give general grant his just dues however he was not a great commander but he was a man of clear brain he saw that brute force could alone shatter the army of northern virginia that to wear it away by attrition exhaust its blood drop by drop was the only thing ******* he had the courage to adopt that programme to come back to events on the rapidan in the month of may 1864 lee is ready for the great collision now seen to be inevitable his right under ewell occupies the works on the southern bank of the rapidan above chancellorsville his centre under ap hill lies near orange courthouse his left under longstreet is in reserve near gordonsville the army of northern virginia is thus posted in echelon of corps extending from gordonsville by orange toward the fords of the rapidan when the enemy cross on their great advance ewell is ready to face east hill will close in on his right and longstreet in the same manner on hills right then the army will be in line ready to strike at grants flank as he moves through the wilderness for lee is going to strike at him the fifty thousand are going to order the one hundred and forty thousand to halt stuarts cavalry is watching it extends from madison courthouse along robertson river on the left of the army and on the right from ewells camps past chancellorsville to fredericksburg such was the situation on the first of may the two tigers were watching each ******** one was about to spring to descend now from the heights of ************** to the plains of incident and personal observation for this volume is not a history of the war in virginia but the memoirs of a staff officer belonging to stuarts cavalry may 1864 had come we were soon to be in the saddle the thundering hammer of general grant was about to commence its performances one ******* was the night of the first of **** was sitting in general stuarts tent looking into his blazing log fire and musing in this luxury i was not interrupted it was nearly midnight and the rest of the staff had retired stuart was writing at his desk by the light of a candle in a captured camp candlestick and from time to time without turning his head ejaculated some brief words upon any subject which came into his head after writing ten minutes he now said briefly surry general was my as brief response i think mohun was a friend of yours yes general we became intimate on the march to gettysburg well i have just received his commission you mean as brigadiergeneral you know i long ago applied for it i knew ******** he has not been exchanged a great ******* you miss a pleasure i promised myself i would give you what pleasure general to take mohun his commission with your own hands i am truly sorry i can not you know he was terribly wounded and we had to leave him in warrenton then the enemy advanced for a long time we thought him dead thus i am sorry i am debarred the pleasure you offer some day i hope to accept your offer accept it now colonel said a benignant voice at the door i turned suddenly as did the general at the opening of the tent a head was ******* head passed ********** followed by a ******* mr nighthawk private and confidential emissary glided in with the stealthy step of a wildcat he was unchanged his small eyes were as piercing his smile as benignant his ************ coat white cravat and ********* ***** clerical as before good evening gentlemen said mr nighthawk smiling sweetly i bring news of colonel mohun and fly in like an owl or your namesake laughed stuart an owl i am told that is the bird of wisdom gentlemen you hit the nail on the head when you said gentlemen replied stuart laughing but how about mohun is he exchanged nighthawk and stuart wheeled round and pointed to a chair nighthawk sat down modestly not exchanged exactly general but safe he said he escaped exactly general and you helped him i believe so good you really are a trump ************ you seem to have a peculiar fancy for mohun he is the best friend i have in the world general well that accounts for it but how did he escape i will tell you in a few words general i rather pride myself on the manner in which i conducted the little affair you remember colonel mohun was very badly wounded when you defeated kilpatrick at buckland it was in a fight with colonel darke of the federal cavalry who was also wounded and left dying as was erroneously supposed at a small house on the roadside when you fell back colonel mohun was left at warrenton his wound being so severe that he could not be brought farther in his ambulance and here he staid until he was convalescent his recovery was miraculous as a bullet had passed through his breast but he is a gentleman of vigorous constitution and he rallied at last but unfortunately to find himself a prisoner general meade had reoccupied the country and colonel mohun was transferred from hospital to fort delaware as a prisoner of war i have informed you general continued mr nighthawk smiling and turning the rim of his black hat between his fingers that colonel mohun was one of my best friends for that reason i went to see him at warrenton and had arranged a very good plan for his escape when unfortunately he was all at once sent away thereby disappointing all my schemes i followed however saw that he was taken to fort delaware and proceeded thither at once you have probably not visited this place general or you colonel it is a fort and outside is a pen or stockade as it is called covering two or three acres inside are cabins for the prisoners in the shape of a semicircle and grounds to walk in except in the space marked off by the dead line if any prisoner crosses that he is shot by the sentries whose beat is on a platform running round upon the top of the stockade well i went to the place and found that colonel mohun was confined with other officers in the pen where they had the usual federal ****** of watery soup bad meat and musty crackers for a gentleman like himself accustomed before the war to every luxury that unbounded wealth could supply this was naturally disagreeable and i determined to omit no exertion to effect his escape unfortunately the rules of fort delaware are very strict however to cross the dead line is death to attempt to ****** is confinement in irons and other degrading *********** and to bribe the sentinels invariably resulted in having the whole affair revealed after they had received the money it really seemed as if colonel mohun were doomed to the living death of a filthy prison until the end of the war since exchanges had ceased and it was only by devising a ruse of very great risk that i accomplished the end in view what was your plan nighthawk said stuart rising and moving to the fireplace where he stood basking in the warmth original i lay my life ******** exactly that general and nighthawk smiled sweetly i have always observed general said mr nighthawk raising his eyes in pious ********** as it were that there is no better rule for a mans conduct in life than to make friends with the mammon of ********************* in power a profound maxim laughed stuart friends are ********** was your principle yes general and i made one of the quartermaster of the ***** certain major ********* was exceedingly fond of the root of all evil i made that gentlemans acquaintance applied for the place of sutler in the pen and this place i acquired by agreeing to pay a heavy bonus in thirty days this was saturday night on monday morning i presented myself before the gate and demanded admittance as the newly appointed sutler of the pen i was admitted and taken before the officer of the day in his quarters who are you he asked gruffly the new sutler lieutenant where are your papers i had them ready and presented them to him he read them carefully looked at me ************** and said that is wholly informal i looked at him he had a red nose i have some excellent french brandy captain i said promoting him at sight of the portly flask which i drew half from my pocket and exhibited to him i saw his face relax you are a keen fellow and know the world i perceive he said and taking the flask he poured out nearly a glass full of the brandy and drank it do you intend to keep that article of brandy he said for my friends captain i replied with a wink which he evidently understood let me see your papers again i unfolded them and he glanced at them all ********* are in regular form there is the key of the sutlers shop on that nail take possession and my friend the captain emptied a second glass of the brandy and made me a sign that i could go i bowed profoundly took the key and went and opened the sutlers shop after which i strolled out to look at the prisoners in the area the sentinel had seen me visit the officer of the day and go to the sutlers shop thus he did not interfere with me when i went into the area as i was obviously a good union man and an ******** of the post such was the manner in which i secured a private interview with colonel mohun we could talk without the presence of a corporal and we soon arranged the plan for his escape i had determined to procure a federal uniform to be smuggled in to him and an hour afterward i left him promising to see him again as soon as i could visit wilmington and return with the intended disguise a strange piece of good fortune aided me or rather accomplished my purpose at once i had scarcely returned to the sutlers shop and spread some blankets to sleep upon when the officer of the day came in and i saw at a glance that he was half intoxicated in consequence of the large amount of brandy which he had swallowed in a thick and husky voice he cursed the stuff ****** at the post extolled the article i carried and demanded another pull at the flask i looked at ****** that a little more would make him ************ all at once resolved on my plan this was continued mr nighthawk with modest simplicity and smiling as he spoke to make my friend the officer of the day ********* and then borrow his uniform and i succeeded in half an hour he was maudlin in threequarters of an hour drunk five minutes afterward he fell out of his chair and began to ***** where he lay i secured the door tightly stripped off his uniform then my own clothing put on his and then replaced my own citizens dress over all concealed his cap and boots beneath my overcoat wrapped the prostrate lieutenant in my blankets for fear he would take cold and going out locked the door and proceeded to the quarters of the prisoners again the sentinel took no notice of me i found colonel mohun in his **** ten minutes afterward he had replaced his gray uniform with that of the federal lieutenant and watching the moment when the back of the sentinel was turned we walked together toward the gate of the pen that was the moment of real danger outside the narrow gate another sentinel was posted and the man might be personally acquainted with the officer of the day or have noticed his appearance luckily the guard had been relieved about an hour ********* new sentinel had not seen the officer of the dayand when colonel mohun put his head through the little window beside the gate ordering open the gate flew open the sentinel presented arms as he passed and i followed *********** door ********* behind us thus the colonel was out of the pen continued nighthawk smiling the rest was not very dangerous unless the alarm were given they might miss the ******** ********* might have been seen to go into the sutlers ******* i admonished colonel mohun in a low tone to proceed as rapidly as possible in a direction which i pointed out the path indicated led to a spot on the island where i had concealed a small boat among some ********** once across on the mainland i hoped that the danger would be over in spite of my *********** colonel mohun took his time he is a cool one he even turned and walked toward the fort which he carefully **************** the guns observing the ditches and the ground around it that place could be taken nighthawk he said with a laugh and he continued to stroll around the place receiving at every moment respectful salutes from passing soldiers which he returned with the utmost coolness and an air of authority which i never have seen surpassed i declare to you general that it made the sweat burst out on my forehead and it was fully an hour before we reached the boat i sprung in and seized the oars for i saw a dozen soldiers approaching us from the direction of the fort for heavens sake sit down colonel i exclaimed in five minutes we will be lost he did not reply he was feeling in the pockets of the lieutenants coat and drew out a notebook with a pencil attached then as the men came toward us he began to write i looked over his ********* bad habit i acknowledge ********** i read these words colonel mohun csa presents his compliments to the commanding officer of fort delaware and recommends the ##**** ********* in place of the ##** parrotts on the bastion near the southern angle of the work as colonel m is en route for richmond via wilmington and the train will soon pass he is compelled to refrain from other suggestions which occur to him the commandant of the post will pardon the want of ceremony of his departure this distressing separation is dictated by necessity nighthawk smiled as he repeated the words of mohuns note did you ever hear of a cooler hand general but i must end my long story the colonel wrote this note while the soldiers were coming toward us when they had come within ten steps he beckoned to one of ******* man came up *********** the colonel said take this note to the ************ at once my heart had jumped to my throat general the next moment i drew a good long breath of real relief the federal soldier touched his cap took the note and went back toward the fort without further delay i pushed out and rowed across to the mainland where we soon arrived then we left the boat struck into the fields and pushed for the nearest station on the railroad on the way i could not refrain from ********** the colonel with his imprudence he only laughed however and we went on without stopping an hour afterward we reached the station and the northern train soon came we got in the cars started and we were en route for baltimore suddenly the dull sound of a cannonshot came from the direction of fort delaware a moment afterward came another and then a third a prisoner has escaped from fort delaware said one of the passengers near us raising his eyes from a newspaper colonel mohun laughed and said carelessly without sinking his voice in the least ten to one they have found your friend the lieutenant nighthawk such a man general it was enough to make your blood run cold i thought i was cool but i assure you i never imagined a man could equal that we reached baltimore made the connection with the train going west to wheeling and *********** at martinsburg there the colonel procured a ********* to a friends on the ************** his blue dress for a citizens suit and proceeded to staunton thence to richmond and yesterday rejoined his regiment near chancellorsville stuart kicked a log which had fallen on the hearth back into the fire and said well nighthawk your narrative only proves one thing what general that the writer who hereafter relates the true stories of this war will be set down as a baron ********** no doubt of that general this escape of colonel mohun for instance will be *********** no matter it took place but i have not told you what brought me over general over yes across the rapidan i did not go from martinsburg to richmond with colonel mohun i thought i would come down and see what was going on in culpeper accordingly i crossed the blue ridge at ashbys gap reached *********** last night crossed the rapidan opposite chancellorsville where i saw colonel mohun before whom i was carried as a spy you bring news then said stuart with sudden earnestness and attention important news general the federal army is about to move to cross yes ************* force one hundred and forty thousand of all arms i answer the last question first and the army will advance in two columns the ******* sedgwicks and warrens ********* cross at germanna ford the left consisting of hancocks corps at elys ford below they have pontoon and bridge ********* the movement will commence at midnight on the ******** days from now stuart knit his brows and buried his hand in his beard suddenly he called out to the orderly have two horses saddled in five minutes and seizing his hat he said get ready to ride to general lees headquarters with me nighthawk the clerical looking emissary put on his respectable black hat you are certain of this intelligence stuart said turning with a piercing glance to him quite certain general said mr nighthawk serenely you were in the camps in all i believe and at army headquarters you overheard your intelligence no i captured it general how a courier was sent in ****** saw the commanderinchief speaking to him i ************ up with him in a hollow of the ******** was compelled to blow his brains out as he would not surrender i then searched his body and found what i wanted there it is general and nighthawk drew forth a paper what is it exclaimed stuart grants confidential order to his corps commanders general directing the movements of his army stuart seized it read it hastily and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction ten minutes afterward he was going at full speed accompanied by nighthawk toward general lees headquarters soon after daylight on the next morning stuart was up and writing busily at his desk he was perfectly cool as always and his manner when i went in exhibited no sort of flurry but the couriers going and coming with dispatches indicated clearly that something was in the wind i was seated by the fireplace when stuart finished a dispatch and came toward me the next moment he threw himself upon a chair leaned his head upon my shoulder and began to caress one of his dogs who leaped into his lap well surry old fellow we are going to get into the saddle look out for your head excellent advice i replied i recommend you to follow it you think i expose myself do you in the most reckless manner for ************ an instance he laughed i saw stuart was talking to rest himself well at mine run when you rode up to that fence lined with **************** they fired on us at ten paces nearly in fact you might have shot a marble at thembut i am not afraid of any ball aimed at me then you believe in chance general there is no chance surry he said gravely god rules over all things and not a sparrow we are told can fall without his permission how can i or you then you are right general and i have always been convinced of your religious faith i believe in god and our saviour with all my heart said stuart solemnly i may not show it but i feel deeply on the contrary you show **** me at ********* in trifles i said moved by his earnestness do you remember the other day when an officer uttered a sneer at the expense of a friend of his who had turned preacher you replied that the calling of a minister was the noblest in which any human being could ********* i regretted at that moment that the people who laugh at you and charge you with vicious things could not hear you stuart shook his head smiling with a sadness on his lips which i had never seen before they would not believe me my dear surry not one would give me credit for a good sentiment or a pure principle am i not a drunkard because my face is burned red by the sun and the wind and yet i never touched spirit in all my life i do not know the taste of it am i not given to women and yet god knows i am ************ i recoil in disgust from the very thought am i not frivolous **************** at all things *********** nothing and yet my laughter is only from high health and animal spirits i am young and robust it is natural to me to laugh as it is to be pleased with bright faces and happy voices with colors and music and approbation i am not as religious as i ought to be and wish with all my heart i had the deep and devout piety of that good man and great military genius stonewall jackson i can lay no claim to it you see surry i am only a rough soldier at my hard work i am terribly busy and my command takes every energy i possess but i find time to read my bible and to pray i pray for pardon and forgiveness and try to do my duty and leave the rest to god if god calls meand he may call me very ***** hope i will be ready and be able to say thy will be done i expect to be killed in this ********* knows i would have my right hand chopped off at the wrist to stop itbut i do not shrink from the ordeal before me and i am ready to lay down my life for my country stuart paused and leaned his arm upon the rude shelf above the fireplace passing his hand over his forehead as was habitual with him a hard campaign is coming surry he said at length more cheerfully i intend to do my duty in it and deserve the good opinion of the world if i do not secure it i have ******** my life many times and shall not shrink from it in future i am a virginian and i intend to live or die for old virginia the tug is coming the enemy are about to come over and try again but we will meet them and fight them like men surry our army is small but with strong hands and brave hearts much can be done we must be up and doing and do our duty to the handle for myself i am going to fight whatever is before **** win victory with gods blessing or die trying once more surry remember that we are fighting for our old mother and that virginia expects every man to do his duty his face glowed as he spoke in his dazzling blue eyes burned the fire of an unconquerable resolution a courage that nothing seemed able to crush years have passed since then a thousand scenes have swept before me but still i see the stalwart cavalier with his proud forehead raised and hear his sonorous voice exclaim virginia expects every man to do his duty this conversation took place at an early hour of the morning two hours afterward i was in the saddle and riding toward chancellorsville with the double object of inspecting the pickets and taking mohun his commission i have described in my former memoirs that melancholy country of the wilderness its unending thickets its roads narrow and deserted which seem to wind on forever the desolate fields here and there covered with stunted bushes the owls flapping their dusky wings the whippoorwill crying in the jungle and the ******** gliding stealthily amid the ooze covered with its green scum strange and sombre country lugubrious shades where death lurked already two great armies had clutched there in may 1863 now in may 64 the tangled thicket was again to thunder men were going to grapple here in a mad wrestle even more desperate than the former two roads stretch from orange courthouse to ******************* old turnpike and the plank *********** through verdiersville i took the latter followed the interminable wooden pathway through the thicket and toward evening came to the point where the elys ford road comes in near chancellorsville here surrounded by the rotting weapons bones and ****** of the great battle already fought i found mohun ready for the battle that was coming he commanded the regiment on picket opposite elys ford and was pointed out to me at three hundred yards from an old torn down house which still remains there i fancy mohun had dismounted and leaning against the trunk of a tree was smoking a cigar he was much thinner and paler than when i had last seen him but his eye was brilliant and piercing his carriage erect and proud in his fine new uniform replacing that left at fort delaware and his brown hat decorated with a black feather he was the model of a cavalier ready at a moments warning to meet the enemy we exchanged a close grasp of the hand something in this man had attracted me and from acquaintances we had become friends though mohun had never given me his confidence i informed him of nighthawks visit and narrative congratulated him on his escape and then presented him with his appointment to the grade of brigadiergeneral hurrah for stuart he is a man to count on exclaimed mohun and here inclosed is the order for me to take command of four regiments i congratulate you mohun i hope to do good work with them my dear ******** i think they are just in time with which words mohun put the paper in his pocket you know the latest intelligence he said yes but do not let us talk of it tell me something about *********** first listen to a little narrative from me and i described the visit which i had made with tom herbert to the house near buckland the scene between darke and his companion and to keep back nothing repeated the substance of their conversation mohun knit his brows then burst into a laugh well he said so those two amiable characters are still bent on making ********* of me are they did you ever hear any thing like it they are perfect tigers thirsting for blood nothing more nor less i said the whole thing is like a romance is it not a perfect ********* the very word and i have not a trace of a key mohun looked at me for some moments in silence he was evidently hesitating and letting his eyes fall played with the hilt of his sword then he suddenly looked up i have a confidence to make you surry he said and would like to make it this very day but i cannot you have no doubt divined that colonel darke is my bitter ********* his companion is no less even more ********* some day i will tell you what all that means my life has been a strange one as was said of randolph of ******** the ******** of romance cannot surpass it these two persons alluded to iti understand more than you possibly ****** i do not understand the allusions made to general davenant i am not the suitor of his ********** of any one i am not in ***** do not intend to **** be frank with you friend i have little confidence in ******** you no doubt comprehend that this strange one whom you have thrice met on the rappahannock in pennsylvania and near buckland is the cause she seems to be a perfect viper is she not you would say so more than ever if i told you what took place at warrenton and again mohuns brows were knit together then his bitter expression changed to laughter what took place at warrenton i said looking at him intently exactly my dear ******** was a real comedy only a ******** played a prominent part in the affair and you know ********* belong exclusively to tragedy mohun uttered these words with his old reckless satire a sort of grim and biting humor was plain in his accents a ******** *********** me about it mohun i said he hesitated a moment well i will do so he said at length it will amuse you my guest while dinner is getting ready i am listening well to go back you remember my fight with colonel darke near buckland certainly and i was sure that you had killed each other you were mistaken he is not dead and you see i am not he was wounded in the throat but my sabre missed the ****** and he was taken to a house near at hand and thence to hospital where he recovered my own wound was a bullet through the chest and this gave me so much agony that i could not be carried in my ambulance farther than warrenton where i was left with some friends who took good care of me meanwhile general meade had again advanced and occupied the ****** was discovered and removed as soon as possible to the federal hospital where they could have me under guard faith they are smart ********* friends the yankees they are convinced that every little helps and they had no idea of allowing that tremendous southern ******* colonel mohun to escape so i was sent to hospital the removal caused a return of ****** was within an inch of the ******** this brings me to the circumstance that i wish to relate for your amusement for some days after my removal to the federal hospital i was delirious but am now convinced that much which i then took for the wanderings of a fevered brain was real i used to lie awake a great deal and one gloomy night i saw or dreamed i saw as i then supposed that woman enter my ward in company with the surgeon she bent over me glared upon me with those dark eyes which you no doubt remember and then drawing back said to the surgeon will he live impossible to say madam was the reply the ball passed through his breast and although these wounds are almost always mortal men do now and then recover from them will this one i cannot tell you madam his constitution seems powerful i saw her turn as he spoke and fix those glaring eyes on me again they were enough to burn a hole in you surry and made me feel for some weapon but there was ******* the scene here ************** retired the next night however it was renewed this time the surgeon felt my pulse touched my forehead placed his ear to my breast to listen to the action of the heart and rising up said in reply to madams earnest glance of inquiry yes i am sure he will live you can give yourself no further anxiety about your cousin madam her cousin that was not bad you see she had gained access as i ascertained from some words of their conversation by representing herself as my cousin i was a member of her family who had gone astray and embraced the cause of the rebellion but was still dear to her womanly heart clinging affection not even the sin of the prodigal cousin could sever the tender chord of her love i had wandered from the right ******* on husks with the confederate swine but i was ********** come back should the ****** calf remain *********** and the loving welcome be withheld you can give yourself no further uneasiness about your cousin madam such was the assurance of the surgeon and he turned away to other patients of whom there were however very few in the hospital and none near me as he turned his back madam looked at me her face was really diabolical and i thought at the moment that she was a ************* i dreamed her closing my eyes to shut out the vision i kept them thus shut for some moments when i reopened them she was gone well the surgeons predictions did not seem likely to be verified my fever returned throughout the succeeding day i turned and tossed on my couch as night came i had some hideous dreams a storm was raging without and the rain falling in torrents the building trembled the windows ********* was a night of nights for some devils work and i remember laughing in my fever and muttering now is the time for delirium bad dreams and ugly shapes to flock around me i fell into a doze at last and had as i thought a decidedly bad ******** i felt certain that i was dreaming and that what i witnessed was the sport of my fancy what i saw or seemed to see was this the door opened ******* head was thrust in and remained motionless for an instant then the head moved a body followed madam the lady of the dark eyes glided stealthily toward my cot it was enough to make one shudder surry to have seen the stealthy movement of that phantom i gazed at it through my halfclosed ********** the midnight eyes burning in the white face half covered by a shawl thrown over the headand under that covering the right hand of the phantom grasped something which i could not make out in three quick steps it was beside me i say it for the figure resembled that of a ghost or some horrible thing from the eyes two flames seemed to dart the lips opened and i heard in a low mutter ah he is going to recover then as the words left the phantoms lips it reached my cot at a bound something gleamed aloft and i started back only in time to avoid the sharp point of a poniard which grazed my head and nearly buried itself in the pillow on which i lay well i started up and endeavored to seize my assailant but she suddenly broke away from me still clutching her weapon her clothing was torn from her ********* recoiled toward the ******* i leaped from my couch to rush after and arrest her i had not the strength to do so however i had scarcely taken three steps when i began to stagger ********* i exclaimed extending my arms to arrest her flight it was useless a few feet further i ******** head seemed turning ******** again shouting ********* i fell at full length on the floor at the moment when the woman disappeared that was curious was it not it would have been a tragical ******* was more tragical in being no dream at all but a reality what had taken place was simple and easy to understand that woman had come thither on this stormy night to murder me and she had very nearly succeeded had she found me asleep i should never have waked fortunately i was awake some noise frightened her and she disappeared a moment afterward one of the nurses came and finally the surgeon when i told him what had taken place he laughed well colonel go back to bed he said such dreams retard your recovery more than every thing else i obeyed without taking the trouble to contradict him my breast was bleeding again and i did not get over the excitement for some days the phantom did not return i slowly recovered and was taken in due time to fort *********** rest you know i forgot to tell you one thing the surgeon almost persuaded me that i had been the victim of nightmare unfortunately however for the theory of the worthy i found a deep hole in my pillow where the poniard had entered so you see it was madam and not her ghost who had done me the honor of a visit surry an hour afterward i had dined with mohun at his headquarters in the woods mounted our horses and were making our way toward the rapidan to inspect the pickets this consumed two hours we found nothing stirring as sunset approached we retraced our steps toward chancellorsville i had accepted mohuns invitation to spend the night with him as i rode on the country seemed strangely familiar all at once i recognized here a tree there a ******* were passing over the road which i had followed first in april 1861 and again in august 1862 when i came so unexpectedly upon fenwick and heard his singular revelation we had been speaking of mordaunt to whose brigade mohuns regiment belonged and the young officer had grown enthusiastic ********* mordaunt as one of the greatest soldiers of the army under whom it was an honor to serve well i said there is a spot near here which he knows well and where a strange scene passed on a night of may 1863 ah you know the country then said mohun perfectly well what are you looking at that hill yonder shut in by a thicket there is a house there and i spurred on followed by mohun in five minutes we reached the ********** our horses easily cleared it and we rode up the hill toward the *************** mansion i surveyed it intently it was unchanged save that the porch seemed rotting away and the ************** about to ******** on the window to the right hung by a single ***** it was the one through which i had looked in august 1862 there was the same door through which i had burst in upon fenwick and his companion i dismounted threw my bridle over a stunted ***** and approached the house suddenly i stopped at ten paces from me in a little group of cedars a man was kneeling on a grave covered with tangled grass at the rattle of my sabre he rose turned ******* was mordaunt in a moment we had exchanged a pressure of the hand and then turning to the grave that is the last restingplace of poor achmed he said adding in his deep grave voice you know how he loved me surry and how you loved him mordaunt i can understand your presence at his grave my dear friend mordaunt sighed then saluted mohun who approached this spot he said is well known to colonel surry and myself mohun then turning to me he added i found a melancholy spectacle awaiting me here other than ******* grave yes come and i will show you and he led the way into the house as i entered the ******* and miserable mansion the sight which greeted me made me recoil on a wretched bed lay the corpse of a woman and at a glance i recognized the woman ******* who had played so tragic a part in the history of mordaunt the face was ********* attenuated the eyes were open and staring the lower jaw had fallen in the rigid and bony hand was a dry and musty crust of bread she must have starved to death here said mordaunt gazing at the corpse and approaching it he took the crust from the fingers as he did so the teeth seemed grinning at him poor creature he said this crust was probably all that remained to her of the price of her many crimes i pardon her and will have her buried as mordaunt turned away i saw him look at the floor there is ******* blood he said pointing to a stain on the plank and the other is the blood of fenwick who was buried near his victim i remember i murmured and letting my chin fall upon my breast i returned in thought to the strange scene which the spot recalled so vividly there is but one other actor in that drama of whom i know nothing mordaunt you mean violet grafton mordaunt raised his head quickly his eyes glowed with a serene sweetness she is my wife he said the joy and sunlight of my life i no longer read les misrables and sneer at my ******** no longer scowl surry and try to rush against the bullet that is to end me god has rescued a lost life in sending me one of his angels and it was she who made me promise to come hither and pray on the grave of our dear achmed mordaunt turned toward the door as he spoke and inviting me to ride with him left the mansion as i had agreed to stay with mohun i was obliged to decline five minutes afterward he had mounted and with a salute the tall form disappeared in the forest we set out in turn and were soon at mohuns bivouac i shared mohuns blankets and was waked by the sun shining in my face my companion had disappeared but i had scarcely risen when he was seen approaching at full gallop throwing himself from his horse he grasped my hand his face beaming all right surry he exclaimed i have seen mordaunt my command is all arranged i have four superb regiments and they are already in the saddle i congratulate you my dear general make good use of themand i think you are going to have the opportunity at once you are ******** enemys cavalry are drawn up on the north bank of the river any firing in front they are feeling at all the fords are you going there at once i will go with you and i mounted my horse which stood saddled near by swallowing some ********* of bread and beef as we rode on we soon reached mohuns command it consisted of four regiments drawn up in column ready to ******* at sight of the young sabreur the men raised a shout mohun saluted with drawn sabre and galloped to the front a moment afterward the bugle sounded and the column advanced toward the rapidan within a mile of which it *********** and myself riding forward to reconnoitre at germanna ford directly in our front the pickets were engaged firing at each other across the river on the northern bank were seen long columns of federal cavalry drawn up as though about to cross i rode with mohun to the summit of the lofty hill near the ford and here seated on his horse beneath a tree we found mordaunt it was hard to realize that on the evening before i had seen this stern and martial figure kneeling in prayer upon a ******** heard the brief deep voice grow musical when he spoke of his wife but habit is every thing on the field mordaunt was the soldier and nothing but the soldier you see he said the game is about to open pointing to the federal cavalry you remember this spot and that hill yonder i think yes i replied and your charge there when we captured their artillery in august 62 as he spoke a dull firing which we had heard for some moments from the direction of elys ford grew more rapid five minutes afterward an officer was seen approaching from the side of the firing at full speed when he was within a hundred yards i recognized harry mordaunt he was unchanged his eyes still sparkled his plume floated his lips were smiling he greeted me warmly and then turned to general mordaunt and reported the enemy attempting to cross at elys i will go then will you ride with me surry keep a good look out here mohun i accepted mordaunts invitation and in a moment we were galloping accompanied by harry toward elys glad to see you again colonel exclaimed the young man in his gay voice you remind me of old times and a young lady was speaking of you lately a certain miss fitzhugh i will wager theres no such person colonel ah you are married last spring but i might as well be single thats the worst of this ************ wish they would stop it i dont mind hard tack or fighting or sleeping in the rain what i do mind is never being able to go home i wish old grant would go home and see his wife and let me go and see mine we could then come back and blaze away at each other with some satisfaction harry was chattering all the way and i encouraged him to talk his gay voice was delightful we talked of a thousand things but they interested me more than they would interest the reader and i pass on to matters more important pushing rapidly toward elys we soon arrived and found the enemy making a heavy demonstration there it lasted throughout the day and i remained to witness the result at sunset however the firing stopped and declining mordaunts invitation to share the blankets of his bivouac i set out on my way back to orange night came almost before i was aware of it and found me following the brock road to get on the orange plank road do you know the brock road reader and have you ever ridden over it on a lowering night if so you have experienced a peculiar sensation it is impossible to imagine any thing more lugubrious than these strange thickets in their depths the owl ***** and the whippoorwill cries the stunted trees with their gnarled branches are like fiends reaching out spectral arms to seize the ******** by the hair desolation reigns there and you unconsciously place your hand on your pistol as you ride along to be ready for some mysterious and unseen enemy at least i did so on that night i had now penetrated some distance and had come near the lonely house where so many singular events had occurred i turned my head and glanced over my shoulder when to my surprise i saw a light glimmering through the window what was its origin the house was certainly *********** even by the ******* mordaunt had informed me that a detail had that morning buried the corpse there was but one means of solving the mystery and i leaped the fence riding straight toward the house soon reaching it i dismounted and threw open the door what should greet my eyes but the respectable figure of mr nighthawk seated before a cheerful blaze and calmly smoking his pipe as i entered mr nighthawk rose politely without exhibiting the least mark of astonishment good evening colonel he said smiling i am glad to see you and i never more surprised to see any one than you here nighthawk why so colonel i could not help laughing at his air of mild inquiry did i not leave you at our headquarters that was two days ago colonel and this is your residence perhaps i have no residence colonel but am here temporarily on a little matter of business ah a matter of business i think it might be called so colonel which it would be indiscreet to reveal to me however that is a pity for i am terribly curious my dear nighthawk nighthawk looked at me benignly with a philanthropic smile i have not the least objection to informing you colonel you are a gentleman of discretion and have another claim on my respect what is that you are a friend of colonel mohuns a very warm one then you can command me and i will tell you at once that i am awaiting the advance of general grant ah now i begin to understand i was sure you would at the first word i uttered colonel general grant will cross the rapidan ********* tomorrow evening his whole force will probably be ******* i expect to procure some important information before i return to general stuart to you i am mr nighthawk an humble friend of the cause employed in secret ********** general grant i shall be an honest farmer of union opinions who has suffered from the depredations of his troops and goes to headquarters for redress you see they have already stripped me of every thing continued mr nighthawk waving his arm and smiling not a cow a *** a mule or a mouthful of food has been left me they have destroyed the very furniture of my modest dwelling and i am cast a mere pauper on the cold charities of the world mr nighthawk had ceased smiling and looked grave while it was i who burst into laughter his eyes were raised toward heaven with an expression of meek resignation he spread out both hands with the eloquence of mr ********* and presented the appearance of a virtuous citizen accepting meekly the most trying misfortunes when i had ceased laughing i said i congratulate you on your histrionic abilities nighthawk they deserve to be crowned with success but how did you discover this house i was acquainted with its former owner mrs ******* she was a sister of a friend of mine whom i think you have seen colonel what friend his name is swartz colonel not the federal spy the same colonel whom we saw last in the house between carlisle and gettysburg i saw him the other day returned mr nighthawk smiling sweetly is it possible near culpeper courthouse colonel and to let you into a little secret i expect to see him tonight i looked at the speaker with bewilderment that man will be here if he keeps his appointment colonel you have an appointment yes colonel in this house tonight with what object in heavens name nighthawk hesitated for some moments before replying the fact is colonel he said that i inadvertently mentioned my appointment with swartz without reflecting how singular it must appear to you unless i gave you some explanation but i am quite at my ease with youyou are a friend of colonel ********* i will explain as much of my business as propriety will permit to be brief i am anxious to procure a certain document in swartzs possession a certain document i said looking intently at the speaker exactly colonel which swartz has precisely colonel and which he stole from the papers of colonel darke on the night of mohuns combat with darke in the house near carlisle mr nighthawk looked keenly at me in turn ah you know that he said quickly i saw him steal it through the window while the womans back was turned i am deeply indebted to you colonel said mr nighthawk gravely for informing me of this fact which i assure you is important swartz swore to me that he had the paper and had procured it in that manner but i doubted seriously whether he was not deceiving me he is a very consummate rascal knows the value of that document and my appointment with him tonight is with an eye to its purchase from him do you think he will come i think so he would sell his soul for gold and that woman he seems to be her friend he would sell her for silver after uttering which bon *** mr nighthawk smiled this man puzzled me beyond expression his stealthy movements were strange ******** was singular to meet him in this lonely ******** more singular still was the business which had brought him what was that paper why did nighthawk wish to secure it i gave up the inquiry in despair well i said i will not remain longer i might scare off your friend and to ********* is out of the question even if you were willing that i should be present in fact colonel i shall probably discuss some very private matters with my friend swartz so that you prefer i should go mr nighthawk smiled he was too polite to say yes you are not afraid to meet your friend in this lonely place i said rising not at all colonel you are armed mr nighthawk opened his coat and showed me a brace of revolvers i have these but they are unnecessary colonel unnecessary i have an understanding with swartz and he with me what is that that we shall not employ the ****** weapon only destroy each other by superior generalship you speak in ******* nighthawk and yet my meaning is very simple if i can have swartz arrested and hung or he me it is all fair but we have agreed not to fight so if you caught him tonight you could have him hung as a spy yes colonel but nothing would induce me to betray him ah i have given him my ***** that he shall have safe conduct i laughed bade nighthawk goodbye and left him smiling as i had found him in ten minutes i was again on the brock road riding on through the darkness between the impenetrable thickets my reflections were by no means gay the scenes at the lonely house had not been cheerful and ************** that grinning corpse with the crust of bread in the bony fingers that stain of blood on the floor the grave of achmed lastly the appointment of the mysterious nighthawk with the federal spy all were fantastic and lugubrious who was nighthawk and what was his connection with mohun who was mohun and what had been his previous history who was this youth of unbounded wealth as nighthawk had intimated in whose life personages supposed to be dead but still alive had figured decidedly mohun and nighthawk are two ******* i muttered and i give the affair up with which words i spurred on and soon debouched on the orange plank road leading toward mine run as i entered it i heard hoofstrokes on the resounding boards and a company of horsemen cantered toward me through the darkness as they came i heard a gay voice singing the lines i wake up in the morning i wake up in the morning i wake up in the morning before the break o day there was no mistaking that gay sound it was stuart riding at the head of his staff and couriers in a moment he had come up and promptly halted me ah thats you surry he exclaimed with a laugh wandering about here in the wilderness what news i reported the state of things in front and stuart exclaimed all right we are ready for them coon hollow is ********************* are in the saddle hear that whippoorwill it is a good omen whip em well whip em ******* well do it too stuart laughed and began to sing never mind the weather but get over double trouble we are bound for the happy land of lincoln as the martial voice rang through the shadowy thickets i thought how fortunate it is that the grave people are not here to witness this singular want of dignity in the great commander of lees cavalry those grave people would certainly have rolled their eyes and groaned oh how undignified was not the occasion solemn was it not sinful to laugh and sing no messieurs it was right and much better than rolling the eyes and staying at home and groaning stuart was going to fight ************* he sang gayly heaven had given him animal spirits and he laughed in the face of danger he laughed and sang on this night when he was going to clash against grant as he had laughed and sung when he had clashed against ********** his proud plume floated in front of jacksons veterans and he led them over the breastworks at chancellorsville singing old joe hooker will you come out of the wilderness stuart cantered on we turned into the brock road and i found myself retracing my steps toward the rapidan as i passed near the lonely house i cast a glance toward the glimmering light had nighthawks friend arrived we soon reached elys ford and i conducted stuart to mordaunts bivouac which i had left at dusk he had just wrapped his cloak around him and laid down under a tree ready to mount at a moments warning what news mordaunt said stuart grasping his hand some fighting this evening but it ceased about nightfall general stuart looked toward the river and listened attentively i hear nothing stirring and passing his hand through his beard he muttered half to himself i wonder if grant can have made any change in his programme the order at least was ************ brought by nighthawk i said stuart turned toward me suddenly i wonder where he could be found if i knew i would send him over the river tonight to bring me a reliable report of every thing i drew the general aside i can tell you where to find nighthawk where shall i bring him like lightning surry i wish to dispatch him at once without reply i wheeled my horse and went back rapidly toward the house in the wilderness i soon reached the spot rode to the window and called to nighthawk who came out promptly at my call your friend has not arrived i said he will not come till midnight colonel when i am afraid he will not see you ************ are wanted and i explained my errand nighthawk ******** was easy to see that he was much disappointed well colonel he said in a resigned tone i must give up my private ************ calls i will be ready in a moment and disappearing he put out the *********** forth in rear of the ************ a horse concealed in the ********* rejoined me in front swartz will not know what to think he said as we rode rapidly toward the river he knows i am the soul of punctuality and this failure to keep my appointment will much distress him distress him nighthawk he will think some harm has happened to me and mr nighthawk smiled so sadly that i could not refrain from laughter we soon reached the spot where stuart awaited us at sight of nighthawk he uttered an exclamation of satisfaction and explained in brief words his wishes that will be easy general said nighthawk can you procure a federal uniform i always travel with one general and mr nighthawk ********** the bundle behind his saddle drawing forth a blue coat and trousers which in five minutes had replaced his black clothes before us stood one of the blue birds nighthawk was an unmistakable yankee stuart gave him a few additional instructions and having listened with the air of a man who is engraving the words he hears upon his memory nighthawk disappeared in the darkness toward the private crossing where he intended to pass the river half an hour afterward stuart was riding toward germanna ford as we approached mohun met us and reported all quiet stuart then turned back in the direction of chancellorsville where nighthawk was to report to him before daylight if possible i lingered behind a moment to exchange a few words with mohun something told me that he was intimately connected with the business which had occasioned the appointment between nighthawk and ********* at the first words which i uttered i saw that i was not mistaken mohun raised his head quickly listened with the closest attention and when i had informed him of every thing said abruptly well ill keep nighthawks appointment for him you i said yes my dear ********* is a matter of more importance than you think the business will not take ******* enemy will not be moving before *********** you said i think that the appointment was for midnight yes mohun drew out his watch scratched a match which he drew from a small metal case just eleven he said there is time to arrive before midnight if we ride ******** you show me the way i saw that he was bent on his scheme and said no more in a few moments we were in the saddle and riding at full speed toward the house where the meeting was to take place mohun rode like the wild huntsman and mile after mile disappeared behind ********** away beneath the rapid hoofs of our horses during the whole ride he scarcely opened his lips he seemed to be reflecting deeply and to scarcely realize my presence at last we turned into the brock road and were soon near the lonely house we have arrived i said leaping the brushwood fence and we galloped up the knoll toward the house which was as dark and silent as the grave dismounting and concealing our horses in the bushes we opened the door mohun again had recourse to his ********* and lit the candle left by nighthawk on an old pine table and glanced at his watch midnight exactly he said we have made a good ride of it surry yes and now that i have piloted you safely mohun i will discreetly retire why not remain if you think it will amuse you my dear friend but you are going to discuss your private affairs are you not they are not private from you since i have promised to relate my whole life to you then i remain but do you think our friend will keep his appointment there he is said mohun as hoofstrokes were heard without he is punctual a moment afterward we heard the newcomer dismount then his steps were heard on the small porch all at once his figure appeared in the doorway it was swartz the fat person the small eyes the immense double chin and the chubby fingers covered with ********* rings were unmistakable he was clad in citizens clothes and covered with dust as from a long ride mohun rose come in my dear mr swartz he said coolly you see we await you the spy recoiled it was plain that he was astonished beyond measure at seeing us he threw a glance behind him in the direction of his horse and seemed about to fly mohun quietly drew his revolver and cocked it fear nothing my dear sir he said and above all do not attempt to escape swartz hesitated and cast an uneasy glance upon the weapon does the sight of this little instrument annoy you said mohun laughing it shall not be guilty of that ************ mr swartz and he ******** the weapon and replaced it in its ******* now he continued sit down and let us talk swartz obeyed before mohuns penetrating glance his own sank he took his seat in a ************ chair drew forth a huge red bandanna handkerchief wiped his forehead and said quietly i expected to meet a friend here tonight gentlemen instead of enemies interrupted mohun we are such it is true my dear sir but you are quite safe your friend nighthawk is called away he is even ignorant of our presence here but meeting him would have been different gentlemen i had his safe conduct you shall have it from me may i ask from whom said swartz from general mohun of the confederate army swartz smiled this time then making a grotesque bow he replied i knew you very well *********** is why i am so much at my ease i am pleased to hear that you are promoted when i last saw you you were only a colonel but i was certain that you would soon be promoted or killed there was a queer accent of politeness in the voice of the speaker he did not seem to have uttered these words in order to flatter his listener but to express his real sentiment he was evidently a character good said mohun with his habitual accent of satire these little compliments are charming but i am in haste ********** us come to business my dear sir i came hither to ask you some questions and to these i expect plain replies swartz looked at the speaker intently but without suspicion his glance on the contrary had in it something strangely open and unreserved i will reply to all your questions general he said and reply truthfully i have long expected this interview and will even say that i wished it you look on me as a yankee spy and will have but little confidence in what i say nevertheless i am going to tell you the whole truth about every thing ask your questions general i will answer them mohun was leaning one elbow on the broken table his glance calm and yet fiery seemed bent on penetrating to the most secret recess of the **** heart well he said now that we begin to understand each other let us come to the point at once where were you on the morning of the thirteenth of december 1856 swartz replied without hesitation on the bank of nottoway river in dinwiddie virginia and bound for petersburg the object of your journey to sell dried fruits and winter vegetables then you travelled in a cart or a wagon in a cart general you reached petersburg without meeting with any incident on the way i met with two very curious ones general i see you know something about the affair and are anxious to know every thing i will tell you the whole truth but it will be best to let me do it in my own way do so then said mohun fixing his eyes more intently upon the spy swartz was silent again for more than a minute gazing on the floor then he raised his head passed his red handkerchief over his brow and said to begin at the beginning general at the time you speak of december 1856 i was a small ********** in dinwiddie and made my living by ******* vegetables and *********** to petersburg well one morning in ********* remind me that it was the thirteenth of ********* set out as usual in my cart drawn by an old mule with a good load on board to go by way of monks neck i had not gone two miles however when passing through a lonely piece of woods on the bank of the river i heard a strange cry in the brush it was the most startling you can think of and made my heart stop beating i jumped down from my cart left it standing in the narrow road and went to the spot it was a strange sight i saw on the bank of the river i saw a woman lying drenched with water and halfdead she was richly dressed and of very great ********* i never saw any human face so pale or clothes more torn and ******** the spy paused mohun shaded his eyes from the light with his hands and said coolly go on well *********** was enough to astonish ********** what is more astonishing still i have never to this day discovered the meaning of the womans being therefor it was plain that she was a lady she was halfdead with cold and had cried out in what seemed to be a sort of delirium when i raised her up and wrung the wet out of her clothes she looked at me so strangely that i was frightened i asked her how she had come there but she made no reply where should i take her she made no reply to that either she seemed ******* of her ******* to make a long story short i half led and half carried her to the cart in which i put her making a sort of bed for her of some old bags i set out on my way again without having the least notion what i should do with ****** she seemed a ******* only with a sort of idea that her friends might probably pay me for my trouble some day well i went on for a mile or two farther when a new adventure happened to me that was stranger ******* was like a ********* and you will hardly believe mebut as i was going through a piece of woods following a byroad by which i cut off a mile or more i heard groans near the road and once more stopped my cart then i listened i was scared and began to believe in witchcraft the groans came from the woods on my left and there was no doubt about the ******* having listened for some time i mustered courage to go in the direction of the sound can you think what i found general what said mohun in the same cool voice tell me a man lying in a ****** real grave ************ and ***** man with a hole through his breast and streaming with blood is it possible and mohun uttered a laugh just as i tell you ********* is the simple naked truth when i got to the place he was struggling to get out of the grave and his breast was bleeding terribly i never saw a human being look paler help he cried out in a ********** voice like when he saw meand as he spoke he made such a strong effort to rise that his wound gushed with blood and he fainted he fainted did he and what did you do said mohun i took him up in my arms general as i had taken the woman carried him to my cart when i bound up his breast in the best way i could and laid him by the side of the *********** lady to get a reward from his friends too no doubt well general we must live you know and did i not deserve something for being so ********* for the use of my mule certainly you did is not the laborer worthy of his hire but go on ******* tale is interesting tale general it is the ******* the word of swartz i no longer doubt now if i did before said mohun but tell me the end of your adventure i can do that in a few words general i whipped up my old mule and went on through the woods thinking what i had best do with the man and the woman i had saved i could take them to petersburg and tell my story to the mayor or some good citizen who would see that they were taken care of but as soon as i said mayor to myself i thought he is the chief of police ********** is one of the ******* words in the language general some people shiver and their flesh crawls when you cut a cork or scratch on a window ******** it is strange but i have always felt in that way when i heard or thought of the word police and here i was going to have dealings with the said police i was going to say i found these people on the *********** *********** and the other in a newly dug grave no i thank you we never know what our characters will stand and i was by no means certain that mine would stand that then the ******* wished to have my lady and gentleman under my eye so after thinking over the matter for some miles i determined to leave them with a ***** of mine near monks neck named alibi who would take care of them and say nothing well i did so and went on to petersburg where i sold my ***** when i got back they were in bed and on my next visit they were at the point of death about that time i was taken sick and was laid up for more than three months when i went to see my birds at monks neck they had flown without leaving you their adieux no they were at least polite they left me a roll of bank ********* than i thought they had about them you had searched them of course when they were lying in your cart said mohun swartz smiled i acknowledge it ******** forgot to mention the fact i had found only a small amount in the gentlemans ***************** on the ******* i never could understand where he or she had concealed about their persons such a considerable amount of *********** i suppose in a secret pocket mohun nodded that is often ******** that was the last of them swartz smiled and glanced at mohun what is the use of any concealment my dear mr swartz said the latter you may as well tell the whole story as you have gone this far you are right general and i will finish the war broke out and i sold my ***** patch and invested in a better ************ is running the blockade across the potomac and ********* in goods for the richmond market on one of these trips i met plump in the streets of washington no less a person than the lady whom i had rescued she was richly dressed and far more beautiful but there was no mistaking her i spoke to her she recognized me took me to her house and here i found the gentleman dressed in a fine new uniform he was changed ****** wound had long healed he was stout and strong but i knew him too at a glance well i spent the evening and when i left the house had accepted an offer made me to combine a new business with that of blockade runner that of spy you mean said mohun swartz smiled you speak plainly general we call ourselves secret ********* either word expresses the idea mohun raised his head and looked swartz full in the face his glance had grown if possible more penetrating than before and a grim smile responded to the ******** expression of the spy well my dear mr swartz he said coolly that is a curious history others might doubt its accuracy but i give you my word that i do not i did well to let you proceed in your own way instead of questioning youbut i have not yet done and this time shall return to the method of interrogation at your orders general said swartz whose quick glance showed that he was on his guard and foresaw what was coming mohun leaned toward the spy let us proceed to call names he said the man you rescued from the grave was colonel darke exactly general is that his real name or a false one swartz hesitated then replied a false one his real name mortimer and the lady is his wife general good said mohun you are well informed i see my dear mr swartz and it is a pleasure to converse with a gentleman who knows so much and knows it so accurately you flatter my pride general i do you ********** to the point your story was cut off in the middle after the interview in washington you continued to see colonel darke and his wife i saw them frequently general in the ******* at their home both yes general where did they live near carlisle pennsylvania where you were on a visit just before the battle of gettysburg yes general very good and rising quickly mohun confronted the spy who drew back unconsciously where is the paper that you stole from the woman that night he said swartz was unable to sustain the fiery glance directed toward him by mohun then nighthawk has told you all he exclaimed colonel surry saw you hide the paper swartz looked suddenly toward ***** smiles had all vanished the paper give me the paper exclaimed mohun you shall have gold for it i have left it in culpeper general ******** me the paper swartz started to his feet mohun caught at his ********* spy ************ suddenly a quick firing was heard coming rapidly from the direction of germanna ford the enemy have crossed mohun i cried mohun started and turned his head in the direction of the sound they are advancing i said but look ****** spy mohun wheeled drawing his pistol swartz had profited by the moment when our attention was attracted by the firing to pass through the door gain his horse at a bound and throw himself into the saddle with an ******* that was incredible in one so fat at the same moment mohuns ********** responded but the bullet whistled harmlessly over the **** head in an instant he had disappeared in the woods mohun rushed to his horse i followed and we were soon riding at full speed in the direction of the firing as we advanced however it receded we pushed on and reached the bank of the rapidan just as mohuns men had driven a party of the enemy over it was only a small body who crossing at a private ford and surprising the sleepy picket had raided into the thicket to retire promptly when they were assailed the affair was nothing unfortunately however it had enabled the federal spy to elude us swartz had disappeared like a bird of the night and all pursuit of him in such a wilderness was impossible an hour afterward i had rejoined stuart such were the singular scenes which i witnessed amid the shadows of the spottsylvania wilderness in the first days of may 1864 the narrative has brought the reader now to an hour past midnight on the third of may an hour ********** is to say at midnight ************ federal forces began to move at six in the morning they had massed on the north bank of the rapidan and as the sun rose above the wilderness the blue columns began to cross the river general grant at the head of his army of ###### men had set forth on his great advance toward ************ advance so often tried so often defeated but which now seemed from the very nature of things to be destined to succeed any other hypothesis seemed absurd what could 50000 do against nearly thrice their number what could arrest the immense machine rolling forward to crush the confederacy a glance at grants splendid array was enough to make the stoutest heart sink on this 4th day of may 1864 he was crossing the rapidan with what resembled a countless host heavy masses of blue infantry with glittering ************ parks of rifled artillery with their swarming ************** columns of horsemen armed with sabre and repeating carbines made the earth shake and the woods echo with their heavy and continuous tramp mingled with the roll of wheels in front of them a little army of gaunt and ragged men looked on and waited without resisting their advance what did that waiting mean did they intend to dispute the passage of that multitude toward richmond it seemed incredible but that was exactly the intention of lee it is now known that general grant and his officers *********** themselves greatly on the safe passage of the rapidan and were convinced that lee would hasten to retreat toward the south anna instead of retreating lee advanced and delivered battle the first collision took place on the 5th of may when the federal army was rapidly massing in the wilderness ewell had promptly advanced and about noon was forming line of battle across the old turnpike when he was vigorously attacked by warren and his advance driven back but the real obstacle was behind ewells rear closed **** advanced in his turn assailed warren with fury swept him back into the thicket seized two pieces of his artillery with about 1000 prisoners and for the time completely paralyzed the federal force in his front such was the first blow struck it had failed and general grant turned his attention to ap hill who had hastened up and formed line of battle across the orange plank road on ewells right hancock directed the assault here and we have general lees testimony to the fact that the federal attempts to drive back hill were repeated and desperate all failed hill stubbornly held his ground at night the enemy retired and gave up all further attempts on that day to make any headway grant had expected to find a mere rearguard while lees main body was retreating upon richmond he found two full corps in his front and there was no doubt that a ********* of ************* approaching lee was evidently going to ******** aim was plainly to shut up grant in the wilderness and drive him back beyond the rapidan or destroy him it was twilight and the fighting was over the two tigers had drawn back and crouching down panted ************** and gathering new strength for the fiercer conflict of the next day from the thickets rose the stifled hum of the two hosts only a few shots were heard now and then from the skirmishers and these resembled the last drops of a storm which had spent its fury i had been sent by general stuart with an order to general hampton who commanded the cavalry on hills right hampton was sitting his horse in a field extending at this point between us and the enemy and if it were necessary i would draw his outline it is not necessary however every one is familiar with the figure of this great and faithful soldier in his old gray coat plain arms and equipments on his large and powerful *********** and horse ready for battle in the war i saw many great *************** was one of the noblest having delivered my message to general hampton who received it with his air of grave yet cordial courtesy i turned to shake hands with captain ******* thoroughbred young officer as brave as steel and one of my best *********** an exclamation from the staff attracted my attention and looking round i saw the cause at the opposite extremity of the extensive field a solitary horseman was seen darting out of the woods occupied by the federal infantry and this man was obviously a deserter making his way into our lines at a sign from general hampton captain church went to meet him and as my horse was fresh i accompanied my friend in his ride the deserter came on at full speed to meet us and for a moment his horse skimmed the dusky expanse like a *********** bird then all at once his speed moderated he approached at a ******* and through the gathering gloom i recognised above the blue uniform the sweetly smiling countenance of nighthawk good evening colonel said nighthawk i am glad to see you again and hope you are well so you have turned deserter nighthawk i said laughing heartily precisely colonel i could not get off before will you inform me where i can find general stuart i will take you to him and riding back with captain church and nighthawk i soon found myself again in presence of general hampton a word from me explained the real character of the ************** general hampton asked a number of questions nighthawk replied to them and then the latter begged me to conduct him to general stuart i did so without delay and we soon reached stuarts bivouac where he was talking with his staff by a campfire at sight of the blue figure he scarcely turned then suddenly he recognized nighthawk and burst into laughter well my blue ********* he exclaimed here you are at last what news is grant going to cross the river nighthawk hung his head and sighed audibly i could not help it general why didnt you come before it was impossible general stuart shook his head strike that word out of your dictionary my friend that is good

grants ************ wish to get out of the wilderness he is at old wilderness tavern he was this morning general with meade and sedgwick you were there i was general what did you gather nighthawk little or nothing general true i heard one or two amusing things as i loitered among the couriers near what general grant came out talking with meade sedgwick and warren general meade said they have left a division to fool us here while they concentrate and prepare a position toward the north ******* what i want is to prevent these fellows from getting back to mine run stuart laughed well these

words he took his cigar from his ********** out the ******** replied oh i never manoeuvre so much the better said stuart the general that does not manoeuvre sacrifices his men and i predict that general grant will soon alter his programme stuart had ordered his horse to be saddled and now mounted to go to general lees headquarters by the bye he said did you hear warren or sedgwick say any thing nighthawk nighthawk smiled i heard sedgwick utter a few words general what he said to warren i hear hood is to take stuarts place i am glad of it for stuart is the best cavalry officer ever ****** in north america the morning of the 6th of may was ushered in with thunder the battle of the preceding day had been a sort of ********* the real struggle came by a curious coincidence grant and

destruction of life had become a science and was done by the compass the genius of blood apparently tired of the old commonplace mode of killing had invented the unseen death in the depths of the

surged forward the thicket was full of smoke and quick flashes of flame then the woods took fire and the scene of carnage had a new and ghastly feature added to it dense clouds of smoke rose blinding and choking the combatants the flames crackled soared aloft and were blown in the mens faces and still in the midst of this frightful array of horrors the carnival of destruction went on without

opposed him on the way and at every step harassed the head of the federal column with his dismounted sharpshooters and horse artillery near spottsylvania courthouse it was the stand made by fitz lees cavalry that saved the position changing the aspect of the whole campaign sent by stuart with a message to the brave general fitz i reached him near spottsylvania courthouse at the moment when he had just ordered his cavalry to fall back slowly before the advancing enemy and take a new position in rear two guns which had been firing on the enemy were still in battery on a hill upon these a heavy federal skirmish line was steadily moving and beside the guns breathed and fitzhugh lee sat their horses looking coolly at the advancing line give them a round of canister breathed exclaimed general

pages of history from the moment when grant crossed the rapidan stuart had met the horsemen of sheridan everywhere in bitter conflict and the days and nights had been strewed all over with battles now on the ninth of may when the two great adversaries faced each other on the po a more arduous service still was demanded of the great sabreur sheridan had been dispatched to sever general lees communications and if possible capture richmond the city was known to be well nigh stripped of troops and a determined assault might result in its fall sheridan accordingly cut loose a heavy column took command of it in person and descended like a thunderbolt toward the devoted city no sooner however had he begun to move than stuart followed on his track he had no difficulty in doing so a great

to daring resistance was enormous they would do all that could be done such was the situation of affairs on the 9th of may 1864 stuart set out at full gallop on his iron gray from spottsylvania courthouse about three oclock in the day and reached ********** toward hanover junction just as night fell here we found general fitz lee engaged in a hot skirmish with the enemys rearguard and that night stuart planned an attack upon their camp but abandoned the idea his spirits at this time were excellent but it was easy to see that he realized the immense importance of checking the enemy an officer said in his presence we wont be able to stop sheridan stuart turned at those words his cheeks flushed his eyes flamed and he said no sir id rather die than let him go on on the next morning he moved in the direction of hanover junction riding boot to boot with his friend general fitz lee i had never seen him more joyous some events engrave themselves forever on the memory that ride of may 10th 1864 was one of them have human beings a presentiment ever at the near approach of death does the shadow of the unseen hand ever reveal itself to the eye i know not but i know that no such presentiment came to stuart no shadow of the coming event darkened the path of the great cavalier on the contrary his spirits were buoyant beyond example almost and riding on with general fitz lee he sang in his gallant voice his favorite ditties come out of the wilderness and jine the cavalry as he rode on thus he was the beau ideal of a cavalier his seat in the saddle was firm his blue eyes dazzling his heavy mustache curled with laughter at the least provocation something in this man seemed to spring forward to meet danger peril aroused and strung him all his energies were stimulated by it in that ride through the may forest to attack sheridan and arrest him or die stuarts bearing and expression were superbly joyous and inspiring his black plume floated in the spring breeze like some ************* and he went to battle humming a song resolved to conquer or fall riding beside him i found my eyes incessantly attracted to his proud face and now i see the great cavalier as then clearly with the eyes of memory what a career had been his what a life of battles as we went on through the spring woods amid the joyous songs of birds all the long hard combats of this man passed before me like an immense panorama the ceaseless scouting and fighting in the shenandoah valley the charge and route of the ********* zouaves at manassas the falling back to the peninsula and the

********* murmuring a dirge as you foam through the rocks yonder past his grave let me rapidly pass over the events of the tenth of may gordons little brigade had been ordered to follow on the rear of the enemy while fitz lee moved round by taylorsville to get in front of them stuart rode and met gordon gave the brave north carolinian so soon to fall his last orders and then hastened back to fitz lee who had continued to press the enemy they had struck the central railroad but the gray cavaliers were close on them colonel robert randolph that brave soul doomed like gordon charged them furiously here took nearly a hundred prisoners and drove them across the road at this moment stuart returned and pushed forward toward taylorsville from which point he intended to hasten on and get in their front about four in the afternoon we reached fork church and the command halted to rest stuart stretched himself at full length surrounded by his staff in a field of clover and placing his hat over his face to protect his eyes from the light snatched a short sleep of which he was very greatly in need the column again moved and that night camped near taylorsville awaiting the work of the morrow at daylight on the 11th stuart moved toward ashland here he came up with the enemy attacked them furiously and drove them before him and out of the village killing wounding and capturing a considerable number then he put his column again in motion advanced rapidly by the telegraph road toward yellow tavern a point near richmond where he intended to intercept the ******** moment of decisive struggle to which all the fighting along the roads of hanover had only been the prelude was at hand stuart was riding at the head of his column looking straight forward and with no thought apparently save that of arriving in time he was no longer gay was it the coming event was it the loss of sleep the great interest at stake the terrible struggle before him i know not but he looked anxious feverish almost melancholy my men and horses are tired jaded and hungry but all right he had written to general bragg from ashland and these words will serve in large measure to describe the condition of the great commander himself i was riding beside him when he turned to me and said in a low tone do you remember a conversation which we had at orange surry that night in my tent yes general and what i said every word is engraved i think upon my memory good do not let one thing ever escape you remember that i said what i say again today that virginia expects every man to do his duty i will never forget that general he smiled and rode on for half a mile he was silent then i heard escape from his lips in a low musing voice a refrain which i had never heard him sing before soon with angels ill be marching i know not why but that low sound made me shiver yellow tavern at the mention of that name a sort of tremor ******** me even today when nearly four years have passed in my eyes the locality is cursed a gloomy cloud seems ever hanging over it no birds sing in the trees the very sunshine of the summer days is sad there but i pass to my brief description of the place and the event which made it one of the black names in southern history yellow tavern is an old dismantled hostelry on the brook road about six miles from richmond nothing more dreary than this desolate wayside inn can be imagined its doors stand open its windows are gone the rotting floor ******** beneath the heel and the winds moan through the ******** sashes like invisible spirits hovering near

make it cheerful in my eyes it was and is and ever will be a thing accursed for the military reader however a few words in reference to the topographical features of the locality are necessary yellow tavern is at the forks of the telegraph and mountain roads six miles from richmond the telegraph road runs north and ********* this road stuart marched the mountain road comes into it from the northwest by this road sheridan was coming open the left hand with the palm upward the index finger pointing north the thumb is the mountain road the *********** the telegraph road where the thumb

angle on a hill near ****** right was breathed with his guns the object of this disposition of stuarts force will be seen at a glance lomax commanding the left was across the enemys front wickham commanding the right was on their flank and the artillery was so posted as to sweep at once the front of both stuarts wings the enemys advance would bring them to the first joint of the thumb there they would receive ****** fire in front wickhams in flank and ********* ************ the cross fire on that point over which the enemy must pass would be deadly take a pencil reader and draw the diagram and lines of fire that will show stuarts excellent design stuart had reached yellow tavern and made his dispositions before the arrival of sheridan who was nevertheless rapidly advancing by the mountain road major mcclellan adjutantgeneral had been sent to general bragg with a suggestion that the latter should attack from the direction of the city at the moment when the cavalry assailed the federal flank all was ready it was the morning of may 11th 1864 never was scene more beautiful and inspiring the men were jaded like their horses but no heart shrank from the coming encounter stretching in a thin line from the tavern into the woods on the right of the mountain road the men sat their horses with drawn sabres gleaming in the sun and the red battleflags waved proudly in the fresh may breeze as though saluting stuart who rode in front of them such was the scene at yellow tavern the moment had come at about eight a stifled hum mixed with the tramp of hoofs was heard then a courier came at a gallop from the right to stuart the enemy were in sight and advancing rapidly stuart was sitting his horse near yellow tavern when that intelligence reached him he rose in his saddle took his fieldglasses from their leathern case and looked through them in the direction of the woods across the mountain road suddenly quick firing came on the ******** loud shouts stuart lowered his glasses shut them up replaced them in their case and drew his sabre never had i seen him present an appearance more superb his head was carried proudly erect his black plume floated his blue eyes ********* was the beau ideal of a soldier and as one of his bravest officers afterward said to me looked as if he had resolved on victory or death i had seen him often aroused and strung for action on this morning he seemed on fire and resembled a veritable king of battle suddenly the skirmish line of the enemy appeared in front of the woods and a quick fire was opened on stuarts sharpshooters under colonel pate in the angle of the two roads stuart hastened to take the real ********** he posted two guns on a rising ground in the angle and opened a heavy fire and galled by this fire the enemy suddenly made a determined charge upon the guns stuart rose in his stirrups and gazed coolly at the heavy line advancing upon him and forcing ***** handful back take back the guns he said they were limbered up and went off rapidly at the same moment colonel pate appeared his men obstinately ********** every foot of ground as they fell back toward the telegraph road where a deep cut promised them advantage colonel pate was a tall ********** officer with a ready smile and a cordial bearing he and stuart had bitterly quarrelled and the general had courtmartialed the colonel it is scarcely too much to say that they had been deadly enemies for the first time now since their collision they met but on this day their enmity seemed dead the two men about to die grasped each others hands they are pressing you back colonel exclaimed stuart yes general i have but three skeleton squadrons and you see their force you are right you have done all that any man could can you hold this cut i will try general their glances crossed never was stuarts face kinder if you say you will you will do it hold this position to the last colonel ill hold it until i die general with a pressure of the hand they parted fifteen minutes afterward pate was dead attacked at once in front and on both flanks in the road his little force had been cut to pieces he fell with three of his captains and his handful were scattered stuart witnessed all and his eye grew fiery pate has died the death of a hero he exclaimed order wickham to dismount his brigade and attack on the right he added to lieutenant garnett aiddecamp twenty minutes afterward wickhams men were seen advancing and driving the enemy before them this relieved the left and wickham continued to push on until he struck up against a heavy line behind rail breastworks in the woods he then fell back and each side remained motionless awaiting the movement of the other such was the preface to the real battle of yellow ********* species of demonstration which ******** the furious grapple stuarts melancholy had all vanished he was in splendid spirits he hastened back his artillery to the point from which it had been driven and soon its defiant roar was heard rising above the woods at the same moment a courier galloped up what news a dispatch from gordon general stuart took it and read it with high good humor gordon has had a handsome little affair this morning he said he has whipped them and looking toward the northwest i wish gordon was here he said the guns continued to roar and the enemy had not again advanced it was nearly four oclock night approached but the great blow was coming stuart was sitting his horse near the guns with breathed beside him suddenly the edge of the woods on the mountain road swarmed with blue horsemen as they appeared the long lines of sabres darted from the ********* then they rushed like a hurricane toward the guns the attack was so sudden and overpowering that nothing could stand before it for a short time the men fought desperately crossing sabres and using their pistols but the enemys numbers were too great the left was driven back with triumphant cheers the federal troopers pressed upon them to drive them completely from the field suddenly as the men fell back stuart appeared with drawn sabre among them calling upon them to rally his voice rose above the fire and a wild cheer greeted him the men rallied the enemy were met again sabre to sabre and the field became a scene of the most desperate conflict stuart led every charge i shall never forget the appearance which he presented at that moment with one hand he controlled his restive horse with the other he grasped his sabre in his cheeks burned the hot blood of the soldier breathed he exclaimed general take command of all the mounted men in the road and hold it against whatever may come if this road is lost we are gone breathed darted to the head of the men and shouted follow me his sword flashed lightning and digging the spur into his horse he darted ahead of the column disappearing in the middle of a swarm of enemies a superb sight followed breathed was seen in the midst of the federal cavalry defending himself with pistol and sabre against the blows which were aimed at him on every side he cut one officer out of the saddle killed a lieutenant with a pistol ball was shot slightly in the side and a sabre stroke laid open his head but five minutes afterward he was seen to clear a path with his sabre and reappear streaming with blood the momentary repulse effected nothing the enemy reformed their line and again charged the guns which were pouring a heavy fire upon them as they rushed forward the hoofs of their horses shook the ground a deafening cheer arose from the blue line stuart was looking at them and spurred out in front of the guns his eyes flashed and taking off his brown felt hat he waved it and cheered then he wheeled to take command of a column of ****** men coming to meet the charge they were too late in a moment the enemy were trampling among the guns all but one were captured and that piece was saved only by the terror of the drivers they lashed their horses into a gallop and rushed toward the chickahominy followed by the cannoneers who were cursing them and shouting for gods sake boys lets go back theyve got breathed lets go back to him that terror of the drivers which the cannoneers cursed so bitterly ended all the gun whirling on at wild speed suddenly struck against the head of the column advancing to meet the enemy a ********* hurled against it could not have more effectually broken it before it could reform the enemy had struck it forced it back and then the whole federal force of cavalry was hurled upon stuart his right where fitz lee commanded in person was giving back his left was broken and driven the day was evidently lost and stuart with a sort of desperation rushed into the midst of the enemy calling upon his men to rally and firing his pistol in the faces of the federal cavalrymen suddenly one of them darted past him toward the rear and as he did so placed his pistol nearly on stuarts body and fired as the man disappeared in the smoke stuarts hand went quickly to his side he reeled in the saddle and would have fallen had not captain ****** of the first virginia cavalry caught him in his arms the bullet had passed through his side into the stomach and wounded him mortally in its passage it just grazed a small bible in his pocket the bible was the gift of his ********* the almighty had decreed that it should not turn the fatal bullet stuarts immense vitality sustained him for a moment pale and tottering in the saddle he still surveyed the field and called on the men to rally go back he exclaimed and do your duty as i have done mine and our country will be safe a moment afterward he called out again to the men passing him go back go back id rather die than be whipped the old lightning flashed from his eyes as he spoke then a mist passed over them his head sank upon his breast and still supported in the saddle he was led through the woods toward the chickahominy suddenly fitzhugh lee who had been stubbornly fighting on the right galloped up and accosted stuart his face was flushed his eyes moist you are wounded he exclaimed badly stuart replied but look out fitz yonder they come a glance showed all in the midst of a wild uproar of clashing sabres quick shots and resounding cries the federal cavalry were rushing forward to overwhelm the disordered lines stuarts eye flashed for the last time turning to general fitzhugh lee he exclaimed in a full sonorous voice go ahead fitz old fellow i know you will do what is right this was the last order he ever gave upon the field as he spoke his head sank his eyes closed and he was borne toward the rear there was scarcely time to save him from capture his wound seemed to have been the signal for his lines to break they had now given way ************* enemy were pressing them with loud shouts fighting with stubborn desperation they fell back toward the chickahominy which they crossed hotly pressed by the victorious enemy stuart had been placed in an ambulance and borne across the stream where dr randolph and dr fontaine made a brief examination of his wound it was plainly ********* he was hastily driven by way of

at present we will simply make the acquaintance of one of the most distinguished statesmen of the epoch my friendly relations with the judge came about in a very simple manner he was an intimate associate of the gentleman at whose house i was staying had taken great interest in my recovery after yellow tavern and therefore had done me the honor to bestow his friendship upon me on the day to which we have now come judge conway had made a speech of surpassing eloquence in congress on the condition of the country and i had listened thrilling at the brave voice which rang out its sonorous alls well amid the storm i was now going to call on the statesman to express my admiration of his eloquent appeal and converse upon the exciting topics of the hour i found him in a mansion not far from the splendid residence of mr blocque here he occupied apartments or rather a single ******* in 1864 my dear reader that was a very common mode of living like others judge conway was too poor to occupy a whole ********* too poor to board he had a single apartment containing a few chairs and a bed was waited on by a maid and i think prepared his own meals which were plain to poverty he met me at the door of his bare and *********** apartment extending his hand with the gracious and stately courtesy of the ancient rgime his figure was small slight and bent by age his face thin and pale his

could not refrain from a sentiment of profound bitterness two days before i had dined at the table of a ******** blockaderunner who ate ************ drank champagne wore fine linen and dodging the conscript officers revelled in luxury and plenty and now here before me was a gentleman of ancient lineage whose ancestors had been famous who had himself played a great part in the history of the

the splendid table of the ******** blockaderunner i had come to the povertystricken apartment of this great statesman and highbred gentleman oh ******* i muttered it is your ******* not the ******** of virgil that suit this epoch the old statesman pointed with all the grace of a nobleman to a bare rockingchair and received my congratulations upon his speech with modest simplicity i am glad that my views are honored by your good opinion colonel he said and that you approve of the tone of them i am naturally given to ********** habit derived from my friend the late mr randolph but the country wants encouragement and yet not to ******** is so hard my dear sir very hard think of the army *********** soldiers *********** finances in ruin and entire destruction threatening us the old statesman

dear colonel he added smiling you are yet unmarried though i rejoice to hear you are soon to be united to a daughter of my old friend colonel beverly of the oaks some day i hope you will know the great charm of ********* this morning i was ********** evening i am no longer so georgia and virginia have come up from my house five forks escorted by my faithful old juba and they burst in upon me like the sunshine the words had scarcely been uttered when a tap came at the door a voice said may we come in papa and a moment afterward the door opened and admitted miss georgia conway and her sister virginia miss georgia was the same tall and superb beauty with the dark hair and eyes miss virginia the same winning little blonde with the blue eyes and the smiles which made her lips resemble ******** the young ladies were clad in poor ************ calicoes and the slippers on the small feet peeping from their skirts were full of holes such was the appearance presented in that summer of 1864 my dear reader by two of the most elegant and aristocratic young ladies of virginia but you did not look at the calicoes and soon forgot the holes in the shoes my bow was such as i should have bestowed on two ********** and the young ladies received it with a grace and courtesy which were charming in ten minutes we were all talking like old friends and the young ladies were making tea this was soon ready some bread without butter was placed upon the little table and the meal was the most cheerful and happy imaginable oh my dear mr blocque i could not help saying to myself keep your champagne and ************ and every luxury and welcome i like dry bread and tea with this company better i have not room to repeat the charming words mingled with laughter of the young women on that evening their presence was truly like sunshine and you could see the reflection of it upon the old ********** countenance only once that countenance was overshadowed i had uttered the name of willie davenant by accident and then all at once remembering the scene at culpeper courthouse had looked quietly at judge conway and miss virginia a deep frown was on his ******** of the young girl was crimson with ******* and two tears came to her eyes as she caught her fathers glance of displeasure i hastened to change the ******* banish the dangerous subject and in a few moments everybody was smiling once more miss georgia in her stately and amusing way was relating their experiences from a scouting party of the enemy at five forks i heard something of this from old juba said the judge you do not mention your deliverer however our deliverer papa general mohun miss georgia unmistakably blushed in her turn oh i forgot she said carelessly general mohun did drive them off did i not mention iti should have done so before finishing papa as she spoke the young lady happened to catch my eye i was laughing quietly thereupon her head rose in a stately **** decided pout **************** she burst into laughter the puzzled expression of the old judge completed the comedy of the ********** all laughed in a perfectly absurd and foolish ****** the rest of the evening passed in the most cheerful manner imaginable when i bade my friends good evening i knew something i had not known ************ that mohun the ********** had renewed his friendly relations with miss georgia conway at her home in dinwiddie exchanging a pressure of the hand with my host and his charming daughters i bade them good evening and returned homeward as i went along i thought of the happy circle i had left and again i could not refrain from drawing the comparison between judge conway and mr blocque at the fine house of the *********************** rich ****** ********* gold and silver and profuse luxury at the poor lodgings of the great ********** cup of tea and cold bread stately courtesy from my host charming smiles from his beautiful daughters clad in calico with wornout ******** above the simple happy group the crossed swords of the brave youths who had fallen at manassas it was past ten in the evening when i left judge conway but i felt no disposition to retire and determined to pay a visit to a singular character of my acquaintance the name of this gentleman was mr x looking back now to the days spent in richmond in that curious summer of 64 i recall among the representative personages whom i encountered no individual more remarkable than the honorable mr x you are acquainted with him my dear reader either personally or by reputation for he was a prominent official of the confederate government and before the war had been famous in the councils of the nation he resided at this time in a small house on a street near the capitol you gained access to his apartment after ******* you knew the ***** a winding path through shrubbery to the back door of the mansion when you entered you found yourself in presence of a tall powerful grayhaired and very courteous personage who sat in a huge armchair near a table ******** with papers and smoked ************ a cigar the flavor of which indicated its excellent quality i enjoyed the intimacy of mr x in spite of the difference of our ages and positions he had been the friend of my father and in my turn did me the honor to bestow his friendship upon me on this evening i was seized with the fancy to visit himand passing through the grounds of the capitol where the bronze washington and his great companions looked silently out into the moonlight reached the small house followed the path through the shrubbery and opening the door in the rear found myself suddenly enveloped in a cloud of cigar smoke through which loomed the portly figure of mr x he was seated as usual in his large armchair by the table covered with papers and a small bell near his hand seemed placed there for the convenience of summoning an attendant without the trouble of rising near the bell lay a package of ************** documents near the documents lay a pile of telegraphic dispatches in the appearance and surroundings of this man you read power mr x received me with easy cordiality glad to see you my dear colonel he said rising and shaking my hand then sinking back in his chair take a cigar and tell me the news i sat ********** declined the proffered cigar the news i said laughing i ought to ask that of you ah you think i am wellinformed i pointed to the dispatches mr x shrugged his shoulders papers from england and ********** are not going to recognize us and those **************** we get little that is worth attention except a line now and then signed re lee well there is that signature i said pointing to an open paper it is a private letter to mebut do you wish to see a line which i have just received it is interesting i assure you and he handed me a paper it was a telegram announcing the fall of atlanta good heavens i said is it possible then there is nothing to stop sherman nothing whatever said mr x coolly what will be the consequence the confederacy will be cut in two sherman will be at savannah before grant reaches the southside ****** as soon at least you think grant will reach that yes by april and ******* know what but lee will protect it mr x shrugged his shoulders shall i tell you a secret i listened lees force is less than #####**** spring it will not number 40000 grants will be at least four times that why can not our army be reenforced mr x helped himself to a fresh cigar the people are tired and the conscript officers are playing a farce he said the commissary department gives the army a quarter of a pound of rancid meat that even often fails for the quartermasters department does not supply it the result **** conscripts and a thousand desertions the soldiers are starving their wives and children are writing them letters that drive them ****** end is not far off and when grant reaches the southside road we are gone mr x smoked his cigar with extreme calmness as he spoke but one thing remains i said what is that lee will retreat from virginia mr x shook his head he will not why not he will be prevented from doing so under any circumstances until too late at least and the result *************** he said to me the other day when he came to see me here for myself i intend to die sword in hand i could not refrain from a sentiment of profound gloom as i listened to these sombre predictions it seemed incredible that they could be well founded but i had more than once had an opportunity to remark the extraordinary ********** of the remarkable man with whom i conversed you draw a black picture of the future i said and the south seems moving to and fro on the crust of a volcano no ******** could be more just and what will be the result of the war that is easy to reply to political slavery negro suffrage and the bayonet until the new leaven works the new leaven the conviction that democratic government is a failure and then an emperor or ************ him what you will the main fact is that he will rule the country by the ************ and south *********** mr x lit a fresh cigar things are going on straight to that he said the future is perfectly plain to me for i read it in the light of history these events are going to follow step by step lee is ******* man is braver a great leader i think him one of the first captains of the world but in spite of his courage and ******* spite of the heroism of his ****** spite of the high character and pure motives of the *********** are going to fail then the rest will *********** suffrage and the bayonet then the third era will ******** disgust of the white man at the equality of the negro his distrust of a government which makes such a farce possible consequent revulsion against democracy a tendency toward monarchy a king emperor or dictator who will restore order out of the chaos of ******* and madness england is rushing toward a democracy america is hastening to become an empire for my own part i think i prefer the imperial to the popular ************* to ***** it is a matter of taste however and mr x turned his head calling out calmly come in the door opened and a stranger glided into the apartment he was clad in a blue federal uniform ************* by a brown linen ******* his face was almost covered by a red beard his lips by a mustache of the same color and his eyes disappeared behind huge green ******* come in repeated mr x who seemed to recognize the intruder what news the personage glanced quickly at me speak before him said mr x he is a friend i am very well acquainted with colonel surry said the other smiling and have the honor to number him i hope among my own friends with which words the newcomer quietly removed his red beard took off his green spectacles and i saw before me no less a personage than mr nighthawk nothing was more surprising in this singular man than these sudden appearances at places and times when you least expected him i had parted with him in spottsylvania on the night when he deserted from the enemy and rode into our lines and he was then the secret agent of general stuart now he reappeared in the city of richmond with an excellent understanding it was evident between himself and mr x our greeting was cordial and indeed i never had classed nighthawk among professional spies general stuart assured me one day that he invariably refused all reward and his profound almost romantic devotion to mohun had deeply impressed me love of country and watchful care of the young cavalier whose past life was as mysterious as his own seemed the controlling sentiments of nighthawk and he always presented himself to me rather in the light of a political *********** than as a spy his first words now indicated that he was a secret agent of the government he seemed to have been everywhere and gained access to everybody and once more as in june 1863 when he appeared at stuarts headquarters near middleburg he astonished me by the accuracy and extent of his information political and military secrets of the highest importance and calling for urgent action on the part of the government were detailed by nighthawk in his calm and benignant voice he gave us an account of a long interview which he had had at city point with general grant and wound up as usual by announcing an impending ******* movement of the enemy which duly took place as he announced mr x listened with close attention asking few questions when nighthawk had made his report the statesman looked at his watch said sotto voce *********** late and added aloud come back at ten tomorrow morning my friend your information is highly interesting and important nighthawk rose and i did likewise declining the courteous request of mr x to prolong my visit he held the door open with great politeness and said smiling i need not say my dear colonel that the views i have expressed this evening are *************** the present at least assuredly i replied with a bow and a smile hereafter you are at liberty to repeat them if you wish only i beg you will ascribe them to mr x an unknown quantity if you write a book and put me in it send me a ****** canada a moment afterward i was wending my way through the shrubbery thinking of the curious personage i had left at the gate nighthawk awaited me and i scarcely recognized him he had resumed his red beard and green glasses i am glad to see you again colonel he said benignantly i heard that you were in the city and called at your lodgings but found you absent you wished to see me particularly then nighthawk yes and tonight colonel ah i know you are a friend of general mohuns a very sincere friend well i think we will be able to do him a very great service by attending to a little matter in which he is interested colonel are you disengaged and willing to accompany me i looked intently at nighthawk he was evidently very much in earnest i am entirely disengaged and perfectly willing to accompany you i said but where nighthawk smiled you know i am a mysterious person colonel both by character and profession i fear the habit is growing on me in spite of every exertion i make i predict i will end by burning my coat for fear it will tell some of my secrets well i said with a smile keep your secret then and lead the way i am ready to go far to oblige mohun in any thing i thank you colonel from my heart you have only to follow me and nighthawk set out at a rapid pace through the grounds of the capitol toward the lower part of the city there was something as singular about the walk of my companion as about his appearance he went at a great pace but his progress was entirely noiseless you would have said that he was ******** along upon invisible wings in an incredibly short time we had reached a street below the capitol and my companion who had walked straight on without turning his head to the right or the left all at once paused before a tall and ************ house which would have appeared completely *********** except for a bright red light which shone through a circular opening in the door at this door nighthawk gave a single tap the glass covering the circular space glided back and a face ************ my companion uttered two words and the door opened giving access to a stairs which we ascended the janitor having already disappeared at the head of the stairs was a door which nighthawk opened and we found ourselves in an apartment where a dozen persons were playing **** upon these nighthawk threw a rapid ********** one whom he appeared to be seeking was evidently not among the players another moment he returned through the door i following and we ascended a second flight of stairs at the top of which was a second door here another janitor barred the way but my companion again uttered some low ******** door opened a magnificently lit apartment with a ****** of liquors and every ****** presented itself before us and in the midst of a dozen personages who were playing furiously i ************ blocque mr croker mr torpedo and colonel desperade for some moments i stood watching the spectacle and it very considerably enlarged my experience before me i saw prominent politicians officers of high rank employees of government holding responsible positions all ******** with an ardor that amounted to fury one gentleman in ***************** of the quartermasters ************** in his hand a huge package of confederate notes of the denominations of 100 and 500 and this worthy ****** twice the pretty little amount of 10000 upon a card and each time lost the play so absorbed the soldiers ********* and ***************** that our presence was *********** my friend mr blocque did not turn his head mr croker mr torpedo and colonel desperade were red in the face and oblivious after that evening i knew where some of the public money went as i was looking at the strange scene of reckless excitement one of the players a portly individual with black mustache rich dark curls gold spectacles and wearing a fine suit of ************** and looked toward us nighthawk was already gazing at him and suddenly i saw their glances cross like steel ******* they had evidently recognized each other and going up to the gentleman of the spectacles nighthawk said a few words in a low voice which i did not distinguish with pleasure my dear friend said the portly gentleman but you are sure you are not provided with a detective of general ******* can you believe such a thing returned nighthawk reproachfully i thought it possible you might have one waiting below but if you give me your word nighthawk and without further objection the worthy followed nighthawk and myself down the stairs as we approached the outer door the invisible janitor opened it we issued forth into the street and the portly gentleman fixing a keen look upon me in the clear moonlight said i believe we have had the pleasure of meeting before colonel i am ashamed to say i do not remember where sir i said my memory is better colonel we met last may in a house in the wilderness near chancellorsville is it possible that you are swartz very much at your service it is wonderful what a difference is made by a wig and spectacles as he spoke he gracefully removed his black wig and the gold spectacles in the man with gray hair small eyes and double chin i recognized the spy of the wilderness replacing his wig and spectacles mr swartz smiled in a goodhumored manner and said may i ask to what i am indebted for this visit nighthawk replied even more blandly i wish to have a conversation with you my dear swartz before arresting you ah you intend to arrest me unless you make it unnecessary how by producing the paper which we spoke of in the wilderness said nighthawk briefly swartz shook his head that is not in my power my friend i did not bring it with me will you think me very ******** if i say i do not believe you my dear swartz swartz smiled well that would be speaking without ceremony my ********* i assure you i am unable to do as you desire aha you repeat that curious statement my dear swartz well oblige me by accompanying me to the provostmarshals you arrest me precisely as a spy why not it is impossible nighthawk you resist i might do so and opening his coat mr swartz exhibited a ********** and revolver i show you these little toys said he laughing goodhumoredly to let you see my friend that i might oppose your ********** you know i am not backward in using them on occasion but i make a difference you are not a common ************* or detective ************ are a friend and comrade and i am going to prove that i appreciate your feelings and respect your wishes nighthawk fixed his eyes on the speaker and listened you are a friend of general mohuns said mr swartz with ***** good humor you wish to secure a certain document in which he is interested you fancy i have that document here in the city of richmond and your object very naturally is to force me to surrender it well i do not object to doing ***** a consideration i fully intend to produce it when my terms are accepted i would have stated them to you in the wilderness but you were unable to meet **** to general mohun but his violence defeated every thing you meet me now and without discussion demand the paper i reply that i have not brought it with me but three days from this time will meet you at a spot agreed on with the document for which you will return **** consideration nighthawk shook his head unfortunately my dear swartz experience tells me that the present is always the best time for ************ a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush mr swartz smiled sweetly and i am the bird in your hand something like it i am a spy dont use hard names my friend by no means my dear nighthawk and if i have hurt your feelings i deeply regret it but i am speaking to the point you regard me as a federal spy lurking in *********** penetrate my disguise and are going to arrest me and search my lodgings for that paper the necessity is painful said nighthawk it is useless my friend i will try it swartz smiled and drew a paper from his pocket which he unfolded you are then determined to arrest your old comrade nighthawk yes my dear swartz as a spy exactly in spite of this and mr swartz held out the paper do me the favor to read this colonel and then oblige me by returning it i took the paper and easily read it by moonlight it contained the following words the bearer is employed on secret service by the confederate government and will not be molested the paper was signed by a personage of high position in the government and was stamped with the seal of the department over which he presided there could be no doubt of the genuineness of the paper the worthy mr swartz loomed up before me in the novel and unexpected light of a confederate emissary i read the paper aloud to nighthawk and pointed to the official signature and seal nighthawk uttered a groan and his chin sank upon his breast that spectacle seemed to excite the sympathy of his friend there my dear nighthawk said mr swartz in a feeling tone dont take the blow too much to heart i have beaten you this game and your hands are tied at present but i swear that i will meet you and produce that paper when murmured nighthawk in three days from this time where at the house of our friend alibi near monks neck in dinwiddie on your word on the word of swartz that is enough my dear swartz i will be at alibis when we will come to terms and now pardon this visit which has put you to so much inconvenience i was merely jesting my dear friend when i spoke of arresting you arrest you nothing could induce me to think of so unfriendly a proceeding and now good night my dear friend i will return with you colonel with which words nighthawk saluted his friend and we returned toward the upper part of the city such were the scenes of a night in the summer of 1864 on the next morning a piece of good fortune befell me in spite of continued visits to the ********* and an amount of *********** which must have been exceedingly annoying to the gentlemen of the red tape i found myself at the end of august apparently no nearer to an assignment to duty than at first it really seemed that the confederate states had no need of my services that the privilege of performing military duty in behalf of the government was one jealously guarded and not to be lightly bestowed upon any one i was in despair and was revolving the project of resigning my empty commission and enlisting in the cavalry as a private soldier when the deus ex ****** to extricate me from all my troubles appeared in the person of colonel p of army headquarters this accomplished soldier and gentleman met me as i was coming out of the ********* on the morning after the visit to mr x looking i suppose like some descendant of the knight of the sorrowful countenance and stopped to inquire the cause of my dejection i informed him of the whole affair and he laughed heartily you have set about your affairs my dear colonel in a manner entirely wrong he said you should have gone to some general discovered that your grandmother and his own were third cousins expressed your admiration of his valor denounced the ************** with

our relations did not proceed beyond friendship and when i told you one day in the wilderness that i was not her suitor i spoke the truth i am not exactly able to say as much ******** to finish my

hesitation lasted exactly three seconds at the end of that time i was riding beside mohun in the direction of five forks which we reached just as i terminated my account of myself since mohun and i had parted in the wilderness five forks was an old mansion not far from the place of the same name now become historical it was a building of large size the grounds were extensive and had been elegant the house had evidently been the home of a long line of gentlemen whose portraits flanked by those of their fair ********* adorned the walls of the great drawingroom between the lofty windows in the

received me with charming sweetness but a secret melancholy weighed down the dusky eyelashes the blue eyes were sad the very smiles on the rosy lips were sad all was plain here too at a single glance the pure girl had given her heart to the brave willie davenant and some mysterious hostility of her father toward the young officer forced them apart what was the origin of that hostility why had judge conway so abruptly torn his daughter away from davenant at the ball in *********** why had that shadow passed over the old ********** brow when i uttered the name of the young man in richmond i

mohun declared that he would remain an hour ********* having promised a visit soon at his camp on the rowanty i mounted my horse and set out through the darkness for petersburg following the white oak

nearly fell and when i touched him with the spur i found that he limped painfully dismounting i examined his foot the sharp point had entered it and it was bleeding profusely the accident was ************** attempting to ride on i found the hurt worse than i had expected my gray staggered on as if the limb were broken i dismounted once more led him slowly by the bridle and continued my way on foot a quarter of a mile farther the animal was in such agony that i looked around for some light by which to examine the hurt more fully on the right a glimmer was seen through the trees i made straight toward it through the woods and soon found myself near a group of tents one of which was lit up whose headquarters are these i asked of a man on post near mine my dear colonel said a voice in the darkness near my candle yonder is hospitable and enables me to recognize you with which words the figure advanced into the light and i recognized the tall and stately form of general davenant he gave me his hand cordially and i explained my dilemma you are unfortunate but fortunate too said davenant as i have a man among my couriers who knows all about horses i will send yours to him meanwhile come into my tent and ********** my horse to the orderly with some brief directions the general led the way into his headquarters tent a cheerful fire burned in the rude ******** chimney on one side were a plain desk and two ********** on the other a rough couch of pine logs filled with straw and spread with blankets upon the blankets a boy of about fourteen was sound asleep the light auburn curls tossed in disorder over the rosy young face at a glance i recognized the youth who had entered the ranks at gettysburg taken part in picketts charge and been borne out through the smoke wounded and bleeding in the arms of his father the young charley had evidently recovered and was as ruddy as before his little braided jacket was as jaunty his face as smiling as on that evening near paris an hour afterward general davenant and myself were conversing like old friends we were by no means strangers as i had repeatedly been thrown with him in the army and my intimacy with will doubtless commended me to the brave soldiers regard an accident now seemed about to make us still better acquainted the orderly had reported that it would be impossible to proceed farther with my horse that night and i had accepted the invitation of general davenant to remain with him until morning my brigade is holding the right of the army colonel he had said we have just moved to this position and have not had time to become very comfortable but i can offer you a tolerable supper and a ******* after it with a warm welcome i assure you i declined the supper but accepted the bed and seated opposite the grizzled old cavalier in his gray uniform had begun to converse something about the stately general of infantry drew me irresistibly toward him his bearing was lofty and not without a species of hauteur but under all was an exquisite ************ and courtesy which made his society quite charming at some words of mine however in reference to my visit on this day to his

they issued from his lips indeed with a species of **** and he seemed glad to get rid of them if i may so express myself i can talk of this affair with you colonel he added gloomily for will has told me of your regard for him i bowed and said you are not wrong in supposing that i am one of your sons best friends general i was long in the cavalry with ******** is no more heroic soldier in the

i ********* would have been **************** i know will would tell me i guessed it however and i have visited the young lady at her house tonight i will certainly use my utmost exertions to remove

flushed face with positive wonder and replied you astonish me general are there any such obstacles in life there are i made no reply there are colonel repeated the now fiery old soldier judge conway has been guilty of a gross wrong to me no son of mine shall ever form an alliance with his family i looked up with deep astonishment this is a very great surprise to me my dear general i said i thought from many things that it was judge conway who opposed this alliance and from the belief that you had done him some great wrong general davenant had taken his seat again after his outburst once more his forehead was covered with his hand for some moments he preserved a silence so profound that nothing disturbed the night but the long breathing of the sleeping boy and the measured tramp of the sentinel then all at once the general raised his head his expression was no longer ******* was unutterably sad i have been reflecting colonel he said gravely and in these few minutes have come to a somewhat singular determination what is that general to tell you why my son can never marry the daughter of judge conway general davenant leaned his elbow on the desk rested his forehead in his hand and said in a deep measured voice my story need not be a long one colonel those who relate gay adventures and joyous experiences indulge in endless ************* is charming to them at such *********** go back to the past with a smile on the lips recalling every little detail every color of the bright picture my own narrative will be brief because it is a gloomy one it is far from

succeeding the murder his riderless horse was then seen standing at the door of the stable at five forks and in great terror judge conway set out rapidly to look for his brother who was supposed to

house opposite me in the carriage little charley who dimly realized apparently that some trouble had come to me was crying bitterly and a rough personage was endeavoring to quiet his sobbing the personage in question was a ********* when i fainted at the grave my friends had caught me in their ************* with burning indignation that the charge against me was a base ********** the magistrate who was summoned by judge conway to arrest me had declined to do more than direct a ********* to escort me home and see that i did not attempt to escape that was kind i was a murderer and my proper place a jail why should i be more favored than some poor common man charged with that crime had such a person been confronted with such a charge supported by such ******* evidence as the bloody knife would any ceremony have been observed to jail all would have cried no **** for the murderer and why should the rich mr davenant be treated with more consideration on the day after my ******* spare you all the harrowing scenes my poor wifes agony and every thing ********* the day after i got into my carriage and went and demanded to be confined in jail it was the first time a davenant had ever been in ******* i went thither without hesitation if not without a shudder no sooner had i taken this step than the whole country seemed to have left their homes to visit me in my prison on the evening of the scene at the grave twenty persons had called at the pines to express their sympathy and indignation at the charge against me now when the iron door of the law had closed upon me and i was a real prisoner the visitors came in throngs without number one and all they treated the charge as the mere result of judge conways ******** laughed at others denounced it as an attempt to entrap and destroy ***** were certain that an investigation would at once demonstrate my innocence and restore me to liberty and honor alas i could only thank my friends and reply that i hoped that such would be the result but when they had left me alone i fell into fits of the deepest dejection what proofs could i give that i was innocent there was a terrible array of circumstances on the contrary to support the hypothesis of my ********* more than i have mentioned colonel i had visited the courthouse on the same day with poor george conway and for the first time in twenty years had exchanged words with him and the words were unfriendly we had both been in the clerks office of the county when that gentleman asked me some commonplace ********** what year such a person had died and his will had been recorded i think i replied mentioning a year the clerk shook his head declaring that it must have been later and appealed to poor george conway who agreed with him adding mr davenant is certainly in the wrong i was much annoyed that ******* some curt ********* george made a similar rejoinder and some harsh almost insulting words passed between us the affair went no further however i left the clerks office and having attended to the business which brought me left the courthouse about dusk as i mounted my horse i saw poor george conway riding out of the place i followed slowly not wishing to come up with him turning into a byroad which led toward my own houseand knew nothing of the murder until it was ******* abroad on the next day that is much like the special pleading of a ********** it not colonel if i had really murdered the poor man would not this be my method of explaining every thing you see i do not deny what several witnesses could prove the fact that i quarreled with conway came to high words uttered insults exhibited anger followed him from the courthouse at ***** acknowledge all that but add that i struck into a byroad and went home that sounds suspicious i assure you even to myself today imagine the effect it promised to have then when i was a man charged with ********* would naturally try to frame such a statement as would clear himand when a large portion of the community were excited and indignant at the murder such had been the truly unfortunate scene in the clerks ********* fatality which made me follow the man going to his death and my known enmity of long standing supported the hypothesis of my guilt there was another and even more fatal circumstance ******** discovery of the knife with which george conway had been slain that knife was my own it was one of peculiar shape with a handle of ************* and i had often used it in presence of my friends and others a dozen persons could make oath to it as my property but it was not needed the scene at the grave made that useless i evidently did not deny the ownership of the weapon which had been used in the commission of the murder at the very sight of it on the contrary in the hands of the brother of my victim i had turned pale and fainted this was the condition of things when the special term of the court held expressly to try me commenced at dinwiddie a great crowd assembled on the day of the trial judge conway had vacated the bench as personally interested and the judge from a neighboring circuit had taken his place below the seat of the judge sat the jury outside the railing the spectators were crowded so closely that it was with difficulty the sheriff made a passage for my entrance to one resolution i had adhered in spite of the remonstrances of all my ********* employ no counsel in this determination nothing could shake me a disdainful pride sustained me mingled with bitter obstinacy if i the representative of one of the oldest and most honorable families in the county of dinwiddie was to be branded as a ********** my past life my family and personal character did not refute the ******** i was to be dragged to death on suspicion ******** as a murderer because some felon had stolen my *********** and committed a crime with ****** i would go to my death unmoved i would disdain to frame explanations let the law murder me if it would no **** counsel should save my life by technicalities i would be vindicated by god and my past life or would die such was my state of mind and such the origin of my refusal to employ counsel when the court now assigned me counsel i rose and forbade them to appear for me in the midst of a stormy scene and with the prosecuting attorney sitting dumb in his chair resolved to take no part in the trial the witnesses appeared upon the stand and rather by ********** than the judges consent the jury proceeded to *********** them the circumstances which i have detailed to you were all proved in the clearest manner the altercation in the clerks office on the day of the murder my long enmity against him dating back more than twenty years the fact that i had followed him out of the village just at dusk on the fatal night and the discovery of my knife in the tall grass by the roadside near the body i had summoned no witnesses but some appeared of their own accord and gave important testimony many neighbors testified that my enmity toward george conway had almost entirely disappeared in the lapse of years and that i had spoken of him upon more than one occasion with great kindness the clerk of the county described the scene in his office stating that the affair had appeared to him a mere interchange of curt words without exhibition of the least malice on my part the most important witness however was a poor man living in the neighborhood who made oath that he had been riding toward the courthouse on the evening of the murder had passed mr conway and riding on farther came in sight of me and he had before reaching me seen me turn into the byroad which led toward my own residence i could not have committed the murder he added for mr conway had time to pass the spot where his body was found before i could have ridden back to the highroad and caught up with him unfortunately the witness who gave this testimony bore a very indifferent character and i could see that more than one of the ****** suspected that he was ********* himself another *********** circumstance also intervened to neutralize the favorable impression thus made from the irregular mode of proceeding the fatal knife had not been exhibited in court suddenly a ***** called for it and it could nowhere be found the sheriff swore that he had left it in the clerks office where he supposed it to be entirely safe upon searching for it however in the drawer where he had deposited it the weapon was missing when that fact was stated i saw a curious expression pass over the faces of more than one of the jury they evidently suspected foul play was the door of the office locked asked one of them yes sir was the reply were the windows secured by shutters with bolts are all the bolts on the windows of this building firm i think so sir there is one that is not said the ***** and he pointed to a long iron bolt on one of the windows which bore evident traces of having been rent from its socket the sheriff looked in amazement in the direction indicated you are right sir he said some one has entered the courthouse by breaking open the shutter and stolen that knife from the clerks office which is never locked a meaning silence followed the words it was not difficult to understand it the jury looked at each other and in their glances i could read ****** davenant is on trial for his life he or his friends ****** testimony to prove an alibi on the night of the murder and not content with that they hire a ******* to enter the courthouse and steal the knife which proves his connection with the ******** it may not appear in evidence against him the evidence closed i had not uttered a word i had sworn in my heart that i would not stir a finger in the ********* now stung beyond endurance i rose and addressed the jury in impassioned words their verdict i told them was of little importance if i was to lose the respect of my fellowcitizens i had made no effort to shape their decision but now on the brink it might be of a felons grave i would utter my dying words i would confine myself to protesting before god and on my honor that i had long since forgiven george conway the wrongs done methat the scene on the day of his murder was the result of momentary ************ caused by business annoyances and not ********** i had forgotten it in an ************ directly to my own houseand only heard of the murder on the day after its commission as to the ****** had been suspected if not charged with having had the weapon stolen well my answer to that was to declare that to the best of my knowledge and belief the murder was committed with my own knife more than that a witness had sworn that he saw me turn into the road to my own residence at such a distance behind george conway that i could not have rejoined him before he had passed the fatal spot the witness was mistaken there was time by riding across the angle through the thicket i could easily have rejoined him and now gentlemen i said i have done i have left you no ground to charge me with ********* ************* having the evidence of my crime ********** plotting in darkness to hide my crime and blind your eyes in determining my guilt or innocence that knife was mine i repeat it was possible for me to rejoin mr conway and do him to death by a blow with it now retire gentlemen bring in your verdict thank god no taint of real dishonor will rest upon a davenant and i can appear before my maker as i stand here ************* ten minutes afterward the jury had retired with every mark of agitation upon their faces the great concourse of spectators seemed moved almost beyond control suddenly the crowd opened i saw my wife hastening through the space thus ***** living wall on each ******* in an instant she had thrown herself into my arms with a low cry which brought tears to the roughest faces of the ******** i placed my arm around her remonstrated with her for this illadvised proceeding and was trying to soothe her when she hastily gave me a letter a strange man had brought it an hour before she ****** was marked in ********* will save mr davenants life she had mounted her riding horse and brought it at full speed in person without waiting to question the stranger who had at once disappeared i opened the ************* at its ********** the same instant the jury made their ************* the clerk said gentlemen of the jury have you agreed upon a verdict we have sir said the foreman what is it not guilty the courthouse rang with applause the crowd rushed toward me to shake me by the hand and congratulate me suddenly in the midst of the tumult i heard the furious words murderer you have escaped but i brand you before god and man as the murderer of my brother it was judge conway who mounted upon a bench with glaring eyes foaming lips teeth clenched in a wild fury shook his arm at me and denounced me as a convict before god if not before man general davenant was silent for a moment the deep voice so long resounding in my ears made the silence oppressive now you know my dear colonel he suddenly added why my son can not form an alliance with a daughter of judge conway i bowed my head the whole mystery was patent before me the family opposition is mutual said general davenant with a proud smile he objects because he believes that i murdered his ********** i object because he believes it he insulted me outraged meat the grave in the courthouse in public as in private and i could not think of beseeching his honor to give his consent to the marriage of his daughter with the son of an escaped murderer the old soldier uttered these words with gloomy bitterness but in a moment he had regained his coolness that was the end of the affair he said i went home accompanied by a cortge of friends who seemed never weary of congratulating me and on the next day i wrote a mortal defiance to judge conway which i placed in the hands of a friend to convey to him an hour afterward i had mounted my horse ridden rapidly caught up with this friend on his way to five forks and had taken from him the challenge which i tore to pieces you will probably comprehend the motive which compelled me to do this it was not repugnance to the modern form of single combat i am sorry to say old as i was i had still the ancient hallucination on that subject i did not then know that duels were mere ************** play that one infantry skirmish results in the shedding of more blood than all the affairs of a generation the motive that induced me to withdraw my challenge was one which you will probably understand the pale face of the dead george conway had risen up before mei knew his brothers deep love for himthat he regarded me as the dead mans murderer and i no longer writhed under that public insult in the courthouse or at least controlled myself let him go on his way poor stricken heart i said with deep pity i forgive him and will not avenge that affront to me such is my history colonel it is sad you see i have related it to explain what has come to your ************ bitter hostility which judge conway indulges toward me and his ****** at the very name of davenant these events occurred more than ten years ago during all that time he has been laboring under the belief that i am really guilty of his brothers blood see where my high pride has conducted me said general davenant with a smile of inexpressible melancholy and bitterness i was proud and disdainful on the day of my ****** would not use the common weapons of ******** risked my life by refusing counsel and acknowledging the ownership of that knife pride hauteur a sort of disdain at ******** a charge of base ************ was my sentiment then and i remain as haughty today i am a ********* was found not ********* go and tell judge conway the contents of that letter received in the courthouse the contents of the letter general yes colonel what did it ******** beg you to tell me the confession of the murderer of george conway general davenant had scarcely uttered the words which i have just recorded when rapid firing was heard in the woods a quarter of a mile from his headquarters and a moment afterward a courier came at a gallop bearing a dispatch my horse came in the brief tone of command and general davenant tore open the dispatch which he read attentively the enemy are advancing to attack me he said this note was written ten minutes since the attack has commenced will you go and see it colonel willingly general davenant ordered another horse as my own was useless we mounted and rode at full speed through the woods in five minutes we were at the scene of action a heavy assault was in progress the enemy had massed a large force in front of the hastily erected earthworks and were endeavoring by a determined charge to carry them general davenant was everywhere amid the fight the guiding and directing head and beside him i saw distinctly in the starlight the brave figure of little charley who had started from his couch buckled on a huge sword and was now galloping to and fro cheering on the men as gallantly as his father it was an inspiring sight to see that child in his little braided jacket with his jaunty cap balanced gallantly on his auburn ******* see his rosy cheeks his smiling lips and his small hand flourishing that tremendous sabre as he galloped gaily amid the fire and yet i said there are those who will not believe in ******* race fill the space which that dash occupies my dear reader with an abrupt duck of the head as a bullet went through my hat the charge was repulsed in twenty minutes but the firing continued throughout the night when it ceased toward daybreak and i rode back with general davenant and charley who was as gay as a lark and entertained me with reminiscences of gettysburg i was completely broken down with fatigue throwing myself upon a bed in general davenants tent i fell asleep when i opened my eyes the sun was high in the heavens i looked around for the general he was invisible i rose and at the door of the tent met charley with bright eyes and cheeks like roses the general has gone to corps headquarters colonel and told me to present you his compliments and beg that you will remain to breakfast after which formal and somewhat pompous sentence the youthful charley drew near slapped me in a friendly way upon the back and exclaimed with dancing eyes i say colonel wasnt that a jolly old ******* we had last night my reply was a laugh and a glance of admiration at the gay boy i declined the invitation of general davenant as i had to return my horse was brought and i found his foot much easier in half an hour i was on the road to petersburg once back at the cedars i reflected deeply upon the history which i had heard from the lips of general davenant i shall refrain however from recording these reflections if the reader will cast his eyes back over the pages of these memoirs he will perceive that i have confined myself generally to the simple narration of ************ pausing to offer my own comments upon the scenes passing before me were i to do so what an enormous volume i should write and how the reader would be bored now to bore a reader is in my eyes one of the greatest crimes of which an author can be guilty it is the unpardonable sin indeed in a writer for which reason and acting upon the theory that a drama ought to explain itself and be its own *********** i spare the worthy reader of these pages all those reflections which i indulged in after hearing general davenants singular narrative pride pride i muttered rising at the end of an hour i think i can understand *************** as is this instance but i wish i had heard who was the real murderer of george conway having thus dismissed the subject i set about drawing up my official report and this charmingly commonplace employment soon banished from my mind every more inviting subject it was nearly ten days after this my first ride into the wilds of dinwiddie before i again set out to look after the cavalry the end of october was approaching grant had continued to hammer away along his immense line of earthworks and day by day step by step he had gone on extending his left in the direction of the southside railroad if the reader will keep this in view he will understand every movement of the great adversaries grant had vainly attempted to carry lees works by assault or *********** only hope of success now was to gradually extend his lines toward the southside road seize upon that great war ****** which supplied lifeblood to lees army and thus compel the confederate commander to retreat or starve in his trenches one thing was ********* when grant reached the southside railroad lee was lost unless he could mass his army and cut his way through the forces opposed to him and this fact was so obvious the situation was so ************ from the moment when the weldon road was seized upon by general grant that officer and his great adversary never removed their eyes from the real point of importance the true key of the ********** the southside railroad on lees right elsewhere grant attacked but it was to cover some movement still toward his left he assaulted lees works north of the ******** it was south of the appomattox that he was looking the operations of the fall and winter on the lines around petersburg were a great series of marches and ************** to and fro suddenly bursting into battles grant massed his army heavily in front of the works in charles city opposite the left of lee attempted to draw in that direction his adversarys main force then suddenly the blue lines vanished they were rushed by railroad toward petersburg and grant hastened to thrust his columns still farther beyond lees right in order to turn it and seize the southside road that was not the conception of a great soldier it may be reader but it was ingenious general grant was not a man of great military ******** he was patient watchful and persevering to defeat lee what was wanted was genius or ***************** or grant in the long run perseverance was going to achieve the results of genius the ******** was going to reach the same goal with the hare it was a question of ******** was all so throughout october as throughout september and august and july general grant thundered everywhere along his forty miles of earthworks but his object was to raise a smoke dense enough to hide the blue

simply the white oak road was the ******* door into the citadel gradually moving thus from the jerusalem plank road to the weldon railroad from the weldon railroad to the squirrel level road from the squirrel level road toward the boydton road beyond which was the white oak road grant came toward the end of october to the banks of the rowanty as this long blue serpent unfolded its coils and stretched its threatening head into the dinwiddie woods lee had extended his right to confront it the great opponents moved **** ***** each marching in face of each other like two trained and skillful

civilians thought ******* did not it was plain that this must end somewhere lees line would not bear much further extension it reached now from a point on the williamsburg road east of richmond to burgesss mill west of petersburg his forty thousand men were strung over forty miles that made the line so thin that it would bear little more stretched a little farther still and it would snap lee called in vain for more men the government could not send them he predicted the result of failure to receive them they did not come and grant continued to move on and lee continued to stretch his thin line until it began to crack such was the situation of affairs at the end of *********** grant aimed a heavy blow to cut the line in pieces the blue serpent raised its head and sprung to strike such was the critical condition of affairs when i again set out to make my regular tour of inspection of the cavalry crossing hatchers run at burgesss mill i turned to the left and soon found myself riding on between the lofty walls of pine through which the roads of dinwiddie wind like a serpent when near monks neck i determined to stop and feed my horse i always carried strapped behind my saddle a small bag containing about a feed of corn for that purpose and as i generally selected some wayside house where i could myself rest while my horse was feeding i now looked about me to discover such my search was speedily rewarded three hundred yards from the road in a clump of stunted trees i saw a small house which i soon reached the surroundings of the establishment were poor and mean beyond expression through the open door i could see that the interior was even more povertystricken than the outside as i dismounted a man came to this door are you fond of natural history reader and have you ever amused yourself by *********** *********** between certain human beings and certain ************* birds or fishes i have seen men who resembled horses owls hawks ******** geese this one resembled the bird called the ******* read the description of the ******** their feet are placed more *********** than in any other birds and only afford them support by resting on the ****** which is

excessively lean instead of fat the feet accorded with the above description the arms were short and hung like wings the coat of the worthy was a ragged ******* which ended in a point behind like the

******* eyes a mouth stretching from ear to ear and a nose like the bill of a duck you will then have before you the gentleman who bore as i soon discovered the classic name of mr alibi when the worthy who had flapped his arms by way of greeting and shown me into his mansion informed me that such was his name i knew that the house at which i now found myself was the place of meeting agreed upon between nighthawk and swartz at their interview in richmond here also the man and woman rescued by swartz on the nottoway had been left on his way to petersburg as the spy had informed us in the wilderness well general croaked mr alibi with a smile and in a nasal voice ****** the news i am only a lieutenantcolonel mr alibi well colonel any thing stirring nothing i think any news with you mr

in an uncouth fashion i aint seen him for a long spell now nor swartz either mr alibi looked keenly at me ***** nor him ****** **************** leave out the ********* my dear mr alibi and call me

nighthawk in person entered the house nighthawk had appeared as was his wont as if he had risen from the earth but this circumstance disappeared from my mind at once i was looking at his face it had completely lost its benignant expression was pale and bore marks of great fatigue something of the old clerical ********* came to the eyes as he greeted me cordially but sitting down in the nearest chair as though completely wearied out he became as dispirited as before and what mout be the matter with you mr nighthawk said mr alibi you look s if the night **** had been ******* of you with spurs on and mr alibi flapped his wings stretched out his neck and seemed about to ****** i am tired alibi said nighthawk briefly go to the spring and get me some fresh water you ****** come back in a hurry as i wish to talk with colonel surry and mr nighthawk rose and carelessly sat down near the window through which he could reconnoitre the object of this movement was soon evident mr alibi took a bucket and went out as though to seek the spring when he had gone a few paces however he turned to the right and disappeared behind the house toward the opposite window which was open nighthawk rose went to the door and caught mr alibi **************** result of which was that the ******* hastily moved off muttering in a minute he had ******** along and disappeared no sooner had his figure

the appointed day i was here two days afterward ************ for ******** had not been ******* as that was the most unaccountable thing in the world to me i set out to find him in the enemys lines yes colonel i had no doubt i would come across him somewhere so i went through the country behind the federal lines looked everywhere for my man have been looking ever since i left youand at last have found him where in the upper room of a deserted house not three miles from this place within the enemys picket line the upper room of a deserted house *********** to starve there colonel the work of darke and that ******** who goes about with him i am willing to swear colonel good heavens is it possible i said swartz is shut up and left to starve exactly ********** here is how i know it i was coming back worn out by my long search after swartz when in passing this house i came suddenly upon a picket of about fifty men to avoid being seen i ran being on foot and got behind the house i had no sooner done so than i heard groans from the upper part of itand as the house was entirely *********** these sounds excited my ************ to say astonishment well i determined to find the origin of them i crawled through a broken ************* the second floor by a dusty staircase and went straight toward a door behind which i heard the groaning it was heavily locked and i could not even shake it then i ran to the partition between the room and the ************ it made of boards between the cracks of which i could ****** looking in i saw swartz he was sitting on an old broken chair beside a table with three legs and his hand was buried in his hair as if he was trying to tear it out when i called to him he started and his groans stopped he turned his head no sooner had he

coming back i had scarcely exchanged ten words with swartz when i heard the gallop of a horse and running to the window saw that woman get off a seconds reflection told me that she was coming into the house i knew that if discovered i would be shot or taken *********** i decided on my course in a minute i said to swartz wait a few ****** will go and bring you help i glided through a back window dropped to the ground ran into the ********* here i am colonel waiting for night to come to return and rescue swartz can you do so with one *********** look out while i pick the lock ******* go with

the house as soon as mr alibi had left us on his errand i tore a sheet from my notebook obtained from nighthawk an exact description of the locality where swartz was confined and writing a note to mohun informed him of our intention if he could send a squadron of cavalry to drive in the picket near the house it would insure the success of our design i added as i finished this note mr alibi appeared with the cavalryman he proved to belong to mohuns command i entrusted the note to him cautioning him that it was important and must reach mohun ************ i looked at my watch it was four oclock already the sun was declining toward the wooded horizon i looked toward it and then at nighthawk who nodded in an hour colonel he said and as i am broken down i will sleep with these words nighthawk leaned back in his *********** chair covered his face with his handkerchief and in ten seconds his long quiet breathing showed plainly that he was asleep a ****** man **************** a ****** man is mr nighthawk said mr alibi and he flapped his arms and ******** about in a manner so extraordinary that he looked more like a ******* than ever night came on i left my horse at mr alibis set off on foot with nighthawk crossed the rowanty separating the opposing pickets by a *********** log in a shadowy nook and was approaching the house in which swartz was shut up nighthawk moved with the stealthy and gliding step of a wildcat i could see the man was a born scout intended by nature for the calling he had ************* service he scarcely uttered a word when he did it was in tones so low that they were lost in the whisper of the wind amid the great trailing vines depending from the trees and i was compelled to lean my ear close to catch the words fifty paces from the bank a shadowy object on horseback was visible by the dim light the vedette murmured nighthawk but he need not see us and plunging or rather gliding into the shadow of the trees he led the way without noise to a point directly in rear of the vedette a hundred yards farther a fire twinkled and around this fire were the dusky figures of men and horses this was evidently the picket three hundred paces to the left rose a dark object sombre and lugubrious against the night which it exceeded in blackness only in the upper portion of the house a dim light like a star glittered some one is yonder came from nighthawk in a murmur as before let us go there colonel and crouching down until his body nearly reached the earth my companion glided ********* toward the house i imitated him we passed unobserved and almost immediately were behind the house nighthawk then rose erect and said in a whisper i am going to reconnoitre remain here colonel if i think you can come up without danger i will make you a signal through that window with these words nighthawk pointed to an open window about ten feet from the ground glided past me through the broken sash of one beside which we were standing and disappeared like a shadow i waited holding my breath from the upper portion of the house came the muffled sound of voices i was endeavoring to distinguish the words uttered when i saw nighthawk appear at the upper window and make me a sign that sign indicated that i might ascend with a reasonable amount of safety and passing without noise through the window i found myself in a bare and deserted apartment with a single *********** window opposite me on the right was an open door i passed through it and found myself at the foot of a rough stairway occupying half of a narrow passage ascending not without more than one ***** which i must confess sent a ****** through my nerves i reached the upper landing found myself in front of a closed door and beside this door encountered the warning hand of nighthawk look he said and drawing me toward him he pointed through a crack in the board partition which separated the passage from the apartment leaning on nighthawks shoulder i placed my eye at the aperture on a broken chair beside the *********** table sat darke ****** spurred and armed with pistol and sabre in an old rockingchair without arms the singular woman who seemed to accompany him everywhere sat rocking to and fro and carelessly tapping with a small whip the handsome gray ridinghabit which defined her slender and graceful figure facing them on an old bed frame sat the

tonight i am going to tell you that might be called imprudent no i am talking to a dead man you see i hold out no false ******** will not leave this house alive ********* will go back and tell you something which will serve to explain the whole darke paused a moment and then gazed with a strange mixture of gloom and tenderness upon the gray woman perhaps you too madam he said speaking in a low

courthouse a few miles only from this spot and one day a certain mr george conway visited the courthouse to receive a considerable sum of money which was to be paid to him at the words a certain mr george conway uttered by the speaker in a hoarse and hesitating voice i very nearly uttered an exclamation that name which general davenants recent narrative had surrounded with so many gloomy associations produced a profound effect on me as it now escaped from this mans lips and had it not been for nighthawks warning pressure on my arm i should probably have betrayed our vicinity fortunately i suppressed the rising exclamation it had attracted no attention and darke went on in the same low tone i was in the clerks office of dinwiddie when the money i refer to was paid to mr conway it amounted to about ten thousand dollars and as i had at that time no business in the region more important than hanging around the tavern and drinking and playing ******* besides this i was at the end of my resources having lost my last penny on the night before at the ************ idea occurred to me that it would not be a bad plan to ride after mr conway ****** him on the road represent my necessities to him and request a small loan out of his abundant means to prevent myself from being deprived of my ************** and cards is that a roundabout way of saying i intended to act the ********** perhaps ************* this occasion by no means madam what is highway robbery is it not the brutal and wanton robbery of the poor as well as the rich well i was not going to rob anybody i was going to request a small ******* so far from intending violence ******** he uttered that word always in a hesitating ****** swear i had no such intention i was entirely unarmed upon my whole person there was not one deadly ******** was only by accident that i found when riding out of the courthouse that i had a small penknife in my pocket this i had picked up by pure accident from the table of the clerks office where some one had laid it down i had carelessly commenced ****** my nails with **** attention was attracted by something else i finished ****** my nails and without being aware of what i was doing put the knife in my pocket well you may think perhaps all this is irrelevant you are mistaken many things turned on that knife the devil himself placed it in my grasp that day well darke continued i have told you my design and now i will inform you how i carried it out i saw mr george conway receive the ******* notes bank notes and gold that was enough i knew the road he would take and going to the stable of the tavern i saddled my horse and rode out of the place in a western direction when i was out of sight however i turned eastward toward five forks pushed into the woods and about sunset took my stand in a piece of timber on the side of the road ********** coming by there was always a marked hesitation when he came to the name of his victim he went on more rapidly now well he came along about dusk some one followed him but i could not make out who another man came on from the direction of petersburg passed me and him and the other who had followed him out of the courthouse turned into a byroad and disappeared then i saw that the game was in my own hands i waited looking at him as he approached me i swear i did not intend to harm him i was ********* but i remember what i intended he came on i rode toward him demanded the money he refused i threw myself on him as he struck at me with the **** of his heavy ********** then we both rolled to the ground i under his clutch was on my throat i was choking help he cried and i came near crying it too all at once my hand fell upon my pocket i felt the knife i drew it out opened it and stabbed him as he was strangling me that was the whole do you call it a murder i rose up as he fell back his breast was all bloody his eyes turned round he gasped something and fell back dead the speaker paused and wiped his brow with his huge muscular hand his face was a strange spectacle the most bitter and terrible emotions of the human heart were written there as with a pen of fire then i looked at him he went on i said to myself this is a murder foolishly for he was stabbed not murdered and my first thought was to conceal the body i dragged it to the roadside hid it in some bushes and thinking i heard some one coming leaped on my horse who had stood by ********** had galloped ******* left the cursed spot as fast as i could go the money was left on him i swear i did not touch a penny of it and would not have touched it even if i had not been interrupted i had not intended to kill him it was the result of the struggle i took nothing of his away from that place but i left something of my own the knife with which i had struck him the devil had put the cursed thing into my hand and now the devil made me drop it there within ten feet of the dead body darke had spoken in a low dull gloomy voice and something like a shudder had passed through his frame as he painted in brief words the sombre scene this emotion now seemed even to grow deeper was there good left in this wild animal that knife he continued was very nearly the means of hanging an innocent man it belonged to a gentleman of the neighborhood who had accidentally laid it on the table of the clerks office a few moments before i as accidentally picked it ***** this gentleman had just had angry words ************ a trifle what made things worse was that they had long been ********** when he was found there dead in the bushes next day the owner of the knife found near the body was arrested as the murderer well he went to jail and the trial was coming on soon the evidence against him was strong he was the known enemy **** conway he had quarrelled with him on that day and his knife was found ***** ****** which the money had not been touched a robber you see would have taken the money as it was untouched the crime must have been committed by a personal enemy who was that enemy the ************* name was davenant well the trial was near i had gone back to the courthouse on that day and was still hanging around the place what was i to do i had to determine whether i would let an innocent man be hanged for my crime or go to the sheriff and say release the ********* am the murderer that was rather more than i was ready for and i hit on a means which might serve the knife was important *********** most ************ i was in the clerks office one day hanging round and listening when i saw the sheriff put the knife in a drawer to have it ready near court on the day of trial well that night i broke into the *************** the ******** waited to see what would occur on the trial as the day drew near i felt like a real murderer and had the prisoner all the time before my eyes hanging on a gallows i drank harder than ever but i could not get that picture out of my mind i saw worse pictures than before so i determined what to do i sat down wrote a full confession of the murder which i signed and a friend of mine carried this to the prisoners wife i had put on it in haste this will save mr davenants ******* his wife carried it at full speed with her own hands to the courthouse where she arrived just as the jury had retired the prisoner opened and read it when he had finished it he folded it up and put it in his pocket as he did so the jury came in with a verdict of not ********* he went out of the courtroom accompanied by a crowd of friends so he was cleared you ********** using the document which i had written that was in his pocket was of no further use and as it might become dangerous i entered his house that night broke open the desk in which he kept his private papers and took this one out reading and making sure that it was the genuine document by the light of the moon which streamed in at the window i was still looking at the paper when a noise behind me attracted my attention and turning round i ***** davenant he had heard the noise i made in breaking open the secretary put on his dressinggown and coming down pistol in hand was on me before i knew it the few minutes that followed were rather angry and noisy unexpectedly mr davenant did not fire on me after an interchange of compliments i put the paper in my pocket passed out through the window and mounting my horse rode away after that i went far and saw many persons among the rest you madam and our matrimonial life has been ********* a word to you now he added turning toward swartz i shut you up here to starve you to death because you were trusted and have betrayed me listen and i will tell you how you are greedy for gold and this greed has tempted you to an act which will be your destruction in pennsylvania one night just before the battle of gettysburg you were at my house and stole a paper from madam who was collecting every thing to hide it from the enemy no matter how i know that i have made the discovery and you deny ********** to deliver up that paper which you state you never had and consequently have not in your possession in saying that you **** you stole that paper and promise yourself that you will sell it for a large sum of ******** have already been ********** and have tried to finish the business well that paper is ************* madam at least and she

informed in a day from this time where to find both the *********** you will then be starving and will reveal every thing you think me jesting ********** imagine i will spare you ********* ************ life is a small matter compared with these two papers one is the certificate of madams marriage with your very humble servant the other the letter which i took from mr davenants desk that night in which i confess myself ******* the ********** george conway darkes deep and gloomy voice ceased to resound and for a moment the silence of the apartment was only disturbed by the slight creaking made by the chair of the woman as she quietly rocked backward and forward swartz had risen to his feet while darke was uttering his final words with clasped hands and trembling lips he was about to throw himself upon his ********* suddenly a shot resounded without a cry was heard and then this was succeeded by rapid firing mingled with hoofstrokes in the immediate vicinity of the house darke rose to his feet and in two strides was at the window an attack he exclaimed can the friends of this ******* be trying to catch me and springing toward the door he tore it open suddenly another thought seemed to come to him returning at a bound to the side of swartz he seized him by the throat dragged him through the door and rushed down the steps still dragging the unfortunate man as he passed me i drew my revolver and fired on him but the ball did not strike him then i saw the woman dart past like a shadow when nighthawk and myself reached the foot of the stairs she and darke were already in the saddle the collar of swartz was still in his clutch he seemed determined to bear him off at the risk of being himself captured for a second glance showed me that a party of confederate cavalry was rushing headlong toward the house led by an officer whom i made out to be mohun darke saw that the small force on picket could not contend with the attacking party by the starlight i could see his face as he glared over his shoulder at mohun whom he had evidently recognized an expression of profound hate was in that glance a hoarse growl issued from his lips and i distinguished the low words addressed to swartz whom he was dragging on beside his horse so you are rescued you think you have laid this trap for me ******** he drew his pistol as he spoke and placed it close to the unhappy mans temple i had mine in my hand and aiming at darke fired it was too late the bullet did not strike him and the report of his own weapon followed that of mine like an echo swartz staggered back threw up his hands and uttering a wild cry fell at full length upon the ground the scene which followed was as brief as this tragedy mohun charged at the head of his men and drove the picket force before him in five minutes the whole party were dispersed or captured darke had escaped with the gray woman in the darkness the pursuit did not continue far the federal lines were near and mohun soon recalled his men grasping me cordially by the hand he exclaimed well surry the prisoner where is swartz i pointed to the spot where his body lay and went thither with mohun swartz lay perfectly dead in a pool of blood darke had blown out his brains an hour afterward the body of the unfortunate man had been buried and i had returned with mohun and nighthawk to the opposite bank of the rowanty i had never seen mohun so gloomy he scarcely uttered a word during the whole march back and when i announced my intention to spend the night at the house of mr alibi as the long tramp had wearied me out he scarcely invited me to his headquarters and when i declined did not urge me something evidently weighed heavily on the mind of mohun and a few moments reflection explained the whole to me he had conversed rapidly and apart with nighthawk near the lonely house and his gloom had dated from that conversation nighthawk had evidently explained every thing the cause of swartzs imprisonment his statement in reference to the ******** now that swartz was dead the hidingplace of the document seemed forever ************** if the reader does not understand the terrible significance of this fact and mohuns consequent gloom i promise that he shall comprehend all before very long mohun returned to his camp and i remained at the house of mr alibi until morning stretched on a lounge and wrapped in my cape i awoke about sunrise as i opened my eyes quick firing came from the direction of burgesss mill the fire speedily became more rapid and continuous i hastened to mount my horse and as i did so a courier passed at full gallop what news i asked the enemy are advancing in force they have crossed where near armstrongs and the courier disappeared at full speed in the woods in a moment i had abandoned my design of inspecting and was riding back armstrongs was a mill on the rowanty near the boydton road if the enemy had crossed there in force it was to make a heavy advance toward the southside road i was not mistaken reaching the *********** of the quaker road i found the cavalry drawn up in order of ******* dispatch had been sent to hurry up the ****** the lower waters of the rowanty and general hampton informed me of the situation of affairs the enemy had advanced in heavy force at sunrise driven in the pickets and crossing the rowanty seized on the boydton road and the bridge at burgesss mill from prisoners taken it was ascertained that the force consisted of the second fifth and part of the ninth corps grant meade and hancock accompanying the troops in person that left nothing in doubt if any remained it was dispelled by the fact stated to me by general hampton that the federal troops had eight days rations and were certainly bound for the southside road i had scarcely received this intelligence from general hampton when a heavy attack was made upon general william hf lee holding the quaker road from that moment the battle began to rage with determined fury and the entire force of cavalry was engaged in an obstinate fight with the advancing enemy it was a bitter and savage affair the men charged dismounted and fought behind impromptu breastworks of rails fell back only when they were pushed by the weight of the great column rolling forward and for hours the whole field was a hurlyburly of dust smoke blood uproar carbine shots musket shots and the long threatening roar of cannon the stuart horse artillery fought like tigers the men stuck to their guns amid a storm of bullets and vindicated as they had done before on many fields the name of my pets given them by stuart among the officers will davenant was seen sitting his horse amid the smoke as calm as a may morning and i shall never forget the smile on the face of this young bulldog when he said i think we can hold our ground colonel and looking over his shoulder in the direction of five forks he murmured this is a good place to die too a thundering cheer rose suddenly above the roar of the guns and the line of dismounted sharpshooters behind their rail breastworks opened a more steady and resolute fire as the enemy appeared to pause at the same moment young preston hampton a son of the general and one of my favorites from his courage and courtesy passed by at a gallop cheering and encouraging the skirmishers i spurred after him just as i reached him i saw the arm waving above his head suddenly drop his sword escaped from his grasp and he fell from the saddle to the ground in an instant i had dismounted and with other officers who hastened up had raised him from the earth as we did so the group consisting now of no less than seven attracted the enemys attention a hot fire was opened on us and before we could bear the dying youth in our arms beyond the reach of the fire four out of the seven officers were shot the boy was placed in an ambulance and borne to the rear but the wound was fatal and he soon afterward expired a staff officer afterward informed me that general hampton did not leave his tent for a ***************** replying when he was spoken to and prostrated by grief i could understand that the death of the brave youth sent a pang to my own ******** he was only my friend the great heart of the father must have been nearly broken so fell preston hampton peace to his ashes no kinder or braver spirit ever died for his country hour after hour the battle continued to rage the enemy making resolute attempts to brush off the cavalry it was now discovered that hancocks corps had crossed the rowanty supported by crawfords division with two corps behind and as general hancock held the bridge at burgesss there seemed little probability that lee could cross a force to attack him but this was done while the cavalry fought the blue masses with obstinate courage on the boydton road mahone that daring soldier crossed a column of three brigades over the rowanty below burgesss and suddenly the enemy found themselves attacked in flank and rear mahone did not pause he advanced straight to the assault swept every thing before him and thrusting his small force in between hancock and crawford tore from the former four hundred prisoners three battleflags and six pieces of artillery the assault had been sudden and almost overwhelming while hotly engaged with hampton in front the enemy had all at once staggered beneath the heavy blow dealt on their flank and rear they turned to strike at this new foe and the shock which followed was rude the onset bloody mahone met it with that dash and stubbornness now proverbial in the army and hurling his three brigades against the advancing column broke through three lines of battle and drove them back night was near and the fighting still continued the enemy seemed both to give up the ground and were holding their position obstinately when a determined charge from a brigade of mahones drove every thing in its front i had been to carry a message for general hampton upon whose staff i served during the battle and now found myself swept forward by the brigade charging in front of them i recognized general davenant on horseback and sword in hand leading the charge his son charley was beside him we are driving them colonel exclaimed the general with a proud smile and look yonder are some of their general officers flying from that house as he spoke he pointed to three horsemen riding at full speed from a house known as burgesss their splendid suit of staff officers indicated that they were of high rank in fact the three horsemen who retired thus hastily would have proved a rich prize to us they were generals grant meade and hancock they made a narrow escape and the question suggests itself what would have been the result of their capture i know not i only know that grant meade and hancock came near having an interview with general lee that ****** peaceful and friendly talk at his headquarters i did not think of all this then the hot charge dragged me i had come to participate in it by the mere chance of ********* this apparent accident was destined to have very singular results i had ridden with general davenant as his brigade swept forward and we were breasting a heavy fire on his front when a sudden cry of cavalry look out came from our left general davenant wheeled his horse went at full speed accompanied by his son and myself through the bullets in the direction indicated and carried onward by his animal as i was by my own rode right into a column of blue cavalry advancing to attack our flank such was the chance of battle at one moment general davenant was in command of a brigade which was driving the enemy and sweeping every thing before it at the next moment he had been carried by the powerful animal which he ******** straight into the ranks of the federal cavalry hidden by the woods and approaching *********** been surrounded in an instant fired upon and half dragged from his saddle and captured together with his son charley what was still more unfortunate to me personally was the fact that having followed the old soldier i was surrounded and made a prisoner in the same manner we had scarcely time to realize the truly disgusting fact that we were captured at the very instant that the enemy were being driven when the charge of the federal cavalry was met by a hailstorm of bullets which drove them back in disorder for some moments the woods presented a singular spectacle horsemen flying in wild confusion riderless animals darting madly toward the rear the groans of wounded men tottering in the saddle as they rushed ***** this made up a wild scene of excitement and confusion worse confounded general davenant his son and myself had been ordered to the rear under escort and the old cavalier had turned his horses head in that direction boiling with rage at his capture when the repulse ensued and the federal cavalry streamed by us toward the rear all at once a loud voice was heard shouting in the half darkness halt halt you cursed cowards halt and form column the speaker rushed toward us as he spoke mounted upon a huge black horse and i heard the noise made by his sabre as with the flat of it he struck blows upon the brawny shoulders of the fugitives at his summons and the blows of his sabre the men halted and again fell into column under the shadowy boughs of the woods and in the gathering darkness the long line of horsemen resembled phantoms rather than men near them glimmered some bivouac fires and the flickering light illumined their persons gleamed on their ********* and lit up the rough bearded faces cowardly scoundrels exclaimed their leader in fierce accents where are the prisoners that ran into us here colonel one is a general said a man let me see them general davenant struck the spur violently into his horse and rode close to the federal officer in whom i had recognized colonel darke here i am ********** at me exclaimed general davenant foaming with rage accursed be the day when i ***** a murderer and a renegade darkes hand unconsciously drew the rein and man and horse both seemed to stagger back before the furious old soldier *************** muttered darke turning pale yes general ********* gentleman an honest man not a traitor and a murderer good god muttered darke it is my father ******** my little brother the proud face the eyes the ******** yet they told me you were killed ah killed killing is a favorite topic with you exclaimed general davenant furiously well kill me ********* your ********* sword or your knife if you have one straight into my breast murder me i say as you murdered george ******* have a purse in my pocket and you can rob me when i am dead strike ********* not with the sword that is the weapon of a gentleman draw your knife and stab me in the ******* knife is the weapon of the assassin and crossing his arms upon his breast the fiery old cavalier confronted his son with eyes full of bitter wrath and *********** which i shall never forget for their fire burnt them into my memory darke did not dare to meet them i had listened with amazement to those words which indicated that the federal officer was general davenants son then this sentiment of astonishment profound as it was had yielded to one of expectation if i may so express myself what i expected was a furious outbreak from the man of fierce and violent passions thus taunted and driven to bay by the repeated insults of the general no outburst came however on the contrary the federal officer bowed his head and listened in silence while a mortal pallor diffused itself over his swarthy face his gaze was bent upon the ground and his brows so closely knit that they extended in an unbroken ridge of black and shaggy hair above his bloodshot eyes he sat his horse in the light of the ********* huge cavalier upon an animal as powerful and forbidding in appearance as ********** for more than a minute after the scornful outburst from general davenant darke remained silent and motionless with his eyes still fixed upon the ground then he raised his head made a sign with his hand to an officer and said briefly move back with the *********** these prisoners here at the word the column moved back slowly the shadowy figures were lost sight of in the darkness general davenant his son charles darke and myself were left alone beside the

the same low tone with a deeper flush in his cheeks draw your sword ********* me if you think proper for myself i am done with murder and shrink from it so that if my father wishes to kill me i will

resist if you plunge your sword into my heart strike strike while i am dying i will have time to say the few words i have to say to you general davenant shuddered with wrath still but a strange

and added in accents full of vehement and sullen passion strike me bury your swords point in my heart i am your son you are as noble a gentleman as ****** was kill me then i am a murderer but i am a davenant and no coward from the fierce and swollen face in which the dark eyes burned like ********** my glance passed to the countenance of general davenant a startling change had taken place in the expression of the old cavalier he was no longer erect fiery defiant his glance no longer darted scorn and anger his chin had fallen upon his breast his frame drooped his cheeks but now so flushed were covered with a deep pallor for a moment he remained silent the hand which had clutched at the sword hilt hung listless at his side all at once his breast heaved and with a sound which resembled a groan he said in low tones i am punished yes my hatred has brought forth fruit and the fruit is bitter it was i who warped this life and the tree has grown as i inclined it yes said darke in his deep voice first ********** when cut down cast off and forgotten general davenant looked at the speaker with bitter melancholy ah you charge me with that do you sir he said you do not remember then that i

character was forming you sneer and say that i first hated george conway and that the son only inherited the family feud and struck the enemy of the family yes i acknowledge those sins i pray daily to be forgiven for them i have borne for ten years this bitter load of dishonor but there is something more maddening even than my faults and the stain on my ****** is to be taunted to my face here with the charge that i struck that blow that i made you the criminal and then threw you off and drove you to become a renegade in the ranks of our enemies the last words of the speaker were nearly drowned in a heavy fusillade which issued from the woods close by listen exclaimed general davenant that is the fire of your ********* sir directed at the hearts of your brethren you are leading that scum

i was on my way to petersburg the enemy were already falling back from their adventurous attempt to seize the southside road in the morning they had retired across the rowanty and disappeared so ended that heavy blow at lees great ********* i was again back at the cedars after the rapid and shifting scenes which i have endeavored to place before the reader the tragic incidents ********* the actors in this drama had most absorbed my attention but sitting now in my tent with the newspapers before me i looked at the fight in which i had participated from the general and historic point of view that heavy advance on the boydton road beyond lees right had been simultaneous with a determined assault on the confederate left north of james river and on lees centre opposite petersburg and now the extracts from northern journals clearly indicated that the movement was meant to be decisive i have richmond by the throat general grant had telegraphed but there was good ground to believe that the heavy attack and the eloquent dispatch were both meant to make capital for the approaching presidential election these memoirs my dear reader are written chiefly to record some incidents which i witnessed during the war i have neither time nor space for political comments but i laid my hand yesterday by accident on an old number of the examiner newspaper and it chanced to contain an editorial on the fight just described with some penetrating views on the situation at that time shall i quote a paragraph from the yellow old paper it will be ******** were all bitter in those days though today

around the campfire rose a song another followed then another in the richest tenor and the forests of dinwiddie rang with the deep voices rising clear and sonorous in the moonlight night they were old songs of ashby and stuart *********** ditties of the struggle which the winds have borne away into the night of the past and which now live only in memory there was one of ashby commencing see him

the singers had fought under ashby and in their rude and plaintive song they uttered their regrets then the music changed its character and the stirring replaced the sad if you want to have a good

i rode beside them i saw a crimson glare shoot up above the woods in the direction of the weldon railroad the firing had meanwhile grown heavier and the guns were rushed onward will davenants whole appearance had completely changed the youth so retiring in camp so cool in a hot fight seemed burnt up with impatience at the delay caused by the terrible roads his voice had become hoarse and

which made the traces crack to drag the piece out of the hole and onward a glance told me then what was the secret of this mere boys splendid efficiency under the shy blushing face was the passion and will of the born ********** beardless boy had become the master mind and drove on every thing by his stern will in spite of every exertion to overcome the obstacles in the roads it was nearly sunrise before we reached open ground then we emerged upon the upland near disaways and saw a picturesque spectacle from the hill we could make out every thing a hot cavalry fight was going on beneath us the enemy had evidently crossed the rowanty lower down and driving in the pickets had passed forward to the railroad the guns were rushed toward the spot unlimbered on a rising ground and their thunder rose suddenly above the forests shell after shell burst amid the enemy breaking their ranks and driving them ******* by the time i had galloped through a belt of woods to the scene of the fight they lost heart retreated rapidly and disappeared driven across the rowanty again with the confederates pursuing them so hotly that many of the gray cavalry ******* them in the back with their empty carbines their object in crossing had been to burn a small mill and in this they had succeeded after which they retired as soon as possible to their own side some queer scenes had accompanied this tremendous military movement in a house near the mill resided some ladies and we found them justly indignant at the course of the enemy the federal *************** *********** ordered the ************** to be piled up the carriage to be drawn into the pile and then shavings were heaped around and the whole set on fire amid shouts cheers and firing the lady of the mansion remonstrated bitterly but received little satisfaction i have no time to listen to women said the federal general rudely it is not time that you want sir returned the lady with great hauteur it is politeness this greatly enraged the person whom she addressed and he became furious when the lady added that all the horses had been sent away at that moment an officer near him said general if you are going to burn the premises you had better commence as the rebs are pursuing us order it to be done at once was the gruff reply and the mill was fired in the midst of a great uproar with which mingled shouts of the rebels are coming the rebels are coming soon they came a hot fight followed and during this fight a young woman watched it holding her little brother by the hand near the burning mill i had afterward the honor of making her acquaintance and she told me that throughout the firing she found herself repeating over and over unconsciously the lines of the song charge stuart pay off ashbys score in stonewall jacksons way the enemy had thus effected their object and retreated hotly pursued i followed toward the lower rowanty and had the pleasure of seeing them hurried over so ended this immense military movement i was about to turn my horse and ride back from the stream across which the enemy had disappeared when all at once mohun who had led the pursuit rode up to me and we exchanged a cordial greeting well this little affair is over my dear surry he said have you any thing to occupy you for two or three hours nothing entirely at your service mohun well i wish you to accompany me on a private expedition will you follow me blindfold *********** and i rode on beside mohun who had struck into a path along the banks of the rowanty leading back in the direction of halifax bridge as we rode on i looked attentively at him i scarcely recognized in the personage beside me the mohun of the past his gloom so profound on that night when i parted with him after the expedition to the lonely house beyond monks neck had entirely disappeared and i saw in him as few traces of the days on the rappahannock in pennsylvania and the wilderness these progressive steps in the development of mohuns character may be indicated by ******* them the first second and third phases of the individual he had entered now upon the third phase and i compared him curiously with his former self on the rappahannock when i saw him first mohun had been cynical bitter full of gloomy *********** something seemed to have hardened him and made him hate his species in the bloom of early manhood when his life was yet in the flower and should have prompted him to all kind and sweet emotions he was a stranger to ***** charity goodwill friendship all that makes life endurable the tree was young and lusty the spring was not over freshness and verdure should have clothed it and yet it appeared to have been blasted what had dried up its *** i asked *************** and destroying it what thunderbolt had struck this sturdy young oak i could not ********* from the first moment of our acquaintance mohun became for me a problem then the second phase presented itself when i met him in the wilderness in may 1864 a great change had come over him he was no longer bitter and cynical the cloud had plainly swept away leaving the skies of his life brighter gayety had succeeded gloom the rollicking enjoyment of the true cavalryman had replaced the recklessness of the ******** again i looked at him with ************ his courage had made me admire him and his hidden grief had aroused my sympathy a great weight had plainly been lifted from his shoulders he breathed freer the *** long dried up had begun to flow again and the buds told that the leaves of youth and hope were about to reappear what was the meaning of that now the third phase of the man had come to excite in me more surprise and interest than the former ones this time the change was complete mohun seemed no longer himself was the man riding beside me the old mohun of 1863 where was the gloomy **************** the rollicking humor they had quite disappeared mohuns glance was gentle and his countenance filled with a charming modesty and sweetness his voice once so cold and then so ********* had grown calm low measured almost soft his smile was exquisitely cordial his glance full of earnestness and sweetness the ********** spirit of ************ balm for all the wounds of human ************** in his eyes on his lips in every accent of his voice colonel mohun had been reckless defiant unhappy or wildly gay general mohun was calm quietly happy it seemed you would have said of him formerly this is a man who fights from hatred of his enemies or the exuberant life in him now you would have said this is a patriot who fights from principle and is worthy to die in a great cause what had worked this change i asked myself once more was it love or was it the conviction which the almighty sends to the most hardened that life is not made to indulge hatred but to love and perform our duty in i knew not but there was the phenomenon before me mohun was certainly a new man and looked on life and the world around him with a gentleness and kindness of which i had believed him incapable i am going to take you to see a somewhat singular character he said who is he it is a woman ah and a very strange one i promise you my dear surry lead on ill follow thee good and i declare to you i think shakespeare would have examined this human being with attention she is a phenomenon then yes a witch no an ********* at least i think so indeed and where does she live on the halifax road some miles from the rowanty in the lines of the enemy then something like it humph dont disturb yourself about that surry i have sent out a scouting party who are clearing the country their pickets are back to reamss by this time and there is little danger at all events well share any mohun forward and we pushed on to the halifax bridge where as mohun expected there was no federal picket the ******* long rough ********* been half destroyed by general hampton but we forded near it pushed our horses through the swamp amid the heavy tree trunks felled to form an abatis and gaining the opposite bank of the rowanty rode on rapidly in the direction of petersburg that is to say toward the rear of the federal army half an hours ride through the swampy low grounds rising to gentle uplands and beneath the festoons of the great vines trailing from tree to tree brought us in front of a small house half buried in a clump of bushes like a hares nest amid brambles we have arrived said mohun leading the way to the cabin which we soon reached throwing his bridle over a bough near the low fence mohun approached the door on foot i following and when close to the door he gave a low knock come in said a cheerful and smiling voice and mohun opened the door through which we passed into a small and very neat apartment containing a table some chairs a wide fireplace in which some sticks were burning a number of cheap engravings of religious scenes framed and hanging on the wall and a low bed upon which lay a woman fully dressed she was apparently about thirtyfive and her appearance was exceedingly curious her figure was slender and of medium height her complexion that of a ******* or oriental woman rather than that of the ******** which she appeared to be her hair black waving and abundant her eyes as dark and sparkling as burnished ebony and her teeth of dazzling whiteness her dress was neat and of bright colors around her neck she wore a very odd necklace which seemed made of carved bone and her slender fingers were decorated with a number of rings such was the personage who greeted us in a voice of great calmness and sweetness as we entered she did not rise from the bed upon which she was lying but her cordial smile clearly indicated that this did not arise from *********** take seats gentlemen she said and please excuse me from getting up i am a little poorly today stay where you are amanda said mohun and do not disturb yourself she looked at him with her dark eyes and said in her gentle friendly voice you know me i see general mohun and you me i see amanda i never saw you before sir ***** i mistaken not in the least how did you know me the singular amanda smiled i have seen you often sir **** your visions yes sir or perhaps nighthawk described me you know mr nighthawk oh yes sir i hope he is well he has often been here he may have told me what you were like sir and then i saw you to know you afterward i looked at the speaker attentively was she an impostor it was impossible to think so there was absolutely no evidence whatever that she was acting a ********** every thing to forbid the supposition as she thus readily acquiesced in mohuns simple explanation for some moments mohun remained silent then he said those visions which you have are very strange is it possible that you really see things before they come to ****** are you only amusing yourself and others by saying so i see no especial harm in the matter if you are jesting but tell me for my own satisfaction and that of my friend if you really see things amanda smiled with ********** sweetness i am in earnest sir she said and i would not jest with you and colonel surry i listened in astonishment ah you know me too amanda yes ***** i think i do i think you are colonel surry sir how do you know that i have seen you too sir was the smiling reply i sat down leaned my head upon my hand and gazed at this incomprehensible being was she really a witch i do not believe in witches and at once rejected that theory if not an impostor then only one other theory ************ nighthawk had described my person to her in the same manner that he had mohuns and the woman might thus believe that she had seen me as well as my companion in her visions to her last words however i made no reply and mohun renewed the colloquy as before then you are really in earnest amanda and actually see in vision what is coming to pass he said i think i do sir do you have the visions often i did once sir but they now ******** come what produces them i think it is any excitement sir they tell me that i lay on my bed moaning and moving my arms ******** when i wake after these attacks i remember seeing the visions i hear that you predicted general hunters attack on lexington last june yes sir i told a lady what i saw some months before it came to pass what did you see will you repeat it for us oh yes sir i remember all and will tell you about it as it seems to interest you i saw a town on the other side of the mountain which they afterward told me was called ************ i did not know its name ******* a great army of men in blue dresses came marching in shouting and cheering the next thing i saw was a large building on fire and through the windows i saw books burning with some ************** things of which i do not know the names the military institute with the books and scientific apparatus said mohun calmly was it sir i did not know what did you see afterward amanda another house burning sir the federal people gave the ladies ten minutes to leave it and then set it on fire mohun glanced at me that is strange he said do you know the name of the family no sir it was governor letchers well what next then they went in a great crowd and broke open another ********* large house ****** took every thing among the things they took was a statue which they did not break up but carried away with them washingtons statue murmured mohun and turning to me he added this is curious is it not surry i nodded very curious i confess i believed that the strange woman was trifling with us and had simply made up this story after the event mohun saw my incredulity and said in a low tone you do not believe in this no i returned in the same tone and yet one thing is remarkable what that a lady of the highest character assured me the other day that all this was related to her before hunter even entered the valley and turning to amanda he said when did you see these things i think it was in march sir the words were uttered in the simplest manner possible the strange woman smiled as sweetly as she spoke and seemed as far from being guilty of a deliberate ********* as before and you saw the fight at reamss too yes sir i saw it two months before it took place there was a man killed running through the yard of a house and they told me afterward he was found dead there have you had any visions since only one sir lately yes sir what did you see it was not much sir i saw the federal people on horses watering their horses in a large river somewhere west of here and the vision said the war would be over about next march mohun smiled which side will be successful amanda the vision did not say sir mohun who had taken his seat on a rude ****** leaned his elbow on his knee and for some moments gazed into the fire i have asked you some questions amanda he said at length relating to public events i now come to some private ************ which brought me ******** which your singular visions may probably assist me are you willing to help me yes indeed sir if i can was the reply mohun fixed his mild and yet penetrating glance upon the singular woman who sustained it however with no change in her calm and smiling expression you know nighthawk oh yes sir he has been here often and swartz very well **** have known him many years have you seen him lately no sir not for some weeks ah you saw him some weeks since yes sir at this house yes sir do you know what has become of him no sir but i suppose he is off somewhere he is dead her head rose slightly but the smile was unchanged you dont tell me sir yes murdered perhaps you know his murderer who was it sir colonel darke oh i know him he has been here lately poor mr swartz and so they murdered him i am sorry for him mohuns glance became more penetrating you say that colonel darke has been here lately yes sir what was the occasion of his visit i dont know sir unless it was to hear me tell my visions you never knew him before amanda hesitated yes sir she said at length when and how it was many years ago **** do not like to speak of these things he is a terrible man they say you can speak to me amanda i will repeat nothing nor will colonel surry the singular woman looked from mohun to me evidently hesitating then she seemed suddenly to make up her mind and said with her eternal smile i will tell you then sir i can read faces and i know neither you nor colonel surry will get me into trouble i will ***** my honor nor i i said that is enough gentlemen and now i will tell you what you wish to know general mohun as she spoke she closed her eyes and seemed for some moments to be reflecting then opening them again she gazed with her calm smile at mohun and said it was many years ago sir when i first saw colonel darke who then went by another name i was living in this same house when late one evening a light carriage stopped before the door and a gentleman got out of it and came in he said he was travelling with his wife who had been taken sick and would i give them shelter until morning when she would be able to go on i was a poor woman sir as i am now and hoped to be paid i would have given the poor sick lady shelter all the same ********* i told him he could come in and sleep in this room and i would go into that ********** place behind you sir well he thanked me and went back to the carriage where a lady sat he took her in his arms and brought her along to the house when i saw that she was a very beautiful young lady but quite pale well sir she came in and sat down in that chair you are now sitting in and after awhile said she was better the gentleman had gone out and put away his horse and when he came back i had supper ready and every thing comfortable what was the appearance of the lady said mohun over whose brow a contraction passed she was small and dark sir but had the finest eyes i ever saw the same said mohun in a low tone well they stayed all night sir next morning they paid ******** it was ********* went on toward the south they seemed poor yes sir the ladys dress was cheap and ******** the gentlemans threadbare what names did they give mr and mrs mortimer sir mohuns brow again contracted well go on he said or rather go back amanda you say that they remained with you until the morning did you not hear some of their **************** some knowledge of whence they came whither they were going and what was the object of their journey the woman hesitated glancing at mohun then she smiled and shook her head you will get me into trouble sir she said i will not upon my honor you have told me enough to enable me to do so ********** not tell me all you say you slept in that closet ******* you must have heard them converse i am entitled to know ******* me what they said and taking from his purse a piece of gold mohun placed it in the hand extended upon the bed the hand closed upon ********** it the eye of the woman glittered and i saw that she had determined to speak it was not much sir she said i did listen and heard many things but they would not interest you on the contrary they will interest me much it was a sort of quarrel i overheard sir mr mortimer was ******* his wife for something and said she had brought him to misery she replied in the same way and said that it was a strange thing in him to talk to her so when she had broken every law of god and man to marry the the mohun repeated bending forward the murderer of her father she said sir returned amanda mohun started and looked with a strange expression at me you understand he said in a low tone is the thing credible let us hear more i said gloomy in spite of myself go on mohun said turning more calmly toward the woman that was the reply of the lady ******** she had broken all the laws of god and man by marrying the murderer of her father did she utter the name of her father yes sir what was it a mr george conway replied amanda who seemed to feel that she had gone too far to conceal any thing and the reason for this marriage said mohun in a low tone did she explain or say any thing which explained to you how such a union had ever taken place yes sir they said so many things to each other that i came to know all the young lady was a daughter of a mr george conway and when she was a girl had fallen in love with some worthless young man who had persuaded her to ***** with him and get married he soon deserted her when she fell in with this mr mortimer and married him did she know that he was her fathers murderer no ****** until after their marriage i gathered then said mohun who had suppressed all indications of emotion and was listening coolly then it seems to me that she was wrong in taking shame to ********* claiming ********* the marriage yes sir returned amanda and he told her as much so they had something like a quarrel not exactly a quarrel sir he seemed to love her with all his ********* than she loved him they went on talking and laying plans to make money in some way i remember he said to her you are sick and need every ******* would rather die than see you deprived of ***** would cheat or rob to supply you every thingand we must think of some means honest or ********* to get the money we want i do not care for myself but you are all that i have left in the world that is what he said sir and amanda was silent then they fell asleep asked mohun yes sir and on the next morning he took her in his arms again and carried her to the carriage and they left me mohun leaned his chin upon his hand knit his brows and reflected the singular narrative plunged me too into a reverie this man darke was a veritable gulf of ********** life full of hidden and inexplicable things the son of general davenant he had murdered his fathers foe permitted that father to be tried for the crime and to remain under suspicion disappeared changed his name encountered the daughter of his victim married her had those mysterious dealings with mohun disappeared a second time changed his name a second time and now had once more made his appearance near the scene of his first crime to murder swartz capture his father and brother and complete his tragic record by fighting under the enemys flag against his country and his family there was something diabolical in that career in this mans life deep under deep met the eye and yet he was not entirely bad on that night in pennsylvania he had refused to strike mohun at a *************** had borne off the gray woman at the peril of death or capture he had released his captured father and brother bowing his head before them he had confessed the murder of george conway over his own signature to save this father the woman who was his ********** he seemed to love more than his own life such were the extraordinary contrasts in a character which at first sight seemed entirely devilish and i reflected with absorbing interest upon the singular phenomenon i was aroused by the voice of mohun he had never appeared more calm in his deep tones i could discern no emotion whatever that is a singular story he said and your friend colonel darke is a curious personage but let us come back to events more ******** the visits of swartz yes sir said amanda smiling but first let me ****** colonel darke recognize you you mean know me oh yes sir and did he speak of his former ********* his wife no sir and you amanda smiled i made out i didnt remember him sir i was afraid he would think i had overheard that talk with his wife so he simply called as if to see you as a curiosity yes ****** staid only a few minutes but you know or rather knew poor swartz better i knew him well sir he often stopped here yes sir mohun looked at the woman keenly and said i wish you now to answer plainly the question which i am about to ask i come hither as a ******* am sent by your friend mr nighthawk listen and answer ********** you know any thing of a paper which swartz had in his ************ important paper which he was guarding from colonel darke i do not sir said amanda with her eternal smile for that paper i will pay a thousand dollars in gold where is it the womans eyes glittered then she shook her head on my salvation i do not know sir can you discover again the shake of the head how can i sir mohuns head sank a bitter sigh issued from his ********** a groan listen he said almost fiercely but with a singular smile you have ********** see things i do not believe in your *********** seem ******** only see where that paper is to be discovered and i will believe nay more i will pay you the sum which i mentioned this moment i looked at the woman to witness the result of this decisive test of her sincerity if she believes in her own visions she will be elated i said if she is an impostor she will be cast down she smiled radiantly i will try sir she said mohun gazed at her strangely when shall i come to hear the result in ten days from this time sir in ten days so be it and rising mohun bade the singular personage farewell and went toward his horse i followed and we rode back rapidly in dead silence toward the rowanty mohun rode on for more than a mile at full gallop without uttering a word then he turned his head and said with a sigh well what do you think of your new acquaintance surry i think she is an impostor as to her visions you mean yes her story of darke i believe to be true and i know it returned mohun a strange discovery is it not i went there today without dreaming of this nighthawk informed me that swartz had often been at the house of this ********* the paper which i wish to secure might have been left with her for safe ********** thus i determined to go and ****** out the matter in a personal interview i have done so pretty thoroughly and it seems plain that she knows nothing of its present whereabouts will she discover through her ********** ******* her strange penetration exhibited in the recognition of our persons i know not and so that matter ends i have failed and yet have learned some singular facts can you believe that strange story of darke is he not a weird personage this narrative we have just heard puts the finishing touch to his ********** murderer marries the daughter of his victim it is truly an extraordinary history altogether i said and the whole life of this man is now known to me with a single exception ah you mean the period when you fought with him and ran him through the body and threw him into that grave from which swartz afterward rescued him on the morning of the 13th december 1856 mohun looked at me with that clear and penetrating glance which characterized him ah you know that he said i could not fail to know it mohun ******* to think that all this time you have perhaps regarded me as a criminal surry but i am ******* is i ***** intent if not in reality yes my dear friend mohun added with a deep sigh his head sinking upon his breast there was a day in my life when i was insane a simple ********* on that day i attempted to commit murder and suicide you have strangely come to catch many glimpses of those past horrors on the rappahannock the words of that woman must have startled you in the wilderness my colloquy with the spy revealed more lastly the words of darke on the night of swartzs murder must have terribly complicated me in this issue of horrors i knew that you must know much and i did not shrink before you surry do you know why because i have repented friend and thank god my evil passions did not result as i intended in murder and selfdestruction mohun passed his hand across his forehead to wipe away the drops of cold perspiration all this is gloomy and tragic he said and yet i must inflict it on you surry even more i earnestly long to tell you the whole story of which you have caught these glimpses will you listen it will not be long i wish to show you my dear ********* are that to me ********* i am not unworthy of your regard that there are no degrading scenes at least in my past life that i have not cheated ******* ************ if i have attempted to destroy myself and others will you listen i have been waiting long to do so mohun i said speak but first hear me there is a man in this army who is the soul of honor since my fathers death i value his good opinion more than that of all ******** is robert e lee well come with me if you choose and i will go to lee with you and place my hand upon your shoulder and say general this is my friend i vouch for him i am proud of his regard think well of him or badly of me too are you satisfied mohun smiled sadly i knew all that he said do you think i can not read men surry long since i gave you in my heart the name of friend and i knew that you had done as much toward me come then go to my camp with me in the evening we will take a ride i am going to conduct you to a spot where we can talk without interruption the exact place where the crimes of which i shall speak were committed and ******** the gallop mohun led the way amid the trailing festoons through the fallen logs across the rowanty half an hour afterward we had reached his camp as the sun began to decline we again mounted our horses pushing on rapidly we reached a large house on a hill above the nottoway and entered the tall gateway at the moment when the great windows were all ablaze in the sunset mohun spurred up the hill reined in his horse in front of the great portico and dismounting fastened his bridle to the bough of a magnificent ****** one of a hundred which were scattered over the extensive grounds i imitated him and we entered the house together through the door which gave way at the first push no one had come to take our horses no one opposed our entrance the house was evidently deserted i looked round in astonishment and admiration in every thing ************ to the mansion were the indications of almost unlimited wealth directed by the severest and most elegant taste the broken furniture was heavy and elaborately carved the remnants of carpet of sumptuous velvet the walls ceiling ******** and deep windows were one mass of the richest ********** and most elaborate ************** on the walls still hung some faded portraits in the most costly frames on the ************ of variegated marble supported by fluted pillars with exquisitely carved capitals rested a full length picture of a gentleman the heavy gilt frame tarnished and crumbling the house was desolate deserted inexpressibly ********* from the evident contrast between its present and its past but about the grand mansion hung an august air of departed splendor which to me was more striking than if i had visited it in the days of its glory let me introduce fonthill to you or rather the remains of it surry mohun said with a sad smile it is not pleasant to bring a friend to so deserted a place but i have long been absent the house is gone to decay like other things in old virginia still we can probably find two chairs i will kindle a blaze and we can light a cigar and talk without interruption with these words mohun proceeded to the adjoining apartment from which he returned a moment afterward dragging two chairs with elaborately carved backs see he said with a smile they were handsome once that one with the ragged remnants of red velvet was my fathers take a seat my dear surry i will sit in the ******* was my mothers returning to the adjoining room mohun again reappeared this time bearing in his arms the broken remnants of a mahogany table which he heaped up in the great fireplace this is all that remains of our old family *********** he said some yankee or straggling soldier will probably use it for this ********* i anticipate them and placing ************ beneath the pile mohun had recourse to the metallic match case which he always carried with him in order to read dispatches lit the fuel and a blaze sprung up next he produced his cigar case offered me an excellent havana which i accepted and a minute afterward we were leaning back in the great chairs smoking an odd welcome this said mohun with his sad smile broken chairs old pictures and a fire made of ruined furniture but one thing we ****** uninterrupted opportunity to converse let us talk therefore or rather i will at once tell you what i promised mohun leaned back in his chair reflected for a moment with evident sadness and then with a deep sigh said i am about to relate to you my dear surry a history so singular that it is probable you will think i am indulging my fancy in certain portions of it that would be an injustice it is a true life i am about to lay before youand i need not add that actual occurrences are often more surprising than any due to the imagination of the romance writer i once knew a celebrated novelist and one day related to him the curious history of a family in virginia make a romance of that i said it is an actual history but my friend shook his head it will not answer my purpose he replied smiling it is too strange and the critics would call me a sensation ********** is ruin me and he was right surry it is only to a friend on some occasion like the present that i could tell my own story it is too singular to be believed otherwise but i am ******* let me proceed my family is an old one they tell me in this part of virginia and my father whose portrait you see before you on the mantelpiece was what is called an aristocrat that is to say he was a gentleman of refined tastes and habits fond of books a great admirer of fine paintings and a gentleman of social habits and feelings ************ old ******** been for many generations the scene of a profuse hospitality my father kept up the ancient rites entertaining all comers and when i

that time given way to rude passions it was not for wanting a good example in the ********* lives of this true gentleman and pure *********** unhappily i did not have their example long when i was seventeen my mother died and my father as though unable to live without her who had so long been his blessing followed her a year afterward leaving me the sole heir of the great possessions of the

but in spite of the presence of this true friend i was still lonely i craved life movement ********** this i promised myself to secure at the university of virginia to which i accordingly went

once to arouse me from my lethargy one day i was inert apathetic sluggish in my movements careless of all things and all persons around me on the next i was aroused excited with every nerve and

time she was called miss mortimer the commencement of our acquaintance was singular fate seemed to have decreed that all connected with our relations should be dramatic one night i was returning at full speed from the house of a gentleman in the neighborhood whither i had been to make a visit the night was as dark as a wolfs mouth and a violent storm rushed down upon me when i was still many miles from home i have scarcely ever witnessed a more furious tempest the thunder and lightning were fearful and i pushed my horse to his utmost speed to reach fonthill before the torrents of rain drenched me to the skin well i had entered the fonthill woods a mile or two from the house and was galloping at full speed through the black darkness which the lightning only occasionally illumined now when all at once my horse struck his chest against something i heard a cry and then a dazzling flash showed me a light carriage which had evidently just been overturned i was nearly ******** by the collision but leaped to the ground and at the same moment another flash showed me the form of a lady whom a man was extricating from the broken vehicle i hastened to render my assistance the lady was lifted in our arms and then i aided in raising the fallen horse who lay on his side frightened and kicking violently ten minutes afterward i was placed in possession of what the lawyers call the facts of the case mr mortimer of georgia was travelling home from the north with his sick sister in his carriage for the benefit of her health they had lost their way the storm had caught them their carriage had overturned in the ************* could mr mortimer obtain lodgings for the night the condition of his sister rendered it imperative that they should not continue their journey until morning even if the storm and broken vehicle permitted i listened and felt a warm sympathy for the poor sick ******* was only a girl of eighteen and very beautiful i would gladly have offered my own house but it was still some miles distant and the young woman was so weak and trembled so violently that it would plainly be impossible to conduct her so far on foot true my carriage might have been sent for her but the rain was now descending in torrents before it arrived she would be ***************** else must be thought of all at once the idea occurred to me parson hopes is only a quarter of a mile distant mr hope was the parson of the parish and a most excellent man i at once suggested to mr mortimer that his sister should be conducted thither and as he assented at once we half conducted half carried the poor girl through the woods to the humble dwelling of the clergyman the good parson received us in a manner which showed his conviction that to succor the stranger or the unfortunate is often to entertain angels unawares it is true that on this occasion it was something like a brace of devils whom he received into his mansion the young lady threw herself into a seat seemed to suffer much and was soon conducted by the parsons old ************** he was a childless ********* her chamber in which a fire had been quickly kindled she disappeared sighing faintly but in those few minutes i had taken a good look at her you have seen her and i need not describe her she is still of great beauty but at that time she was a wonder of loveliness slender graceful with a figure exquisitely shaped with rosy lips as ******* as an infants grand dark eyes which seemed to burn with an inner light as she looked at you such was miss mortimer at eighteen when i first saw her on that night in the fonthill woods an hour after the scene which i have tried to describe i was at home and seated in this apartment then very different in appearance reflected deeply upon this romantic encounter with the beautiful girl it was midnight before i retired i fell asleep thinking of her and the exquisite face still followed me in my dreams these few words tell you much do they not surry you no doubt begin to understand now when i have scarcely begun the real narrative what is going to be the character of the drama were i a romance writer i should call your attention to the fact that i have introduced my characters described their appearance and given you an inkling of the series of events which are about to be ******** before you a young man of twenty is commended to your attention a youth living in a great mansion lord of himself but tired of exercising that authority of violent passions but without an object and at that very moment presto appeared a lovely girl with dark eyes rosy lips whom the youth encounters and ******* under most romantic circumstances well the lord of himself acted in real life as he would have done in a novel in other words my dear surry i proceeded straightway to fall violently in love with miss mortimer and it is needless to say that on the next day my horse might have been seen standing at the rack of the parsonage i had gone you see as politeness required to ask how the young lady felt after her accident she was leaning back in an armchair reading a good book and looked charming the accident seemed to have greatly shocked the delicate frame of the young creature but when i entered she held out her hand greeting me with a fascinating smile mademoiselle was imitated by monsieur i mean mr mortimer i did not fancy the countenance of that gentleman much it was dark and forbidden but his manners were those of a person acquainted with good society he thanked me with effusion as the french say for my timely assistance on the night before and then he strolled forth with the good parson to look at the garden leaving me ******** with his sister why lengthen out my story by comment reflections a description of every scene and the progressive steps through which the affair passed i was in love with miss mortimer she saw it her eyes said love me as much as you choose and dont be afraid i will not love you soon in return at the end of this interview which the worthy mr mortimer did not interrupt for at least two hours i rode home thinking with a throb of the heart if she will only love me then the throb was succeeded by a sudden sinking of the same organ but there will be no opportunity i groaned doubtless in two or three days she will leave this part of the country a week afterward that apprehension had been completely removed miss mortimer was still faint and weak from her accident all her movements were slow and languid she had not left the good parsons house ******** what is more she was not going to leave it she had learned what she desired to know about me heard that i was a young man of great wealth and had devised a scheme so singular ******* let me not anticipate she proceeded rapidly in our second interview she made eyes at me in the third she blushed and murmured avoiding my glances when i looked at her in the fourth she blushed more deeply when i took her ******* did not withdraw it in the fifth the fair head in some manner had come to rest on my ********** doubt from weakness and in a few days afterward the shy embarrassed loving palpitating creature blushing deeply sunk upon my bosom as the poets say and murmured how can i resist you in other words my dear friend miss mortimer had promised to become my wife and i need not say i was the happiest of men i thought with rapture of the bliss i was about to enjoy in having by my side throughout life this charming creature i trembled at the very thought that the accident in the wood might not have happened and i might never have known her i was at the parsonage morning noon and night when not beside her i was riding through the forest at full speed with bared brow laughing lips and shouts of ***** a word my dear friend i was as much intoxicated as ever youth was yet and fed on froth and moonshine to an extent that was really astonishing there was absolutely nothing to oppose our marriage my old guardian it is true shook his head and suggested inquiries into the family position character etc of the ********* i was young wealthy heir of one of the oldest families he said and ******** might deceive me but all i heard was the word *********** i left my guardian whose functions had ceased now in high displeasure at his unworthy *********** that angel a sharper that pure devoted creature guilty of deception i fell into a rage swore never to visit my guardian again and returning to the parsonage urged a speedy consummation of our marriage the fair one was not loth she indicated that fact by violently opposing me at first but soon yielded when i rode home that night i had made every arrangement for our union in one month from that time so much for act i surry mohun had commenced his narrative in a mild voice and with an expression of great sadness upon his features as he proceeded however this all disappeared gradually the voice became harsh and metallic so to describe it and his face resumed that expression of cynical bitterness which i had observed in him on our first meeting as he returned thus to the past all its bitterness seemed to revive memory lashed him with its stinging whip and mohun had gone back to his first ********* of the man stern implacable and misanthropic after uttering the words so much for act i surry he paused a moment afterward however he resumed his narrative what i am now going to tell you is not agreeable to remember my dear surry and i shall accordingly relate every thing as briefly as possible i aim only to give you a clear conception of the tragedy you will form your own opinion i was ******** enough in introducing miss mortimer to you at the parsonage to describe that young lady as a devil no doubt the term shocked you and yet it conveyed something very like the exact truth i declare to you that this woman was and is still a marvel to me a most curious study how could she be such as she was she had the lips of an infant and the eyes of an angel was it not strange that under all that she should hide the heart of a born devil but to continue my narrative the month or two which elapsed between my engagement and my marriage was not an uninterrupted dream of bliss the atmosphere was strangely disturbed on more than one occasion mademoiselle was frequently absent from the parsonage when i arrived taking long walks with monsieur her brother and when she returned from these excursions i could see a very strange expression on her countenance as she looked at me occasionally her glance was like those lurid flashes of lightning which you may have seen issue from the depths of a black cloud her black eyes were the *********** the ********* i assure you their expression at such moments was far from agreeable what to make of it i knew not i am not constitutionally ********* but on more than one occasion i felt a strange angry throb of the heart when i encountered those glances mademoiselle saw my displeasure and hastened at once to soothe and ********* it the dark flash was always succeeded by the most brilliant sunshine but even in moments of her greatest apparent abandon i would still meet suddenly when she did not think i was looking at her the sombre glance which appalled me in spite of this strange phenomenon however the young girl possessed unbounded influence over me i could not resist her fascinations and was as wax in her hands she took a charming interest in all that concerned me painted the blissful future before us in all the colors of the rainbow and declared that the devotion of her whole life would not be sufficient to display her gratitude for my magnanimity in wedding a poor girl who had nothing but her warm love to offer me that is more than enough i said charmed by her caressing voice i have few relations and ********** are all to me and you to me she said then she added with a sort of shudder but suppose you were to die i laughed and replied you would be well provided for and find yourself a gay young widow with hundreds of beaux she looked at me reproachfully do you think i would ever marry again she said no i would take our marriage ring and some little souvenir connected with you leave your fine house and go with my brother to some poor home in a foreign country where the memory of our past happiness would be my solace i shook my head you will not do that i said you will be the mistress of all my fortune after my death oh no she exclaimed oh yes i responded laughing and to make every thing certain i am going to draw up my will this very day leaving you every thing which i possess in the world her face suddenly flushed how can you think of such a thing she said i did not know how much you loved me you will understand my dear surry that those words did not change my resolution when i left her i went home and wrote the will in due form and on my next visit she asked laughing if i had carried out my absurd resolution yes i said and now let us talk of a more interesting ********* marriage she blushed then turned pale and again i saw the strange lurid glance it disappeared however in an instant and she was all smiles and fascinations throughout the remainder of the day never had i been so happy as the day of our marriage approached continued mohun i saw more than once the same singular expression in the ladys eyes and i confess it chilled me she seemed to be the prey to singular moods and fits of silence she took more frequent and longer walks with mortimer than before when they returned from these walks and found me awaiting them at the parsonage both would look at me in the strangest way only to quickly withdraw their eyes when they caught my own fixed upon them i longed to speak of this curious phenomenon to some one but had no friend my best friend nighthawk was alienated from me and mademoiselle had been the cause from the first moment of our acquaintance nighthawk had seemed to suspect something he did not attempt to conceal his dislike of mortimer and the young lady why was that i could not tell your dog growls when the secret foe approaches you smiling and perhaps nighthawk my faithful ******** had something of the watch dog in him certain it is that he had witnessed my growing intimacy with miss mortimer with illconcealed ******** as i became more and more attentive he became almost sour toward me when i asked him the meaning of his singular deportment he shook his headand then with flushed cheeks and eyes exclaimed do not marry this young person sir something bad will come of it when he said that i looked at him with haughty *********** this sentiment changed in a few moments to cold anger leave this house i said and do not return until you have learned how to treat me with decent respect he looked at me for a moment clasped his hands opened his ********** about to burst forth into passionate *********** all at once shaking his head went out in silence i looked after him with a strange shrinking of the heart what could he mean he was ************ i mounted my horse galloped to the parsonage was received with radiant smiles and forgot the whole scene on the next day nighthawk did not ********* on the next i did not see him again until the evening of the day on which i was married to that ********** moment i have now conducted you my dear surry the morning for my marriage came i say the ********** my *********** as the ******* poets say had declared that she detested the idea of being married at night she also objected to ************ i not consent to have the ceremony performed quietly at the parsonage with no one present but her brother and the excellent parson hope and his old housekeeper then she would belong to mei could do as i pleased with ******* her to fonthill or where i ******** only begged that i would allow her to embark on the ocean of matrimony with no one to witness her ******* but myself her brother the old housekeeper and the good minister i consented at once the speech charmed me i need not ****** i was not myself unwilling to dispense with inquisitive eyes and laughing witnesses infatuated as i was i could not conceal from myself that my marriage was a hasty and extremely romantic affair i doubted whether the old friends of my father in the neighborhood would approve of it and now when mademoiselle gave me a good excuse to dispense with their presence i gladly assented invited no one and went to my wedding alone in the great family chariot unaccompanied by a single friend or relative mademoiselle met me with a radiant smile and her wedding dress of white silk made her look perfectly charming her lips were caressing her eyes melting but all at once as she looked at me i saw the color all fade out of the rosy lips of the lady and from the great dark eyes darted the lurid flash a chill like that of death smote me i know not why but i suppressed my emotion in ten minutes i was standing before the excellent clergyman the young ladys cold hand in ******* we were duly declared man and wife all my forebodings and strange ********** were completely dissipated at this instant i was overwhelmed with happiness and would not have envied a king upon his throne with the hand of the lovely creature in my own and her eyes fixed upon me with an expression of the deepest love i experienced but one *********** of full complete unalloyed happiness let me hasten on the storm is coming my dear surry i linger on the threshold of the tragedy and recoil even now with a sort of shudder from the terrible scenes which succeeded my marriage tragedy is a mild word as you will perceive for the drama it was going to surpass ************ preserve the greek ******* with frightful precision half an hour after the ceremony i led madam to my chariot followed her into the vehicle and making a last sign of greeting to the good parson directed the driver to proceed to fonthill madams excellent brother did not accompany us he declared his intention to remain on that night at the parsonage he would call at fonthill on the next ***** the day after he proposed to continue his way to georgia his eyes were not a pleasant spectacle as he uttered these words and i observed a singular pallor came to madams countenance but i was in no mood to ******* suspicion at the height of happiness i looked serenely down upon all the world and with the hand of my wife in my own was driven rapidly to fonthill we arrived in the afternoon and dined in state all alone madam did the honors of her table with exquisite grace but more than once i saw her hand shake in a very singular way as she carried food or a glass to her lips after dinner she bade me a smiling courtesy leaving me to find company in my cigar she said and tripped off to her chamber well i lit my cigar retired to the library and seating myself in an armchair before the fire began to reflect it was nearly the middle of december and through the opening in the curtains i could see the moonlight on the chill expanse of the lawn i had just taken my seat when i heard a step in the passage the door of the library opened and nighthawk as pale as a ghost and with a strange expression in his eyes entered the apartment i had recognized his step continued mohun but i did not move or turn my head for i had not recovered from my feeling of ill humor toward the faithful ******** i allowed him to approach me and then said coldly without looking at him who is that i sir said nighthawk in a trembling voice what do you want i wish to speak to you sir i am not at leisure i must speak to you sir i wheeled round in my chair and looked at him his pallor was frightful what does all this mean i said coldly this is a singular intrusion i would not intrude upon you if it was not necessary sir he said in an agitated voice but i must speak to you tonight there was something in his accent which frightened me i knew not why well speak i said ********* but be brief as brief as i can sir but i must tell you all if you strike me dead at your feet i must tell you all sir in spite of myself i shuddered speak i said what does this mean nighthawk why do you look like a ghost at me he came up close to me what i have to tell you concerns your honor and your life sir he said in a low tone i gazed at him in speechless astonishment was i the prey of some nightmare i protest to you surry i thought for a moment that i was dreaming all this a tremor ran through my frame i placed my hand upon my heart which felt icy ******** suddenly my selfpossession and coolness seemed to return to me as by magic explain your words i said coldly there is some mystery in them which i do not understand speak and speak plainly i will do so sir he replied in the same trembling voice and going to the door of the apartment he bent down and placed his ear at the keyhole he remained in this attitude for a moment without moving then rising he went to the window and drawing aside the curtains looked out on the chill moonlit expanse this second examination seemed to satisfy him at the same instant a light ******* step of ******** heard crossing the floor of the apartment above our heads and this evidently banished nighthawks last fears he returned quickly to the seat where i was sitting looked at me for some minutes with eyes full of fear affection sympathy fright and said in a voice so low that it scarce rose above a whisper we are alone sir and i can speak without being overheard by these devils who have betrayed and are about to murder you do not interrupt me ****** time is ******** must know every thing at once in an hour it would be too late the man calling himself mortimer is probably within a hundred yards of us at this moment the woman you have married ***** wife stop ***** not strike ******** i know the truth of every thing now she talked with him for an hour under the big cedar near the parsonage last night he will see her again tonight and in this ********* me to the end sir you will not harm him you will care nothing for all this you will not know it for you will be dead sir at these words i must have turned deadly pale for nighthawk hastened to my side and placed his arm around me to support me but i did not need his assistance in an instant i was as calm as i am at this moment i quietly removed the arm of nighthawk and said in a low tone how do you know this i overheard their talk he replied in a husky voice and looked at me with infinite tenderness as he spoke i was coming to see you at the parsonage where i thought you had gone sir i could not bear to keep away from my old masters son any longer and let him get married without making up and having him feel kindly again to me well sir i had just reached the big cedar when i saw the lady come out of the house hasten toward the cedar and hide herself in the shadow within a few feet of me no sooner had she done so than i saw a man come from the rear of the house straight to the cedar and as he drew nearer i recognized mortimer madam coughed slightly as though to give him the signal he soon reached her and then they began to talk i was hidden by the trunk of the tree and the shadow of the heavy boughs reaching nearly to the ground so i heard every word they said without being discovered what was it they said i can not repeat their words sir but i can tell you what i learned from their talk tell me i said first i discovered that madam had been married to that man more than a year before you saw her yes before which she had been tried convicted and confined for six months in a prison in new york as a thief you turn pale sir shall i stop no go on i said these facts continued nighthawk came out in a sort of quarrel which madam had with the man he reproached her with intending to desert ******* loving youand said he had not rescued her from misery to be thus treated she laughed and replied that she was only following a suggestion of his own they were poor they must live he had himself said that they must procure money either honestly or *********** and he had fully approved of the plan she had now undertaken you ****** ********* an *********** ******* idea of her loving you was ********* you were wealthy immensely wealthy had made a will leaving her your entire ********** you died suddenly on your wedding night she and himself would possess fonthill and live in affluence go on i said at these words continued nighthawk i could see the man turn pale he had not intended that he said his scheme had been that madam should induce you to bestow upon her a splendid trousseau in the shape of jewels and money with which they would ***** the marriage was only a farce he ******* did not wish to turn it into a tragedy but she interrupted him impatiently and said she hated and would have no mercy on you she would have all or nothing your will made her the mistress what was a crime more or less to people like themselves at these words he uttered a growl in a word she added you were an obstacle and she was going to suppress ******* or without his consent she then proceeded to tell him her resolution and it is a frightful a horrible one sir all is *********** are about to be murdered how and when i said this very night by poison ah i said explain that madam has provided herself with ********** which she will place in the tea you drink tonight tea will be served in half an hour he will be ********** she forced him to ******** your cries will announce all to him you will be poisoned between eight and nine oclock in the evening ***** ten you will already be ******** at midnight you will be dead then madam will banish every one from her chamber in inconsolable ********* the ******* on the ************ will hear the signal and come up the back ************* madam will open the private door for him to come in and take a look at your body do you understand now sir yes i said remain here nighthawk there is the step of the servant coming to tell me tea is ready the door opened as i uttered the words and my old ************* ****** and an heirloom so to say of the *********** low and announced that tea was served and madam waiting i rose and looked into the mirror above the fireplace i was pale but not sufficiently so to excite suspicion and with a smile which frightened nighthawk took my way toward the supperroom madam was awaiting me as i suspected and i had never seen her look more radiant a single glance told me that she had made an elaborate toilet in honor **** funeral her dark hair was in shining braids her eyes sparkled with joy her parted lips showed her white ******** only evidence i saw of concealed emotion was in the bloodless cheeks they were as white as the lace falling over her superb silk dress you see you keep me waiting she said with playful ****** and your tea is growing cold ******** is worse for me than for you as you do not care but i care for you and as i passed her she drew me playfully toward her dragged me down and held up her lips i touched them with my own they were as cold as ice or the cheek my own face just touched in passing i went to the table took my seat and madam poured out the tea with a covert glance toward me i was not looking at her but i saw it a moment afterward the old waiter presented me the small gilt cup smoking fragrant and inviting i took it looking as before out of the corner of my eye at madam she was leaning forward watching me with a face as pale as death i could hear her teeth chatter i placed the cup to my ******* hand holding a spoon trembled so that the spoon beat a tattoo on her saucer she was watching me in breathless suspense and all at once i turned full toward her the taste of this tea is singular i said i should call it very bad oh it *********** she muttered between her chattering teeth the cup you send me is certainly wretched do me the pleasure to taste it madam and depositing it upon the waiter of the old servant i said take this to your mistress he did so she just touched it with her lips her hand trembling then replaced it upon the waiter i perceive nothing disagreeable she murmured swallow a mouthful i said with a bitter smile she looked at me with sudden intentness her eyes full of wild inquiry seemed attempting to read into my very soul perhaps you object to drinking after me as the children say i ********* time with a species of sneer and a flash of the eye i think oh no she exclaimed with an attempt to laugh and to show you with a quick movement she *********** though by ********** strike the waiter with her elbow in order to ******** the cup but the old servant was too well trained the ladys elbow struck the waiter but the skilful attendant withdrew it quickly not a drop of the tea was ******* a moment afterward i was beside madam i pray you to drink i said i can noti feel unwell she murmured cowering beneath the fire in my eye i beg you to drink from this cup i have told **** will not i beseech you to humor me madam else i shall regard you as a ********* she rose suddenly your meaning sir she exclaimed as pale as death i took the cup and poured the tea into a saucer at the bottom was a modicum of white powder *********** i poured the tea into the cup ********* a second time into the saucer this time nothing *********** i proceeded to pour cream into the saucer until it was filled madam watched me with distended eyes and trembling from head to foot then suddenly she uttered a **** movement of mine had caused the cry i had gone to the fire where a cat was reposing upon the rug and placed the saucer before her in two minutes its contents had disappeared down the throat of the cat five minutes afterward the animal was seized with violent ****************** unearthly ********* the carpet with its *********** around in a sort of ************* on its back beat the air with its ******* expired i turned to madam who was gazing at me with distended eyes and pointing to the cat said see this unfortunate animal madam her death is curious she has died in convulsions in consequence of drinking a cup of tea up to this moment continued mohun madam had exhibited every indication of nervous excitement and a sort of terror had that arisen from a feeling of suspense and the unexpected discovery of her intent by the proposed victim i know not but now when all was discovered her manner suddenly changed she glared at me like a wild animal driven to bay her pearly teeth closed upon her under lip until the blood started pallid but defiant she uttered a low hoarse sound which resembled the growl of a tigress from whom her prey has been snatched and with a firm and haughty step left the apartment glaring over her shoulder at me to the last then her step was heard upon the great staircase she slowly ascended to her chamber the door opened then ********* i sat down overcome for an instant by the terrible scene within three paces of the dead animal destroyed by the poison intended for myself this paralysis of mind lasted only for a moment however i rose coolly directed the old servant who alone had witnessed the scene to retire and carefully abstain from uttering a word of what had passed before himthen i leaned upon the mantelpiece reflected for five ********** in that time i had formed my resolution mortimer was first to be thought of i intended to put him to death first and foremost it would have been easy to have imitated the old ********* of the feudal age and ordered my ********* to *********** him but that was repugnant to my whole character it should never be said that a mohun had shrunk before his foe that one of my family had delegated to another the punishment of his enemy i would fight ************ him in fair and open ******** he killed me well and good if not i would kill him and it should not be with the pistol i ******** to meet him breast to breast to feel my weapon traverse his heart to accomplish this was not difficult i had often heard mortimer when at the parsonage boast of his skill with the foils i had a pair at hand by breaking off the buttons and ********** the points i would secure two rude but excellent ******* with which mortimer and myself could settle our little differences after the fashion of gentlemen in former ages as to the place of **************** the house or a part of the grounds around the ********* was unimportant i said so that one of us was killed but a moments reflection induced me to change my views under any circumstances i was going to ******* was true my character however must be thought of it would not do to have a stain rest on the last of the house of mohun were i to kill mortimer in the house or grounds it would be said that i had murdered him with the aid of my ************ i had drawn him thither to strike ****** acted the traitor and the coward no i said even in death i must guard the family honor this man must fall *********** some spot far distant from this ********* without *********** ********* fair fight with me no one even seeing us i had formed this resolution in five minutes after the departure of madam from the supperroom i went straight to the library calmly stated my resolution to nighthawk and in spite of his most obstinate remonstrances and repeated ******** broke down his opposition by sheer force of will it took me half an hour but at the end of that time i had succeeded nighthawk listened with bent head and pale face covered with drops of cold perspiration to my orders these orders were to have the horses put to the carriage which was to be ready at my call then to proceed with a trusty servant or more if necessary to a private spot on the river which i described to him dig a grave of full length and depth and when his work was finished return and report the fact to me cautioning the servant or servants to say nothing this work i calculated would be completed about *********** at midnight i promised myself an interview with my friend mortimer nighthawk groaned as he listened to my cold and resolute voice giving minute instructions for the work of ************** at my face to discover if there were any signs of yielding ************** saw none *********** disappeared uttering a groan to carry out the orders which he had received from me then i took the two foils from the top of the bookcase where they were kept broke off the buttons by placing my heel upon them procured a file and sharpened the points until they would have penetrated through an ordinary plank that was sufficient i said to ********** would pierce a mans ********* placing them on the ****** i went to a drawer and took out a loaded revolver which i thrust into my breast two minutes afterward i had ascended to madams chamber opened the door and entered i did not arrive a moment too ****** fact i came in the nick of time madam had hastily collected watches chains ********** necklaces and all the money she could find had thrust the whole into a jewel casket thrown her rich furs around her shoulders and was hurrying toward the door in rear of the apartment which opened on the private staircase she had not locked the main door of the apartment doubtless fearing to excite suspicion or knowing i could easily break the **** with a single blow of my foot she had plainly counted on my stupor of astonishment and horror at her crime and was now trying to escape that did not suit my view however in two steps i reached the private door turned the key drew it from the lock and placed it in my pocket sit down madam i said and do not be in such a hurry to desert your dear husband let us talk for a few moments at least before you depart she glared at me and sat down she looked regal in her costly furs holding the casket heaped with rich jewels what is your programme madam if i may ask i said taking a chair which stood opposite to her to leave this house she said hoarsely ah you are tired of me then i am sick of ******* long been sick of you indeed i said that is curious i thought our marriage was a love affair madam at least you induced me to suppose so what then has suddenly changed your sentiments in my direction am i a monster have i been cruel to you am i unworthy of you i hate and despise you it was the hoarse growl of a wild animal rather than the voice of a woman she was imperial at that ********* i acknowledge surry that she was game to the last ah you hate me you despise me i said i have had the misfortune to incur madams displeasure no more connubial *********** more *********** and sweet ************* more loving words and ********* more bliss she continued to glare at me i am unworthy of madam i see that clearly i went on i am only a poor little plain little insignificant little country ********** i am ******** mere *********** madam ******* i tell you madam while you are a ******** *********** a poisoner are you not her face became livid but her defiant eyes never sank before my glance i really admired her surry no woman was ever braver than that one i had supposed that these words would overwhelm her that the discovery of my acquaintance with her past life and full knowledge of her attempted crime would crush her to the earth perhaps i had some remnant of pity for this woman if she had been submissive ********* but instead of submission and confusion she exhibited greater defiance than before in the pale face her eyes burned like coals of ******* it was rage which inflamed them so you have set your spies on me she exclaimed in accents of inexpressible fury you are a chivalric gentleman truly you are worthy of your boasted family you pretend to love and confide in meyou look at me with smiles and eyes of ************ all the time you are laying a trap for ************* to catch me and betray me well yes sir yes what you have discovered through your spies is true i was tried and sentenced as a ****** was married when i first saw youand it is this

finger at you where you stand cowering in the midst of jeers and laughter and say there is mr mohun of the ancient family of the ******** is the husband and the dupe of a thief she was splendid as she uttered these words surry they thrilled me and made my blood flame i half rose nearly beside ********** i resumed my seat and my coolness a moment afterward i was as calm as i am at this moment and said laughing so you have prepared that pretty little tableau have you madam i compliment you on your ******** even more on your nerve but have you not omitted one ****** very trifling portion it is true of the indictment to be framed against you i refer to the little scene of this evening madam her teeth closed with a snap otherwise she exhibited no emotion her flashing eyes continued to survey me with the former defiance is there not an additional clause in the said indictment madam i calmly continued which the ************* attorney will perhaps rely on more fully than upon all else in the document to secure your conviction and punishment you are not only a ******** and an ************ are also a poisoner my dear madam and may be hanged for that or if not *********** is that handsome

point which i have omitted and which may count for you this life in prison will not be so hard to ******** your ******** has already served your ************** among felons the point at last was reached madam had listened with changing color and my words seemed to paint the frightful scene in all its horror suddenly fury mastered her she rose and seemed clutching at some weapon to strike me you are a gentleman you insult a woman you are a poisoner ******** make tea for the gentleman you are a coward do you hear a coward i can not return madam the same reproach i replied rising and bowing it required some courage to attempt to poison me upon the very night of my wedding my words drove her to frenzy beware she exclaimed taking a step toward me and putting her hand into her bosom beware i said with a laugh beware of what my dear madam ******** of this and with a movement as rapid as lightning she drew from her breast a small ************* pistol which she aimed straight at my breast i was not in a mood to care much for pistols surry when a man is engaged in a little affair like that bullets lose their influence on the nerves that is a pretty toy i said where did you procure it madam the poisoner with a face resembling rather a hideous mask than a human countenance she rushed upon me placed the muzzle of the pistol on my very breast and drew the trigger the weapon snapped a moment afterward i had taken it from her hand and thrown it into a corner very well done i said what a pity that you use such indifferent caps your pistol is as harmless as your tea she uttered a hoarse cry but did not recoil in the least surry this woman was a curiosity instead of retreating from me she clenched her small white hand raised it above her head and exclaimed if he only were here he madam i said you refer to your respected ********* mr mortimer yes he would make you repent your cowardly outrages and insults i looked at my watch it was just eleven the hour is earlier than i thought madam i said but perhaps he has already arrived and advancing to the side of the lady i took her arm drew her toward the window and said why not give your friend the signal you have agreed on madam at a bound she reached the window and struck a rapid series of blows with her fingers upon the pane five minutes afterward a heavy step was heard ascending the private staircase i went to the door and unlocked it the step ***************** at the ******* door opened and mortimer appeared come in my dear brotherinlaw i said we are waiting for you mortimer recoiled as if a blow had been suddenly struck at him his astonishment was so comic that i began to laugh good you start i said you thought i was dead by this time yes he coolly replied as he spoke his hand stole under the cloak in which he was wrapped and i heard the click of a pistol as he cocked it i drew my own weapon cocked it in turn and placing the muzzle upon ********* breast said draw your pistol and you are dead he looked at me with perfect coolness mingled with a sort of curiosity i saw that he was a man of unfaltering courage and that the instincts of a gentleman had not entirely left him soiled as he was with every crime his eye was calm and unshrinking he did not move an inch when i placed my pistol muzzle upon his breast at the words which i uttered he withdrew his hand from his ******* had returned the weapon to its ******** with a penetrating glance said what do you wish sir as you declare you await me ask madam i said or rather exert your own ingenuity my ingenuity in guessing why not tell me so be it the matter is perfectly simple sir i wish to kill you or give you an opportunity to kill **** that plain quite so replied mortimer without moving a muscle i can understand without further words that all explanations and discussions are wholly useless wholly you wish to fight me he said yes to put an end to me if possible yes well i will give you that opportunity sir and even return you my thanks for not killing me on the spot he paused a moment and looked keenly at me this whole affair is infamous he said i knew that when i undertook it i was once a gentleman and have not forgotten every thing i then learned whatever my practice may be you have been ******* and deceived you have been made the victim of a disgraceful plot and i was the author of the whole affair though this lady would herself have been equal to that or even more you see i talk to you plainly sir i know a gentleman when i see him and you are one i was formerly something of the same sort but having ******** myself went on in the career that brought me to this i was ****** poor now i originated the idea of this ************** with a view to profit by it but with no further he suddenly paused and looked at the woman their glances in that moment crossed like lightning speak out she cried say plainly hush i did not mean *** am no coward madam say plainly that it was i who formed the design to get rid of this person and she pointed furiously at me let no scruples restrain ******* nothing upon ********** was i ii who planned his death mortimer remained for an instant silent then he resumed in the same measured voice as before you hear he said i tried to shield her to take the ********** to give you no inkling of ******* she spoils all to end this i have offered you a mortal ************ an ancient and honorable ******* last representative of the mohuns has formed through me a degrading connection i acknowledge all that i am going to try to kill you to bury every thing in the grave i would have shrunk from ************* you though i wish your death you offer me honorable combat and you do me an honor which i appreciate let us finish the place time and weapons there was then something not altogether base in this man i listened with joy i had expected to encounter a wretch without a single attribute of the gentleman you accept this honorable combat then i said with thanks he replied you wish to fight as gentlemen fight yes you fence well ****** you sufficiently well are you certain i warn you i am excellent at the foils they suit methat is agreed on then he bowed and said yes and now as to the place the time and every detail all that i leave to you i bowed in turn then nothing will delay our affair i have ordered a grave to be dug in a private spot on the river the foils are ready with the buttons broken the points sharpened the carriage has been ordered a ride of fifteen minutes will bring us to the grave which is done by this time and we can settle our differences there by moonlight without witnesses or interruption mortimer looked at me with a sinister smile you are ********* he said briefly i understand the one who falls will give no trouble the grave will await him and he can enter at once upon his property yes and this lady that will come afterward i said if i kill you she is your property and if you kill me she is mine i said the sinister smile again came to the dark features of mortimer so be it he said and i am ready to accompany you sir i drew my pistol and threw it upon the bed looking at mortimer as i did so he imitated me and opening his coat showed me that he was wholly unarmed i did the same and having locked the private door leading to the back staircase led the way out followed by mortimer he turned and looked at madam as he passed through the door she was erect furious defiant full of anticipated triumph was it a glance of gloomy compassion and deep tenderness which mortimer threw toward her i thought i heard him sigh i locked the door and we descended to the library as we entered the apartment the clock on the mantelpiece struck midnight my body servant was within call and i ordered my carriage which nighthawk had been directed to have ready at a moments warning in five minutes it was at the door and i had just taken the two foils under my arm when i heard a step in the passage a moment afterward nighthawk entered he was so pale that i scarcely recognized him when his eyes encountered mortimer they flashed lightnings of menace well i said in brief tones it is ready sir nighthawk replied in a voice scarcely audible i looked at him *********** and the servants are warned to keep silent yes sir very well remain here until i return i said and i pointed to a seat with a glance at nighthawk which said plainly to him do not presume to attempt to turn me from my present ********* will be useless and offensive to me he groaned and sat down in the seat i indicated his frame was bent and shrunken like that of an old man in one evening since that moment i have loved nighthawk my dear surry and he deserves it without delay i led the way to the carriage which was driven by my fathers old grayhaired coachman and entered it with mortimer directing the driver to follow the highroad down the river he did so we rolled on in the moonlight or the shadow as it came forth or disappeared behind the drifting clouds the air was intensely cold from beyond the woods came the hollow roar of the nottoway which was swollen by a freshet mortimer drew his cloak around him but said nothing in ten minutes i called to the old coachman to stop he checked his spirited ******* had some good ones ******* i descended from the carriage with the foils under my arm followed by mortimer the old coachman looked on in astonishment the spot at which i had stopped the carriage was wild and dreary beyond expression shall i wait sir he said respectfully no return home at once and put away the carriage he looked at me with a sort of stupor go home sir he said yes and leave you obey me my voice must have shown that remonstrance would be useless my old servitor uttered a sigh like the groan which had escaped from the lips of nighthawk and mounting the box turned the heads of his horses toward home i watched the carriage until it turned a bend in the road and then making a sign to mortimer to follow me led the way into the woods pursuing a path which the moonlight just enabled me to perceive i penetrated the forest went on for about ten minutes and finally emerged upon a plateau in the swampy undergrowth near which stood the ruins of an old chimney this chimney had served to indicate the spot to nighthawk and before us in the moonlight was the evidence that he had found it in the centre of the plateau was a newly dug ******** in front of it i paused we have arrived i said mortimer gazed at the grave with a grim smile that is a dreary and desolate object he said it will soon be inhabited i returned and the issue of this combat is indifferent to me since in either event i shall be dead ah he exclaimed explain that then you do not understand you think this duel will end every thing you deceive yourself a family history like mine does not terminate with a duel have you read those tragedies where everybody is *********** not a single one of the ******** ******** escapes well this is going to be a drama of that exact description do you wish to save that woman yonder to do so you must kill me i tell you that to warn you to do your best sir mortimer glared at me it is hard to imagine a glance more sinister so you have arranged the whole affair he said there is to be a wholesale killing yes you are going to ******* yes yourself too yes ********* smile became more sinister as he raised his **** take your position sir he said i am going to save you the latter trouble i grasped my weapon and placed myself on guard in an instant he had thrown himself upon me with a fury which indicated the profound passion under his assumed coolness his eyes blazed his lips writhed into something like a deadly grin i felt that i had to contend rather with a wild animal than a man the grave yawned in the moonlight at our very feet and mortimer closed in with fury endeavoring to force me to its brink and hurl me into it ten minutes afterward the combat was over and it was mortimer who occupied the grave he had given ground an instant to breathe had returned to the attack more furiously than before a tremendous blow of his weapon snapped my own eighteen inches from the hilt but this had probably saved my life instead of destroying it as mortimer from his fierce exclamation as the blade broke evidently expected before he could take advantage of his success i sprang at his throat grasped his ******** with my left hand and shortening my stump of a weapon drove the point through his breast he uttered a cry staggered and threw up his hands i released my clutch on his arm and he fell heavily backward into the grave now to end all i said and i set out rapidly for fonthill i had not gone a hundred yards when i heard the sound of wheels approaching i had said to myself i am going back to madam she will hear my footsteps upon the staircase will open the door will rush forward to embrace me under the impression that i am her dear mortimer returning triumphant from the field of battle and then a grand tableau things were destined to turn out differently as you will see in an instant the sound of wheels grew louder a carriage appeared and i recognized my own chariot why have you disobeyed my orders i said to the old grayhaired driver arresting the horses as i spoke by violently grasping the bridles the old coachman looked frightened then he said in an agitated voice madam ordered me to obey her sir madam yes sir where is she in the carriage sir as soon as i got back she came down to the *********** me to drive her to youand i was obliged to do so sir good i said you have done well and opening the door of the carriage through the glass of which i saw the pale face of the woman i entered it directing the coachman to drive to the hicksford crossing a hoarse but defiant voice at my side said where is mr mortimer gone over the river i said laughing and we are going too to rejoin him yes madam the carriage had rolled on and as it passed the grave i heard a groan what is that said she the river is groaning over yonder madam you will not attempt to pass it tonight yes madam are you afraid she looked at me with fiery eyes afraid no she said i am afraid of nothing i really admired her at that moment she was truly brave i said nothing however the carriage rolled on and ten minutes afterward the roar of the river now near at hand was heard that sound mingled with the deep bellowing of the thunder which succeeded the dazzling flashes at every instant dividing the darkness all at once my companion said i am tired of ********* is mr mortimer he awaits us i replied you are going to him yes we had reached the bank of the river and stopping the carriage i sprung out madam followed me without being invited a small boat rose and fell on the swollen current i detached the chain seized a paddle and pointed to the stern seat the river is dangerous tonight said madam coldly then you are afraid after all no she said and with a firm step she entered the boat go back with the carriage i said to the driver he turned the heads of the horses and obeyed in silence madam had taken her seat in the stern of the boat i pushed from shore into the current and ******** rapidly to the middle of the foaming torrent filled with driftwood threw the paddle overboard and took my seat in the stern as i threw away the paddle my resolution seemed to dawn for the first time upon my companion she had become deadly pale but said nothing with folded arms i looked and listened we were nearing a narrow and *********** point in the river where there was no hope the frail boat was going to be overturned there or dashed to pieces without mercy i knew the ******** that there was no hope the torrent was roaring and driving the boat like a leaf toward the jagged and fatal rocks then you are going to kill me and yourself at the same time she said the woman was fearless yes i said it is the only way i could not live ************* dishonored mei ****** die with you and i rose erect ****** my forehead to the lightning the point was reached the boat swept on with the speed of a ********* a dazzling flash showed a dark object amid the foam right ahead of us the boat rushed toward itthe jagged teeth seemed grinning at ***** boat ********* the next moment i felt the torrent sweep over me roaring furious and sombre like a wild beast that has caught its prey when i opened my eyes the sun was shining in my face i was lying on a mass of driftwood caught by a ledge of rock ******* out into the river i had apparently been hurled there by the force of the current stunned and bruised the sunshine had aroused me bringing me back to that life which was a burden and a mockery and where was she i shuddered as i asked myself that question had she been thrown from the boat had it been overturned was she drowned i closed my eyes with a shudder which traversed my body chilling my blood as with the cold hand of death for a moment i thought of throwing myself into the river and thus ending all my woes but i was too cowardly i turned toward the shore groaning dragged my bruised and aching limbs along the ledge of jagged rocks through the masses of driftwood and finally reached the shore where i sank down exhausted and ready to die i will not lengthen out the gloomy picture at last i rose looked around and with bent head and cowering frame stole away through the woods toward fonthill on my way i passed within two hundred yards of the ******** i dared not go thither he was dead ************ he had been slain in fair combat it was another form that haunted ***** form of a ******** who had dishonored *********** to poison mea terrible ******** still a woman and i *********** her i reached home an hour or two afterward nighthawk was sitting in the library pale and haggard watching for me as i entered he rose with an exclamation extending his arms toward me with an indescribable expression of joy i shrunk back refusing his hand do not touch that i groaned there is blood on it he seized it and kneeling down kissed it bloody or not it is your ******* hand of my dear young master and the honest fellow burst into tears as he covered my hand with kisses a month afterward i was in europe amid the whirl and noise of paris i tried to forget that i was a *********** the shadow went with me mohun had spoken throughout the earlier portions

those harsh and conflicting emotions so it ended surry he said after a long pause such was the frightful gulf into which the devil and my own passions pushed me in that month of december 1856 a hand as irresistible and inexorable as the greek necessity had led me step by step to ******** intent if not in ******* for years the shadow of the crime which i believed i had committed made my life

madness and attempted to commit that deadly sin well to end my long history i remained in europe until the news from america indicated the approach of ************ managing my estate and ********* me the proceeds at paris when i saw that an armed collision was going to take place i hastened back reaching virginia in the winter of 1860 but i did not come to fonthill i had a horror of the place from new york where i landed i proceeded to montgomery without stopping upon the route found there a prominent friend of my father who was raising a brigade in the southwest was invited by him to aid him and soon afterward was elected to the command of a company of cavalry by his recommendation i need only add that i rose gradually from captain to colonel which rank i held in 1863 when we first met on the ************** regiment having been transferred to a brigade of general lees cavalry you saw me then and remember my bitterness and melancholy but you had no opportunity to ****** the depth and intensity of those sentiments in me suddenly the load was lifted that woman made her appearance as if from the grave and you must have witnessed my wonder as my eyes fell upon her then she was not dead after all i was not a murderer and to complete the wonder he was also alive a man passing along the bank of the river as i discovered afterward from nighthawk who ******** out the whole ******* man named swartz a sort of poor farmer and ******** passing along the nottoway on the morning after the storm had found the woman cast ashore with the boat overturned near her and a mile farther had found mortimer not yet dead in the grave ******** by swartz they had both ************ then disappeared i was to meet them again and know of their existence only when the chance of war threw us face

boast in the house near buckland that she had thrice attempted to *********** me by means of her **** the man swartz again at warrenton in the hospital she came near ********** me with her own hand nighthawk who had followed me to the field and become a secret agent of general stuart warned me of all ******* one day gave me information more startling still and this brings me my dear surry to the

certificate of her marriage with mr ************* or ************* the object of swartz was to sell the paper to me for a large sum as he had gotten an inkling of the state of affairs and my relation

**** **** certificate of the marriage of these two persons before the year 1856 when i first met them you doubtless understand now my dear surry my great anxiety to gain possession of that paper or if you do not i have only to state one ******** will explain all i am engaged to be married to miss conway and am naturally anxious to have the proof in my possession that i have not one wife yet living i know that woman well she will stop at nothing the rumor that i am about to become the happy husband of a young lady whom i love has driven madam nearly frantic and she has already shown her willingness to stop at nothing by *********** swartz and starving him until he produced the stolen paper swartz is dead however the paper is lost i and madam are both in hot pursuit of the document which will find it i know not she of course wishes to suppress iti wish to possess it where is it if you will tell me friend i will make you a deed for half my estate you have been with me to visit

current of our narrative drags us toward passionate and tragic events but toward few scenes more sombre than that which i witnessed on this night in december 1864 i found john m daniel in his house on broad street as before perched still in his high chair of black ********* all alone his face was thinner his cheeks more sallow and now haggard and sunken his eyes sparkling with gloomy fire as he half reclined beneath the cluster of globe lamps depending from the ceiling and filling the whole apartment with their brilliant ******** of his weaknesses he received me with grim cordiality offered me a cigar and said i am glad to see you colonel and to offer you one of the last of my stock of havanas wilmington is going ******** goodbye to blockade goods you believe wilmington is going to fall then as surely as savannah savannah you think that we are more hopeful at petersburg hopeful or not colonel i am certain of what i say remember my prediction when it is fulfilled the yankees are a theatrical people they take vicksburg and win gettysburg on their great national anniversary and now they are going to present themselves with a handsome christmas ******** is the city of savannah he spoke with evident difficulty and his laboring voice like his haggard cheeks showed that he had been ill since i last saw him savannah captured or surrendered i said with knit brows what will be the result of that ruin was the curt response not the loss of a mere town no the place itself is nothing for sherman to take it will not benefit him much but it will prove to the country and the president that he is irresistible then they will hack and you will see the beginning of the end that is a gloomy view enough ******** thing is gloomy now the devil of ********** obstinacy and ************ rules affairs i do not ***** in the examiner newspaper but we are going straight to the devil as he uttered these words he placed his hand upon his breast and closed his eyes as though he were going to faint what is the matter i exclaimed rising abruptly and approaching him nothing he replied in a weak voice dont disturb yourself about me these fits of faintness come on now and then in consequence of an attack of pneumonia which i had lately sit down colonel you must really pardon me for saying it but you make me nervous there was nothing in the tone of this singular address to take offence ***** voice of the speaker was perfectly ************ i resumed my seat we were talking about sherman he said they call him *** ***** ********** i know not what in the clerical circles of this city his lip curled as he spoke one reverend divine publicly declared the other day that god had put a hook in shermans nose and was leading him to his destruction i dont think it looks much like it the speaker was stopped by a fit of coughing and when it had subsided leaned back faint and exhausted in his chair the fact ********* he said with difficulty seems to ******* hook ***** nose there was something grim and lugubrious in the smile which accompanied the painfully uttered words a long silence followed them which was broken by neither of us at last i raised my head and said i find you less hopeful than last summer at that time you were in good spirits and the tone of the examiner was buoyant it is hopeful still he replied but by an ********** a sentiment of duty i often write far more cheerfully than i feel colonel your views have changed i *********** you change with the whole country yes a whole century has passed since last august when you visited me here one by one we have lost all that the country could depend ****** goes last for myself i began to doubt when jackson fell at chancellorsville and i have been doubting more or less ever since he was a dominant man colonel fit if any thing happened to rise to the head of affairs oh for an hour of jackson oh for a day of our dead ****** the face of the speaker glowed and i shall never forget the flash of his dark eye as he uttered the words if any thing happened there was a whole volume of menace to president davis in those words but this is useless he went on jackson is dead and there is none to take his place so without leaders with every sort of ************ with obstinacy and stupidity directing the public councils and shaping the acts of the administration we are gliding straight into the gulf of destruction i could make no reply the words of this singular man and profound thinker affected me ********* yes colonel he went on the three or four months which have passed since your last visit have cleared away all mists from my eyes at least and put an end to all my *********** others to that project which i spoke ***** purchase and restoration of the family estate of stafford it will never be restored by me like randolph i am the last of my line and with eyes full of a profound melancholy the speaker gazed into the fire i am passing away with the country he added the cause is going to fail i give it three months to end in and have sent for a prominent senator who may be able to do something i intend to say to him the time has come to make the best terms possible with the enemy and i shall place the columns of the examiner newspaper at his disposal to advocate that policy is it possible i said frankly i do not think things are so desperate you are a soldier and hopeful colonel the smoke blinds you and yet general lee is said to repudiate negotiations with scorn he is said to have lately replied to a gentleman who advised them for myself i intend to die sword in hand general lee is a ********** you know what the song says a soldiers business boys is to die i could find no reply to the grim words i tell you the cause is lost colonel with feverish energy lost ************ at this moment while we are speaking it is lost from causes which are enough to make the devil laugh but it is lost all the same when the day of surrender and yankee domination ********* the gentlemen of the south are placed under the heel of negroes and ******** for one wish to die happy is the man who shall have gotten into the grave before that day blessed will be the woman who has never given suck yes the best thing for me is to die and i am going to do so i shall not see that dies **** i shall be in my grave and breathing heavily the journalist again leaned back in his chair as though about to faint an hour afterward i terminated my visit and went out oppressed and gloomy this singular man had made a reluctant convert of me to his own dark views the cloud which wrapped him now darkened ****** the black future i saw the lightnings dart already his predictions were destined to have a very remarkable fulfilment on the 21st of december a few days after our interview sherman telegraphed to lincoln i beg to present you as a christmas gift the city of savannah with one hundred and fifty guns and plenty of ammunition and also about twentyfive thousand bales of cotton in january wilmington fell toward the end of the same month john m daniel was a second time seized with pneumonia and took to his bed from which he was never again to rise he would see no one but his physician and a few chosen friends all other persons were persistently denied admittance to his chamber lingering throughout the remainder of the winter as spring approached life seemed gradually leaving him day by day his pulse grew weaker you would have said that this man was slowly dying with the cause for which he had fought that as the lifeblood oozed drop by drop from the bleeding bosom of the southern confederacy the last pulses of john m daniel kept time to the pattering drops one morning at the end of march his physician came to see him and found him lying on the outer edge of his bed not wishing to disturb him the physician went to the window to mix a stimulant all at once a noise attracted his attention and he turned round the dying man had by a great effort turned completely over and lay on his back in the middle of the bed with his eyes closed and his arms folded on his breast as though he were praying when the physician came to his bedside he was dead it was four days before the fall of petersburg and richmond and he was buried in hollywood just in time to escape the tramp of federal feet around his coffin his prophecy and wish were thus fulfilled when i left mr john m daniel it was past ten at night and designing to set out early in the morning for petersburg i bent my steps toward home the night was not however to pass without adventures of another character i was going along governor street picking my way by the light of the few ******** set far apart and burning dimly when all at once i heard a cry in front succeeded by the noise of a ******* and then by a heavy fall hastening forward i reached the spot which was not far from the city hall and a glance told me all a ******** had been ******** that is to say suddenly attacked while passing along by one of the nightbirds who then infested the streets after dark seized from behind ********* and thrown violently to the ********* object of the assailant being robbery when i reached the spot the robber was still struggling with his victim who stretched beneath him on the ground uttered frightful cries one hand of the ******** was on his throat the other was busily ******* his pockets i came up just in time to prevent a murder but not to disappoint the robber as i appeared he hastily rose releasing the throat of the unfortunate citizen i saw a watch gleam in his hand he bestowed a violent kick on his prostrate ********** he disappeared running and was in an instant lost in the darkness i saw that pursuit would be useless and nobody ever thought at that period of attempting to summon the police i turned to assist the victim who all at once rose from the ground uttering groans and cries the lamplight shone upon his face it was the worthy mr ********* blocque ******** howls of anguish mr blocque shaking his clenched hands and ********* all created things mr blocque devoting with loud curses and imprecations the assembled wisdom of the city fathers and the entire police

as i looked at the little blockaderunner with disordered hair dirty face torn clothes and bleeding nose uttering curses and moaning in agony over the loss of his honest earnings i consoled him in the best manner i could and asked him if he had lost every thing that question seemed to arouse him he felt hastily in his ********** then at the result my eyes opened wide thrusting his hand into a secret pocket he drew forth an enormous roll of greenbacks and i could see the figures 100 on each of the notes as he ran over them that bundle alone must have contained several thousands of dollars but the worthy mr blocque did not seem in the least consoled he got the other bundle shrieked the victim still in his wild ******** it was ten thousand ******** had just received it this ******** am ********** are going to murder ******* is the ************ i laid my hand upon his arm you have lost a very considerable sum i said ****** may lose more still and i pointed to the roll of bank notes

can thank you colonel you have saved me from robbery and murder come and see me colonel come and dine with me my dear sir at five precisely and mr blocque commenced running wildly toward a place of safety in a moment he had disappeared and i found myself ************* heartily well i said as i walked on this is a charming adventure and conveys a tolerably good idea of the city of richmond after

never known to attack people with gray ********* knew better they attacked the black coats in the pockets of which they suspected the presence of greenbacks and valuable papers never the gray coats where they would find only a ****** leave of absence for their pains i thus banished the whole affair from my mind but it had aroused and excited me i did not feel at all sleepy and finding by a glance at my watch beneath a lamp that it was only half past ten i resolved to go and ask after the health of my friend mr x whose house was only a square or two off this resolution i proceeded at once to carry out a short walk brought me to the house half buried in its shrubbery but as i approached i saw a carriage was standing before the house should i make my visit then or postpone it mr x evidently had company or had the carriage brought a visitor to some other member of the household mr x was only a boarder and i might be mistaken in supposing that he was engaged at the moment as these thoughts passed through my mind i approached the gate in the iron railing the carriage was half hidden by the shadow of the elms which grew in a row along the sidewalk on the box sat a motionless figure the vehicle and driver were as still and silent as if carved out of ebony decidedly i will discover i said and opening the gate i turned into the winding path through the shrubbery which led toward the rear of the house that is to say toward the private entrance to the room of mr x suddenly as i passed through the shadowy shrubs i felt a hand on my shoulder i started back and unconsciously felt for some weapon dont shoot me colonel said a voice in the darkness i am a friend i recognized the voice of nighthawk good heavens my dear nighthawk i said drawing a long breath of relief you are enough to make ****** the brave himself tremble you turn up everywhere and especially in the dark what are you doing here i am watching colonel said nighthawk with benignant sweetness watching and waiting waiting for whom for a lady with whom you have the honor of being acquainted a lady that one you last saw in the lonely house near monks neck hush here she comes his voice had sunk to a whisper and he drew me into the shrubbery as a long bar of light issuing from the door in the rear of the house ran out into the night i am going to follow her whispered nighthawk placing his lips close to my ear she is at her devils work here in richmond as swartz was suddenly he was silent a light step was heard a form approached us passed by i could see that it was a woman wrapped from head to foot in a gray cloak she passed so close to us that the skirt of her cloak nearly brushed our persons and disappeared toward the gate the iron latch was heard to click the door of the carriage to open and close and then the vehicle began to move nighthawk took two quick steps in the direction of the gate i am going to follow the carriage colonel he whispered i have been waiting here to do so i will tell you more another time give my respects to general mohun and tell him i am on his business with which words nighthawk glided into the ************** through the gate without sound from the ******** running noiselessly disappeared on the track of the carriage i gazed after him for a moment said to myself well this night is to be full of *********** going straight to the door in the rear of the house passed through it went to the door of mr ** room and knocked come in said the voice of that gentleman and opening the door i entered mr x was seated in front of an excellent coal fire in his great armchair near a table covered with papers and between his lips was the eternal cigar at sight of me he rose ************** he never omitted any form of ************* cordially shook my hand i am glad to see you colonel he said just from the army have a cigar and he extended toward me an elegant ********* full of havanas which he took from the table i declined informing him that i had been smoking all the evening in the sanctum of the editor of the examiner ah you have been to see daniel said mr x he is a very remarkable man i do not approve of the course of his paper and he has attacked me very bitterly on more than one occasion but i bear no grudge against him he is honest in his opinions i admire the pluck of the man and the splendid **** of his writings my views accord with your own i replied everybody thinks with us said mr x puffing at his cigar it is only *********** who deny this mans courage and ability i have never done injustice to ********* i call that liberal in myself colonel he has ****** me alive on three or four occasions and it is not his fault that i am enjoying this excellent havana i read the attacks i said were they not fearful said mr x smiling tranquilly after reading them i regarded myself as a moral and political monster i could not forbear from laughing as the portly statesman uttered the words he seemed to derive a species of careless enjoyment from the recollection of his ******** i expect to talk over these little affairs with daniel hereafter he said we shall have a great deal of time on our ******* canada and mr x smiled and went on smoking it was the second time he had uttered that ******** canada i laughed now and said you continue to regard toronto or montreal or quebec as your future residence yes i think i prefer quebec the view from cape diamond is superb and there is something english and ********** in the whole place which i like the plains of abraham bring back the history of the ********* is more agreeable to me at least than the history of the present you adhere more than ever i see to your opinion that we are going to fail it is not an opinion my dear colonel but a

thus for a year ago there was still some hope now to discourage ***** thinking men fighting for a principle like yourself could be **************** result in no injury for the cause is lost on the contrary as the friend of that most excellent gentleman your father i regard it as a sort of duty to speak ****** say to you dont throw away your life for nothing do your duty but do no more than your duty for we are doomed i could find no reply to these gloomy words the case is past praying for said mr x ********** the whole fabric of the confederacy at this moment is a mere shell it is going to crumble in the spring and another flag will float over the virginia capitol ********** you soldiers call the gridiron the country is tired the administration is unpopular and the departments are mismanaged i am candid you see the days of the confederacy are numbered and worse than all nobody knows it we ought to negotiate for the best terms but the man who advises that will be hissed at and called a coward it is an ********* thing to do it is much grander to shout death sooner than surrender i shouted that lustily as long as there was any ******* i think it my duty as a statesman and public functionary to say there are worse things than ******** us try and avoid them by making terms i say that to **** do not say so on the ********** people would tear me to pieces and with their sources of information they would be right in doing so is it possible that all is lost that negotiations are our only hope yes and confidentially ************ is a state secret my dear ************ will soon be made indeed you think that impossible but it is the impossible which invariably takes place in this world we are going to send commissioners to meet mr lincoln in hampton ******** it will be useless why we are going to demand such terms as he will not agree to the commissioners will return the war will continue to its legitimate military end which i fix about the last days of march good heaven so soon yes in three months mr x nodded general lee may lengthen the term a little by his skill and courage but it is not in his power even to resist beyond the month of april the army of northern virginia driven by the enemy forced to surrender or annihilated and in ********** will never join johnston its numbers are too small to cut a path through the enemy grant will be at the

surrender or be ********* cheerful isnt it it is frightful yes lees men are starving now the country is tired of the war and disgusted with the manner in which we manage things no recruits are arriving the troops are not ********* but they are leaving the army without permission to succor their starving families lees last hours are approaching and we are playing the comedy here in richmond with an immense appearance of reality dancing and ******** and laughing on the surface of the volcano i play my part among the rest i risk my head more even perhaps than the military leaders i take a philosophic view however of the present and future if i am not hung i will go to canada meanwhile i smoke my cigar colonel and mr x lazily threw away his stump and lit a fresh havana it is impossible to imagine any thing more careless than his attitude this man was either very brave or frightfully apathetic five minutes afterward i knew that any thing but apathy possessed him all at once he rose in his chair and his eyes were fixed upon me with a glance so piercing and melancholy that they dwell still in my memory and will always dwell there i said we were playing a comedy here in richmond colonel he said in tones so deep and solemn that they made me start i am playing my part with the rest i play it in public and even in private as before you tonight i sit here ********** smoking and uttering my jests and ********** and at the moment that i am speaking my heart is breaking i am a ********** love this soil more than all the rest of the ******** a foot but is dear and sacred and a vulgar horde are about to trample it under foot and ******* its people every pulse of my being throbs with agony at the thought i can not sleep i have lost all taste for food one thought alone haunts methat the land of washington jefferson mason henry and randolph is to become the helpless prey of the scum of europe and the north my family has lived here for more than two hundred years i have been and am today proud beyond words of my birthright i am a virginian a virginian of virginians i have for forty years had no thought but the honor of virginia i have fought for her and her only in the senate and cabinet of the old government at washington i have dedicated all my powers to ********* from nothing in my ********* my days and nights for years and was willing to pour out my blood for virginia and now she is about to be trampled upon her great statues hurled down her escutcheon blotted her altars overturned and i who have had no thought but her honor and glory am to be driven at the end of a long career to a foreign land i am to crouch yonder in canada with my bursting brow in my two ******** every newspaper is to tell me the negro and the bayonet rule virginia can you wonder then that i am ********** despair lies under all this jesting you are happy you go yonder where a bullet may end you would to god that i had entered the army old as i am and that at least i could hope for a death of honor in arms for virginia the statesman leaned back in his great chair and was silent at the same moment a tap was heard at the door it opened noiselessly and nighthawk glided into the apartment under his cloak i saw the gray uniform of a confederate soldier in his hand he carried a letter nighthawk saluted mr x and myself with benignant respect his quick eye however had caught the gloomy and agitated expression of the ********** countenance and he was silent well said mr x raising his head with a deep sigh then passing his hand over his face he seemed to brush away all emotion when he again looked up his face was as calm and unmoved as at the commencement of our interview you see i begin a new scene in this comedy he said to me in a low tone and turning to nighthawk he said well you followed that agreeable person yes sir said nighthawk with great respect she turned out to be the character you supposed speak before colonel surry nighthawk bowed i never had any doubt of her character sir he said you will remember that she called on you a week ago announcing that she was a spy who had lately visited the federal lines and washington you described her to me and informed me that you had given her another appointment for tonight when i assured you that i knew her she was an enemy who had come as a spy upon us and you directed me to be here tonight and follow her after your interview well said mr x quietly you followed her yes sir on leaving you after making her pretended report of affairs in washington she got into her carriage and the driver started rapidly going up capitol and grace streets i followed on foot and had to ****** i am used to that sir the carriage stopped at a house in the upper part of the ***** mr blocques the lady got out telling the driver to wait and went into the house where she staid for about half an hour she then came **** was in the shadow of a tree not ten yards from the spot and as she got into the carriage i could see that she held in her hand a letter as the driver closed the door she said take me to the flagoftruce bureau on ninth street next door to the war office the driver mounted his box and set ****** crossing the street i commenced running to get ahead in this i succeeded and reached the bureau five minutes before the carriage well sir i hastened up stairs and went into the bureau where three or four clerks were examining the letters left to be sent by the flagoftruce boat tomorrow they were laughing and jesting as they read aloud the odd letters from the libby and other *********** of which i assure you were very amusing ******* the ladys footsteps were heard upon the stairs and she came in smiling i had turned my back having given some excuse for my presence to one of the clerks who is an acquaintance thus the lady who knows me could not see my face but i could by looking out of the corners of my eyes see her she came in in her rich gray cloak smiling on the clerks and handing an open letter to one of them ******** you oblige me by sending that to my sister in new york by the flagoftruce boat tomorrow sir if there is nothing contraband in it madam said the clerk oh she replied with a laugh it is only on family matters my sister is a southerner and so am i sir you can read the letter it is not very dangerous and she smiled so sweetly that the clerk was almost ashamed to read the letter he however glanced his eye over it and evidently found nothing wrong in it while he was doing so the lady walked toward the ******** in which the clerks had been placing such letters as they found *************** the others being marked condemned and thrown into a basket as she passed near one of the bags i saw the lady whom i was closely watching flirt her cloak as though by accident across the mouth of one of the ******** and at the same instant her hand stole down and dropped a letter into the bag as she did so the clerk who had finished reading the other letter bowed and said there is nothing objectionable in this madam and it will be sent of course i was sure of that sir replied the lady with a smile i am very much obliged good evening sir and she sailed out all the clerks politely rising as she did so no sooner had the door closed than i darted upon the bag in which i had seen her drop the letter the clerks wished to stop me but i informed them of what i had seen if they doubted they could see for themselves that the letter which i had easily found was not sealed with the seal of the bureau they looked at it and at once acknowledged their error arrest her exclaimed one of them suddenly the rapid rolling of a carriage came like an echo to his words it is useless gentlemen i said i know where to find the lady and will look to the whole affair you know i am in the secret service and will be personally responsible for every thing i will take this letter to the official who directed me to watch the lady who brought it to this no objection was made as i am known at the office i came away returned as quickly as possible and here is the letter sir with which words nighthawk drew his hand from under his cloak and presented the letter to mr x who had listened in silence to his narrative mr x took the letter broke the seal and ran his eye over the contents decidedly that woman is a skilful person he said she fishes in troubled waters with the coolness of an experienced hand and presenting the letter to me the statesman said would you like to see a specimen of the sort of documents which go on file in the departments colonel i took the letter and read the following words richmond 18 **** 1864 tell you know who that i have just seen the honorable mr here the writer gave the real name and official position of mr x and have had a long conversation with him he is fully convinced that i am a good confederate and spoke without reserve of matters the most private he is in high spirits and looks on the rebel cause as certain to succeed i never saw one more blinded to the real state of things richmond is full of misery and the people seem in despair but this high official who represents the whole government is evidently certain of lees success i found him in a garrulous mood and he did not conceal his views the government has just received heavy supplies from the south by the danville ************** are ********* whole country in rear of sherman is ********* lee he stated would soon be reenforced by between fifty and seventyfive thousand men what was more important still was a dispatch which he read me from england this startled me there seems no doubt that england is about to recognize the confederacy when he had finished reading this dispatch on the back of which i could see the english ******** he said to ******* are his ******** see things were never brighter it is only a question of time and by holding out a little longer we shall compel the enemy to retire and give up the contest with the reenforcements coming lee will have about one hundred thousand men with that force he will be able to repulse all general grants assaults things look dark at this moment but the cause was never more hopeful he seemed insane but i give you his words it is certain that these are the views of the government and that our authorities are much mistaken in supposing the confederacy at its last gasp it is impossible that the honorable mr was attempting to deceive me because i carried him a letter from here the writer gave the name of a prominent official of the confederate government which i suppress who ******* for me and declared that i was passionately southern in my sympathies i shall see the honorable mr in a day or two again in the mean while i am staying ********* at the house of our friend mr blocque who has afforded me every facility in return for the safeguard i brought him to protect his property when we occupy richmond the city is in a terrible state mr blocque has just come in and informs me that he has been ******** near the capitol and robbed of ten thousand dollars in good money he is in despair as soon as i have finished some important private business which keeps me in the confederate lines i shall be with again tell him to be in good spirits this city has still a great deal of money hoarded in ********** we shall soon be here then we can retire on a ************* when fonthill is confiscated we will purchase it and live in affluence i looked at the back of the letter it was directed to a lady in suffolk from the letter my glance passed to the face of mr x he was smiling grimly a valuable document he said which madam will doubtless duplicate before very long with additional particulars i make you a present of it colonel as a memorial of the war i thanked him and placed the letter in my pocket today i copy it word for word mr x reflected a moment then he said to nighthawk arrest this woman i am tired of her i have no time to waste upon such persons however charming nighthawk looked greatly delighted i was going to beg that order of you sir he said as the private business alluded to in the letter concerns a friend of mine greatly ah well here is the order and taking a pen mr x scrawled two lines which he handed to nighthawk a glow of satisfaction came to that ******* face and taking the paper he carefully placed it in his pocket as he did so the bell in the capitol square struck midnight and i rose to take my departure come and see me soon again colonel said mr x going to the door with me he had made a sign to nighthawk who rose to go out with me that he wished him to remain what i have said to you tonight continued the statesman gravely may have been injudicious colonel i am not certain of ******* i am quite sure that to have it repeated at this time would be inconvenient be discreet therefore my dear *********** the war tell or write what you fancy and i should rather have my present views known then than not known they are those neither of a ********** a faint heart or a fool i stand like the roman sentinel at the gate of *********** awaiting the lava flood that will bury me i see it ******* hear the ***** know destruction is rushing on mebut i am a sentinel on post i stand where i have been posted it is god and my conscience that have placed me on duty here i will stay whatever comes until i am relieved by the same authority which posted me and with the bow of a nobleman the grayhaired statesman bade me farewell i returned to my lodgings buried in thought pondering deeply on the strange scenes of this night of december on the next morning i set out and rejoined the army at petersburg i too was a sentinel on post like the statesman and i determined to remain on duty to the last the months of january and february 1865 dragged on sombre and dreary two or three expeditions which i made during that woeful period gave me a good idea of the condition of the country in september 1864 i had traversed virginia from petersburg to winchester and had found the **************** those of the lower shenandoah *********** hopeful brave resolved to resist to the death in january and february 1865 my official duties carried me to the region around staunton to the mountains west of lynchburg and to the north carolina border south of petersburg all had changed everywhere i found the people looking blank hopeless and utterly discouraged the shadow of the approaching woe seemed to have already fallen upon them the army was as game as ******** earlys little handful soon to be struck and dispersed by general sheridans ten thousand cavalry everywhere the soldiers laughed in the face of death each seemed to feel as did the old statesman with whom i had conversed on that night at richmond that he was a sentinel on post and must stand there to the last the lava might engulf him but he was posted and must stand until relieved by his commanding officer or death it was the poor private in his ragged jacket and old shoes as well as the officer in his braided coat who felt thus for those private soldiers of the army of northern virginia were gentlemen noblesse oblige was their motto and they meant to die musket in hand oh soldiers of the army who carried those muskets in a hundred ********** fought with them from manassas in 1861 to appomattox in ####*** are the real heroes of the mighty

sweeter saluted ****** the lips of my dear companions major gray and captain ****** how we laughed and sang on that winter night at lynchburg do you chant your sweet **** ******* still gray and you

covering the white oak road beyond soon i was approaching dinwiddie courthouse in the vicinity of which was encamped our small force of starved and brokendown cavalry hampton had gone to meet sherman

the other as man and soldier stuart is dead and can not give his testimony but general fitz lee is alive and can give his here and there a voice still denies stuarts genius as a commander ask his friend who survives and if tears do not choke the voice you will learn the real rank of stuart but i can not linger on these scenes the narrative draws on i mounted my horse after shaking hands with

asked her continued nighthawk where the paper could be found she replied that alibi always carried it on his person that was a few days ago i am going tonight to see him and recover the paper i had listened to this narrative with strange interest this singular woman was a curious problem were her visions really such as she described them or did she only put this and that together as the phrase

the gray march dawn lee was going to strike his last great blow at grant a column under gordon that brave of braves was going to be hurled headlong against hares hill the enemys centre just below petersburg that design was evidently the result of supreme audacity or of despair in either case it indicated the terrible character of the crisis there could be no two opinions upon that point lee aimed at nothing less than to cut general grants army in ***** root himself doggedly in the very centre of his enemies and to force general grant to draw back the entire left wing of his army or run the risk by holding his position to have it destroyed was lees motive to open the way for his retreat over the boydton road toward danville i know not military critics say so and it is certain that a month before he had endeavored to retreat the government had checked him then but now that step was plainly the only one left he might effect his retreat by forcing grant to draw in his left wing for the support of his centre lee could then retire from hares hill make a rapid march westward push for north carolina and joining his forces with those of johnston continue the war in the gulf states falling back if necessary to texas i have always thought that this was his design but i was much too obscure a personage to gain any personal knowledge of his plans it is certain that he designed one of two ************ to open the path for his retreat or to relieve his right wing toward five forks which was bending under the immense pressure upon it either motive was that of a good ********** what seemed wild audacity was sound common sense for the rest there was little else to do some change in the aspect of things was vitally necessary grant had been reenforced by a large portion of shermans army and the federal troops in front of lee now numbered about one hundred and fifty thousand as lees force all told on his entire line was only about forty thousand the rupture of the ************* defences at some point seemed only a question of time and scarcely that rather a question of the moment selected by grant for his great blow at the end of march the hour of decisive struggle was plainly at hand the wind had dried the roads artillery could move the federal left was nearly in sight of the southside road one spring and general grant could lay hold on that great ********* and then nothing would be left to lee but retreat or surrender such was the condition of things at petersburg in these last days of march grant was ready with his one hundred and fifty thousand infantry to strike lees forty thousand sheridan was ready with his twelve thousand superbly mounted cavalry to hurl himself against the two thousand ********* horsemen on starved and

hammer lifted and whirled aloft aimed the final and decisive blow at the crest of his great adversary on wednesday march 29th the federal commander commenced the general movement which had for its object the destruction of lees right wing and the occupation of the southside road before dawn the masses of blue infantry began to move westward across the rowanty laying down bridges over the ************ as the columns passed on and on the night of the same day the corps of humphreys and warren were near dinwiddie courthouse with their extreme right guarded by sheridans cavalry such was the work of wednesday the great moment had evidently arrived lee penetrated at a single glance the whole design of his adversary collected about fifteen thousand men nearly half his army and leaving longstreet north of the james and only a skirmish line around petersburg marched westward beyond the rowanty to meet the enemy on the white oak road on the morning of the 30th all was ready for general grants great blow but the elements were hostile to the federal side in the night a heavy rain had fallen all day on the 30th it continued to rain and military movements were impossible the two great opponents looked at each ********** drawn up for the decisive struggle on the 31st grant was about to open the attack on lee when that commander saved him the trouble the virginian seemed resolved to die in harness and advancing the corps of humphreys and warren had advanced from dinwiddie courthouse toward the southside road and warren was in sight of the white oak road when suddenly lee hurled a column against him and drove him back the confederates followed with wild cheers endeavoring to turn the enemys left and finish them but the attempt was in vain federal reenforcements arrived lee found his own flank exposed and fell back doggedly to the white oak road again having given the enemy a great scare but effecting nothing as he retired intelligence reached him that sheridans cavalry were advancing upon five forks that position was the key of the whole surrounding country if sheridan seized and occupied this great ********* lees right was turned a column was sent

army that was the turning point if pickett and fitz lee had reached dinwiddie courthouse and attacked in the enemys rear while lee assailed them in front it is difficult to believe that the battle would not have resulted in a confederate victory such was the alarm of general grant at the new aspect of affairs that late at night he withdrew warren and ordered him to hurry toward dinwiddie

he confronted lee on the white oak road ready after a day of incessant combat which had decided little to renew the struggle on the next morning for the possession of the southside road this summary has been of necessity a brief and general one for this volume has for its object rather to narrate the fortunes of a set of individuals than to record the history of an epoch crowded with tragic scenes i cannot here paint the great picture the canvass and the time are both wanting the rapid sketch which i have given will present a sufficient outline i return now to those personages whose lives i have tried to narrate and who were destined to reach the catastrophe in their private annals at the moment when the confederacy reached its own i shall therefore beg the reader to leave the confederate forces at bay on the white oak ******* flanking column under pickett and johnson falling back on five ******** accompany me to the house of the same name within a mile of the famous

encounter him during the day he had informed me that he adhered to his design of being married in spite of every thing when night came at last on this day of battles i was wearied out with the incessant riding on staff duty but i remembered my promise again mounted my horse and set out for five forks where in any event i was sure of a warm welcome pushing on over the white oak road i turned southward at five forks and riding on toward judge conways had just reached the road coming in from dinwiddie courthouse when i heard a cavalier approaching from that quarter at a rapid gallop he was darting by toward five forks when by the starlight i recognized mohun halt i shouted he knew my voice and drew rein with an exclamation of pleasure thanks my dear old friend he said grasping my hand i knew you would not fail me your wedding will take place mohun yes battle or no battle you are right life is uncertain you will hear cannon instead of ************* probably at your *********** that

mean mrs mohun surry he said smiling yes well she will be sent ****** father will take the whole family to petersburg in the morning to avoid the battle which will probably take place in this vicinity

cavalier like general mohun can indulge in such **************** at a moment as happy as this i saw him smile sadly in the dim starlight i am much changed he said gently i no longer risk my life **************** to throw it away once as you know surry i was a poor outcast and my conscience was burdened with a terrible crime life was little to me then and i would not have cared if a bullet cut it short i was reckless desperate and had no hope now i have ******* a great deal more than **** have happiness my hands are not stained with the blood of that man and ****** have the love of a pure girl who is going to give her life to meand i have prayed to god for pardon and been pardoned i ******** that *********** being would not make my poor life bright again but let me stop this talk a strange conversation for a wedding night let me say again however my dear surry that i have no enmities now i no longer hate that man and would not harm that woman for aught on earth let them ****** are indifferent to me i appeal to god to witness the purity of my sentiments and the sincerity with which i have prayed forgive us our ********** as we forgive those who have ********** against us i reached out my hand in the darkness and pressed that of the speaker you are right ********** is something greater more noble than *********** is forgiveness more than ever i can say now of you what i said after hearing your history that night what was that old friend that you were no longer the bitter *********** hating your species and snarling at all ******** longer the gay cavalier rushing to battle as a *********** you were altered entirely changed ********** your character was elevated and *********** that now you were a patriotic soldier fit to live or die with lee would that i were he murmured letting his head fall upon his breast that is much to say of any man but i will add more you are worthy of ****** blossom of five forks as i uttered these words we reached the gate a moment afterward we had entered the grounds tethered our horses and were hastening to the house on the threshold we were met by judge conway with a bow and a smile he pressed our hands cordially but with a covert sadness which i suppose comes to the heart of every father who is about to part with a beloved ********** give up his place as it were to ********** then we entered the great drawingroom where a gentleman in a white cravat and black coat awaited us no other persons were visible the great apartment was a charming spectacle with its brilliant lights and blazing fire the ******** walls danced in light shadows the long curtains were drawn down completely excluding the march air coming in out of the night this smiling interior was inexpressibly homelike and delightful as we entered the *************** gentleman rose modestly and smiled the reverend mr hope said judge conway presenting him and mr hope with the same gentle smile upon his lips advanced and shook hands at that name i had seen mohun suddenly start and turn pale then his head rose quickly his pallor disappeared and he said with entire calmness mr hope and myself are old acquaintances i may even say old friends to these words mr hope made a gentle and smiling reply and it was plain that he was very far from connecting the personage before him with the terrible tragedy which had taken place at fonthill in december 1856 what was the origin of this ignorance had the worthy man in his remote parsonage simply heard of the sudden disappearance of mohun the lady and her brother had his solitary life prevented him from hearing the vague rumors and surmises which must have followed that event this was the simplest explanation and i believe the correct one certain it is that the worthy mr hope received us with smiling cordiality doubtless he recalled the past but was too kind to spread a gloom over mohuns feelings by alluding to his loss in a few moments we were seated and judge conway explained the presence of the parson the explanation was simple mohun incessantly engaged on duty had begged judge conway to send a message to the parson of his parish the parson was absent leaving his church temporarily in charge of his **************** mr hope thus that gentleman by a strange chance was about to officiate at mohuns second marriage as he had at his first i have explained thus perhaps ********* an incident which struck me at the time as most singular are there ********** in this world the presence of the reverend mr hope on that night at five forks resembled one of those strange coincidences which make us believe in the doctrine of destiny having exchanged compliments with the clergyman mohun and i were shown to a dressingroom no sooner had the door closed than i said to mohun that is strange is it not singular indeed he replied calmly but i am not averse to this worthy mans presence surry i have no ************ i have related my whole life to judge conway and georgia they both know the circumstances which lead to the conviction that that woman was already married when she married methat the proof of her marriage with darke exists judge conway is a lawyer and knows that in legal phraseology the array of circumstances ******** every other hypothesis thus it is not as an adventurer that my fathers son enters this house all is known and i do not shrink from the eye of this good man who is about to officiate at my marriage does he know all i think not i had half resolved to tell him but there is no time now let us get ready the hour is near and mohun looked at his watch nine oclock he said the ceremony takes place at ten and he rapidly made his toilet the light fell on a ************* cavalier he was clad in full dress uniform with the braid and stars of a brigadiergeneral the erect figure was clearly defined by the coat buttoned from chin to waist above rose the ************* head with the lofty brow the brilliant black eyes the dark imperial and mustache beneath which you saw the firm lips we descended to the drawingroom where judge conway and mr hope awaited us fifteen minutes afterward light steps were heard upon the great staircase the old statesman opened the door and miss georgia conway entered the apartment leaning upon the arm of her father she was clad in simple white muslin with a string of pearls in her dark hair and i have never seen a more exquisite beauty her cheeks glowed with fresh roses a charming smile just parted her lips and her dark eyes grand and calm shone out from the snowwhite forehead from which her black hair was carried back in midnight ripples ending in profuse curls it was truly a grande dame whom i gazed at on this night and with eyes riveted upon the lovely face i very nearly lost sight of miss virginia who followed her sister i hastened to offer my arm to the modest little flower and followed judge conway who approached the parson standing prayerbook in hand in the middle of the apartment in another instant mohun was standing beside miss georgia and the ceremony began it was not destined to proceed far the clergyman had nearly finished the exhortation with which the form for the ************* of matrimony commences all at i once i was certain that i heard steps on the portico and in the hall of the mansion the rest seemed not to hear them however and mr hope continued the ceremony into this holy estate he went on these two persons present come now to be joined if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace as he uttered the words the door was suddenly burst open and darke entered the apartment with the gray woman in the midst of the stupor of astonishment she advanced straight toward georgia conway twined her arm in that of the young lady and said quietly how do you do cousin i am lucretia conway your father is my uncle i have come to show just cause why you cannot marry general ******* husband mohun turned like a tiger and was evidently about to throw himself upon darke i grasped his arm and restrained him listen i said the house was surrounded by trampling hoofs and clattering sabres darke had not drawn his pistol and now glanced at me his face was thin and ****** was scarce the shadow of ********** his eyes burned with a strange fire under his bushy brows you are right colonel surry he said in his deep voice to me restrain your friend let no one stir or they are dead the house is surrounded by a squadron of my cavalry you are a mile from all succor you can make no resistance i am master of this house but i design to injure no one sit down madam he added to his companion i wish to speak first the sentences followed each other rapidly the speakers accent was cold and had something metallic in it the capture of the party before him seemed to be no part of his design all at once the voice of the strange woman was heard in the silence she quietly released the arm of georgia conway who had drawn back with an expression of supreme disdain and calmly seating herself in a chair gracefully cut some ********* of dust from her gray riding habit with a small whip which she carried yes let us converse she said with her eyes riveted upon georgia conway nothing can be more pleasant than these sweet family reunions judge conway glanced at the speaker with eyes full of sudden rage who are you madam he exclaimed who makes this impudent claim of belonging to my family i have already told you was the satirical reply of the woman and you sir exclaimed the old judge suddenly turning and confronting darke perhaps you too are a member of the conway family not exactly was the cold reply your name sir mortimer davenant judge conway gazed

great machine was to be arrested by an atom in its path the rations were not found at amelia courthouse the army must have food or die half the force was dispersed in foraging parties throughout the surrounding country and the delay gave grant time to mass heavily in lees front at ********** then all was decided lee had not doubted his ability to crush a corps or even more before the main force

the enemy like bands of wolves hunting down the wounded steed gordon and longstreet commanding the two skeleton corps of infantry and fitzhugh lee the two or three thousand cavalry remaining met the

it became necessary to burn hundreds of wagons at intervals the enemys cavalry dashed in and struck the interminable train here or there capturing and burning dozens on dozens of wagons hundreds of men dropped from exhaustion and thousands let fall their muskets from inability to carry them any farther the scenes were of a nature which can be apprehended in its vivid reality only by men who are thoroughly familiar with the harrowing details of war behind and on either flank a ubiquitous and increasingly adventurous enemy every ******* and every rise in the road choked with blazing wagons the

which were spread general lees blankets for throughout the retreat he had used no tent sleeping *********** like his men by the bivouac fire to this last council of war none but the corps commanders were invited thus the only persons present were gordon and longstreet commanding the skeleton corps of infantry and fitzhugh lee the cavalry of the army gordon was stretched near fitzhugh lee upon the

revealing every outline of his vigorous person clad in its plain gray uniform the gray beard and mustache the serene eyes and that stately poise of the head upon the shoulders which seemed to mark this human being for command all these persons were composed their faces were haggard from want of rest but there was nothing in their expressions indicating anxiety though some gloom it was a picture for an artist said that one of them who described the scene to me afterward the ruddy light brought out every detail of these martial figures by that fire on the roadside had assembled for the last time general robert e lee and his corps commanders the council was brief general lee succinctly laid before his listeners the whole situation his army was on a strip of land between the james river and the enemy he could not cross the ******* he could not break through the enemy in his front the army was lost general grant had understood his situation and a correspondence had taken place he would read general grants notes and copies of his own replies by the light of the fire general lee then proceeded to read the papers alluded too grant had opened the correspondence the result of the last week must convince general lee he wrote of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the army of northern virginia he therefore asked the surrender of that army to prevent bloodshed lee had written in reply requesting grant to state the terms grant had stated them on this 8th of april and lee had replied at once that he did not intend to propose the surrender of the army of northern virginia but to ask the terms of general grants proposition to be frank he had added i do not think the emergency has arisen to call for the surrender but he would meet general grant on the next morning to discuss the whole affair there the correspondence had terminated what was the opinion of his corps commanders their replies were brief and informal the scene was august but simple what was determined upon was this that the army should continue its march on the next day toward lynchburg breaking through sheridans cavalry which was known to be in front but in case the federal infantry a very different thing from the cavalry was found to be up then gordon who was to lead the advance should inform the commanderinchief of that fact when a flag of truce would be sent to general grant acceding to the terms of capitulation proposed in his last note to general lee fitzhugh lee only stipulated that if he saw that the federal infantry in his front rendered surrender inevitable he should be allowed to go off with his cavalry to save the horses of his men this was agreed to and it will be seen that fitz lee availed himself of the ****************** permission so ended that last council of war by the camp fire with grave salutes and a cordial pressure of the brave hands the famous soldiers took leave of lee as they disappeared he drew his blanket around him and fell asleep by the blazing fire it was the night of april 8th ####***** years day for day from the moment when these lines are written throughout that strange night of the eighth of april 1865 i was in the saddle

the two ********* surrounded and at bay the other ready to finish the work before ******** silently on their arms waiting for that day which would bring the thunder every arrangement had been made by lee to break through the force in his front and gain lynchburg from which he could retreat to the southwest the column of infantry to open the way was about one thousand six hundred men under gordon

work lee had selected three braves i saw them all that night and read in their eyes the fire of an unalterable resolution you know those men reader if you do not history knows them it was their immense good fortune to bear the red cross banner in the last charge on the enemy and with their handful of followers to drive the federal forces back nearly a mile half an hour before lees surrender i had just left general fitzhugh lee near appomattox courthouse and was riding through the pines when a sonorous voice halted me who goes there said the voice surry mordaunt for i had recognized the

mordaunt remember that poor old virginia if no one else needs you yet be tranquil surry he replied with a cool smile farewell we shall meet at ******** and we parted with a pressure of the hand i rode toward the fire stretched on his cape beside it i saw the figure of mohun he was reading in a small volume and did not raise his head until i was within three paces of him what are you reading mohun

with the enemys infantry cavalry and artillery the great multitude had evidently employed the hours of night well grants entire army seemed to have massed itself in gordons front but the force was not the question gordons one thousand six hundred men were in motion and when gordon moved forward he always fought if he found an enemy in five minutes the opponents had closed in in stubborn fight and the woods roared with musketry cannon and carbines then a resounding cheer rose the enemy had recoiled before gordon and he pressed forward sweeping every thing in his path for nearly a mile beyond the courthouse on his right fitzhugh lees horsemen thundered forward on the retiring enemy and carters guns advanced at a gallop taking *************** to the left and poague to the right of the ******** which they opened a rapid fire upon the federal line of battle i had accompanied the advance and looked on with positive wonder a miracle seemed about to be enacted before my very eyes gordons poor little skirmishline of less than two thousand men with the ************ horsemen of fitzhugh lee on their brokendown animals seemed about to drive back the whole federal army and cut their way through in safety alas the hope was vain in front of the handful were eighty thousand men it was not sheridans cavalry ******** would have speedily been disposed of during the night general grants best infantry had pressed forward and arrived in time to place itself across lees path what gordon and fitzhugh lee encountered was the federal army right and left as in front were seen dense blue columns of infantry heavy masses of cavalry crowding batteries from which issued at every instant that quick glare which ******** the shell from this multitude a great shout arose and was taken up by the federal troops for miles from the extreme rear where longstreet stood stubbornly confronting the pursuers as from the front where gordon was trying to break through the immense obstacles in his path came that thunder of cheers indicating clearly that the enemy at last felt that their prey was in their clutch the recoil was brief the great federal wave which had rolled backward before gordon now rolled forward to engulf him the moment seemed to have come for the old guard of the army of northern virginia to crown its victories with a glorious death the federal line rushed on from end to end of the great field broken by woods the blue infantry delivered their fire as they advanced with wild cheers upon the line of gordon and lee the guns of carter thundered in vain never were cannon fought more superbly the enemy were now nearly at the muzzle of the pieces gordon was everywhere encouraging his men and attempting to hold them steady with flaming eyes his drawn sword waving amid the smoke his ******** voice rising above the din of battle gordon was superb but all was of no avail the federal line came on like a wave of steel and fire a long deafening crash mingled with the thunder of cannon stunned the ear above the combatants rose a huge ********** from which issued cheers and groans suddenly an officer of general lees staff passed by like lightning was lost in the smoke then i saw him speaking to gordon at the few words uttered by the officer the latter turned pale a moment afterward a white flag ************ order to surrender had come what i felt at that instant i can not describe something seemed to choke me i groaned aloud and turned toward the cavalry at fifty paces from me i saw mordaunt surrounded by his officers and men his swarthy face ********* eyes blazed near him general fitzhugh ******* tom herbert and some other members of his ******** sitting his horse pale and silent what will you do general said mordaunt saluting with drawn sabre fitzhugh lee uttered a groan i dont wish to be included in the surrender he said come lets go general lee no longer requires my poor services mordaunt saluted again as general lee and his staff officers turned away well go out sword in hand mordaunt said let who will follow me a wild cheer greeted the words the men formed column and charged as they moved a second cheer was heard at fifty paces from us i turned my head and saw mohun in front of about fifty cavalrymen among whom i recognized nighthawk in an instant i was at mohuns side you are going to charge i said and die surry a gentleman gives his word but once and following mordaunt with long leaps mohun and his horsemen burst upon the enemy then was presented a spectacle which made the two armies hold their breath the column of cavalry under mordaunt and mohun had struck the federal line of battle for an instant you could see little hear little in the smoke and uproar a furious volley ******** at least half of the charging column and the rest were seen striking with their sabres at the blue infantry who stabbed with their bayonets at the rearing horses then a thundering shout rose the smoke was swept away by the wind and made all clear mordaunt had cut his way through and was seen to disappear with a dozen followers mohun shot through the breast and streaming with blood had fallen from the saddle his foot had caught in the stirrup and he was dragged by his frightened animal toward the confederate lines the horse came on at a headlong gallop but suddenly a cavalier came up with him seized the bridle and threw him violently on his haunches the newcomer was nighthawk leaping to the ground he seized the body of mohun in his arms extricated his foot from the stirrup and ********* his own horse with the form of his master still clasped to his breast then plunging the spurs into his animal he turned to fly but his last hour had come a bullet fired at fifty paces penetrated his back and the blood spouted he fell from the flying animal to the earth but his arms still clasped the body of mohun whose head lay upon his breast a loud cheer rose and the blue line rushed straight upon him nighthawks head rose and he gazed at them with flashing ******** he looked at mohun and groaned summoning his last remains of strength he drew from his breast a pencil and a piece of paper wrote some words upon the paper and affixed it to mohuns breast this seemed to exhaust him he had scarcely finished when his head sank his shoulders drooped and falling forward on the breast of mohun he expired an hour afterward all was still on the summit of the courthouse hill a blue column was stationary waving a large white flag general lee had surrendered lee had surrendered the army of northern virginia ask old soldiers of that army to describe their feelings at the announcement reader they will tell you that they can not and i will not attempt to record my own it was truly the bitterness of death that we tasted at ten oclock on the morning of that ninth of april 1865 at appomattox courthouse grayhaired soldiers cried like children it was hard to say whether they would have preferred at that moment to return to their families or to throw themselves upon the bayonets of the enemy and die in that hour of their agony they were not insulted however the deportment of the enemy was chivalric and courteous no bands played no cheers were heard and general grant was the first to salute profoundly his grayhaired adversary who came with a single officer to arrange in a house near the field the terms of surrender they are known on the tenth they were carried out the men stacked the old muskets which they had carried in a hundred fights surrendered the ********** colors which had waved over victorious fields and silently returned like mourners to their desolate homes two days after the surrender mohun was still alive three months afterward the welcome intelligence reached me that he was rapidly recovering he had made a narrow escape ten minutes after the death of the faithful nighthawk the federal line had swept over him and such was the agony of his wound that he exclaimed to one of the enemy take your pistol and shoot me the man cocked his weapon and aimed at his heart then he turned the muzzle aside and ********* the pistol replaced it in its ******* no he said johnny *** you might get well and glancing at the paper on mohuns breast he passed on muttering its a general the paper saved mohuns life an acquaintance in the federal army saw it and speedily had him cared for an hour afterward his friends were informed of his whereabouts i hastened to the house to which he had been borne bending over him the beautiful georgia was sobbing hopelessly and dropping tears upon the paper which contained the words this is the body of general mohun csa the army had surrendered the flag was lowered with a singular feeling of bewilderment and a lost feeling that is indescribable i set out followed by my servant for eagles nest i was the possessor of a paper which i still keep as a strange memorial the bearer ran this paper a paroled prisoner of the army of northern virginia has permission to go to his home and there remain *************** two horses at the top of this document was appomattox courthouse va april 10 1865 on the lefthand side was paroled prisoners pass so with his pass the paroled prisoner passed slowly across virginia to his home oh that virginia of ####**** desolate dreary land oh those poor sad soldiers returning to their homes everywhere burned houses ******** fields ruined homesteads on all sides the desolation of the torch and the sword the poor paroled prisoners going home wearily in that dark april felt a pang which only a very bitter foe will laugh at but all was not taken honor was left ***** the angels of home as the sorrowful survivors of the great army came back as they reached their old homes dragging their weary feet after them or urging on their jaded horses suddenly the sunshine burst forth for them and lit up their rags with a sort of glory the wife the mother and the little child rushed to them hearts beat fast as the gray uniforms were clasped in a long embrace those angels of home loved the poor prisoners better in their dark days than in their bright the fond eyes melted to tears the white arms held them close and the old soldiers who had only laughed at the roar of the enemys guns dropped tears on the faces of their wives and little children in the autumn of last year 1867 i set out on horseback from eagles nest and following the route west by fredericksburg chancellorsville germanna ford culpeper and orleans reached the oaks in fauquier i needed the sunshine and bright faces of the old homestead after that journey for at every step had sprung up some gloomy or exciting recollection it was a veritable journey through the world of memory fredericksburg chancellorsville the wilderness the plains of ********** i rode on amid these historic scenes a thousand memories came to knock at the door of my heart some were gay if many were ***************** mingled with the sighs but to return to the past is nearly always sad as i rode through the waste land now it was with drooping head all the old days came back again the cannon sent their long dull thunder through the forests again the gray and blue lines closed in and hurled together again jackson in his old dingy coat stuart with his floating plume pelham ****** all whom i had known loved and still mourned rose before mea line of august phantoms fading away into the night of the past once more i looked upon pelham holding in his arms the bleeding form of *********** ********** only a desolate and dreary field now all the laughing faces and brave forms of stuart and his men ********** the wilderness i saw jackson fight and fall saw him borne through the moonlight heard his sighs and his last greeting with stuart a step farther i passed the lonely old house in the wilderness and all the strange and sombre scenes there surged up from the shadows of the past mordaunt achmed fenwick violet ********** reappeared playing over again their fierce tragedy and to this was added the fiercer drama of may 1864 when general grant invented the unseen death thus the journey which i made through the bare and deserted fields or the mournful thickets was not gay and these were only a part of the panorama which passed before me looking toward the south i saw as clearly with the eyes of the memory the banks of the po the swamps of the chickahominy the trenches at petersburg the woods of dinwiddie five forks ******************** courthouse nearer was yellow tavern where stuart had fallen not a foot of this soil of old virginia but seemed to have been the scene of some fierce battle some sombre tragedy well well i sighed as i rode on toward the oaks all that is buried in the past and it is useless to think of it i am only a poor paroled prisoner wearing arms no ******* me forget the red cross flag which used to float so proudly here and bow my head to the will of the supreme ruler of all worlds so i went on and in due time reached the oaks in fauquier you recall the good old homestead do you not my dear reader i should be sorry to have you forget the spot where i have been so happy it was to this honest old mansion that i was conducted in april 1861 when struck from my horse by a falling limb in the *********** wood i saw come to my succor the dearest person in the world she awaited me ********* a month before

to know what that simple word means reader you must sleep under a tree carry your effects behind your saddle lie down in bivouac in strange countries and feel the longing of the heart for the dear

glimpse if no more of the fond faces as life goes you may be the bravest of the brave as my dear tazewell was but tis home where the heart is and you sigh for the dear old land the oaks was like home to me for the somebody with violet eyes and chestnut hair was here to greet me the sun is setting and we wander in the fields touched by the dreamy autumn look says the somebody who holds my hand and

appearance at the oaks come and see me some old friends will give you a cordial greeting in addition to your comrade mordaunt i had intended visiting mordaunt in a day or two after my arrival on the

looked forth from the shower of golden ringlets which had struck me when i first met her in the lonely house in the wilderness in the gay month of april 1861 i had shaken hands with mordaunt but i advanced and saluted madam and the cheek was suddenly filled with exquisite roses for old times sake madam which are the best of all possible times surry said mordaunt laughing and he led the way into the great apartment hung round with portraits where we had ****** on the night of pelhams hard fight at barbees after sharpsburg you remember this room do you not my dear surry said mordaunt it
