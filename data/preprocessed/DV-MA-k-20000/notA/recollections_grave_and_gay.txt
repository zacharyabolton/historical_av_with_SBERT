and later among the wounded her life from this time forward afterward at camp winder near richmond was of the hardest and most heroic kind i have never known any woman possessed of better qualifications for her task with a splendid physique almost unbroken good health a tireless hand and a spirit of tender sympathy she was the ideal attendant upon homesick boys from the far south

********** i grew up in a night and soon there was plenty of womens work for us even now writing of it after so many many years i seem to feel again the pulse of that thrilling time and it was here that there came intimately into my life one of its strongest influences in the radiant person of my cousin hetty cary daughter of my uncle wilson miles cary of baltimore my fathers elder and only brother she with her younger sister jennie had taken the lead in the secessionist movement among the young girls in baltimore who having seen all their best men march across the border to enlist with the confederates for the war relieved their strained feelings by ***** resentment of the union officers and troops placed in possession of their city it was jennie cary who set ******** stirring poem of maryland to the air of ******** ******** brought to her by burton harrison when a student at yale college and first sang it with a chorus of her friends in a drawingroom in baltimore she tells me that the refrain as originally printed in the copy of verses cut by them out of a newspaper was simply maryland and that she added the word my in obedience to the exigency of the music as the song thus boldly chanted by young confederate sympathizers in a city occupied by their enemy and under strict martial rule was to drift over the border to be caught eagerly by the troops of the maryland line and to echo down the ages as the most famous battlesong of the confederacy it is fitting that to miss jennie cary should be awarded all the honor of this achievement we both sang it amid a little group of visitors in september 1861 standing in the doorway of captain ********* tent at manassas the men of the maryland line facing us in the dusk of evening this was in answer to the request sent in from the soldiers to their friend captain ******** that they might hear a womans voice again i can hear now the swing of that grand chorus as the men gradually caught up the refrain and echoed it and by next day to our joy and pride the whole camp at manassas was resounding with my maryland miss hetty cary as fearless as she was beautiful having incurred the displeasure of the military government of baltimore by shaking from the window of her fathers home while the union troops marched by it a confederate banner smuggled through the lines had been warned to leave baltimore under penalty of immediate arrest and transfer to a northern bastile the two sisters carrying drugs for the hospitals and uniforms for friends had run the blockade with their brother crossing to join the

that wave of sound gathering strength and substance as it reached the ear presently emerging from the golden mist we saw first horsemen pacing leisurely then caissons and guns and after them rank upon rank of marching men in gray and above the dust banners of scarlet crossed with blue and as they passed our group some officer recognizing us started a chant caught up along the line and rendered into a grand sonorous swing she breathes she burns shell come shell come maryland my maryland there were our merry hosts joining in the refrain with tremendous **** power and there were we three girls laughing and crying at once in our delight who ever before had the luck or planned with such consummate skill so to entertain guests in the autumn when my cousins had gone to albemarle to visit relatives we three had the honor of being asked by the committee of congress to make the first battleflags of the confederacy after the design finally decided on by them it is generally stated by

miss jennie carys went to general beauregard serving to drape the coffin of beauregard and of jefferson davis and mine to general earl van dorn a dashing cavalry leader for whom was then predicted

a visit springing to arms at the first sound of a cannon in his neighborhood this brilliant young officer who had passed through so many general engagements with safety fell in a terrible fire from

we distinctly heard cries of god bless our president that evening president and mrs davis received at their residence making a most favorable impression upon all richmond we had been hearing a good deal of the inner life of the presidents family from a young inmate of his household destined to play an important part in my life thereafter this was burton ******* harrison born in louisiana of virginia parentage on the fathers side who at the instance of his friend congressman l q c lamar had been summoned by the president to be his private secretary at the moment when mr harrison was about to enlist in new orleans as a private in the ranks of the washington artillery mr harrison having graduated at yale in the class of 1859 had been designated by president f a p barnard then of oxford

to have to order the pallbearers away so proud were they of their dignified position concerning the affairs big or little of the chief mr harrison was wont to preserve continual discreet silence he would say only that the president had the happiest relations with his family by whom he was revered incidentally remarking that to accompany the chief on horseback always his duty together with some of the aides was to sit in the saddle indefinitely in good or bad weather alike never knowing when they were to bring up at home again and keeping mrs davis in continual uncertainty as to her ********** to say nothing of her husbands fate a familiar and picturesque figure was president davis in the streets of richmond from that day forth from richmond scenes in 62 published in battles and leaders of the civil war i reproduce my sketch of him which since it was edited by my husband i feel may be regarded as of some worth he might be seen daily walking through the capitol square from his residence to the executive office in the morning not to return until late in the afternoon or riding just before nightfall to visit one or another of the *********** near the city he was tall erect slender and of a dignified and soldierly bearing with ******** and highbred features and of a demeanor of stately courtesy to all he was clad always in confederate gray cloth and wore a soft felt hat with wide brim afoot his step was brisk and firm in the saddle he rode admirably and with a martial aspect his early life had been spent in the military academy at west point and upon the then northwestern frontier in the black hawk war and he afterward greatly distinguished himself at monterey and buena vista in mexico at the time when we knew him everything in his appearance and manner was suggestive of military training he was reported to feel quite out of place in the office of president with executive and administrative duties in the midst of such a war general lee always spoke of him as the best of military advisers his own inclination was to be with the army and at the first tidings of the sound of a gun anywhere within reach of richmond he was in the saddle and off for the spot to the dismay of his staffofficers who never knew at what hour of the night or of the next day they should get back to bed or to a meal the stories burton harrison told us of his adventures on such excursions were many and sometimes amusing for instance when general lee crossed the chickahominy president davis with several staffofficers and his secretary overtook the column and with the secretary of war and a few other noncombatants forded the river just as the battle of mechanicsville began general lee surrounded by members of his own staff and other officers was found a few hundred yards north of the bridge in the middle of the broad road mounted and busily engaged in directing the attack then about to be made by a brigade sweeping in line over the fields to the east of the road and toward ********* mill where in a few minutes a hot engagement commenced shot from the enemys guns out of sight went whizzing overhead in quick succession striking every moment nearer the group of horsemen in the road as the gunners improved their range general lee observed the presidents approach and was evidently annoyed at what he considered a ********* expedition of needless exposure of the head of the government whose duties were elsewhere he turned his back for a moment until colonel chilton had been despatched at a gallop with the last direction to the commander of the attacking brigade then facing the cavalcade and looking like the god of war indignant he exchanged with the president a salute with the most frigid reserve of anything like welcome or cordiality then without allowance of opportunity for a word from the president the general looking not at him but at the assemblage at large asked in a tone of irritation who are all this army of people and what are they doing here no one moved or spoke but all eyes were upon the president everybody perfectly understood that this was an order for him to retire to a place of safety while the roar of the guns the rattling fire of musketry and the bustle of a battle in progress with troops continually arriving across the bridge to go into action went on the president twisted in his saddle quite taken ***** at such a greeting the general regarding him now with glances of growing severity after a painful pause the president said ************* it is not my army general it certainly is not my army mr president was the prompt reply and this is no place for it in an accent of command such a ****** was a ******* to mr davis who however soon regained his serenity and answered well general if i withdraw perhaps they will follow and raising his hat in another cold salute he turned his horses head to ride slowly toward the bridge seeing as he turned a man killed immediately before him by a shot from a gun which at that moment got the range of the road the presidents own staffofficers followed him as did various others but he presently drew rein in a stream where the high bank and the bushes concealed him from general lees repelling observation and there remained while the battle raged the secretary of war had also made a show of withdrawing but improved the opportunity afforded by rather a deep ditch on the roadside to conceal himself and his horse for a time from general lee who at that moment was more to be dreaded than the enemys guns in the union raid on columbia s c in the spring of 1865 mr daviss bestknown mount a white arabian was captured with all the horses and mules belonging to general james chestnut to whose care the president had entrusted it i find in my album a letter from general chestnut to the president lamenting this occurrence and saying he ranked all his own losses as nothing beside that of the famous steed about march 1 1862 martial law was proclaimed in richmond and from that time till the day of the evacuation we lived amid continually thrilling scenes now came the joyful tidings that my brothers ship the cruiser nashville had successfully slipped

*********** beds night brought a lull in the frightful cannonading we threw ourselves dressed upon our beds to get a little rest before the morrow during the night began the ghastly procession of

wounded two of us girls volunteered to help his mother to search for him through the lower hospitals we tramped down main street through the hot sun over burning pavements from one scene of horror to

could not sleep and talked or listened to the voice of the river that i seem to hear yet over the tramp of rusty battalions the short imperious stroke of the alarm bell the clash of passing bands the

fighting close to the gates of richmond during the battle of mechanicsville the president and many of the cabinet with hundreds of spectators watched its progress from the encircling hills the roofs of the high buildings in the town were also crowded with lookerson and the enemys balloons were plainly visible hovering over the field after dark that night the firing still went on and numbers of people saw the magnificent sight of bombs bursting in air and the flash of thousands of muskets accompanied by the incessant roar of artillery to go home from such a spectacle was to seek a bed but

yet asked the general no sir i believe not yet then go back to your battery my boy and wait until they have after recording these anecdotes i received a visit at belvoir house virginia from captain robert e lee strongly resembling his illustrious father with his wife and little girl ann carter lee he says the rockbridge artillery stories are in the main true he doesnt remember about the shoes but it might well have been what he does recall and has told in his own most interesting book about general lee was once when after one of the battles before richmond black with dirt and smoke he had

conspicuous achievements of the leaders in john ****** ****** splendid story of the civil war i find the following the population of the southern states almost wholly occupied in agricultural pursuits was necessarily accustomed to life in the open air to horses to hunting and fishing to exposure to unusual physical exertion from time to time such conditions of life naturally foster a martial spirit

hands of the able officers who so generally commanded them it cannot be doubted that the southern volunteers frequently ****** successes over their northern adversaries for the simple and sole reason that to them the game of war was not only a perfectly legitimate pursuit but one of the noblest if not the noblest that could claim the devotion of brave and free men they went into it con amore they gave to its duties their most zealous attention and they reaped a full measure of the success which those who throw themselves with all their hearts into any career deserve and generally attain we were in richmond when that desperate fight was fought at antietam of which a war historian has written it is likely that more men were killed and wounded on the 17th of september than on any single

time in some degree ***** up to endurance of the repeated shocks of war we went quietly about our tasks of daily life except for the numbers of people swathed in black met in its thoroughfares richmond showed little trace of its battle summer as yet the pinch of the times did not greatly affect the home commissariat although we refugees had to be satisfied with simple living in other

wherein drawn by mules and ********* on straw we made creeping progress toward centreville on the road we passed a tired woman carrying her baby a crying child tugging at her skirts driven by starvation she said to go inside the union lines we naturally picked them up and the hours that followed were hardly cheerful sleeping at a poor farmhouse that night we awoke to find a party of federal soldiers ****** around it who proceeded to search the premises when we got downstairs the officer in charge was waiting at the breakfasttable although they were in pursuit of some one more important it was necessary for him to know who we were and what our business there property owners in fairfax county going to their home on matters of private business did not seem to suffice him as an explanation we must come with him to report at united states headquarters in centreville lacking other means of advance we then hired the only vehicle of the establishment a pole on four wheels drawn by two oxen and balanced upon this our trunks bound on somehow by the depressed confederate *********** who drove us a ********** guard walking on either side we superbly entered the village of centreville at headquarters the officials in charge made a thoroughly conscientious effort to penetrate our disguise of innocence and stamp us guilty but the case baffled them a full examination of our luggage failed to develop anything save the fact that confederate principles were antagonistic in a marked degree to the theory of personal adornment in the perplexity of the situation they decided to send us on as prisoners of war to brigadiergeneral hayes stationed at union mills on the orange and alexandria railroad whence they said parties of refugees from the rebel lines were daily ********* to alexandria the bitter cold drive of six miles to union mills in a little open trap plunging up and down in deep ruts of frozen clay cut by army wagons in a heavy soil or going at a ****** pace between six stolid germans holding their bayonets as they marched on either side of us was actually the most painful experience of our adventure my aunt with her stately figure and beautiful clear profile in her mourning garb sitting so calm and ************** amid her strange surroundings reminded me of some grande dame of the french revolution going in a ******* to execution for nothing in the world would she have condescended to make a complaint we had deliberately placed ourselves in this situation and must make the best of it ahead of us were several wagons loaded up with country refugees germans and irish going to washington to take oath of allegiance and seek for better fortunes one of these vehicles piled high with household goods upset and there were wails from the women and children belonging to it though nobody was badly hurt while waiting for them to clear the road we suffered intensely with the cold arriving finally at union mills so thoroughly ********* it was hard to set our feet upon terra firma stumbling to the ground we paid our driver and were shown into a room heated to suffocation by a redhot stove and crowded with the unhappy refugees men women and children who had arrived ahead of us all nearly ********* of cold and fatigue we gave but one glance into the interior and turned away sickened by the noxious atmosphere to meet a smart young staffofficer who with the most astonished face i ever saw could not for the life of him understand what we two were doing there ten minutes later seated before a bright fire in the officers quarters above we were kindly and courteously urged to partake of hot coffee which we accepted and champagne which we refused how long it had been since we had seen champagne a room hastily made ready contained two army cots gayly striped blankets tin basins set upon a bench delicious toilet soap and towels a mirror and two tall tin **** of boiling water a tray of supper sent in with the generals compliments filled our hearts with overflowing gratitude to our noble foes i am glad ive ********* warrant for it for i simply love my enemies one of us exclaimed in heartfelt tones a *********** the ******* crowded with the poor emigrants on benches afforded the sole means for our getting on next day our kind host the general relieved his mind of us by letting us go to alexandria on parole under supervision of the provostmarshal there by order from his headquarters we were allowed to travel in the cab of the engine and thus whizzing past many a wellknown landmark in our county we regained the old town left two years before under such different circumstances we went at once to my uncles house in cameron street where my greataunts were installed and spent a day or two with them going about in the interval among old friends things looked very sad the secession spirit in the town kept under by a rod of iron giving people a wistful ***** expression and the streets crowded with alien soldiers wherever we went in shop or dwellings our hands were grasped with speechless sympathy tears ******** the utterance of greetings then we were hurried into corners to ask about our boys when i compared our shabby clothes with their apparently smart ones they would exclaim but what are clothes to standing side by side with those one loves in a *********** struggle like ours finally leave was accorded us by authority to visit washington and remain there until some decision could be arrived at in our case we accordingly resorted to the house of a relative at the federal capital and with brief delay visited ****** bank where my aunt had the infinite relief of depositing her valuable papers and realizing upon them funds much needed by our refugee family in the confederacy for a few days we indulged in the pleasure of daily seeing my aunt mrs irwin and her children and other dear friends as well as the unwonted practice of shopping in establishments that after the barren wilderness of ************ shelves in richmond seemed resplendent then fell a thunderbolt certain union sympathizers among our whilom friends having taken pains to communicate to the secretary of war that he was ********* dangerous characters from the seat of rebellion nearly allied with the leaders of confederate government and full of menace to the union cause an order was sent to us which i transcribe a trim young lieutenant with good manners and as afterward developed a feeling heart lieutenant clark smith of the ###** new york regiment stood in the hall below as the instrument of fate there was a wild rush of packing surrounded by zealous friends whatever it was possible to squeeze into the dixie trunks with little presents for all our circle went into them much was worn a good deal condensed into hand luggage a smart braided riding habit a gown or two and other coveted ********** had to be left with their ****** ultimately reaching us by flag of truce but one thing i could not entirely forsake a new hat an ********** luxury since many months that had been tried on and was waiting orders at the milliners we had no sooner seated ourselves in the carriage opposite the polite lieutenant than a siege of the enemy ensued shorter but no less successful than that of richmond in the end our carriage on its way to the boat wharf drew up before the door of miss wilsons fashionable millinery in pennsylvania avenue and our lieutenant issuing from it returned carrying a ******* i hope this ************* has long ago been forgiven him the new hat so thought the richmond girls was well worth a dash upon the enemy i should perhaps have mentioned before the adventure of the hat that we had been driven first to the office of provostmarshal todd where the oath of allegiance to the united states government was offered and declined with thanks mr montgomery blair had sent me a note addressed to those in high authority stating that as i was the child of an early friend of his he would be glad if circumstances would allow them to grant my requests i suppose they were that we should not be molested but allowed to stay and shop since that was really all i wanted but this did not avail we were told that we must positively return to virginia as we had come and that without delay in alexandria once more we spent the night as prisoners of war on an upper floor of my uncles house the lieutenant occupying the little study to the left of the front door a guard upon the pavement from the town we were the recipients of universal sympathy but in our hearts felt that since our work in washington was done and well done our chief desire was now to get back to our friends people flocked to the house asking for us and sending messages one of them miss mary ************ afterward mrs philip **** eluding the guard at the front went in the rear way where she had played as a child with my fairfax cousins climbed through a window and arrived in our room ******** and joyous bearing a parcel of delightful little gifts back at union mills again and surrendered into the hands of our former host we were greeted by jovial general hayes with pleasant

seated in a smart ambulance under escort of a dashing guard of forty men in blue the general himself with two of his staff accompanying us to the limit of the union lines i was in time to come to see my own boy wearing the blue uniform as a member of troop a of new york a volunteer in the united states service in the war with spain in parting i asked if general hayes had any message to send to his old west point comrade general ewell who had lately lost a leg in confederate service we had liked and admired general ewell since the beginning of the war after his wound we went sometimes to call at his lodgings where we generally found installed as guardian of his hearth and spirits his widowed cousin mrs brown and her pretty brighteyed daughter ******** now living in washington as the widow of major thomas turner of kentucky once of general ewells staff general ewells marriage to mrs brown was the outcome of his convalescence from this wound give my best love to good old dick and tell him i wish it had been his head was the laughing answer transmitted in due time we made our way by divers methods and in slow stages across the debatable ground always received for the night by sympathizers eager to greet and hear from us after giving us of their best they managed to ***** up some sort of a horse and vehicle to carry us on the next stage a memorable stop was at the interesting old house of the *********** whose master even at that date wore the ***** and ************ of his ancestors they sent us on in an antique coach of colonial pattern ************ blue wheeled ********* with a

with hundreds of shoes cast away by union troopers newly shod handsome homesteads crowning the hills looked at us through empty ********** showing no sign of life burnt barns and mills trampled fields were everywhere it was depressing in the extreme but we forged ahead and for the final stage of our journey to rappahannock station where we expected to find an ambulance from general fitz lees head

trunks and bags piled under the stone ******** of the bridge we climbed the steep bank and stood upon the track above straining our eyes in the direction where we fain would be in vain did i throw all the vigor of strong lungs into a halloo for notice the rush of the river drowned my attempts and it was growing dark the rappahannock bridge subsequently burnt by military order was then the highest and longest on the lines of the orange and alexandria road there was no way of crossing it save by stepping from tie to tie of the railway when i proposed essaying this for the first time mrs ***** courage failed her over that raging river she could not walk without ******* and how could she let a young girl go alone the irreverent answer was that there were times when a girl with a steady brain and a light foot was worth any chaperon and before the dear alarmed lady could cry out i was off skipping across the ties till about the middle of the bridge the pickets espied me and sent forth a mighty shout three or four of them came running to meet me and hear my tale they said they were never more astonished than to look up and see a young lady coming at that hour apparently alone out of the forsaken waste of country beyond the bridge they had had no order from the general but there was a house near their picket post where we could put up for the night after that all became easy work in our eyes two of the troopers brought my aunt across between them others followed with our belongings at their little camp by the track over the waters edge we were mounted on peaked saddles upon rawboned horses and led along an *********** muddy road a big cavalryman loaded down with our **** bags and ********* bringing up the rear at the farmhouse where they asked shelter for us the good

it broad awake and up in the moment we believed a skirmish to be in progress but leaning from the window we espied in the gray dawn our host in colloquy with a confederate uniform and the little house yard completely filled with gray troopers dismounting around an empty ambulance the happy truth flashed upon us this was our ambulance our guard sent by our loyal friend the general to convoy us to

were many *********** of publication but the work began again in october 1864 and continued i know not how long to the satisfaction of camps and citizens the greatest feather in my literary cap however i conceived to be an appearance in verse in the columns of the critical examiner of which people stood in awe for the caustic utterances of its editor mr john m daniel on subjects military and otherwise i had met mr daniel and considered him as unapproachable as the north pole was till recently but as has been proved even the north pole has been misunderstood and the ******** editor not

it was broad moonlight and i recall as if it were yesterday the superb figure of our hero standing in the little porch without saying a few last words as he swung his military cape around his shoulders it did not need my fervid imagination to think him the most noble looking mortal i had ever seen as he swept off his hat for a second and final farewell he bent down and kissed me as he often did the girls he had known from their childhood at that time general lee was literally the idol of the confederacy his moral grandeur recognized by all lifted him into the region where envy nor calumny nor hate nor pain did not venture to assail him we felt as he left us and walked off up the quiet leafy street in the moonlight that we had been honored as by more than royalty we went often to mrs daviss receptions where the president never failed to say kind words in passing and sometimes to tarry for a pleasant chat always grave always looking as if he bore the sorrows of a world he was invariably courteous and sometimes playful in his talk with very young women these entertainments of mrs davis in the evening between limited hours were attended by every one not in deep mourning

by an orderly coming to tell my mother that a lot of new wounded had been brought in from the field and were still coming they were putting them in a new ward just built at the far end of the camp but had actually no food or stimulant to give them did mrs cary think she could possibly spare a little from her storeroom since many of these poor fellows had been in the ambulance since the day before some without a mouthful passing their lips we sprang up hurried into our clothes and were outside in a few minutes my mother unlocking her stores with a sinking heart found she had but one bucket of milk a small bottle of brandy a piece of cold boiled pork and a pile of cold cornbread with our arms full we stumbled in the darkness over the rough ground following the orderly and his lantern if we had ***** that precious milk our hearts would have broken then and there the southern night had spent its early heat and a wandering breeze laden with wood odors came up from the river and smote our ********* gratefully at the door of the new ward a long pine shed ambulances were ********** their ghastly contents some of the wounded uttering ********* prayers to be left to die in peace some mercifully in stupor while other forms were lifted out already stiffened in their last sleep those for whom the jolting ride from the battlefield had not finished the work of the enemys bullets were carried in and laid on the cots and by the insufficient glimmer of oil lanterns and tallow dips the surgeons began their rounds before they were half finished a streak of ******* came into the sky seen through the open windows and in the sparse trees on the outskirts of the camp birds had begun to stir and chirp we placed our supplies on a table near the door and my mother telling me the surgeons needed her assistance bade me find out the exact number to be fed and make it go around ah that division of meagre portions never since have i been able to endure with *********** seeing the waste of food in peace times when aided by the ward ******* i began to distribute it some were past swallowing and their more vigorous neighbors looked with ******** eyes upon the poor rejected bits to hurry by carrying off these ******* to take cups away from thirsty lips before they were satisfied was a keen sorrow at length when i had nearly finished the task and almost exhausted my resources i came upon a cot where lay upon his face a mere boy apparently dying there was no time to call a doctor i mixed milk and brandy and after forcing his body over poured it by ************ down his throat keeping on till i had the joy of seeing the vital spark creep back little by little he reached the point of opening his eyes and telling me he didnt exactly know what was the matter with him but that he felt so tired as soon as i could capture my favorite doctor i brought him to my patient a wound was found but a slight one the lad was simply dying from exhaustion the ******** of hours in the ambulance and want of food he may thank his stars you kept on trying said my doctor or hed have been a dead one before now think of children like this put into the ranks to fill the places of the

for him while at camp winder he was indulged by me to an extent that caused some jealousy and cutting comment from his neighbors in the ward for him were reserved all the ******* i could lay hands upon but fortunately he went home before he was too badly spoiled if we had visitors there was nowhere to receive them so the few i allowed to come appeared during my off time in the afternoon and took me out to walk with the private secretary of the president who never came save with some welcome book in hand i oftenest wandered out of the grim precincts of camp winder into the woods above the canal and river bank where we would sit under the shelving boughs and watch the silent boats steal by below reading talking and trying to forget the incubus of war here the air knew no taint wild

save for the rare visits possible where there were so many needing attention we generally ***** ourselves to reach camp at sunset just as the onearmed and ********* soldier on duty at the headquarters

which she was to watch her opportunity of making often when my mother and i returned from the hospital rounds to our pine barracks heated redhot by the ****** southern sun we would sit down to rest weary bones and speculate about our wanderer whether he was yet out upon the deep that tells no tales his ship to be shattered by a broadside from the blockading fleet and he to go down in her without

an ambulance finding me however so much on the mend that i was able to drive back with her through the crimson and golden glories of the pamunkey swamps things as i recall them seem to have rushed onward with the speed of lightning during the last winter of the war we had again settled ourselves in quarters in town i had recovered my full strength and was almost always hungry we had little

there was a large faction supporting the president in his disapproval of general johnstons method of playing the game of war with general sherman in northern georgia many a bitter comment was heard upon mr daviss final action in relieving johnston of his command people we met said *********** that the ********** animus against johnston was based upon a petty feud between their wives who had been daily associates and friends in the old washington days others warmly defended mr davis declaring that the brilliant and aggressive hood was the general of all others to make up for johnstons delay in bringing matters to a crisis it is certain that johnston felt keenly the blow of his removal one of my cousins close to this general throughout the war told me the great soldier shed tears of bitter mortification upon his removal and that he heard him say i had drawn and drawn and drawn sherman and just when i got him where i wanted him to be i was taken away and now for a stirring chapter in

brother on the cruise of the chickamauga and during the siege of fort fisher achieved unexpectedly to him the honor of passing into the archives of the state department at washington where in room ### case 21 this boys record of sea adventure is now preserved found in the naval school after the occupation of richmond by lieutenant commander james parker u s n it was sent by him to the navy department in washington the journal of midshipman cary says commander parker seemed to me a very important and valuable contribution to the naval side of a dispute between admiral porter and general butler as to the propriety of the withdrawal of the troops at fort fisher it was just such a journal as i would have kept in my midshipman days fifteen or more years before and its entire truthfulness and correctness were apparent colored as they were by boyish enthusiasm and frankness of statement i promptly sent it to the navy department i heard no more of it until its reappearance several years later in evidence before the geneva tribunal where it contributed largely to fix the responsibility of great britain for the destruction of our shipping by these confederate ******** whose doings were faithfully chronicled in the journal how the diary came to be discovered in the files of the navy department by those charged with preparing the case of the united states for the geneva tribunal and extracts from it edited for that case mr cary has never heard it was not until the publication of the arbitration proceedings in 1871 that he learned of the continued existence of his almost forgotten journal or that it had so contributed to the making of history the purpose of the production of the journal writes mr cary was to show that the british had granted undue favors to the chickamauga

colonel james morris morgan of washington himself sufficiently acquainted with the methods of gallant service to be a trusted reporter of mr carys youthful prowess when fort fisher was threatened two of the guns of the chickamauga were taken ashore and mounted in the fort midshipman cary was in charge of one of them and during the battle his gun burst killing and wounding some twenty odd men who were standing near it cary was unhurt and walking up to general whiting asked if he could not give him something more to do the federal fleet was at that time sweeping the beach with six hundred guns general whiting expressed his desire to get a communication to a detached battery some hundreds of yards away but said he would not order any man to carry it as he considered it hardly possible that the feat could be accomplished under such a fire midshipman cary begged to be allowed to attempt the perilous journey lieutenant **** and midshipman ******* who were present described the scene to me and several of my old classmates who were with the federal fleet have borne testimony to the accuracy of their statements it seems that hardly had the little midshipman started on his way when the

saw him struggle to his feet and ****** on this happened again and again until at last as he neared the battery a shell was seen to explode very near him which fairly buried him in the sand all in the fort gave him up for dead when suddenly to their amazement they saw him totter to his feet again though wounded in the leg the fleet ceased firing and as he staggered on to his destination both the men in the fort and on board the fleet broke into a mighty cheer this is the only occasion i ever knew of during the war when a man heard both sides cheer him the engagement of my cousin hetty cary to brigadier general john pegram having been announced their decision to be married on january 19 was a subject of active interest my aunt mrs wilson miles cary of baltimore had before christmas obtained from mr lincoln through general barnard chief of the united states engineer corps married to her adopted daughter a pass to go to richmond to visit her children the presence of mrs cary gave general pegram opportunity to urge that his marriage should not be longer delayed and such preparations as were possible were hurried on my aunt was stopping at the house of her niece mrs peyton whence the ceremony took place on the evening of january 19 all our little world flocked to st pauls church to see the ******** of one called by many the most beautiful woman in the south with a son of richmond universally honored and beloved two days before i being confined to my room with a cold hetty had come bringing her bridal veil that i with our mothers might be the first to see it tried on her lovely crown of auburn hair as she turned from the mirror to salute us with a charming blush and smile the mirror fell and was broken to small fragments an accident afterward spoken of by the superstitious as one of a strange series of ominous happenings while a congregation that crowded floor and galleries of the church waited an unusually long time for the arrival of bride and groom my aunt and the other members of our family being already in their seats i stood in the vestibule outside with burton harrison and colonel l q c lamar *********** rather uneasily upon the cause of the delay mr harrison told us that mrs davis who tenderly loved and admired the bride had begged to be allowed to send the presidents carriage to drive her to the church and he was sure it had been in prompt

moment of setting out the presidents horses had reared violently refusing to go forward and could not be controlled so that they had been forced to get out of the carriage and send for another vehicle at that date almost impossible to secure in richmond when the noblelooking young couple crossed the threshold of the church my cousin dropped her lace handkerchief and nobody perceiving it stooped forward to pick it up tearing the tulle veil over her face to almost its full length then regaining herself walked with a slow and stately step toward the altar as she passed there was a murmur of delight at her beauty never more striking her complexion of pearly white the vivid roses on her cheeks and lips the sheen of her radiant hair and the happy gleam of her beautiful brown eyes seemed to defy all sorrow change or fear john pegram handsome and erect looked as he felt triumphant the *********** so the men called him of the invincible beauty of her day miss carys brother captain wilson miles cary representing her absent father gave away the bride after the ceremony we her nearest crowded around the couple wishing them the best happiness our loving hearts could picture general pegrams mother brothers and sisters did the same then as they passed out all eyes followed them with real kindness and unalloyed good feeling there was but a small reception afterward but one felt in the atmosphere a sense of sincere gladness in happy love very rare on such occasions three weeks later to the day general pegrams coffin crossed with a victors palms beside his soldiers accoutrements occupied the spot in the chancel where he had stood to be married beside it knelt his widow swathed in crape again dr minnegerode conducted the ceremony again the church was full behind the hearse waiting outside stood his war charger with boots in stirrups the wailing of the band that went with us on the slow pilgrimage to hollywood will never die out of memory burton harrison drove in the carriage with me and my mother my poor cousin with her mother brother and general custis lee her husbands intimate friend who stood beside her as leaning on her brothers arm she remained during the service close to the grave general pegrams family clustered beyond her snow lay white on the hillsides the bare trees stretched their arms above us the river kept up its ceaseless rush and tumble so much a part of daily life in our four years of ordeal that we had grown accustomed to interpret its voice according to our joy or grief the newly married couple had gone directly to general pegrams headquarters near petersburg where he was at the head of earlys division their new home was in a pleasant farmhouse nine miles out of petersburg close to the line of general pegrams command near hatchers run here within constant sound of shot and shell her taste and skill busied itself in fitting up rooms that seemed to her soldier the perfection of beauty and comfort and in preparing for him little dishes that transformed their ordinary fare when she rode beside him during their short honeymoon the men thronged to look at her with pride in their leaders lovely wife on february 5 a demonstration was made by the enemy against general lees extreme right in which general pegrams forces were engaged he returned to their lodgings and before daylight on the 6th was aroused by the information that the enemy was about to renew attack his wife made coffee and prepared breakfast for him in the gray of dawn then after seeing him ride off spent the day with her mother who had fortunately arrived upon a visit to her son captain cary as the short winters day closed in a messenger arrived from general pegram to say he had come safely through the fight the ladies were at this time sitting in an ambulance at some distance away ******* lint at sunset a new charge was formed against the enemy general pegram leading it sword in hand when a ********* claimed to have been fired by a ************ a great way off entered his heart killing him instantly after striking the sword from his hand and filling its scabbard with his blood of his comrades none was found who would volunteer to break the news to my cousin captain gordon mccabe of richmond a close friend of general pegram has thus written to me i can tell you of the tragic time after he was killed when our guns pulled past the ambulance where she was ******* lint and i heard her laughing merrily within i knew he was dead shot at the head of his division while she sat there waiting for him to come to her after his body had been tenderly placed in the room used as the adjutant generals office at headquarters word was sent to her that she might safely return to their quarters and go to bed for it would be late before he could get back so she slept peacefully that night in the room above his body a bride of three weeks in the morning an old gentleman a civilian volunteered to go up and call her down to where pegram lay kneeling beside the body she put her hand into the breast of his coat drawing out first his watch still ticking that she had wound for him just before they parted next a miniature of herself both stained with life blood my aunt and her son accompanied the widow to richmond in a freight car she sitting beside the coffin no one of us is likely to forget the sad days that followed she was like a flower broken in the stalk another ordeal was in store for her in the death in battle of general pegrams younger brother colonel william pegram who fell in the retreat from petersburg to remain with the mother of these heroes during her time of crushing grief was my cousins loving duty a short time after the occupation mrs cary and mrs pegram accompanied by captain cary returned to their home in baltimore with a free pass from general grant at the end of march hope in the stoutest spirits seemed to flicker but feebly and the ultimate failure of the confederacy to be a ******** conclusion coming in late from a walk on the evening of march 29 i found to my surprise a note from burton harrison who had called in my absence to say that he was unexpectedly desired to take charge of mrs davis her sister and the davis children on a visit to charlotte north carolina he had just been for a farewell visit to mrs wilson miles cary and mrs pegram the saddest i ever knew and must hasten to the train hoping to be back in town ere long to find me well and happy and light of heart when i saw him again it was in the following autumn behind prison bars after months of solitary confinement succeeding his capture with the chief whose fortunes he loyally chose to follow when a dozen times he might have found opportunity to avoid his subsequent hard fate on the morning of april 2 a perfect sunday of the southern spring a large congregation assembled as usual at st pauls i happened to sit in the rear of the presidents pew so near that i plainly saw the sort of gray pallor that came upon his face as he read a scrap of paper thrust into his hand by a messenger hurrying up the middle aisle with stern set lips and his usual quick military tread he left the church a number of other people rising in their seats and hastening after him those who were left swept by a universal tremor of alarm the rector accustomed as he was to these frequent scenes in church came down to the altar rail and tenderly begged his people to remain and finish the service which was done before dismissing his congregation the rector announced to them that general ewell had summoned the local forces to meet for defence of the city at three in the afternoon we knew then that longstreets regulars must have been suddenly called away and a sick apprehension filled all hearts on the sidewalk outside the church we plunged at once into the great stir of evacuation ********* the beginning of a new era as if by a flash of electricity richmond knew that on the morrow her streets would be crowded with her captors her rulers fled her government dispersed into thin air her high hopes crushed to earth there was little discussion of events people meeting each other would exchange silent hand ****** and pass on i saw many pale faces some trembling lips but in all that day i heard no expression of a ******** fear movement was everywhere nowhere panic *********** franklin street sending up perfume from her many gardens was the general rendezvous of people who wanted to see the last of their friends all over town citizens were aiding the departure of the male members of their family who could in any way serve the ************ government in the houses we knew there was everywhere somebody to be helped to go somebody for whose sake tears were squeezed back scant food prepared words of love and cheer spoken those good dear women of richmond who had been long tried as by fire might bend but would not break between two and three in the afternoon formal announcement was made to the public that the government would vacate richmond that evening by nightfall all the flitting shadows of a lost cause had passed away under a heaven studded by bright stars the doomed city lay face to face with what it knew not in my confederate album is the original telegram from general j c breckinridge secretary of war to president davis at danville describing the evacuation of richmond it is written upon a half sheet of cheap ********* paper and marked ### collect ##### and runs as follows i had gone with my brother to the station in the afternoon and saw him off with a heart that for the first time in our war partings felt heavier than lead his farewell present to me was a ham of which he unexpectedly came into possession after we had said goodby sending it to me by a negro ****** with a large amount of confederate currency who to his honor be it said was faithful to his trust my brother was aware that in addition to leaving me alone in our lodging in my mothers absence gone to nurse my cousin ********* fairfax wounded in the battle of *********** in north carolina our larder was very nearly bare i had promised them if an emergency arose to go to my uncles house where i presently arrived my ham following i insert a letter written at this time another letter of this time addressed to burton harrison then supposed to be with the confederate president at danville virginia describes my efforts to meet his request in a note sent in some way to me to secure some packages of private letters left with his belongings at the presidents house a short time only after these letters were penned came the tidings of lees surrender and then our streets were filled up again with the gray uniforms of soldiers on parole dusty threadbare with tarnished buttons and insignia i hope i may never again see men made in gods image wear such sad faces as they did we girls and women had all we could bear hearing the heartbreaking story of the final days before appomattox and giving such consolation as our own rent hearts could offer the war was over what had it cost the country now to be ours again by force of arms more than seven hundred men a day says professor ******* wilson in his history of the american people for every day of the four long years of campaign and battle four hundred killed or mortally wounded in the field the rest dead of disease exposure accident or the slow pains of imprisonment the federal government had spent thirty four hundred millions of dollars upon the war nearly two and a half millions for every day it lasted and less than eight hundred millions of that vast sum had come into its coffers from the taxes more than twentysix hundred millions had been added to the national debt the confederacy had piled up a debt upon its part of nearly fourteen hundred millions and had spent besides no man could say how much the north had spent out of its abundance the south had spent all that it had and was stripped naked of its resources while the war lasted it had been stripped naked also of its men my chief personal interest in the trend of events after the surrender at appomattox lay naturally with the retiring government the story of that retreat and the capture of his chief was told by burton harrison in a paper written for his sons which the editors of the century magazine secured for publication in their number of november 1883 a letter from mr richard watson gilder appended to my bound copy of this narrative says it is of absorbing interest told with evident frankness and truthfulness and with a refreshing sense of humor giving the comedy along with the tragedy of the events it would be one of the most interesting and important contributions to history that the century has published and i can see no reason why you should withhold it longer or till the generation which would take most interest in it is passed away the prophecy of general interest in the paper put forth by the editors had been assured to us on an occasion soon after the war when my husband reluctantly told the story following a dinner at the rev henry m fields at *********** mass where among other hearers besides our clever and inspiring host and hostess we had mr david dudley field president andrew white of ******* university and mrs harriet beecher stowe it is true that much was lent to the narrative by the ******* inimitable gift of narrative so well known to his friends his extraordinary flow of words and dramatic action in recital but even among that company of antagonists in politics and principle he won sympathy and interest as well as full belief that the events disclosed had been exactly what he said of them when he had finished all the guests gathered around thanking him for a vividly interesting chapter of history mrs stowe in particular expressing herself as profoundly impressed by what she had heard a new light thrown upon things misunderstood before of this story it must suffice for me to give here the leading incidents without detail or comment after an intolerably slow journey by interrupted trains mr harrison succeeded in establishing mrs davis and her party at charlotte where on wednesday the 4th of april he received a telegram from president davis at danville merely announcing that he was there this was their first news of the evacuation of richmond on april 2 directly after mr harrison joined his chief at danville the president received the announcement of the surrender of general lee at appomattox and immediately gave his secretary orders for the withdrawal of their party the staff cabinet officers and others of the government then at danville into north carolina a train secured by mr harrison and soon crowded by depressed officials their families and ******* on was enlivened when en route by an explosion resulting from a young officer of the ordnance bureau seating himself rather hard on the flat top of a stove the ********** caused by some torpedo ********* carried in his ******** pocket at greensboro north carolina there was a halt for consultation with general joseph e johnston whose army was then confronting sherman a conference was held including the president general johnston general breckinridge secretary of war general beauregard mr benjamin secretary of state mr mallory secretary of the navy mr reagan postmastergeneral and others in the temporary rooms of colonel john taylor wood of the presidents staff on the next day the retiring government moved southward the president his staff and some members of the cabinet riding their own horses mr benjamin declaring that he should not mount a horse until forced to do so general samuel cooper adjutantgeneral and ranking officer of the whole army no longer a young man mr george davis the attorneygeneral and mr benjamins brotherinlaw mr de saint martin brought up the rear of the column in an ambulance once riding back in search of this distinguished contingent mr harrison found the whole party stalled in a hopeless ******* in the darkness i could see from afar the occasional bright glow of benjamins cigar while the others of the party were perfectly silent benjamins silvery voice was presently heard as he ************ ******* for their comfort verse after verse of tennysons ode on the death of the duke of wellington that mr benjamin could ride as well as another was afterwards proved on this expedition when he ultimately left the party and set out alone for the ******** making his way to england via bermuda so long as he remained with us his cheery ********* and readiness to adapt himself to the requirements of all emergencies made him a most agreeable comrade at yale college when a boy at the bar in new orleans in the senate of the united states from louisiana at first attorneygeneral then secretary of war and finally secretary of state of the confederate states at richmond this gentleman became queens counsel at the london bar and had high honors bestowed on him by the bench and bar of the united kingdom during all this march wrote mr harrison mr davis was singularly equable and cheerful he seemed to have had a great load taken from his mind to feel relieved of responsibilities and his conversation was very bright and agreeable he talked of men and of books particularly of walter scott and byron of horses and dogs and sports of the woods and the fields of roads and how to make them of the habits of birds and of a variety of other topics his familiarity with and correct taste in the english literature of the last generation his varied experiences in life his habits of close observation and his extraordinary memory made him a charming companion when disposed to talk indeed like mark ****** we were all in good spirits under adverse circumstances and i particularly remember the entertaining conversation of mr mallory the secretary of the navy which does not agree with the item i recently found in an old letter of major waltons to mr harrison in which this secretary is styled mr ********** at charlotte it was found that mrs davis and her party had left the day before to go further south as the presidential party entered a house with difficulty obtained for them all the inhabitants fearing a threat made by stonemans troopers to burn every house giving refuge to jefferson davis the president received by ******* from general breckinridge the news of president lincolns assassination tidings universally regretted by the staff and following everybodys remark wrote mr harrison was that in lincoln the southern states had lost their only refuge in their then emergency there was no expression other than that of surprise and regret as yet we knew none of the particulars of the crime during the speech made at this juncture by mr davis to a column of general ***** dukes cavalry mr harrison stood close to the speaker and heard distinctly every word uttered by him there was no reference whatever to the assassination and no other speech was made mr daviss remark to colonel william preston johnston in mr ****** house later on was that mr lincoln would have been much more useful to the southern states than andrew johnson his successor was likely to be i myself said mr harrison heard mr davis express the same opinion at that period so much for the ********* charge against mr davis that he had on this occasion spoken *********** of the horrible crime committed by booth in the name of the conquered south my husband often told me that of such a spirit much less an expression mr davis could never have been guilty no man ever participated he went on to say in a great war of revolution with less of disturbance of the nicest sense of perfect rectitude in conduct or opinion his every utterance act and sentiment was with the strictest regard for all the ********** throughout that troubled time when the passions of many people made them reckless or defiant of the opinions of mankind his cheerfulness continued in charlotte and i remember his there saying to me i cannot feel like a beaten man at charlotte mr daviss anxiety about his wife and family led him to despatch his secretary to abbeville south carolina in search of them using his own judgment as to what to do after he met them the president himself proposing to go as rapidly as possible to the ***** mississippi department to join the army under kirby smith at abbeville mr harrison found mrs davis and her party comfortably installed as the guests of colonel **** mrs davis insisted upon at once seeking the ******** with a view to sailing for europe had she remained where she was yielding to the entreaties of all around her the capture of jefferson davis might never have been a chapter of contemporaneous history mr harrisons party reenforced by two gallant volunteers artillerymen of the southern army captain moody and major victor ****** proceeded in wagons ********** southward the men watching at night while the women and children slept to guard against the theft of their wagons and horses by roving *********** of whom the woods were full at midnight several days later mr harrison who with two teamsters old soldiers constituted the picketguard heard the soft tread of horses approaching their camp on the sandy road harrison challenged and to his astonishment was answered by the presidents voice mr davis was attended by colonel william preston johnston colonel john taylor wood colonel frank r lubbock mr reagan colonel ******** and robert the presidents negro servant this unexpected encounter kept the president with his family for some days when in compliance with the earnest solicitation of the staff he consented to leave them and go on ********** by a wagon train at the village of abbeville south carolina he was overtaken by a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning with torrents of rain and fearing for the safety of his family camping out at night again rode after them to the discomfiture of the party joining mrs davis in camp near the little hamlet of *********** in georgia here after promising his friends that he would leave mrs daviss party finally in the morning mr davis retired to rest in the tent occupied by his wife mr harrison overcome by fever and ********* contracted on the journey threw himself on the ground not far away and fell into profound sleep from which he was awakened at daybreak by jones mrs daviss coachman running to him saying the enemy was upon them i sprang to my feet and in an instant a rattling fire of musketry began on the north side of the creek almost at the same moment colonel ********* and his regiment charged up the road from the south upon us we were taken by surprise and not one of us exchanged a shot with the enemy colonel johnston tells me he was the first prisoner taken in a moment colonel ********* rode directly to me and pointing across the creek said what does that mean have you any men with you supposing the firing was done by our teamsters i said of course we have dont you hear the firing he seemed to be ******* at the reply gave the order charge and boldly led the way across the creek nearly every man in his command following our camp was thus left deserted for a few minutes except by one mounted soldier near mrs daviss tent afterward said to have been stationed there by colonel ********* in passing and by the few troopers who stopped to plunder our wagons i had been sleeping on the same side of the road with the tent occupied by mrs davis and was then standing very near it i saw her come out and say something to the soldier mentioned perceiving she wanted him to move off i approached and actually persuaded the fellow to ride away as the soldier moved into the road and i walked beside his horse the president emerged for the first time from the tent at the side farther from us and walked away into the woods to the eastward at right angles from the road presently looking around and observing somebody had come out of the tent the soldier turned his horses head and reaching the spot he had first occupied was again approached by mrs davis who engaged him in conversation this trooper was joined by perhaps two of his comrades they remained on horseback and soon became violent in their language with mrs davis the order to halt was called out by one of them to the president it was not obeyed and was quickly repeated in a loud voice several times at least one of the men then threatened to fire and pointed a carbine at the president mrs davis overcome with terror cried out in apprehension and the president who had now walked sixty or eighty paces away into the ************ woods turned around and came rapidly back to his wife near the tent as the president reproached the soldier who was using rough language to his wife one of the others recognizing him called out mr davis surrender i recognize you sir while these things were happening miss howell and the children remained within the other tent i have not found that there was any one excepting mrs davis the single trooper by her tent and myself who saw all that occurred and heard all that was said at the time any one else who gives an account of it has had to rely upon hearsay or his own imagination for this story the business of plundering commenced immediately after the capture we were soon left with only what we had on and what we had in our pockets while this was going on i emptied the contents of my haversack into a fire where some of the enemy were cooking breakfast and there saw the papers burn they were chiefly *********** with a photograph of my sweetheart the prisoners en route for macon were allowed to ride their own horses promptly seized by their captors when four days later they reached the railway station in that town whence they were taken by train to augusta on their way to fortress monroe what concerns jefferson davis in his subsequent terrible imprisonment at fortress monroe belongs to history the experience of burton harrison as a prisoner of war was detailed to me by him in 1904 to refresh my memory during his last illness at our temporary home in washington where we had gone to pass the winter near our sons while there was never any bitterness about it in his speech or in his manly soul i could not even after that lapse of years hear the recital without a pang of deep pain for what he had ********** suffered whilst between him and the friends he had left in richmond a black veil of silence and sickening uncertainty as to his ultimate fate had fallen he had been confined at first in a room of the old capitol prison a few days later he was taken by a detective from this place and conducted to a room in the same building under pretext of being introduced to a confederate lady he might like to know feeling instinctively that mischief threatened he had no difficulty in keeping himself in check when in the presence of an old untidy woman with a ****** eye afterward identified as a spy for both sides who with every assurance of cordiality for the south sought to lead him into conversation about mr davis and confederate matters in general she did not name the young girl suffering from a bad headache who deadly pale with a white bandage around her brow struck him as resembling some face on a roman coin in ******* tones the spy woman sought to induce both of them to join in her strictures against the government and expressions of sympathy for the conspirators in a flash he divined the poor girl had been brought there for the same purpose as himself it was designed that they should talk *********** in the presence of authority it was not until the interview futile as to results was over that he chanced to hear the detective call the young woman miss surratt he came away from this hateful interview feeling he had escaped a trap after the disgust of it his prison with the rough jailers seemed a welcome haven next day all the rebel prisoners at the old capitol were allowed to crowd to the barred windows to witness shermans imperial progress of return to washington to eyes long used to faded gray and rusty accoutrements the vast array of blazing sheen and color seemed oppressive but all the same he said the johnny rebs enjoyed the show ****** not ********** professional praise to military details and ******** turning away from his window he felt a touch upon his shoulder from a detective he had not before seen who ****** told him he was to go to another place his prison comrades surrounding him with ********** and kind words watched him depart sadly the rumor had got abroad that jefferson daviss secretary and confidential friend was to be dealt with to the full ***** of the law a drive in an ambulance in wartime serving for all purposes of transfer brought him to the united states arsenal situated upon a peninsula running out from the marshy borders of the eastern end of the potomac now the site of the war college it then contained close to the waters edge a group of brick buildings amid level military ****** banked with pyramids of shells and balls surrounded by cannon their carriages and caissons behind a high wall towered conspicuously a sombre building with barred and grated windows old washington knew this as a district penitentiary it was now transformed into a military and political prison where in the inner cells were confined the prisoners implicated in the murder of president lincoln in the upper story was sitting a military commission whose proceedings filled the world with awesome interest on every one of these piping days of early summer the conspirators were brought in irons through a massive nail studded door communicating with the cells and placed in a line ********** with armed guards to sit in the courtroom facing their judges and a mixed audience till at the end of the days session they were returned to their ******** the ambulance containing the new prisoner and his guard was several times put out of line before the arsenal door by carriage loads of fine people the women dressed as if for a race day one after the other of these gay parties passed in laughing and chatting under a grim wall **** of which ******* ten feet apart kept always on the lookout it had become a ****** thing for society to drop in for a peep at the conspirators trial passes limited to the capacity of the courtroom were in demand like opera tickets to a special performance the prisoners last glimpse for many a day of the outer world was of a broad dusty avenue with shabby fringes of negro cabins and ****** leading up to the entrance gate that looked like a country fair cattle with ******* tongues were there *********** pigs and ***** dogs getting in the way of marching soldiers and fashionable vehicles to the left he saw a military encampment filling a ******** plain where under shelter tents soldiers off duty ******* dozed played cards or tossed ****** in the background of the prison two gunboats kept unceasing watch upon the river front the prisoner was hurried through the door marched up two flights of steps and without warning ushered before the gaze of the crowded courtroom gaping for new sensations there to stand awaiting the provost marshal general to whom he was consigned without moving he faced the ordeal his lips set hot anger ******** through his veins spite of his sense of unnecessary degradation he noted and remembered well the ****** of the scene the judge advocate general holt presiding with his ***** cold face ****** ill for a prisoner falling under his displeasure his assistants the judges of the military commission unfortunately for themselves appointed to conduct this trial the reporters of the commission the large whispering smiling audience and the accused seven men and one woman ******** together almost inevitably doomed to death when relieved from his unpleasant position by the arrival of the functionary who was to take official possession of his body he was again led out of the courtroom through a jostling vulgar crowd affecting to shrink away on either side of him as if from a monster ********** the general having annexed a formidable key led the way the prisoner followed by the guard brought up the rear a band of vagabond ******** shuffling after them until turned back at the entrance to a ponderous grated door life stood still for him a long time thereafter while he alternately lay or sat upon a blanket on the cemented floor of a felons cell four feet by eight dark as night in ******* during five long weeks he was forbidden speech with any one ********** but in those days and nights when he threw himself down upon the blanket or else walked or used ********* exercises to stretch his muscles and save his reason he might have said what a virile poet wrote long afterward i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul he said what he minded most was the eye of a ********** soldier perpetually looking through the ******* in his door of whatever his enemies might have accused him it was not a failure in stoic endurance of his lot one of his jailers at fort delaware told me afterward that of the many thousands they had held no confederate prisoner had borne himself with higher courage and cooler pluck but that experience of the dark cell came near to permanent weakening of his strong physique when they heard him singing and laughing to himself one day the guards made haste to summon surgeon and provost marshal believing he had gone mad the surgeon finding his prisoner a wreck in physical strength the matter was reported to the war department after which he was given leave to take daily exercise in the prison yard below from this glimpse of the world of the living such as it was the return to solitary darkness became more and more exhausting to nerve and body his good doctor again reporting his condition he was then transferred to a cell facing the capitol through which plentiful summer sunlight ****** in and he could see afar the glitter of the golden dome a chair allowed him his next demand was for a copy of horace or tennyson for which the doctor substituted louis napoleons life of csar with a promise of more literature to follow under these changed conditions the prisoners health improved daily although no one spoke to him of daily happenings his ********* kept him actually abreast of the grim tragedy enacting under the roof that sheltered him he said he felt like a savage trained to notice the dropping of a nut or the crackle of a twig of the unhappy beings on trial he knew nothing nor had he any sentimental desire that they should escape justice once walking in the prison yard he had seen at a window the wan face of the girl met in the **** company at the old capitol now the most crushed and sorrowstricken creature that ever met his gaze in the yard also he once picked up and secreted a bit of greasy newspaper blown from some sentrys lunch from this he saw that the conspirators were hastening to their doom when one day the guards failed to come for him to walk and from the yard below arose a great clamor of **** and hammering he surmised what was to be every night before he had heard coming through the *********** tube the melancholy whistling of an occupant of the cell beneath his evidently absent in the day for which sound he had learned to listen with an odd sense of companionship that evening the whistle began but was halted suddenly and the listener thought the effort was beyond the power of a condemned man probably on the eve of execution that night also he heard a new sound a ships bell striking the watches close by some of them are to be transported and that boat is here to take them off flashed through his mind at dawn he turned in his blanket wakened by the noise of renewed hammering from his window he could see many troops massing in pennsylvania avenue and amid them riding alone the catholic priest father walter the intrepid soldier of christ who because of his belief in the innocence of one of the condemned was forbidden to go with her to the scaffold coming to ****** departing souls the officer detailed as usual to watch him at his breakfast generally so genial today avoided meeting the prisoners eye as did the soldier always holding a musket before his door he asked no questions ate his food and sat afterward for hours without stirring from his chair thenceforward every sound in the prison came unnaturally distinct on all sides he heard the incessant tramp of gathering soldiers on the roof facing the arsenal he saw ****** assembled and could not look at them he heard cell doors opening below and their occupants led out into the corridor heard the sobbing of ********* women whose feet kept hurried pace a little while with the others then turned back heavily and lastly a hush an awful calm while the lives of a woman and three men were taken from them upon the scaffold at his usual hour that evening the guards came to lead him out for exercise stepping from the prison door upon the pavement of the courtyard he saw the scaffold looming black exactly across a path he had made in the ***** grass called by the soldiers harrisons beat and there lying across the path were four new made graves like beads upon a string he said over and over to himself like beads upon a string the guards and ********** watching curiously for evidence of his emotion were not gratified giving no sign he began making for himself a new path parallel with the former one that night he heard the sound of a faint tremulous dejected whistle coming up the *********** tube and actually laughed aloud so glad he was to think the poor devil had not been hanged when the ships bells ceased to strike he was sure it had carried his whistling friend away all these things were told to and written down by me a short time before my husbands death in 1904 calmly without resentment or animus of any kind he also said that major a dane from michigan who shortly after this transferred him to fort delaware told him during the journey that he had been in personal charge of mrs surratt in prison had put the black cap over her head and the rope around her neck ********* her into eternity he said mrs surratt had nothing to do with the plot to kill lincoln that she was party to a scheme to capture him only and that she died an innocent woman see general butlers charge to judge ******* in the house of representatives that he had hanged an innocent woman major also told mr harrison that before sentence of death was passed upon mrs surratt her daughter had tried continually but in vain to gain access to her cell after she was condemned the girl was allowed to meet her mother major was present at the interview and said he never saw such an exhibition of character as the girl came into the cell she could not stand but fell upon the floor creeping over it weeping bitterly till she reached her mothers feet and kissed them with a thousand loving imploring words of tenderness the mother remaining cold as a stone his heart filled with wrath against her hardness to her child but when miss surratt finally went out of the cell the woman broke down in such an awful passion of tears as he prayed he might never see again melting him utterly into sympathy with her burton harrison was personally on good terms with his jailers when major was conducting him with two guards to fort delaware they were halted in the station at philadelphia because of the failure of a carriage expected to take them to the boat wharf in some perplexity the major said he would go himself and look for it and in the meantime colonel he added seriously will you have an eye upon these fellows of mine and see that they dont leave you with general hartranft also the provost marshal who had locked him in the black cell at the arsenal and came every day with the surgeon to see if the prisoner kept his health and ****** mr harrison had kind relations in after years when as counsel for the union telegraph company my husband went to conduct some business for them at harrisburg pennsylvania he found the official he had to consult ************** was none other than his former ****** when mr harrison came downstairs in the morning at the ******* hotel and saw hartranft waiting for him in the hall he threw up his hands exclaiming my god general you are not after me again they shook hands and the general answered i tell you harrison you havent a better friend than i am in the world come to breakfast and after weve finished business well spend the day together before ending this grim chapter one of the horrible sequel of the civil war i will say that after hearing these stories told again in washington in 1904 i desired to drive with my husband to the scene of his old ordeal where the present war college buildings were then going up on the site of the old prison of the arsenal sitting in a victoria he directed the coachman as well as he could where to go but became soon confused about localities in the altered aspect of the place we pulled up and i addressed the **** of a gang of workmen asking if he could tell me where we were why maam dont you know he answered this is the place where the scaffold stood on which mrs surratt and the other conspirators were hanged my husband made no comment nor did i and silently we drove homeward it was thought best for us ************** of both sexes to keep quietly out of public observation while still the wave of feeling enormously increased by the assassination of lincoln dashed high over our reunion with northern friends our cousin the rev herbert norris rector of the episcopal church at woodbury new jersey who had lost a noble son in the union service at antietam was good enough to ask that i should be sent to remain under his protection and that of his wife one of the rawle family of philadelphia intensely in sympathy with the ********** cause they were more than kind to their poor little storm tossed rebel visitor carrying in her young heart a world of painful experience together with certain fears and sad ********* of which she could speak to nobody it was as if an iron door had closed between her and the one who had gone out of her life so ************** that day of march on the eve of the occupation not a word had come from him and she only knew he was treated as a dangerous prisoner the first thing mrs norris wisely judged to be a healthy *********** for girlish spirits was for me to ******** my confederate wardrobe and spend the check my mother had given me for new clothes i went into philadelphia escorted by my cousin herbert who took me to all the necessary shops and stood by patiently till my ardor was appeased i cannot now imagine anything much ****** than the ***** ruffled skirts stretched over wide hoops the short ****** jackets and insignificant little round hats ******* forward upon our brows but when they came home and were compared with the threadbare faded ********* of my richmond supply i felt richer than a queen these ************* did not last long and many a night i sobbed for ******* and for friends who felt with me the great city of philadelphia as i saw it on our visits seemed so untouched by the

remembrances and sorrows of the war my next visit was one of some length to my fathers sister at old morrisania she had lent a son to the union army and with her girls was in mourning for president lincoln when i arrived my uncle an original member of the republican party having been like my father an old line whig of ardent enthusiasm was strongly opposed to the southern idea of secession and for the confederacy and its leaders had no ********* or consideration while a man of large ************ and kind impulse he was violent in invective against the rebels and all their works at table and elsewhere it was the constant effort of the family who had received me with open arms and cemented a friendship lasting all our lives to restrain him from ******* remarks of triumph over the conquered south that swelled my heart to bursting unable as i was to retort or give expression to my sufferings one day at luncheon when he quoted the verse about hanging jeff davis to a sour apple tree i for a while saw red and came very near leaving the house on foot and taking refuge i knew not where afterward on learning from his wife how he had pained me he was as sorry as i could have wished i could not understand why some of their country neighbors calling at morrisania looked at me curiously as at a brand snatched from the burning this dear house was to become a second home to me i to assume the position of elder daughter to my aunt who had been my fathers favorite sister and in the course of time i was to go out from under its hospitable ****** as a bride the ease and luxury of my surroundings in startling contrast to the life so recently led in richmond would have been better appreciated had i known what was ********* my prisoner at fort delaware my girl cousins full of sympathy in the case had already become warm advocates of the unseen private secretary of the late confederate president there was a universal thrill of satisfaction in the family when at last one day in august i received from him a long full letter the way in which it came to me was never revealed until by a letter written in #### by that ***** chevalier colonel henry *** douglas of hagerstown maryland after reading a virginian paper i had published in scribners magazine this letter tells better than i can the conditions under which my prisoner was passing his days in august 1865 i was a prisoner in fort delaware sent there by the sentence of a military commission my imprisonment was not a harsh one and what with the courtesy of the commanding officer and free access to a wellfilled library and the liberty of the island my time passed easily if not rapidly but up in a keep among the battlements strictly guarded and confined with no privileges and no companionship of men and books in solitary imprisonment colonel harrison passed a longer servitude wearily and impatiently he was suffering *********** for the alleged treason of his chief morning and evening he took his unsatisfactory exercise along the battlements we were forbidden to speak to or recognize each other and yet there was no prison rule which could prevent the unspoken salute of the raised hat although with averted faces even the ******* and jailers of that fort used as they had become to many senseless ********* during the war were disgusted with the strict and hard imprisonment of colonel harrison and the men on duty freely expressed their opinion of it the day before i was released a stalwart ********* ******** soldier came into my room after telling me that he cooked for and waited on colonel harrison he began to deplore the ********** of his confinement especially the order that forbade him to write to or receive letters from his family and friends and most especially with hot wrath and an oath did he think it was a shame the prisoner couldnt even write to the young lady he was in love with how he obtained this information i do not know he then said that one way or another colonel harrison had got hold of pen and ink and paper and had written a number of letters he wanted to send out to his family would i take charge of them a flash of suspicion on my part was dispelled by a look into his honest face the next day he strolled again into my quarters and after expressing his satisfaction at my release and his regret that colonel harrison was not freed wandered about the room a bit then said goodby and walked out upon taking down my coat which hung against the wall i found therein a solid pack of letters that day general ******* took me to wilmington in his boat that evening the letters were delivered to mrs cary in baltimore i think the fullest letter there was addressed to whom she must have received and evidently appreciated it does she remember it other letters followed a vegetable seller became the messenger of cupid and carried more than one out of the fort in ******** carrots and ********* we in return contrived to get letters back addressed to a certain tony ******** care of a certain somebody else at a certain postoffice which shall be forever nameless we knew now that things had otherwise improved for the prisoner that books from the post library heaped his table and a friendship had sprung up between himself and the brave commandant of the fort ending in walks on the island and visits to the generals home these things inspired in me hope that a pleasure even greater might be given to the captive with my mother i returned in the autumn to woodbury new jersey where with the aid of my young cousin dr herbert norris we three made an attack in person upon the fort our ways of getting there were devious and thorny from a village on the opposite shore of the delaware river we sailed in a ***** fishing boat across a swelling ********** tide arrived at the ****** fortress on the bank we sent in our cards by a soldier to the commandant to our delight no question was made about receiving us and crossing a bridge to enter gloomy corridors we were soon in the presence of the ********* chief had i divined that the generals kind heart was already enlisted for the prisoner not only through his own pleasure in his society but because of his ******* warm liking and championship had i supposed that in after years these dear people were to name a son burton harrison and to bid their other sons try to model themselves upon one whom they conceived to be a perfect gentleman then i should not have been so ************ the general maintaining a severe official aspect looked us over and ******** of mrs cary whether we were perchance the mother and sister of colonel harrison no said my mother only friends i understand said the general hemming and ****** greatly a moment more and he had taken the parcel my mother handed to him a miniature of myself painted by mrs thompson in new york to replace the one burnt up in the soldiers campfire in the georgia wilderness and the open letter sent with it and despatched them by an orderly to the prisoner and then a sudden even kinder impulse ********** him he asked my mother if she could trust him to show me the interior of the fortress he led i followed to a door opening on the inner court where bidden to look up toward the battlements i saw my prisoner standing indeed between bayonets in a casemate but alive and well waving his hat like a schoolboy and uttering a great irrepressible shout of joy these are the things that remain green in memory when the landscape of life is elsewhere dry and **** but for the courage and devotion of my dear mother and my cousin in accompanying me on what seemed a forlorn hope we should never have won the day the next winter we had a house in washington principally for the purpose of winning the prisoners release through the tireless efforts with president johnson of our dear old friend hon francis preston blair this was finally accomplished on the 16th of january 1866 burton harrison was freed from fort delaware coming at once to visit us in washington on his way to rejoin his mother and sister in the south having spent the latter months of his imprisonment in studying law through the aid of books furnished him by his old friends and yale chums eugene ******** and s d page of philadelphia he after journeys to canada and to europe was admitted to the new york bar by advice of mr charles ****** his first friend and ******* then the leading lawyer of new york he entered the law office of ******* ********* and shortly after began practice for himself which continued during many years of busy and successful

managed to become old couples by now bore names familiar to new york society everybody on board was nice to us recent enemies of the republic and we contracted more than one friendship of an enduring nature as our winter in paris was avowedly for the purpose of giving my education the finishing touches sadly omitted in war experience i was forthwith started in lessons of various kinds including a training of the voice by m archaimbaud of the paris ************* to meet exigencies of foreign opinion i was transformed back into the conventional jeune fille accompanied everywhere by my mother i often wondered what my ***** little ***** de chant would think if i told him i had sung war songs to marching troops or played accompaniments for a chorus of soldiers surrounding me at the piano i believe he would have fainted then and there archaimbaud took interest in my voice and inspired me with delight in his methods by and by we removed from the hotel de ***** et ******* to a quaintly
