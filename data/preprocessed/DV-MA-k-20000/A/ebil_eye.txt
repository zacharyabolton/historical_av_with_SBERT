this volume is affectionately dedicated to mrs james ****** who first discovered merit in my dialect sketches to mrs j ****** reed whose love has been over me as i have written to my ever loyal friend elsie ******* ******* to helen h gardener whose pen is always found in the forefront of the battle against wrong to *********** ******* whose home has been the inspiration of my best thought to my lifetime friend ***** r haxtun who has strewn flowers of faith and affection along my way to mary lowe ********* whose heart is ever open to the cry of humanity and to mary e ******** who has given me courage and sympathy in my work religion and romance are the dominant sentiments of the human mind in the races which yet linger in the morning twilight of evolution these ********** principles are united into the *********** tyrannical ***************** in the shadows which ******* the slowly awakening intellect **** phantoms more impressively real than any figures that dance in the sunlight of noonday over the cramped lives hemmed in by ********* mental ******** mysterious forces wield irresistible power for *************** power for evil in the world of higher thought and more clearly defined action these forces do not lose their strength nor fall into decay they merely exchange their names for other titles more acceptable to the advanced stage superstition ******* into science the phantoms of the night become the living realities of the new day the most dreaded power known in the philosophy of the plantation negro was the evil ************ of ********* the victim upon whom the ********** orb cast its malign glance instantly fell a helpless prey to a diabolical will though personal desire might point to a certain line of action the course pursued was the direct opposite the will was not perverted it was only drugged with some strong ethic poison and rendered powerless however it might silently strive for the right the wrong was consummated having once fallen under the malignant influence it never recovered its erect attitude through all remaining life it was in chains and there was no hope of relief except that death might shake the power of the evil eye all the glow died out of life as the roses die when the frost falls suddenly on a blossoming garden all the radiance of hope fades away as the light of the sun is blotted out by the ********** the garden rose may bloom again when june kisses the earth with her warm lips no flower will ever again blossom but in the life that has been blighted by the evil eye the sun may again shower its golden wine upon the world when the cloud has passed no light can ever again dawn upon a life across which a glance of the evil eye has cast its gloom there was an expression in the pale brown face of my *********** which suggested this dismal fatality it had haunted me persistently since i first saw her her calm serene countenance seemed the outer page of a mysterious ********** wherein a dark tragedy had been written i had wondered what the story was and wished that i could read below the surface writing for several years i had observed her passive aristocratic face as she came and went wid de ***** i had watched almost with envy the perfect repose and grace of manner of the ignorant **** she had sometimes talked with me as she lingered to do little services about my room with a thoughtful kindness which had won my appreciation but she had given me no key to any mystery that might be recorded on that hidden page i had never even heard her ******* until one morning as she came down the long corridor some one of the servants called her mrs ******* how came you by the name of ******* i asked later on as she went noiselessly about my room arranging the ornaments in her subtle **** fashion and wiping off every speck of dust was it an inheritance from your master or were you always free would you mind telling me your history please i ********* telling me just a little about your life so that i may make of it a character sketch as well as a guide for others of your race i know intuitively that it has many a landmark to show the way many a lesson that will be found useful and helpful this is a revelation to me aunt ****** i said for while you were quiet and grave you seemed always so cheerful and bright that i imagined your life had been a very happy one some of the most renowned men were born within its borders washington richard henry lee and his three brothers thomas francis and arthur general henry lee monroe and judge bushrod washington and many others the birthplace of the father of his country was only half a mile from the junction of popes creek with the potomac river mr g w curtis has placed a stone to mark the spot bearing the simple inscription here on the 11th of *** o s #### george washington was born so this beautiful county is the southern cradle of american independence among the distinguished residents of this famous old county was the mayo family descended directly from the campbells the rev archibald campbell was a minister of that parish in #### and the ********* of thomas marshall brother of the chief justice monroe and madison he was an uncle of thomas campbell the poet his granddaughter married robert mayo his nephew married the daughter of patrick henry thus historian poet orator and politician formed a famous family ************* whose names are a priceless inheritance and by none more proudly cherished than by their family servants who like many of the slaves in virginia took the name of their old master did you ever see a real live *** ***** ******** nigger it is a species fast dying out there are but few left the genuine article is always an endless and refreshing source of merriment especially in a household where there are little folks ********* **** randy mayo was an excellent representative of her species she was of a *********** color as she described it herself with a flat nose poppy eyes big thick lips with her ***** wool or hair wrapped in different colored strings ******* her head and as is usual with the native negro she had a very pretty figure and a mellow musical voice it was thus that i met her one fourth of july i bought some packages of firecrackers and a couple of tin horns and started off to look after some friends who poor innocents had been lured to washington by the hope of reward for great political sacrifices and services during the last campaign trusting that thus their impoverished condition might be improved their aspirations met the fate common to expectations based upon campaign promises after their money was all gone death came suddenly to the disappointed father the poor widowed mother was ***** out a bare support for herself and five children by making bags for the agricultural department i had sent to them the week before a little gas stove which i had been so fortunate as to receive in exchange for an old useless ************* and which i knew would be a great comfort in their crowded rooms during the summer the door was opened by an oldfashioned servant who in answer to my question is mrs t at home said the neighbors called to ask if the children were ready and if i had not sent randy back to inform her mistress she would have continued her conversation and efforts at hospitality indefinitely when the children were gone my little friend explained to me how she came into possession of her new servant thus worn out with the trials of washington help and longing for one of the good oldtime servants of the south i heard with delight that my mammy dilsey had recently moved here from westmoreland county and was living not far distant i called my little son and after directing him how to go and cautioning him to be careful of his manners for our old ******* are very critical you know i told him to say this is ***** mammy dilsey and my mamma sent me to bring you back with me she sends her love to you and to daddy and hopes you are well she says to ask you in these words are you both still in the land of the living an old westmoreland salutation and to say that she is anxious to know how you are getting along so far away from old westmoreland ***** soon returned his face beaming with smiles and the old negress tottering after him between longdrawn ******* she exclaimed after gratifying the dear old souls curiosity about all the old people of westmoreland a place of deep interest not only for its associations but for its natural beauties and sending my little girl off to fill a basket of odds and ends for mammy dilsey to take back with her i inquired about uncle harry this was the way my friend secured her maid of all work who rejoiced in the ********** title of ********* ********* mayo she called her randy as *********** by the youngest of the little ts she came to me on saturday said my friend and was installed much to my comfort and the delight of my little ones she had never seen a gas stove and while the range stood in the kitchen yet we used this little ******** your gracious fourth of july gift when directing her to make bread over night i put on the **** all ready for use going to early devotions in the morning i stepped into the kitchen to see how she was getting on and was greeted thus i took a match lighted the gas and opening the **** door put in the pan of rolls with eyes fairly popping out of her head and an expression that beggars description she asked i am not so sure of that randy just wait and see perhaps it may surprise you and **** the rolls very nice and brown have a little patience i said ************* they will not be spoiled on the contrary i think you will find they will be baked so nice you will be proud of your work certainly i expect it yes going to do all of that i said in this little tin box with this little blue light i went out leaving the astonished bewildered maid talking to herself and presently i heard her singing with ******** notes on my return from church randy met me at the front door holding the pan of rolls in her outstretched hand saying in the most subdued tone theres a welcome in the sky for all good news good news for the angels brought the tidings down good news my lord while we enjoyed the results of that little blue light we could still hear her talking to herself and when after breakfast the dishes were washed and the house had been put in order she came in to ask ef hit want time ter mek a **** in de ******** ***** a ****** in de ******* she opened her eyes still wider when i said no you ***** gwine ter hab dat ***** ham fer dinner den is you she asked eagerly referring to an old ********** ham which had been sent me from your old home yes i said and went in and showed her how to put it on to boil she moaned and silently put the ham on to boil and watched and waited looking in after a while there she was stooping over with one hand on each knee her eyes fascinated by the little blue light her head rolling from side to side muttering and anon singing a verse of some old song as if to comfort and reconcile herself ******* the action to the word she squeezed the supply pipe putting out the light with a face full of terror as the odor of the gas filled the room she rushed to meet me ********** i ********* the gas and reassured her but i am afraid i shall not be able to keep her for as she says shes ******** ******** in her *** bout wat she ******* *** she ****** ***** en ****** dat green **** en smell dat ********* smell en dat her daddy ****** say dat a **** hoss dont ****** fall *** he ****** de bit en shes gwine ter member de hoss she seems very cheerful now i said as i heard her singing an old familiar plantation song with a sigh at the first line of the chorus ****** long down town she stopped short moaning to herself a sermon from the text us was preached with much influence and is illustrative of the methods of certain phases of intelligence in dealing with scriptural subjects in reporting this sermon i do not wish to be regarded as sacrilegious whether one approaches the bible merely as a poet to gain from its sublime thoughts and picturesque imagery inspiration for higher and purer song or comes as a little child with a heart full of love to learn the will of an adored father no other work bears so long and deep a study opening with the creation of earth and man it is the starting point of philosophy and religion as well as of the physical world whether its words be regarded as typical ********** traditional or ******** they are the deepest and truest we know the thought comes that they are too beautiful and sacred to be recklessly given to the ignorant lest translated by the light of their pale brain they might be hurtful my intention in ************ this discourse is no more irreverent than was that of the good brother who delivered it and whose earnestness of diction and solemnity of demeanor forbade all suggestion of levity rather would i dwell upon the wondrous power of that divine philosophy which ******** within its ************ scope all the ******* grades of ********* rather would i that my written word might open up some heart to a new phase of the great ********** and that my influence might linger as the memory of a rose when the flower is gone this i learned from the shadow of a tree that to and fro did sway the wall our shadows ****** our influence may fall where we can never be when the swords of the south were turned into ********** those implements of ********* were guided by the ********* gallant officers who had worn the glittering blades of war before their transformation the army of the confederacy from general to private was to be found among the wheat and cotton or patiently following up and down rows of corn

busy keeper of the home ready fora pleasant ride to the house of some comrade in the honorable warfare against the hostile forces of poverty these meetings were held in different houses so that each in turn became the scene of the sunday hospitality general rufus ingalls general grants quartermastergeneral had bought at auction a convenient and roomy ambulance and sent it to turkey island with his compliments and one of these sundays when it was filled to its utmost capacity with neighbor friends we set out for the home of our host of the day colonel haxall as we drove on we accidentally lost our way and going along a woodland path we saw smoke drifting out from the forest on one side and heard voices singing in the distance we followed the direction of the sound and soon came to a little chapel in the grove in front of which were some colored people not far away was a brushwood fire whence came the smoke over it suspended on two forks was a huge iron pot containing what seemed to be a particularly ****** stew it was tended by an old colored woman who with a staff in her hand limped around the seething cauldron stopping to stir the stew with a big wooden paddle and murmur her charm good morning auntie said the how are you this beautiful general day good ****** ter you marse jawge **** you suh im ******** praise de lawd she said leaning on her stick and looking up into the generals face with an expression of deep interest you know my name you know then who i am auntie said the general what have you in your big pot mammy that smells so good then you are aunt ******* yes everybody has heard of aunt ******* and the wonderful ******* of her rabbit ******* she ***** into it the most delicious ******* and the power to ********* forever from all those who are so fortunate as to partake of it all the ills and aches that flesh is heir to we shall be delighted auntie to taste your stew thank you very much nobody ever yet refused a paddle of aunt ******** rabbit stew one and all of us tasted this magic stew and straightway felt ****** from at least one of the important ills of life and perhaps if our faith had been as strong as the ******* we should never have been deluded by ************* or suffered the aches to which we have since fallen victims i see auntie that they are holding service in your church this morning is uncle tim preaching uncle tim is a brave man to have the courage of his convictions and we should all like very much to hear this celebrated sermon if you think we would not disturb the congregation when we entered the church the discourse was about half finished the preacher stopped speaking and the congregation arose to show respect to us there were several white people in the audience drawn thither by the fame of uncle **** eloquence the sable divine apparently did not share the antipathy of the cloth in general to ********** for he amiably asked if he should begin again at the opening of the sermon being unwilling to take ***** take of his *********** to the possible fatigue of both preacher and such of the congregation as according to aunt ******** suggestion might be ***** up we signified the desire that the discourse should proceed from the point which it had reached thereupon the good brother went on to the conclusion of his sermon saying at the close brer tim clark as he was commonly called by all classes and conditions of people in the district in which he lived was born in henrico county virginia and was noted for his skill in ***** as well as for the originality of his sermons he was so far as i have been able to learn the first one on record to select and preach from this strange brief text us the name tim of our brer tim was not the usual ************ of the old greek name timothy as brer tim himself indignantly asserted on one occasion when the ******** of deeds of henrico county found it necessary to record his full name brer **** last two names were an inheritance from col george rogers clark the ******** of the west who not only saved virginias back settlements from indian fury but planted her standard far beyond the ohio colonel clark extended virginias western establishments and erected fortifications among which was fort jefferson on the mississippi at great risk he captured ********** the obnoxious governor of canada who took every possible method of exciting the indians to hostilities he captured ********* and other smaller towns intercepting a convoy from canada taking sixty prisoners and fifty thousand dollars worth of goods brer tim was as proud of his ancestors and of their deeds as he was of his name artistically ******** on a juniper stick each generation with each event of note pertaining to it till he had traced his ancestry back to the first office boy of the first loan office opened at williamsburg which office was to effect two resolutions of congress for the obtaining of a loan of continental money for the use of the united states another loan office was established by the state for borrowing on the part of the commonwealth one million dollars to supersede the necessity of ******** more paper money having given you the origin of brer **** christian name and a brief sketch of the hero for whom he received his ******* i will ******** give you his sermon with his unique and original translation of the text he selected and written as he delivered it in his own musical dialect it is as follows the superstitions and the fascinating tales of those golden yesterdays silken woven by the tongue of fancy when we knew things because we believed them when our wisdom was our faith and the authenticated tragedies told as history had to our view made awesome shadows around the place they called sandy bottom otherwise it would have been nothing more than a gloomy insignificant little valley in a mixed ************ body of woods with a ************ stream of water running across it where a great army of ********* *********** called for a ******* ******* and where the legend says the **** of this melodious jargon woven in the clang and pang of such a **** of woe was further impressed by the words of uncle remus for the ears wreathed low like a laurel wreath on the lifted brow of the frog that chants of the why and how to my mind the mysterious knowledge ascribed to the ******** was confirmed by the fact that the bed of that murky little stream placidly crawling across the pathway of sandy bottom over which the frog ****** his never ceasing sentinel croon is the dismal grave of many a trusting heart in its dread deathbed by the side of priests and indians ********** maidens and darkeyed savages sleep the wife and children and servants of an english nobleman the infant child because of its appealing helplessness was saved while the great strong horses and the coach with its freight of human lives gold and jewels were silently swallowed up by the treacherous quicksand the rescue of this little child purchased the freedom of a dark strange race from ********** race of frenigike whose restless spirit so the legend goes has haunted for these hundred years this spot of tragedy witchcraft and ********** de *** ********* ******** ***** dar hides ober dar haids en **** outn dar own skins en ***** dar ********* where the wail of the child the song of the maid the moan of the **** and the croon of the frog all tangle together the tale of their woes with the long limp **** of frenigike the english tragedy was enacted in the year 1789 when sir henry clinton projected the plan of ******** the pride and destroying the resources of virginia he sent a powerful fleet to hampton roads and landed a force under general mathews to advance and perfect this object general mathews took possession of norfolk and ********** and the surrounding country committing extensive depredations on the expedition suffolk was burned ********* in his graphic description says added to the horrors of the burning town the heads of thousands of barrels of tar pitch ********** and rum which had been on lots ********** to the wharves were knocked out and their contents which flowed in a commingled mass catching the blaze descended to the river like torrents of burning lava as the winds blew from the wharves with great violence these ********** with difficulty ******* in water rapidly floated to the opposite shore in a splendid state of conflagration which they communicated to the thick and decaying ******* of an extensive marsh the growth of the preceding year this immense sheet of fire added to the vast columns of undulating flames which ascended from the burning houses in the town the explosion at intervals of the gunpowder in the magazines the consequent projection through the air of large pieces of ******* timber which flew like meteors to an astonishing distance all contributed to form a collective scene of horror and ********* and desolation such as could not be viewed without emotions not to be described the family of an english nobleman were so frightened at the ruthless ************ of their own people that they fled for safety and were trying to make their way to a place on the nansemond river called ******** point opposite which a part of the fleet was lying in waiting passing sandy bottom en route the driver stopped to water his horses and turning their heads to the right was about to urge them further up the stream where the water was deeper and ******* when a runaway negro named isaac sprang from the bank shrieking out a warning of the terrible danger of the quicksand and with all his might struck the horses with the fishing rod he had in his hands when both driver and mistress refused to listen to his warnings or heed his entreaties he dashed up to the carriage and snatched the sleeping baby from its nurses lap saying before the ****** words could find their last echo before even the frightened child could catch sufficient breath for a second shriek carriage horses driver ******* maids children and mistress were all ****** in and swallowed up in the dark water a few bubbles and ripples here and there the only signs of its treachery the helpless horrified horsemen had followed so close that the dash of their horses feet splashed drops simultaneously on the screaming child and over the bubbling water which marked the fatal spot of its mothers doom isaac the negro who as a reward for humanity was given his liberty and a home was i am told the first one of his race ever set free in virginia and was thereafter impressively distinguished by the to them *********** epithet of *************** which name was soon ******** into frenigike and after a time through culture and prosperity ************* into ******** which is the present family name of the descendants of frenigike the old place where ************** lived is still called ************* or ************** and it was in passing there as a child that i saw for the first time one of the descendants of the hero of the tragedy and i recall to this day his peaceful tranquillity and the lessons of resignation and ************** taught by his untutored mind i remember he looked like an ********* walking quarter *********** as he moved slowly down the middle of the road keeping time and step to the song which he sung i was going to suffolk with my father who was always courteous and gallant always solicitous of and interested in his people and always thoughtful and considerate of every one reined up his horse as we came in sight and taking out a ********* and a piece of tobacco and handing both to me said you can give this to the old man my baby the old man stopped and then turned and looked around for the first time as my father drew up to his right and called out good morning good morning uncle frenigike good morning is that you old man how are you impatient in my childish haste to be polite that i might present my little gift and receive uncle ********** thanks i ****** in before my father could make his reply and said how do you do uncle frenigike here is something for you the old negro looked at me for a minute and then laughing heartily said you are very welcome old man and im glad to see you so well and happy we could hear you singing away down the road as we drove along some readers may not understand the old mans mention of ole bringer ole bringer was the **** **** of which the old colored people stood in great awe his bark being supposed to bring misfortune or to ******* death or some calamity to the one who was so unfortunate as to hear it you are very plucky old man i have always known that but you seem to be carrying quite a ******* in pain too as you say it is too bad im very sorry old man to hear this very sorry you were singing so merrily and seemed to be so cheerful and so happy that i had no idea you were in any trouble it is well to be philosophical if we can old man and i am glad you look
